***As a Result of The President’s Investments In America, a Record 10.5
Million New Small Businesses Applications Filed in 2021 and 2022***

During the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) second annual Women’s
Business Summit, President Biden will announce new resources to support
women small business owners, and he will reaffirm the Biden-Harris
Administration’s continued commitment to supporting all of America’s
small businesses. The President will announce that SBA will expand the
Women Business Centers network, bringing the total to 160 centers across
the country that assist women entrepreneurs through training, mentoring,
business development, and financing opportunities.

Small businesses are the engines of our economy. That’s why from his
first day in office, the President has taken action to assist our
nation’s small businesses as they recover from the economic impact of
the pandemic and continue to grow. As a result of these actions, a
record 10.5 million applications to start new businesses have been filed
in the last two years– each one representing the hope and
entrepreneurial spirit of America’s small business owners, and the faith
and confidence they have in America’s future.

During Women’s History Month, we celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit of
women and women-owned and operated businesses:

-   Women own 12 million businesses in America, [employing more than 10
    million
    workers](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/03/women-business-ownership-in-america-on-rise.html).
-   They continue to trailblaze across industries every day,
    starting [nearly half of all new
    businesses](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/women-entrepreneurs-gusto-gender/) in
    the United States in 2021.
-   Last year, annual earnings for women owned businesses [increased by
    almost
    30%,](https://www.biz2credit.com/research-reports/annual-women-owned-business-study-2023) with
    women-owned businesses in the manufacturing sector experiencing a
    35% increase.

The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken significant steps to
support women-owned businesses. This includes:

**Providing Resources and Mentorship to Women Small Business
Owners: **Many small businesses, especially those from underrepresented
communities, lack the access to technical expertise, accountants, and
lawyers employed by better resourced businesses. This Administration is
focused on meeting small businesses owners, including women small
business owners, where they are by offering extensive support services
to navigate available programs. That’s why this Administration has: 

-   Invested millions to establish the largest network of Women Business
    Centers (WBC) in history. These centers are specifically designed to
    assist women, providing training, mentoring, business development,
    and financing opportunities, recognizing that women still face
    unique obstacles in the business world. This Administration has
    invested nearly $70 million in the Women Business Centers network,
    expanding it for the first time into all 50 states, the District of
    Columbia, and Puerto Rico. This includes tripling the number of WBCs
    at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU),
    Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI), and other minority-serving
    institutions (MSI). President Biden will announce that the SBA will
    expand the WBC network with an additional 15 locations, bringing the
    total to 160 centers across the country.
-   Awarded $100 million in grants through [the Community Navigators
    Pilot
    Program](https://www.sba.gov/partners/counselors/community-navigator-pilot-program) to
    organizations in all 50 states and Puerto Rico to bolster the
    ability of organizations that already have deep connections in their
    communities to provide resources and guidance to traditionally hard
    to reach small businesses. The program focuses on socially and
    economically disadvantaged small businesses, rural communities, and
    small businesses owned by women and veterans. The President’s Fiscal
    Year 2024 budget proposes an additional $30 million to support this
    critical initiative.
-   Made the [Minority Business Development Agency
    permanent](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/27/fact-sheet-the-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-advances-equity-and-opportunity-for-black-americans-and-communities-across-the-country/),
    creating the only Federal agency dedicated to connecting
    minority-owned businesses to private lenders, exporters, and public-
    and private-sector buyers.

**Expanding Access and Avenues to Capital. **Capital is vital for small
businesses to start and grow. That’s why expanding access to capital,
and making sure there are ample pathways to reach that capital, is a
core pillar of the Administration’s agenda to support small businesses.
This Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   Invested $10 billion through the American Rescue Plan’s [State Small
    Business Credit
    Initiative](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/small-business-programs/state-small-business-credit-initiative-ssbci) (SSBCI)
    to help States, territories, and Tribal governments leverage
    billions more in matching public and private dollars to support
    small businesses across the United States, with a particular focus
    on business owners from socially and economically disadvantaged
    backgrounds. SSBCI provides funding for credit and venture capital
    programs. This is a vital tool to address the capital access gap for
    women-owned businesses, who receive less than 2 percent of all
    traditional venture capital dollars.
-   Delivered over $10 billion in capital to women-owned small
    businesses through SBA’s 7(a) and 504 loan programs in 2021
    and 2022. The 7(a) loan program provides funding to small businesses
    seeking short- and long-term working capital to purchase equipment,
    supplies, and addresses other critical business growth needs. The
    504 loan program provides long-term, affordable fix-rate financing
    for major assets that promote job creation and business growth.

**Leveraging Federal Spending to Support Small Businesses: **The federal
government spends more than $600 billion every year in goods and
services, and this Administration is committed to ensure that federal
spending supports entrepreneurship and wealth creation.  This
Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   Set a goal of increasing the share of federal contracting dollars
    awarded to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) by 50% [by
    2025](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-reforms-to-increase-equity-and-level-the-playing-field-for-underserved-small-business-owners/).
    This will result in an estimated additional $100 billion in federal
    contracting dollars to underserved small businesses over a 5-year
    period, many of which are owned by women. In 2021, the
    Administration awarded [27.2 percent or $154.2
    billion](https://www.sba.gov/article/2022/jul/26/biden-harris-administration-awards-record-breaking-1542-billion-contracting-small-businesses) in
    federal contract dollars to small businesses, an $8 billion increase
    from the previous fiscal year. Women-owned Small Businesses (WOSB)
    received more than $[26 billion for the
    third](https://www.sba.gov/article/2022/jul/26/biden-harris-administration-awards-record-breaking-1542-billion-contracting-small-businesses) straight
    year.
-   Focused on ensuring that funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act continue to
    create meaningful wealth-building opportunities for women-owned
    businesses,
    creating [billions](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-equity-and-economic-opportunity-through-federal-procurement-and-state-and-local-infrastructure-contracting/) of
    dollars in contracting opportunities for America’s small businesses.

In addition, the President’s American Rescue Plan made critical
investments which saved hundreds of thousands of small businesses from
shutting their doors during the pandemic, including by:

-   Providing [assistance](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-funds-provided-a-critical-lifeline-to-200000-child-care-providers-helping-millions-of-families-to-work/) to
    220,000 child care providers – which are nearly all small
    businesses, and are over 90% women-owned and women staffed. Ninety
    percent of child care providers that received
    support [report ](https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/user-98/naeyc_ece_field_survey_february2022.pdf)that
    these funds helped them stay open and operating. One in three child
    care programs who received
    support [report](https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/user-73607/november_2022_naeyc_policy_fieldsurvey_final.pdf) that
    they would have been forced to close permanently without these
    funds.
-   Revamping the [Paycheck Protection
    Program](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/10/a-proclamation-on-small-business-week-2021/) to
    ensure that businesses with less than 20 employees – in particular
    sole proprietor businesses that are disproportionately owned by
    women – had priority access to relief.
-   Providing critical breathing room to more than [100,000
    restaurants](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/10/a-proclamation-on-small-business-week-2021/),
    food trucks, street food vendors, breweries, and other food service
    businesses through our Restaurant Revitalization Fund. Over 40,000
    grants totaling over $10 billion went to women-owned businesses via
    the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.
-   Supporting more than 13,000 hard-hit live entertainment small
    businesses, nonprofits, and venues with $14.5 billion in grants
    through the Shuttered Venues Operator Grant program.

Following the President’s remarks, SBA Administrator Isabella Guzman
will moderate a panel discussion between Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx,
Payal Kadakia, former CEO and founder of ClassPass, Melissa Butler, CEO
and Founder of The Lip Bar, and Natalie King, founder and CEO of Dunamis
Charge, an electric vehicle charger manufacturer. The [Women’s Business
Summit](https://www.sba.gov/event/12167) will continue through
Wednesday, March 29, and feature panels and discussions with
Administration officials, non-profit and for-profit organizations, and
women entrepreneurs leading businesses across various industries,
including childcare, technology, services, manufacturing, and more.
