The United States and Canada held their first Indo-Pacific Dialogue on
Friday, March 10. Led by Dr. Kurt Campbell, Deputy Assistant to the
President and Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs, and Jody Thomas,
National Security and Intelligence Adviser to the Prime Minister,
participants discussed key trends shaping the region and identified new
areas of economic, security, development, and technology cooperation,
and exchanged views on the challenges and opportunities facing the
regional architecture. Participants also shared our intent to expand
engagement in Southeast Asia and redouble our support for ASEAN
centrality, bolster Pacific regionalism through support for the Pacific
Islands Forum (PIF) and coordination through Partners in the Blue
Pacific (PBP), and to promote security and prosperity in South
Asia. Participants reaffirmed our shared commitment to a free and open
region and committed to implement our respective Indo-Pacific Strategies
in close coordination and to meet again soon.
