title: "The American Rescue Plan (ARP): Top 15 Highlights from 2 Years of\_Recovery"
---
 
**1. Led to the Strongest Jobs Recovery on Record: When President Biden
came into office, there was tremendous economic
uncertainty. ***Unemployment was at 6.1% when ARP passed. It was
expected to average 5% in 2022. With the passage of ARP, unemployment
averaged 3.6% in 2022 and fell to 3.4% at the beginning of 2023.*

-   ***ARP Drove the Strongest 2-year job growth ever: ****Over 12
    million jobs have been added since President Biden took office – the
    largest 2-year total in US history and more jobs in two years than
    in any previous administration’s full year term.*
-   ***Powered the Fastest Recovery in the World: ****After the American
    Rescue Plan passed, the US recovered *[*significantly
    faster*](https://www.oecd.org/sdd/na/GDP-Growth-Q422.pdf)* than our
    G7 Peers – with 5.9% growth in 2021 – while our inflation is in the
    middle of the pack and slower than other countries that did
    significantly less to help their economies recover.*  

**2. Powered the Most Equitable Recovery in Memory:* ****In past
recessions, persistent high long-term and youth unemployment as well as
high foreclosures of evictions led to long term harms – “scarring” for
millions of Americans and hard, long roads back for Black and Hispanic
Americans.*

*President Biden’s Rescue Plan ensured that didn’t happen this time:*

-   ***Historic drops in Black and Hispanic Unemployment: ****With the
    strong recovery powered by ARP, Black unemployment saw its largest
    1-year drop since 1984 and is near record lows; Hispanic
    unemployment saw its fastest 1-year drop and reached its lowest
    annual rate <u>ever</u> in 2022. Asian American unemployment fell
    significantly as well – falling by more than half from its January
    2021 rate. *
-   ***Least scarring in any recovery in memory: ****The American Rescue
    Plan led to the fastest drop in long-term and youth unemployment
    ever, which both now stand at pre-pandemic levels. It kept
    foreclosures historically low and evictions 20% below historic
    averages even after the end of the CDC Eviction Moratorium.*

**3.** **Lowered Health Care Premiums by $800 for over 13 Million
Americans**: *ARP lowered health care premiums – which were extended by
the Inflation Reduction Act, increased eligibility to middle- income
families and provided strong incentives for states to expand Medicaid
through the Affordable Care Act. <u>Result:</u>*

-   ***Saved over 13 million Americans an average of $800 a year**** on
    their health premiums.*
-   ***Led to most Americans in history having health insurance***
-   ***Provided health coverage to 3 million Americans ****who would
    have otherwise had no health insurance.*
-   ***Provided an extra $1.5 billion in Medicaid funding to Missouri,
    Oklahoma, and South Dakota ****for Medicaid expansion coverage to
    over half a million people.*
-   ***Gave states an easier pathway to extend Medicaid postpartum
    coverage for a full 12 months**** – ensuring access to critical care
    for over 438,000 women nationwide.*

**4. Largest Small Business Formation Boom in History Due ARP-Driven
Strong Recovery and Small Business Investments:* The Biden
Administration:***

-   ***Increased COVID Emergency Injury Disaster Loans to $2
    million****, while increasing anti-fraud controls*
-   ***Reformed PPP ****to more equitably distribute funds to the
    smallest businesses**.***
-   ***Restaurant Revitalization Fund ****helped over 100,000
    Restaurants, Bars, and Food Trucks stay open.*
-   ***Shuttered Venues Program provided relief to 13,000 venues.***
-   ***Invested a historic $10 Billion in the State Small Business
    Credit Initiative***

*This, and the strong recovery that ARP powered, led to:*

-   ***A record 10.5 million new small business applications ****over
    the past 2 years*
-   ***Hispanic entrepreneurs started small businesses at the highest
    rate in more than a decade**** in 2021 and 23 percent faster than
    pre-pandemic levels. *
-   ***Black-owned small businesses were created at the fastest rate in
    26 years****, as the *[*Washington Post
    found.*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/02/black-business-pandemic-entrepreneurs/)
-   ***Asian American entrepreneurs started small businesses at the
    fastest rate in over a decade in 2021.***

**5. Led to Lowest Child Poverty Rate in American History:* ****The
American Rescue Plan and its expanded monthly Child Tax Credit <u>led
to:</u>*

-   ***Child Poverty nearly cut in half to lowest rate – 5.2% – ever.***
-   ***Black child poverty cut by 52%, Hispanic child poverty cut by
    43%, Native American child poverty cut by 51%, and dramatic drops in
    white and Asian child poverty ****— all to record lows.*
-   ***~9 million children in rural areas ****benefited from the
    expanded credit.*
-   ***5 million children in Veteran and Active-Duty
    families**** benefited from the expanded credit*
-   ***Child Tax Credit payments were delivered reliably**** with the
    first ever monthly payment – on the 15<sup>th</sup> of each month
    with 90% using direct deposit.*
-   ***Over 65 million children in 40 million working
    families ****received largest Child Tax Credit in history.*
-   ***Historic Child Tax Credit Expansion already reached over 230,000
    Puerto Rico families: ****Recent data shows that over 230,000 Puerto
    Rico households will get the expanded Child Tax Credit. 8X the
    number from the previous year.*

**6. Funded a Historic Vaccination Campaign:** *ARP provided $160
billion to support vaccination, therapeutics, testing and mitigation,
PPE, and the broader COVID Response effort.*

*This led to:*

-   ***Over 230 million Americans are fully vaccinated, up from 3.5
    million when President Biden took office.***

**7. Helped Over 8 Million People Stay in Their Homes:**

-   ***Emergency Rental Assistance – the first national eviction
    prevention policy in history – was main American Rescue Plan source
    of multi-month assistance to help over 8 million hard-pressed
    renters**** stay in their homes without sacrificing other basic
    needs.  *
-   ***Emergency Rental Assistance and Other ARP Housing Policies led
    Eviction Filings to remarkably stay 20% below historic averages in
    1.5 years after end of the eviction moratorium****.*

<!-- -->

-   ***Called the “the most important eviction prevention policy in
    American history” by Matthew Desmond****, Pulitzer Prize Winner
    author of “Evicted” – and the “deepest investment the federal
    government has made in low-income renters since the nation launched
    its public housing system.”*
-   ***HUD Emergency Housing Vouchers have already helped 47,500
    households at risk of homelessness lease their own rental
    housing ****– these American Rescue Plan funded vouchers support
    those at risk of or experiencing homelessness or housing
    instability, and those fleeing domestic violence.*

**8. Helped Keep 200,000 Child Care Centers Open**

-   ***American Rescue Plan Stabilization Assistance has reached 200,000
    Child Care Providers**** – that employ 1 million child care workers
    – and have the capacity to serve more than 9 million children.*
-   ***90% of programs reported that American Rescue Plan funds helped
    them stay open.***
-   ***More than 8 in 10 licensed child care centers nationwide ****have
    received ARP assistance**.***
-   ***Benefited 30,000 rural child care programs – ****in most states,
    97+% of rural counties received aid.*

**9. For First Time in History, Direct Relief to Every Town, City,
County and State – No Matter How Big or Small, Urban or Rural So they
Could Design their Own Recovery:**

-   ***Before ARP, 70% of
    cities ***[***anticipated***](https://www.surveyofmayors.com/files/2020/12/Final_2020-Menino-Survey_COVID-Report.pdf)*** layoffs
    or major cuts in services and half of states were freezing or
    cutting jobs. ****Today, cities and states have funds to invest in
    major challenges – like public safety, housing, workforce, and
    rehiring, instead of making dramatic cuts.*
-   ***ARP provided direct fiscal relief to every state, territory,
    ***tribal government******, ***and 30,000 cities and towns
    –**** while previous plans reached only 154 local governments, or
    fewer, with direct flexible relief.*

*This has led to:*

-   ***American Rescue Plan Led to Surge in State Revenue Growth –
    Powering Economic Resilience: ****Before ARP, state revenues were
    expected to grow just 3.7% in 2021, after falling in 2020. After
    ARP, state revenues grew by 16.6% in 2021 (record high growth) – and
    over 14% growth in 2022. As a result, state surpluses are powering
    resilience economy-wide.*
-   ***Major investments in critical areas:***
    -   ***Over $25 billion to Jumpstart Universal Broadband
        Access**** – including Broadband Connections for **<u>16 million
        students</u>** through the Emergency Connectivity Fund for
        schools and libraries to close the homework gap.*
    -   ***Over $10 billion from ARP’s State & Local Fund invested in
        over 3,000 workforce projects***
    -   ***Over $20 billion in State & Local funds invested in water
        infrastructure***
    -   ***Over $14 billion in State & Local Funds invested in
        housing**** – expanding supply, investing in homeless services,
        and providing 3.7 million additional households rent, mortgage,
        and utility relief.*
    -   *With **over $32 billion to help Tribal Nations and Native
        Communities recover** from the pandemic, the American Rescue
        Plan provided the largest single federal investment in Indian
        Country in history.*

**10.** **One of the Largest Federal Investments in Preventing Crime,
Reducing Violence, and Investing in Public Safety in History.**

-   ***Over** $10 billion committed to preventing crime and reducing
    violence,**** with investments by hundreds of state and local
    governments to avoid cuts to police budgets, hire more police
    officers for safe, effective, and accountable community policing,
    ensure first responders have the equipment they need to do their
    jobs, and expand evidence-based community violence intervention and
    prevention programs.*
    -   *Toledo, Ohio used this funding to train a second cohort of new
        police recruits for the first time and plans for 100 new
        officers in the next few years; Mercer County invested in a
        county-wide radio system and improved its 911 system; Baltimore
        invested $50 million for its comprehensive violence prevention
        strategy, including community violence intervention programs.*
-   ***That includes $1.2 billion Medicaid Mobile Crisis Intervention
    Services**** – the American Rescue Plan included $1.2 billion to
    fund mobile crisis intervention units staffed with mental health
    professionals & trained peers. *
-   ***It also includes $1 billion Family Violence Prevention and
    Services Program**** to reduce domestic violence with immediate
    crisis intervention, health supports, and safety.*

**11. Funding School Districts Across the Nation to Reopen K-12 Schools,
Support Academic Recovery, and Invest in Student Mental Health:**

-   ***ARP provided critical relief to 16,000 school districts and other
    local education agencies to reopen safely, support academic
    recovery, and invest in student mental health.***
-   ***Data from School District Plans show that schools are using these
    funds well:***
    -   *Nearly 60% of funds are committed to investments like staffing,
        tutoring, after-school and summer learning, new textbooks and
        learning materials, and mental and physical health supports.*
    -   *Another 23% is going to keep schools operating safely,
        including providing PPE and updating school facilities. This
        includes investments in lead abatement and nearly $10 billion
        for HVAC.*

*This has led to:*

-   ***Going from 46% of schools that had safely opened to full-time
    in-person teaching to 100%: ****In January 2021, CDC data showed
    that just 46% of schools were open full-time in-person. Today, all
    schools are open.*
