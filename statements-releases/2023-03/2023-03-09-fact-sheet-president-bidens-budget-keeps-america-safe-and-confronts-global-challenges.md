title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Budget Keeps America Safe and Confronts\
  \ Global\_Challenges"
---
 
As the President delivers results for the American people at home, he
has also taken action to restore American leadership on the world
stage—leading with America’s values, working in lockstep with America’s
allies and partners, investing in the Nation’s military edge, and
addressing the most significant challenges and opportunities before us.
In the early years of what will be a decisive decade, America is better
positioned than any Nation on earth to expand and preserve democratic
values and prosperity in the 21st Century.  

Under the President’s leadership, America has rallied the world to
support the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty against
Russia’s brutal invasion. The Administration has reinvigorated crucial
partnerships, fostered democracy and economic prosperity, advanced
global health, furthered gender equality around the world, invested in
our immigration system, and strengthened America’s military. The Budget
builds on this progress through proposals to continue outcompeting
China, confronting threats to global security and strengthening our
military, and addressing pressing global challenges. 

*Outcompetes China Globally*

-   **Invests in New Ways to Out-Compete China.** The People’s Republic
    of China (PRC) is the United States’ only competitor with both the
    intent to reshape the international order and increasingly, the
    economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. In
    response to these unprecedented and extraordinary challenges, the
    Budget requests resources to out-compete China and advance American
    prosperity globally. The Budget supports a new $6 billion mandatory
    proposal to strengthen the U.S. role in the Indo-Pacific and to
    advance the U.S. economy, which will allow the U.S. to focus on the
    following new and critical investments to: make transformative,
    high-quality, and sustainable infrastructure investments while
    countering predatory PRC financingbyoffering countries a positive
    alternative, which will simultaneously expand markets and
    opportunities for U.S. businesses; create a new U.S. International
    Development Finance Corporation’s equity revolving fund to support
    highly developmental investments to empower early and growth-stage
    companies from low and lower-middle income countries that would
    otherwise not be able to take on debt; and make game-changing
    investments in the Indo-Pacific to strengthen economies and support
    our partners in pushing back against exploitative PRC efforts.

-   **Renews the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) with the Freely
    Associated States (FAS)** **of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and
    Palau.** Strong ties between the United States and the Pacific
    Islands, individually and collectively, form the foundation of our
    engagement in the Pacific. To maintain our status as a committed
    partner of choice in the Pacific, we must enhance our enduring
    relationships, especially with FAS, with whom we have a special and
    historical bond. The FY 2024 Budget requests a total of $7.1 billion
    in mandatory funds over 20 years to support the COFA.

<!-- -->

-   **Deepens Alliances and Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.** The
    Budget builds on our discretionary investments to include over $2.3
    billion for the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for
    International Development (USAID) in support of the Indo-Pacific and
    our partners in the region.As we focus our efforts to “invest,
    align, and compete” with China, an expanded investment in the region
    is essential to demonstrate to partner nations around the globe that
    our commitment to support them is unwavering. The Administration
    plans dedicated, flexible Foreign Military Financing funding, with a
    priority on assistance to the Indo-Pacific and greater use of
    lending authority where tomorrow’s rising deterrence needs require
    large investments financed today.

<!-- -->

-   **Promotes Integrated Deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and Globally.**
    The Budget prioritizes China as America’s pacing challenge in line
    with the 2022 National Defense Strategy. The Department of Defense’s
    (DOD) 2024 Pacific Deterrence Initiative highlights $9.1 billion of
    targeted investments the Department is making to U.S. force posture,
    infrastructure, presence, and readiness as well as efforts to
    bolster the capacity and capabilities of U.S. allies and partners in
    the Indo-Pacific region, primarily west of the International Date
    Line. The Budget continues to increase DOD’s security cooperation
    funding planned for the Indo-Pacific region, focused on building
    capacity across a range of areas, to include domain awareness,
    logistics, cybersecurity, and command and control. The Budget also
    supports investments to accelerate critical weapons and munitions
    production lines; develop capabilities like long-range strike,
    undersea, hypersonic, and autonomous systems; and increase
    resiliency of our space architectures—all of which support the
    Department’s efforts to align investments with policies and
    activities that will sustain and strengthen deterrence.

*Confronts Threats to Global Security*

-   **Supports Ukraine, European Allies, and Partners.** The Budget
    continues support for Ukraine, the United States’ strong alliance
    with the states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
    and other European partner states by prioritizing funding to enhance
    the capabilities and readiness of U.S. forces, NATO allies, and
    regional partners in the face of continued Russian aggression.

-   **Counters Persistent Threats.** While focused on maintaining robust
    deterrence against China and Russia, the Budget also enables DOD to
    counter other persistent threats including those posed by North
    Korea, Iran, and violent extremist organizations.

-   **Modernizes the Nuclear Deterrent.** The Budget provides $37.7
    billion for DOD to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent as a
    foundational aspect of integrated deterrence for the security of the
    Nation and U.S. allies. The Budget supports the U.S. nuclear triad,
    NATO strategic deterrence, and the necessary ongoing nuclear
    modernization programs, to include the nuclear command, control, and
    communication networks. The Budget also provides $23.8 billion to
    the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration
    to make historic investments in the Nation’s nuclear security
    enterprise to implement the President’s Nuclear Posture Review
    (NPR); support a safe, secure, and effective nuclear stockpile;
    reduce nuclear risks; and provide nuclear power to the U.S. Navy.

<!-- -->

-   **Advances U.S. Cybersecurity.** The Budget continues to invest in
    cybersecurity programs recognizing that cybersecurity is essential
    to the basic functioning of our economy, the operation of our
    critical infrastructure, the strength of our democracy and
    democratic institutions, the privacy of our data and communications,
    and our national security. The recently signed National
    Cybersecurity Strategy details a comprehensive approach to better
    secure cyberspace and ensure the United States is in the strongest
    possible position to seize all the benefits and potential of our
    digital future. The Budget requests more than $395 million to
    advance global cyber and digital development initiatives, including
    the Department of State’s Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy,
    USAID’s Digital Strategy, Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
    Investment (PGII) digital connectivity efforts, and regional
    initiatives such as Digital Transformation with Africa.

    Budget provides more than $3.4 billion to advance democratic
    governance and foster democratic renewal globally. The Budget would
    strengthen free and independent media, fight corruption, bolster
    democratic institutions, advance technology for democracy, promote
    gender equality and women’s civic and political participation, and
    defend free and fair elections and political processes. Within this
    total, the Budget includes $345 million for the Presidential
    Initiative for Democratic Renewal, as well as $25 million for the
    President’s new African Democratic and Political Transitions (ADAPT)
    initiative, as well as targeted increases for “bright spot”
    countries experiencing democratic opportunities.

*Addresses Pressing Global Challenges*

-   **Reinforces Collective Action to Address Global Challenges.** The
    Budget fully meets U.S. annual contributions to international
    organizations and pays current UN peacekeeping dues on time and in
    full. The Budget also proposes increases for key opportunities to
    advance U.S. interests and compete with adversaries, including by
    strengthening collective security through NATO and bolstering U.S.
    leadership at the UN by beginning to pay down past arrears,
    synchronizing $40 million in annual contributions, providing $150
    million to support a U.S. return to the UN Educational, Scientific
    and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and contributing $57 million to
    support the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). The Budget also requests
    nearly $2.3 billion for contributions to multilateral development
    banks, maintaining the United States’ role as the largest World Bank
    donor to support poverty reduction and development in low- and
    middle-income countries. This includes a $1.4 billion investment in
    the International Development Association (IDA), as part of the
    United States’ pledge of $3.5 billion in support of the most recent
    IDA replenishment.

-   **Advances the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment
    (PGII).** The Budget supports more than $50 billion to support PGII,
    a values-driven, high-impact, and transparent infrastructure
    partnership to meet the enormous infrastructure needs of low- and
    middle-income countries and support the United States’ and our
    allies’ economic and national security interests. PGII leverages
    public and private finance to advance climate and energy security,
    health and health security, digital connectivity, gender equity and
    equality, and related transportation infrastructure—all while
    creating opportunities for American businesses globally.

<!-- -->

-   **Increases Global Energy Security, Infrastructure, and
    Resilience.** The Budget supports the President’s pledges to more
    than quadruple international climate finance and to provide more
    than $3 billion for the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation
    and Resilience (PREPARE). This includes a $1.6 billion contribution
    to the Green Climate Fund and a $1.2 billion loan to the Clean
    Technology Fund. The Budget also advances new tools, such as loan
    guarantees, to re-assert U.S. leadership in the Indo-Pacific to
    finance energy security and infrastructure projects and reduce
    reliance on volatile energy supplies and prices.

<!-- -->

-   **Bolsters American Leadership in Global Health.** The Budget
    includes $10.9 billion through State and USAID to reinforce U.S.
    leadership in addressing global health and health security
    challenges, including $1.25 billion to prepare for, prevent, detect,
    and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, of which $500 million
    supports the Pandemic Fund to catalyze and accelerate improvements
    to global health security and pandemic preparedness. The Budget also
    invests dedicated funds for the Administration’s Global Health
    Worker Initiative to enhance global efforts to better train, equip,
    and protect the health workforce—which would strengthen countries’
    ability to provide core health services and respond to crises. The
    Budget increases investments in high-impact and lifesaving voluntary
    family planning and reproductive health programs to address
    significant unmet global need for these services. The Budget
    sustains U.S. leadership in the Global Fund’s historic seventh
    replenishment, providing $2 billion for the second year of a $6
    billion, three-year pledge to save lives and accelerate the fight
    against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.

<!-- -->

-   **Advances Gender Equality Around the World.** The Budget provides
    more than $3 billion to advance gender equity and equality globally,
    consistent with the Administration’s steadfast commitment to invest
    in opportunities for women and girls, including the LGBTQI+
    community. The Budget includes funding to respond to and prevent
    gender-based violence, advance women’s economic empowerment, and
    strengthen the participation of women in conflict prevention,
    resolution, and recovery.

<!-- -->

-   **Bolsters Hemispheric Economic Investment and Migration Management
    Efforts.** In support of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration
    and Protection, the Budget invests $430 million for hemispheric
    migration management. This assistance would bolster stability for
    affected communities, enhance legal pathways and protection in the
    hemisphere, and strengthen humane border management throughout the

    economic opportunity fund, the Americas Partnership Opportunity
    Fund, to support partner countries in the region. The Budget also
    requests up to $40 million for the Global Concessional Financing
    Facility to support programs aimed at improving the lives of
    migrants and refugees in the Western Hemisphere. The Budget includes
    $75 million for the Inter-American Development Bank’s IDB Invest to
    increase private sector investment in the Americas.

-   **Creates Opportunities in Central America and Haiti.** The Budget
    requests more than $1 billion to advance the President’s commitment
    to work with Congress to provide $4 billion over four years to
    address the root causes of migration and improve the lives of people
    in Central America. Assistance would bolster localization efforts,
    enhance the rule of law, and support economic growth for all
    segments of society. Further, in response to deteriorating
    conditions and widespread violence in Haiti, the Budget invests $291
    million to strengthen Haiti’s recovery from political, health, and
    economic shocks, such as strengthening the capacity of the Haitian
    National Police, combating corruption, strengthening the capacity of
    civil society, responding to health emergencies and health needs,

    disasters. The Budget supports the United States’ revitalized
    refugee admissions program, including the resettlement of up to
    125,000 refugees and related efforts, such as Uniting for Ukraine.
    In addition, the Budget supports the President’s pledge to alleviate
    global food insecurity by providing nearly $1.2 billion in bilateral
    agriculture and food security programming.

<!-- -->

-   **Protects Afghan Allies.** The Budget supports Enduring Welcome
    (EW), the whole-of-government effort to continue to welcome our
    Afghan allies who stood with us during the twenty-year war in
    Afghanistan. Through Enduring Welcome, the U.S. government is
    expeditiously processing expeditiously process the applications of
    our Afghan allies, such as Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV)
    candidates, and family reunification cases, and assisting them as
    they come to the United States—while simultaneously safeguarding
    national security. The Budget fully supports implementation of EW by
    leveraging Department of State balances estimated to enable more
