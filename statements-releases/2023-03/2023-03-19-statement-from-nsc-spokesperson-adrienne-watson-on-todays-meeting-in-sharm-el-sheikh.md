title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Today\u2019s Meeting in\
  \ Sharm El\_Sheikh"

We welcome the meeting and understandings reached today in Sharm El
Sheikh between senior political and security officials of Israel and the
Palestinian Authority. This was the second such meeting in this format,
with participation by senior officials from the United States, Egypt,
and Jordan, following the gathering in Aqaba three weeks ago.
The participants noted that meetings at this level have not taken place
in nearly a decade, and that these meetings are building toward
establishing a series of understandings upon which to deescalate
tensions.  We look forward to continuing these discussions as we enter
the Holy month of Ramadan, Passover, and Easter, and over the months to
follow.
