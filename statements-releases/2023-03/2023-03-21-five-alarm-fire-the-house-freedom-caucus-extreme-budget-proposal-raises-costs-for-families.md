title: "FIVE-ALARM FIRE: The House Freedom Caucus\u2019 Extreme Budget Proposal Raises\
  \ Costs for\_Families"
---
 
The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus has
[made](https://twitter.com/freedomcaucus/status/1634205313623572480)
their priorities clear: imposing devastating cuts to public safety and
increasing costs for working- and middle-class families, all to protect
and extend tax breaks skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. In
fact, their tax cuts would be [so
expensive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-the-congressional-republican-agenda-to-increase-the-debt-by-over-3-trillion/)
that their deep and harmful cuts **would not reduce the deficit**.  
  
That’s in sharp contrast with the President’s Budget, which invests in
America, lowers costs for families, protects and strengthens Medicare
and Social Security, and reduces the deficit by $3 trillion over 10
years, while ensuring no one making less than $400,000 per year pays a
penny more in new taxes.  
  
Combined with other commitments extreme MAGA House Republicans have
already made, **the extreme Freedom Caucus proposal will be a disaster
for families in at least five key ways**: endangering public safety,
raising costs for families, shipping manufacturing jobs overseas and
undermining American workers, weakening national security, and hurting
seniors.  
  
Last week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
[confirmed](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-03/58984-spendings.pdf)
that Congressional Republicans’ budget math doesn’t add up. CBO found
that—in order to meet Congressional Republicans’ [stated
commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-15/republicans-balanced-budget-aim-clashes-with-fiscal-realities#xj4y7vzkg)
to balancing the budget in 10 years without raising taxes on the wealthy
or corporations, and without cutting Social Security, Medicare, defense,
and some veterans’ benefits—Congressional Republicans would need to
*eliminate everything in the rest of the Federal budget*.  
  
**<u>The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposal will be a
five-alarm fire for families—including by raising costs.</u>** Unlike
extreme MAGA Republicans in the House who are focused on repealing the
Inflation Reduction Act—which would raise costs on everything from
health insurance, to prescription drugs, to utility bills—President
Biden is focused on lowering everyday costs and giving working families
more breathing room.  
  
**<u>The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposals
will:</u>**

-   **Make Health Care More Expensive:** Extreme MAGA Republicans in the
    House have signed onto a bill to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.
    That will increase health care premiums by an average of $800 per
    year for nearly 15 million Americans.  
-   **Increase Energy Costs. ** The extreme MAGA House Republicans would
    eliminate a law that will lower utility bills for American families
    by hundreds of dollars per year. Their plans would deny Americans
    critical savings on electric vehicles, energy-efficient windows,
    solar panels, and more.  
-   **Make College More Expensive.** The extreme MAGA Republican House
    Freedom Caucus proposal would not only eliminate Pell Grants
    altogether for 80,000 students, it would also reduce the maximum
    award by nearly $1,000 for the remaining 6.6 million students who
    receive Pell Grants—making it harder for them to attend and afford
    college.  
-   **Eliminate Preschool and Child Care Slots.** The extreme MAGA
    Republican House Freedom Caucus proposal would mean 200,000 children
    lose access to Head Start slots and 100,000 children lose access to
    child care—undermining our children’s education and making it more
    difficult for parents to join the workforce and contribute to our
    economy.  
-   **Strip Medicaid Coverage and Food Assistance from Millions of
    People.** Extreme MAGA Republicans want to impose failed policies
    that take Medicaid coverage away from people who fail to meet
    bureaucratic work reporting requirements. When it was tried, this
    policy led to nearly 1 in 4 losing Medicaid coverage – including
    working people and people with disabilities, caused uninsured rates
    to spike and led people to go without needed care, and failed to
    increase employment. Their proposals also put food assistance at
    risk for millions of older people and parents, and would mean 1.2
    million women, infants, and children would lose vital nutrition
    assistance through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
    Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), significantly increasing child
    poverty and hunger.
