title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Judith\_Heumann"
---
 
Judy Heumann was a trailblazer – a rolling warrior – for disability
rights in America. After her school principal said she couldn’t enter
Kindergarten because she was using a wheelchair, Judy dedicated the rest
of her life to fighting for the inherent dignity of people with
disabilities.  
   
Her courage and fierce advocacy resulted in the Rehabilitation Act,
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the Americans with
Disabilities Act – landmark achievements that increased access to
education, the workplace, housing, and more for people with
disabilities. Judy also served in leadership positions in two
presidential administrations, and she started multiple disability
advocacy organizations that continue to benefit people here and around
the world.  
   
I knew Judy for a long time. When I was Vice President, we hosted a
meeting together at the White House to discuss our continued efforts to
break down barriers for those who face discrimination and neglect. Her
legacy is an inspiration to all Americans, including many talented
public servants with disabilities in my Administration.  
   
Jill and I send our deepest condolences to Judy’s husband, Jorge Pineda,
and their entire family.
