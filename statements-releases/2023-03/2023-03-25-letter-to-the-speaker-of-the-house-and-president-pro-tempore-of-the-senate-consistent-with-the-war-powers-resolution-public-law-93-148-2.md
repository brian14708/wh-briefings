Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
As I have reported previously, militia groups affiliated with Iran’s
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have perpetrated a series of
attacks against United States personnel and facilities in Iraq and
Syria.  On March 23, 2023, a one-way unmanned aerial system attack
tragically killed one American contractor supporting the United States
military, and wounded six others, including five United States service
members.  The March 23 attack followed a number of prior attacks against
United States forces in Syria.  These attacks have placed the lives of
United States and Coalition personnel under ongoing threat.  
  
At my direction, on March 23, 2023, United States forces conducted
targeted strikes against facilities in eastern Syria in response to this
series of attacks and continuing threats of future attacks.  The
precision strikes were directed at facilities used by groups affiliated
with the IRGC for command and control, munitions storage, and other
purposes.  They were conducted in a manner intended to establish
deterrence, limit the risk of escalation, and avoid civilian
casualties.  I directed the March 23 strikes in order to protect and
defend the safety of our personnel, to degrade and disrupt the ongoing
series of attacks against the United States and our partners, and to
deter the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iran‑backed militia groups from
conducting or supporting further attacks on United States personnel and
facilities.   
  
I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to
protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in
furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief
and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations.  The
United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent
with international law, and in the exercise of the United States’
inherent right of self‑defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action,
as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.  
  
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  Additional information is provided in a classified annex.  I
appreciate the support of the Congress in this action. 

                             Sincerely,   
  
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
