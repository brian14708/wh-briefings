  \ Use of Commercial Spyware that Poses Risks to National\_Security"

*Presidential Directive Will Serve as a Cornerstone Initiative During
the Second Summit for Democracy*

Today, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/27/executive-order-on-prohibition-on-use-by-the-united-states-government-of-commercial-spyware-that-poses-risks-to-national-security/)
that prohibits, for the first time, operational use by the United States
Government of commercial spyware that poses risks to national security
or has been misused by foreign actors to enable human rights abuses
around the world.  
  
Commercial spyware – sophisticated and invasive cyber surveillance tools
sold by vendors to access electronic devices remotely, extract their
content, and manipulate their components, all without the knowledge or
consent of the devices’ users – has proliferated in recent years with
few controls and high risk of abuse.  
  
The proliferation of commercial spyware poses distinct and growing
counterintelligence and security risks to the United States, including
to the safety and security of U.S. Government personnel and their
families. U.S. Government personnel overseas have been targeted by
commercial spyware, and untrustworthy commercial vendors and tools can
present significant risks to the security and integrity of U.S.
Government information and information systems.

A growing number of foreign governments around the world, moreover, have
deployed this technology to facilitate repression and enable human
rights abuses, including to intimidate political opponents and curb
dissent, limit freedom of expression, and monitor and target activists
and journalists. Misuse of these powerful surveillance tools has not
been limited to authoritarian regimes. Democratic governments also have
confronted revelations that actors within their systems have used
commercial spyware to target their citizens without proper legal
authorization, safeguards, and oversight.   
  
In response, the Biden-Harris Administration has mobilized a
government-wide effort to counter the risks posed by commercial spyware.
Today’s Executive Order builds on these initiatives, and complementary
bipartisan congressional action, to establish robust protections against
misuse of such tools.  
  
This Executive Order will serve as a cornerstone U.S. initiative during
the [second Summit for
Democracy](https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy-2023/) on March
29-30, 2023, which President Biden will co-host with the leaders of
Costa Rica, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of
Zambia. In furtherance of President Biden’s [National Security
Strategy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf),
this Executive Order demonstrates the United States’ leadership in, and
commitment to, advancing technology for democracy, including by
countering the misuse of commercial spyware and other surveillance
technology.  This Executive Order will also serve as a foundation to
deepen international cooperation to promote responsible use of
surveillance technology, counter the proliferation and misuse of such
technology, and spur industry reform.

\*\*\*

In particular, the Executive Order signed by President Biden today:

-   **Applies to U.S. federal government departments and agencies**,
    including those engaged in law enforcement, defense, or intelligence
    activities, and encompasses spyware tools furnished by foreign or
    domestic commercial entities.  
-   **Prohibits departments and agencies across the federal government
    from operationally using commercial spyware tools** that pose
    significant counterintelligence or security risks to the U.S.
    Government or significant risks of improper use by a foreign
    government or foreign person, including to target Americans or
    enable human rights abuses.  
-   **Establishes key counterintelligence, security, and improper use
    factors that indicate such risks**, including if:  
    -   a foreign government or foreign person has used or acquired the
        commercial spyware to gain or attempt to gain access to U.S.
        Government electronic devices, or those of U.S. Government
        personnel, without authorization from the U.S. Government;  
    -   the commercial spyware was or is furnished by an entity that (1)
        maintains, transfers, or uses data obtained from the commercial
        spyware without authorization from the licensed end-user or the
        U.S. Government; (2) has disclosed or intends to disclose
        non-public information about the U.S. Government or its
        activities without authorization from the U.S. Government;
        or (3) is under the direct or effective control of a foreign
        government or foreign person engaged in intelligence activities
        directed against the United States;  
    -   a foreign actor uses the commercial spyware against activists,
        dissidents, or other actors to intimidate; to curb dissent or
        political opposition; to otherwise limit freedoms of expression,
        peaceful assembly or association; or to enable other forms of
        human rights abuses or suppression of civil liberties;  
    -   a foreign actor uses the commercial spyware to monitor a United
        States person, without consent, in order to track or target them
        without proper legal authorization, safeguards, and oversight;
        and  
    -   the commercial spyware is furnished to governments for which
        there are credible reports that they engage in systematic acts
        of political repression, including arbitrary arrest or
        detention, torture, extrajudicial or politically motivated
        killing, or other gross violations of human rights. This ensures
        application of the Executive Order in situations when foreign
        actors may not yet have committed specific abuses through the
        use of commercial spyware, but have engaged in other serious
        abuses and violations of human rights.   
-   **Identifies concrete remedial steps that commercial spyware vendors
    can take to reduce identified risks**, such as cancelling relevant
    licensing agreements or contracts that present such risks.  
-   **Directs important new reporting and information-sharing
    requirements within the Executive Branch** to ensure departments and
    agencies can make informed and consistent determinations based on
    up-to-date all-source information, including a semi-annual
    comprehensive intelligence assessment.

The Executive Order, therefore, seeks to ensure that any U.S. Government
use of commercial spyware aligns with the United States’ core national
security and foreign policy interests in upholding and advancing
democratic processes and institutions, and respect for human rights;
does not contribute, directly or indirectly, to the proliferation and
misuse of commercial spyware; and helps protect U.S. Government
personnel and U.S. Government information systems and intelligence and
law enforcement activities against significant counterintelligence or
security risks.

The Executive Order complements concrete actions the Biden-Harris
Administration and Congress have taken to confront the threat posed by
the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware: 

-   Congress enacted new statutory authorities and requirements related
    to commercial spyware in the Intelligence Authorization Acts for
    Fiscal Years 2022 and 2023, including new restrictions and reporting
    requirements for Intelligence Community (IC) employees’ post-service
    employment with foreign governments or companies, to include foreign
    commercial spyware entities. Last week, the Director of National
    Intelligence [issued binding
    guidance](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2023/item/2368-issuance-of-intelligence-community-directive-712-requirements-for-certain-employment-activities-by-former-intelligence-community-employees)
    to the U.S. Intelligence Community to implement these statutory
    requirements, which set an international standard that we hope will
    be followed by other countries.   
-   The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
    has placed foreign entities on the Entity List to address foreign
    policy concerns related to surveillance technologies. In November
    2021, BIS added [four commercial
    entities](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list)
    to the Entity List for engaging in the proliferation and misuse of
    cyber intrusion tools contrary to the national security or foreign
    policy interests of the United States.   
-   The Department of Commerce has implemented technology-based controls
    to address digital surveillance tools. In October 2021, the
    Department [implemented multilateral Wassenaar Arrangement export
    controls](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-10-21/pdf/2021-22774.pdf)
    on certain cybersecurity items that could be used for surveillance,
    espionage or other actions that disrupt, deny, or degrade a network
    or devices on the network. The [final
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/26/2022-11282/information-security-controls-cybersecurity-items)
    has been in effect since May 2022.  
-   In January 2022, the Department of State and the Office of the
    Director of National Intelligence’s National Counterintelligence and
    Security Center [issued an
    advisory](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/SafeguardingOurFuture/FINAL_Jan-7-2022_Protect_Yourself_Commercial_Surveillance_Tools.pdf)
    for the broader public on how to protect oneself from commercial
    surveillance tools.  
-   At the direction of Congress, the Department of State, in
    consultation with the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence, has submitted to appropriate oversight committees a
    classified report on contractors that have knowingly assisted or
    facilitated certain cyberattacks or conducted surveillance
    activities on behalf of relevant foreign governments against the
    United States or for the purposes of suppressing dissent or
    intimidating critics.    
-   In June 2021, Secretary Blinken announced that the Department of
    State, on behalf of the Biden-Harris Administration, will update the
    United States’ National Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct.
    This builds on prior U.S. government guidance, including the U.S.
    Department of State guidance on implementing business and human
    rights principles for “[Transactions Linked to Foreign Government
    End-Users for Products or Services with Surveillance
    Capabilities](https://www.state.gov/key-topics-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/due-diligence-guidance/).”  
-   In parallel, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to undertake
    a concerted effort to assess the extent to which commercial spyware
    has been directed against U.S. Government personnel serving overseas
    and mitigate the counterintelligence and security risks posed by
    these tools.

Taken together, these efforts aim to reduce the improper use of new
technological tools to facilitate repression and human rights abuses,
mitigate the counterintelligence threats these tools can pose to the
U.S. Government, ensure that U.S. companies and former U.S. Government
personnel are not facilitating authoritarian or repressive practices
abroad, and provide tools to Americans and civil society to better
protect themselves.
