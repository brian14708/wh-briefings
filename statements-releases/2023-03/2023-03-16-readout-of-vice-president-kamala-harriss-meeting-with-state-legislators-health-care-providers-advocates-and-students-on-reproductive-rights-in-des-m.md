title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with State Legislators,\
  \ Health Care Providers, Advocates, and Students on Reproductive Rights in Des Moines,\_\
  IA"
---
 
Today, in Des Moines, Iowa, Vice President Kamala Harris convened state
legislators, health care providers, advocates, students, and other
leaders to discuss the fight to protect reproductive rights. The Vice
President’s event follows attacks on reproductive rights at the national
and state level, which are endangering women’s lives and have
repercussions beyond reproductive health care.  
   
The Vice President thanked the participants for their leadership
fighting on the frontlines for reproductive health care. The Vice
President emphasized that politicians should not interfere
with a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions
with her doctors. The Vice President highlighted how states have
proposed and passed extreme abortion restrictions following the Supreme
Court overruling *Roe v. Wade*. The Vice President outlined how abortion
bans are an attack on the right to basic health care, and an affront to
freedom and liberty. She also discussed extremists’ efforts to achieve a
nationwide ban of medication abortion, which was approved by the FDA as
safe and effective more than 20 years ago.  
   
State legislators, advocates, providers, and students shared how they
are attempting to defend reproductive health care and abortion access in
Iowa, and how a majority of Iowans support reproductive
rights. The participants shared stories of how women’s lives are put at
risk when they cannot get reproductive health care. They also expressed
concerns about how other rights, such as contraception and LGBTQI+
rights, are at stake following the *Dobbs* decision. The
Vice President and local leaders pledged to continue fighting to protect
access to reproductive healthcare in Iowa and nationwide.  
   
The Vice President has brought together leaders from across the nation
who are on the frontlines fighting to protect reproductive health care
and abortion access. From the time the decision to overturn *Roe v.
Wade* leaked in May, the Vice President has hosted approximately 40
different official convenings across the country focused on reproductive
rights. She has met with people from 38 states, including health care
providers, constitutional law and privacy experts, faith leaders,
disability rights leaders, civil rights leaders, higher education
leaders, students, advocates, state attorneys general, and other state
leaders.
