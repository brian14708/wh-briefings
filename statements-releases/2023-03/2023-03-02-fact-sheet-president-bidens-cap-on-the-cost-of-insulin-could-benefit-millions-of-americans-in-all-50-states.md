title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Cap on the Cost of Insulin Could Benefit\
  \ Millions of Americans in All 50\_States"
---
 
As part of President Biden’s historic Inflation Reduction Act,
nearly [four
million](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/b60f396f32e29a2a9469276d9ca80e4b/aspe-insulin-affordibility-rtc.pdf) seniors
on Medicare with diabetes started to see their insulin costs capped at
$35 per month this past January, saving some seniors hundreds of dollars
for a month’s supply. But in his State of the Union, President Biden
made clear that this life-saving benefit should apply to everyone, not
just Medicare beneficiaries.  
This week, Eli Lilly, the largest manufacturer of insulin in the United
States is lowering their prices and meeting that call.

Eli Lilly announced they are lowering the cost of insulin by 70% and
capping what patients pay out-of-pocket for insulin at $35. This action,
driven by the momentum from the Inflation Reduction Act, could benefit
millions of Americans with diabetes in all fifty states and U.S.
territories.  The President continues to call on Congress to finish the
job and cap costs at $35 for all Americans.

The below data breaks down how many adults are living with diabetes in
each state, highlighting the cumulative number of adults that could
experience lower insulin costs from the Inflation Reduction Act’s
insulin cost cap for seniors, and industry’s follow-on actions. And,
data shows that these cost-saving measures will disproportionately
impact communities of color, as Black, Hispanic, and American  
Indian/Alaska Native adults have higher rates of diabetes in the United
States than white Americans.

Additional information on how many seniors in each state are already
benefiting from the President’s historic actions is
