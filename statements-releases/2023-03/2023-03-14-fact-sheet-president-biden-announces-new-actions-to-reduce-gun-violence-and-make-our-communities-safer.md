title: "FACT SHEET:\_President\_Biden Announces New Actions to Reduce Gun Violence\
  \ and Make Our Communities\_Safer"
---
 
Today, in Monterey Park, California, President Biden will announce an
Executive Order with the goal of increasing the number of background
checks conducted before firearm sales, moving the U.S. as close to
universal background checks as possible without additional legislation.
The Executive Order will also keep more guns out of dangerous hands by
increasing the effective use of “red flag” laws, strengthen efforts to
hold the gun industry accountable, and accelerate law enforcement
efforts to identify and apprehend the shooters menacing our communities.
President Biden is also encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to
issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to
minors.  
  
President Biden is traveling to Monterey Park to grieve with the
families and community impacted by the mass shooting that claimed 11
lives and injured nine others in January. Monterey Park is part of a
growing list of communities all across the country that are forever
changed due to gun violence—not only mass shootings, but also daily acts
of gun violence that may not make national headlines.  
  
Last year, President Biden signed into the law the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation
enacted in nearly 30 years. When celebrating the Act’s passage, he
called on Congress to seize the bipartisan momentum and advance
additional commonsense steps to reduce gun violence. Again and again, he
has called for Congress to act, including by banning assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales,
requiring safe storage of firearms, closing the dating violence
restraining order loophole, and repealing gun manufacturers’ immunity
from liability.  
  
As he continues to call on Congress to act, President Biden will do
everything he can to reduce gun violence and save lives. That is why,
over the past two years, President Biden has taken [more executive
action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-administrations-21-executive-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence/)
to reduce gun violence than any other president at this point in their
presidency.  
  
The President’s new Executive Order to reduce gun violence includes the
following additional actions, all of which fall within existing
executive authority and outside of the right protected by the Second
Amendment:  
  
**<u>Keeping guns out of dangerous hands</u>**  
  
The Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:

-   **Increase the number of background checks by ensuring that all
    background checks required by law are conducted before firearm
    purchases, moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks
    as possible without additional legislation.** A large majority of
    Americans support background checks and agree it’s common sense to
    check whether someone is a felon or domestic abuser before allowing
    them to buy a gun. The President will continue to call on Congress
    to pass universal background check legislation. In the meantime, he
    is directing the Attorney General to do everything he can to ensure
    that firearms sellers who do not realize they are required to run
    background checks under existing law, or who are willfully violating
    existing law, become compliant with background check requirements.
    Specifically, the President is directing the Attorney General to
    move the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible
    without additional legislation by clarifying, as appropriate, the
    statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of dealing
    in firearms, as updated by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.
    This move would mean fewer guns will be sold without background
    checks, and therefore fewer guns will end up in the hands of felons
    and domestic abusers. The President is also directing the Attorney
    General to develop and implement a plan to prevent former federally
    licensed firearms dealers, whose licenses have been revoked or
    surrendered, from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in
    firearms.
-   **Improve public awareness and increase appropriate use of extreme
    risk protection (“red flag”) orders and safe storage of firearms.**
    19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted red flag laws,
    allowing trusted community members to petition a court to determine
    whether an individual is dangerous, and then to temporarily remove
    an individual’s access to firearms. However, these laws are only
    effective if the public knows when and how to use red flag orders.
    President Biden is directing members of his Cabinet to encourage
    effective use of extreme risk protection orders, including by
    partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators,
    and other community leaders. In addition, President Biden is
    directing members of his Cabinet to expand existing federal
    campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms.
-   **Address the loss or theft of firearms during shipping.** Bureau of
    Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) data indicates an
    over 250% increase in the number of firearms reported as lost or
    stolen during shipment between federally licensed firearms dealers,
    from roughly 1,700 in 2018 to more than 6,100 in 2022. President
    Biden is directing the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation
    with the Department of Justice, to work to reduce the loss or theft
    of firearms during shipment and to improve reporting of such losses
    or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers.

**<u>Holding the gun industry accountable</u>**  
  
The Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:

-   **Provide the public and policymakers with more information
    regarding federally licensed firearms dealers who are violating the
    law.** Gun dealers violating federal law put us all at risk by
    increasing the likelihood that firearms will fall into dangerous
    hands. The President is directing the Attorney General to publicly
    release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, ATF records from
    the inspection of firearms dealers cited for violation of federal
    firearm laws. This information will empower the public and
    policymakers to better understand the problem, and then improve our
    laws to hold rogue gun dealers accountable.
-   **Use the Department of Defense’s acquisition of firearms to further
    firearm and public safety practices.** The Department of Defense
    buys a large number of firearms and other weapons to protect and
    serve our country. The President is directing the Secretary of
    Defense to develop and implement principles to further firearm and
    public safety practices through Department of Defense acquisition of
    firearms, consistent with applicable law.

President Biden is also **encouraging the independent Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) to issue a public report analyzing how gun
manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers
market firearms to all civilians, including through the use of military
imagery.**  
  
**<u>Additional steps to make our communities safer and support
communities impacted by gun violence</u>**  
  
The Executive Order will direct the President’s Cabinet to:

-   **Help catch shooters by accelerating federal law enforcement’s
    reporting of ballistics data.** The National Integrated Ballistics
    Information Network (NIBIN) allows federal, state, and local law
    enforcement to match fired cartridge casings to the guns from which
    they were fired, making it easier for law enforcement to connect
    multiple crime scenes and catch shooters. In order to maximize
    NIBIN’s effectiveness, federal, state, and local law enforcement all
    have an important role to play in ensuring timely submission of
    ballistics data to NIBIN. Today, the President is directing all
    federal law enforcement agencies to issue rigorous requirements
    regarding NIBIN data submission and use of this tool.
-   **Accelerate and intensify implementation of the Bipartisan Safer
    Communities Act (BSCA).** BSCA is the most significant gun safety
    legislative accomplishment in nearly 30 years, and the Biden-Harris
    Administration is treating it as such by making the most of every
    opportunity it provides to reduce gun violence. President Biden is
    directing each agency responsible for the law’s implementation to
    send a report to him, within 60 days, on progress toward full
    implementation of BSCA and additional steps they will take to
    maximize the benefits of the law, including by increasing public
    awareness and use of the resources made available by BSCA.
-   **Improve federal support for gun violence survivors, victims and
    survivors’ families, first responders to gun violence, and
    communities affected by gun violence.** When a hurricane overwhelms
    a community, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
    coordinates federal, state, local, and non-profit organizations in
    order to assess and meet community needs. However, when a mass
    shooting overwhelms a community, no coordinated U.S. government
    mechanism exists to meet short- and long-term needs, such as mental
    health care for grief and trauma, financial assistance (for example,
    when a family loses the sole breadwinner or when a small business is
    shut down due to a lengthy shooting investigation), and food (for
    example, when the Buffalo shooting closed down the only grocery
    store in the neighborhood). The President is directing members of
    his Cabinet to develop a proposal for how the federal government can
    better support communities after a mass shooting, and identify what
    additional resources or authorities the executive branch would need
    from Congress to implement this proposal.
-   **Advance congressional efforts to prevent the proliferation of
    firearms undetectable by metal detectors.** In recent years, we’ve
    seen the rise of technology that allows guns to be made with
    polymers and other materials that are increasingly capable of
    avoiding detection by metal detectors. President Biden is directing
    the Attorney General to help Congress modernize and make permanent
    the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988, which is currently set to
    expire in December 2023.
