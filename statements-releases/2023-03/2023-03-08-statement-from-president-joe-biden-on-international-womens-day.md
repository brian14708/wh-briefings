International Women’s Day honors a truth we live every day—that women
and girls are essential to success and progress in every aspect of our
society. Promoting opportunities for women and girls strengthens
security, stability, and prosperity for everyone. And we know that we
cannot solve any of the great global challenges of our time if half the
population is left behind. So today, as we celebrate the
accomplishments and contributions of women and girls around the
world, we also reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that all people can
reach their full potential.   
   
Despite decades of progress, in far too many places around the world,
the rights of women and girls are still under attack, holding back
entire communities. We see it in Afghanistan, where the Taliban bars
women and girls from attending school and pursuing employment. We see it
in Iran, where the regime is brutally repressing the voices of women who
are courageously standing up for their freedom. And in the face
of Russia’s vicious and unjust invasion of Ukraine, including the use of
rape as a weapon of war, we see countless stories of women bravely
fighting for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of
all Ukrainians.  
  
The United States stands with women and girls around the world in the
critical work of protecting and advancing human rights.
My Administration is working with dedicated partners and local
communities in every part of the world to expand economic security for
women and girls, defend access to health care—including reproductive
health care—safeguard women’s political participation and human rights,
and promote the full participation of women and girls in all facets of
society. Through initiatives like the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment, we are supporting the infrastructure of
the care economy in low- and middle-income countries. We have also
redoubled our commitment to eliminating gender-based violence wherever
it occurs, promoting accountability for conflict-related sexual
violence, and expanding protection services for women and girls in
humanitarian emergences.  
   
Here in the United States, we have made landmark investments to give
families more breathing room and support women’s participation in
the labor force. This includes signing into law important workplace
protections for pregnant and nursing workers in the United States. And
last year, I was particularly proud to sign legislation
strengthening and reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA),
and increasing VAWA funding to $700 million, the highest funding level
in history. This critical legislation will advance access to services,
justice, and healing for survivors.  
   
As we continue working to implement our first-ever National Strategy on
Gender Equity and Equality, we are focused on lifting up the rights of
women and girls through every aspect of both our foreign and domestic
policy. This is a defining feature of who we are as a nation and the
values we hold dear as Americans. So let us continue to strive toward a
future where women have an equal seat at the table, an equal voice
in shaping decisions, and an equal opportunity to contribute fully to
their nations.
