The United States and Lithuania reconvened high-level bilateral
consultations in Washington today to discuss opportunities for
cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. The United States reaffirmed
strong support for Lithuania as a valued NATO Ally and partner in
addressing many shared global challenges and opportunities, including in
the Indo-Pacific. Participants discussed their countries’ shared
commitment to democratic values, human rights, and support for the
international rules-based order. Participants also addressed trade and
investment in the region and the importance of supply chain resiliency.
The United States looked forward to Lithuania’s development of an
Indo-Pacific strategy and to continuing the effective and constructive
dialogue  with Lithuania on the Indo-Pacific. 

The dialogue was led by Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis of
Lithuania and on the U.S. side by National Security Council Coordinator
for the Indo-Pacific Kurt Campbell. It included representatives from the
Lithuanian government as well as the National Security Council, and the
Department of State.
