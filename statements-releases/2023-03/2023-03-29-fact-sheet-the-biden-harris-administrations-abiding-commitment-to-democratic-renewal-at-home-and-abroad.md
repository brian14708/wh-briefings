title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Abiding Commitment\
  \ to Democratic Renewal at Home and\_Abroad"
---
 
President Biden has called the struggle to bolster democratic governance
at home and abroad [the defining challenge of our
time](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/12/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-summit-for-democracy-opening-session/).
That is because democracy—transparent and accountable government of,
for, and by the people—remains the best way to realize lasting peace,
prosperity, and human dignity.  
  
Internationally, the United States continues to strengthen democratic
resilience and respect for human rights through both new and existing
initiatives.  In Fiscal Years 2022, 2023, and 2024, the United States
has invested and aims to provide approximately **$9.5 billion**, working
with Congress and subject to the availability of appropriations, to
support democracy, human rights, and good governance globally.  
  
At the first Summit for Democracy held in December 2021, President Biden
[launched](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/09/fact-sheet-announcing-the-presidential-initiative-for-democratic-renewal/)
the *Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal*, an expansion of
U.S. Government efforts to defend and grow democratic resilience with
likeminded partners through diplomacy and foreign assistance. These
efforts center on five areas of work crucial to the functioning of
transparent, accountable governance:  advancing technology for
democracy, supporting free and independent media, fighting corruption,
bolstering human rights and democratic reformers, and defending free and
fair elections.  
  
Today, **the United States is announcingup to $690 million in new
funding for the *Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal***
through Fiscal Year 2024, working with Congress and subject to the
availability of appropriations. As part of the *Presidential
Initiative*, the U.S. Government is also announcing a **groundbreaking
new suite of policy initiatives intended to advance technology that
works for, and not against, democratic societies**.     
  
At home, the Biden-Harris Administration has produced historic progress
for the American people, **proving that democracy delivers** a stronger,
fairer society that leaves no one behind. Under President Biden’s
leadership, the economy has added more than 12 million jobs. The
unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent.. The Biden-Harris
Administration has taken action to give families more breathing room,
including cutting prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums,
and energy bills, while driving the uninsured rate to historic lows. It
has invested in rebuilding America’s infrastructure, delivering safe
roads, clean water, and high-speed Internet to communities across the
country. And it is taking the most aggressive action ever to tackle the
climate crisis, investing in American innovation and industries that
will define the future, and fueling a manufacturing boom that is
creating good jobs for workers in parts of the country that have long
been left behind.  At the same time, the Biden-Harris Administration has
continued to restore and strengthen the United States’ democratic
institutions, including by protecting the right to vote and the civil
rights of all Americans.  
  
**<u>Advancing Technology for Democracy at Home and Abroad</u>**

-   The U.S. Government is committed to advancing a positive vision for
    the Internet and the digital ecosystem; countering the misuse of
    technology and stemming the tide of digital authoritarianism; and
    shaping emerging technologies to ensure respect for human rights and
    democratic principles.  At the Summit, the Administration will
    announce an ambitious slate of new efforts to ensure that technology
    strengthens democracy.

**<u>Promoting Democratic Renewal Abroad</u>**

-   **Supporting Free and Independent Media**. To help mitigate the
    existential threat to the survival of independent media, USAID via
    its **Media Viability Accelerator** is partnering with Microsoft and
    Internews to create a new, web-based data platform that will enable
    media outlets to better understand the markets, audiences, and
    strategies that will maximize their odds of profitability.
    Additionally, USAID will provide up to $16 million for the
    **Promoting Information Integrity and Resilience Initiative
    (ProInfo)**, which will strengthen information integrity globally by
    advancing international cooperation and private-public-civic
    partnerships. 
-   **Fighting Corruption**. In complement to the ongoing work at the
    U.S. Department of the Treasury to unmask shell companies by
    requiring them to report information about their beneficial owners,
    today the U.S. government and over two dozen foreign partners
    announced the **Summit for Democracy Commitment on Beneficial
    Ownership and Misuse of Legal Persons**. The Beneficial Ownership
    Commitment pledges endorsees to enhancing beneficial ownership
    transparency so as to make it more difficult for corrupt actors to
    conceal their identities, assets, and criminal activities through
    the misuse of opaque corporate structures and legal persons.
-   **Bolstering Human Rights and Democratic Reformers.**
    -   Through the **Partnerships for Democratic Development** and
        **the Democracy Delivers Initiative**, USAID is **surging
        support to countries experiencing democratic breakthroughs** by
        helping reformist leaders show that democracy is delivering
        concrete benefits to their people.  Since the first Summit for
        Democracy, the **Development Finance Corporation has committed
        more than $1 billion** to help consolidate democratic progress
        in eight countries on which USAID is focusing the latter effort.
    -   USAID is **creating a first-ever Bureau for Democracy, Human
        Rights, and Governance** to expand and modernize its support for
        democracy around the world, implement much of the *Presidential
        Initiative*, and further infuse democracy, human rights, and
        good governance considerations across the Agency’s foreign
        policy and development work.
    -   In coordination with the Department of State, the Department of
        Defense is piloting a program to **reduce gaps for women’s
        participation in partner nation defense and security forces** by
        better incorporating this imperative into security cooperation
        with its partners.  
-   **Defending Free and Fair Elections.**  Following a commitment made
    at the first Summit for Democracy, USAID has convened the world’s
    leading election assistance organizations in the **Global Network
    for Securing Election Integrity**, to align on standards and
    practices for supporting clean elections.  It is also issuing a
    **Guide to USAID Electoral Assistance for the 21st Century** to
    highlight the tenets of transparent, politically neutral,
    technically rigorous electoral assistance, in contrast to the covert
    and partisan electoral interference of malign foreign actors.   

**<u>Advancing Democratic Renewal at Home</u>**

-   **Protecting the Right to Vote in Free, Fair, and Secure
    Elections.**
    -   President Biden has repeatedly and forcefully called on Congress
        to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the
        Freedom to Vote Act to eliminate discrimination in voting and
        ensure access to the ballot box for all eligible voters. Until
        that critical legislation is secured, the Biden-Harris
        Administration will use every tool at its disposal to protect
        the right to vote. The Department of Justice has **doubled the
        number of staff dedicated to enforcing voting rights laws**, and
        the President’s FY 2024 Budget provides an **increase of $62
        million to further strengthen the Department’s Civil Rights
        Division**. The Budget also includes **$5 billion to help state
        and local jurisdictions strengthen our election infrastructure**
        by supporting sustained investment in election equipment,
        systems, and personnel. Agencies continue to implement the
        President’s [Executive
        Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/) directing
        an all-of-government effort to promote **access to voting**.
    -   In January 2023, President Biden signed into law the **Electoral
        Count Reform Act**, which establishes clear guidelines for our
        system of certifying and counting electoral votes for President
        and Vice President. This Act aims to preserve the will of the
        people and to protect against attempts to overturn our
        elections, like the attempt that led to the January 6
        insurrection.
    -   The Federal Election Commission took a major step to increase
        transparency in digital campaigning by finalizing a **rule
        expanding the political advertising disclaimer requirements**.
        These requirements previously applied mainly to traditional
        print and broadcast; this rule explicitly addresses ads placed
        for a fee on another person’s website, digital device,
        application, or advertising platform. Effective March 1, digital
        political ads must now disclose the entity paying for them.
-   **Advancing Equity and Racial Justice and Protecting the Rights of
    All Americans.**
    -   Through the implementation of landmark legislation and historic
        executive action, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to
        make real the promise of America for everyone—including rural
        communities, communities of color, Tribal communities, LGBTQI+
        individuals, people with disabilities, women and girls, and
        communities impacted by persistent poverty. To strengthen the
        federal government’s equity mandate, in February, President
        Biden signed a second **Executive Order further** [**advancing
        racial equity and support for underserved communities through
        the federal
        government**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/).
        This Executive Order launches a new annual, government-wide
        process to address the barriers underserved communities face in
        benefitting from Federal policies, programs, and activities. It
        also requires agencies to improve their community engagement and
        seek more input from communities about the policies that impact
        them. Consistent with this charge, the Office of Information and
        Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) is developing new tools and guidance
        to broaden public engagement in the regulatory process.
    -   In a healthy democracy, the criminal justice system must protect
        the public and ensure fair and impartial justice for all. To
        advance these mutually reinforcing goals, President Biden urges
        Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to
        advance accountability, transparency, and public trust in law
        enforcement. In May 2022, the President issued an [**Executive
        Order**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/05/25/executive-order-on-advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and-public-safety/)
        **on effective and accountable policing and criminal justice
        practices** that, among other things, requires federal law
        enforcement agencies to ban chokeholds; restrict no-knock
        warrants; mandate the use of body-worn cameras; provide
        de-escalation training; submit officer misconduct records into a
        new national database; and restrict the transfer of military
        equipment to local law enforcement agencies. The President’s
        Executive Order also established a new interagency Alternatives
        and Reentry Committee to safely reduce unnecessary criminal
        justice system interactions, improve rehabilitation, and support
        formerly incarcerated individuals’ successful reentry into
        society while addressing existing disparities in our Nation’s
        criminal justice systems.
    -   In September, President Biden held the [**United We Stand
        Summit**](https://unitedwestand.gov/), the first-ever White
        House Summit to address the hate-fueled violence that threatens
        our public safety and democracy. At the Summit, the White House
        announced an historic package of new actions the federal
        government and all sectors of society will take to foster
        national unity and counter hate and toxic polarization. The
        President also
        [established](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/12/statement-from-white-house-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-inter-agency-group-to-counter-antisemitism/)
        an interagency group to increase and better coordinate U.S.
        Government efforts to counter antisemitism, Islamophobia, and
        related forms of bias and discrimination within the United
        States—the group’s first order of business is to develop a
        **national strategy to counter antisemitism**. The President has
        also taken historic action to reduce gun violence, including by
        signing into law **the most significant gun safety legislation**
        in nearly 30 years and taking more executive action to reduce
        gun violence that any other president at this point in the
        presidency.
    -   President Biden has taken **historic actions to advance full
        equality for LGBTQI+ Americans**. The President championed and
        signed into law the **Respect for Marriage Act**, safeguarding
        marriage equality for LGBTQI+ and interracial couples. The
        President has expanded rights and protections for transgender
        Americans. He has also worked to advance opportunity and dignity
        for LGBTQI+ children and families by: taking on the discredited
        practice of so-called “conversion therapy;” strengthening
        resources and protecting for LGBTQI+ children in America’s
        public schools; and improving the federal government’s
        collection of data related to sexual orientation and gender
        identity.
    -   Ensuring all people—regardless of their gender—are able to
        participate fully and equally in civic and political life is a
        foundational tenet of stable democracies. The Biden-Harris
        Administration is implementing the **National Strategy on Gender
        Equity and Equality**, including making progress towards
        ensuring all people can live free from violence by signing into
        law the strengthened and reauthorized **Violence Against Women
        Act** and historic military justice reform. The President has
        also advanced protections and equity in the workplace, including
        through **Executive Orders to advance pay equity for federal
        employees and employees of federal contractors**, and by signing
        into law important **protections for pregnant and nursing
        workers**. The President has issued **two Executive Orders and a
        Presidential Memorandum to protect access to reproductive health
        care services, including abortion**, in the face of the U.S.
        Supreme Court’s decision in *Dobbs*, and to defend a woman’s
        right to make decisions about her own body.
    -   President Biden has prioritized relationships with Tribal
        Nations that are built on respect for Tribal sovereignty and
        self-governance, honoring federal trust and treaty
        responsibilities, protecting Tribal homelands, and conducting
        regular, meaningful, and robust consultation. The President’s
        economic agenda **includes historic levels of funding
        specifically for Tribal communities** and Native people,
        including $32 billion in the American Rescue Plan (ARP), $13
        billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and $700
        million in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
-   **Bolstering Democratic Institutions, Promoting Civic Participation,
    and Improving Public Engagement with Government**.
    -   The Administration is leveraging the power of national service
        and volunteerism to bring together Americans from different
        backgrounds to serve their communities and country in common
        purpose. The President’s FY 2024 Budget includes a **$166
        million increase for AmeriCorps** to raise the living allowance
        it provides its members to make national service more
        accessible.
    -   President Biden believes that all Americans should have the
        opportunity to learn about our democratic process and our
        nation’s rich history—including both our triumphs and the times
        we have failed to live up to our founding ideals. The 2023
        omnibus appropriations package **tripled federal investment in
        civics education**, and President Biden is building on this
        progress by including an **additional $50 million to help
        students understand the U.S. Constitution and how our system of
        Government works** and build the skills—including media and
        digital literacy skills—required to fully participate in civic
        life.
    -   A free and independent press is critical to our democracy. In
        October 2022, Attorney General Garland
        [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-garland-announces-revised-justice-department-news-media-policy)
        significant **revisions to the Justice Department’s regulations
        regarding obtaining information from, or records of, members of
        the news media**. Under the new rules, only in extremely narrow
        circumstances will DOJ use compulsory legal process—like
        subpoenas and search warrants—when investigating media acting
        within the scope of newsgathering. The President’s FY 2024
        Budget committed to working with the Congress to support
        independent local journalism to better inform Americans about
        the matters that impact their lives and hold the powerful
        accountable.
    -   Strong and independent unions are an essential bulwark of
        democracies: They build solidarity across race, gender and other
        lines of difference to advance their members’ shared interests,
        elect leadership from their own ranks to give workers a voice,
        and serve as counter-weights to the economic and political power
        of Wall Street and large corporations. Earlier this month, the
        White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment
        [released](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/17/the-white-house-task-force-on-worker-organizing-and-empowermentupdate-on-implementation-of-approved-actions/)
        an update detailing agencies’ progress towards implementing more
        than **70 action items to support worker organizing and
        collective bargaining**.
    -   In December 2022, the Biden-Harris
        Administration [released ](https://open.usa.gov/national-action-plan/5/)the
        **U.S. Government’s Fifth Open Government National Action Plan
        to advance a more inclusive, responsive, and accountable
        government**. The plan includes commitments to increase the
        public’s access to data to better advance equity, engage the
        public in the regulatory process, make government records more
        accessible to the public, counter corruption, and improve the
        delivery of government services and benefits.
