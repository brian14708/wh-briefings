title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Budget Lowers Energy Costs, Combats the\
  \ Climate Crisis, and Advances Environmental\_Justice"
---
 
In the two years since taking office, the President’s leadership to
tackle the climate crisis has boosted U.S. manufacturing and deployment
of cost-cutting clean energy technologies, put the United States on a
durable path aligned with limiting warming to 1.5 °C, galvanized global
action by partners and the private sector, and advanced environmental
justice. On the first day of the Biden-Harris Administration, the
President rejoined the Paris Agreement—strengthening international
partnerships that are key to addressing the climate crisis on the global
stage. He set an ambitious domestic goal to reduce greenhouse gas
pollution 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels in 2030 and has rallied
countries around the world to make their own bold contributions. 

In signing the Inflation Reduction Act last year, the President also
secured the largest investment to advance energy security and combat
climate change in American history—all while lowering energy costs for
the American people. The Administration is continuing to implement the
Inflation Reduction Act, which is already galvanizing our clean energy
transition and making clean and energy efficient technologies more
affordable for American families. At the same time, the Administration
has launched numerous initiatives to accelerate America’s clean energy
future and advance environmental justice—from jumpstarting an electric
transportation future that is Made in America, to announcing new
climate-smart agriculture and forestry initiatives, to investing in the
places that kept America’s lights on for generations, to implementing
the President’s Justice40 Initiative that ensures 40 percent of the
benefits of Federal investments in climate and clean energy are
delivered to disadvantaged communities. The Budget invests in clean
energy across America, bringing jobs to rural communities and cities,
leaving no one behind.

The Budget builds on this historic progress by advancing clean energy
and investing in climate science, strengthening resilience, advancing
environmental justice, and doubling down on America’s global climate
leadership. The President’s Budget invests a total of $52.2 billion in
discretionary budget authority to tackle the climate crisis, $10.9
billion more than FY 2023 or an increase of nearly 26 percent. The
