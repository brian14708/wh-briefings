title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson Welcoming the Prisoner Exchange\
  \ Agreement Reached for\_Yemen"
---
 
The United States welcomes today’s announcement in Geneva of a major
prisoner exchange agreement by the parties to the Yemen conflict. Under
the deal, 887 detainees related to the war will be released by all
sides. This important step builds on the positive environment created by
a truce in Yemen that has effectively stopped the fighting for the past
11 months. We thank UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg and the
International Committee of the Red Cross for their hard work finalizing
the agreement. Over the past year and thanks to active and persistent
U.S. diplomacy, Yemen has seen the lowest level of violence since the
war began over a decade ago. We remain committed to building on this
work to advance a durable resolution to the conflict.
