title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Sweeping Pandemic Anti-Fraud Proposal:\
  \ Going After Systemic Fraud, Taking on Identity Theft, Helping\_Victims"
---
 
Past underinvestment in basic government technology and the crush of
demand during the pandemic, combined with ill-considered decisions to
take down basic fraud controls at the onset of the pandemic led to a
historic degree of outright fraud and identity theft of emergency
benefits. This systemic fraud particularly impacted the pandemic small
business programs and the new and expanded unemployment benefits that
were originated in the first half of 2020—often with too little regard
for basic program integrity.

While the initial pandemic legislation in 2020—as well as the American
Rescue Plan passed in 2021—were essential to mitigating the health and
economic impact of this unprecedented pandemic, there must be a
bipartisan response to punish those who engaged in major and systemic
fraud against the American people during a time of national emergency,
to put in place stronger fraud and identity theft prevention going
forward, and to hold harmless those Americans who were innocent victims
of identity theft.

President Biden is introducing a three-part historic Pandemic Anti-Fraud
proposal:

-   **Ensuring resources & time for investigations and prosecution of
    those engaged in major or systemic pandemic fraud ($600 Million):**
    It is imperative that those criminal syndicates who preyed on
    Americans during a time of unprecedented health and economic
    emergency know that they may run, but they cannot hide. We must
    prosecute serious offenders and go after those who have the largest
    amount of stolen funds to recapture.  
-   **Investing in fraud prevention and identity theft ($600 Million):**
    It is critical that we learn lessons from what went wrong with
    certain emergency programs that were subject to significant fraud in
    2020 and invest in better prevention of identity theft and all forms
    of major fraud involving public benefit programs. We are committed
    to simpler access for intended beneficiaries and protecting our
    commitment to equity, civil liberties and privacy.  
-   **Helping victims of identity theft ($400 Million):** While we must
    take broad steps to prevent identity theft of public benefits, we
    must recognize the nature of the harms to innocent victims who find
    themselves facing hardship, credit score deterioration, tax
    liability and extreme stress and helplessness through no fault of
    their own.

**<u>Ensuring That Oversight and Enforcement Bodies Have the Resources
and Time to Prosecute Major Pandemic Fraud & Recoup Taxpayer Dollars  
</u>**  
We must empower law enforcement to pursue, investigate, prosecute, and
recover money from those who were engaged in major or sophisticated
fraud—from well-off individuals who took hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, of dollars from taxpayers to sophisticated criminal syndicates
engaging in systemic identity theft. The oversight and law enforcement
communities need both the time to prosecute the most serious and
sophisticated cases and the resources to hire law enforcement and
investigators for multi-year assignments. This is extremely important
with regard to major acts of fraud in the Pandemic Unemployment
Insurance and pandemic small business programs, where the Inspectors
Generals (IGs) have led the investigative work behind major prosecutions
that have recovered or prevented billions of dollars of fraud. Absent
additional resources, the oversight community would be unable to
investigate and prosecute the known caseload before the statute of
limitations expires and to pursue sophisticated cases that will require
more time and resources. This backlog, and the significant funds these
IGs are able to recoup and save, also means that increasing their
funding will result in a more than 10-to-1 return for taxpayers.

***Critical enforcement steps will include $600 million to provide
watchdogs with the resources and the time needed to go after most
serious pandemic fraud.***

-   **Triple the COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force Teams that were created by
    the Department of Justice (DOJ) “Chief Pandemic Fraud Prosecutor”
    that President Biden announced in his State of the Union:**
    Following the President’s policy announcements in his 2022 State of
    the Union address, Department of Justice (DOJ) created three “strike
    forces” for Pandemic Fraud. These “strike forces” have been highly
    effective and must be expanded to recover more stolen taxpayer
    dollars. One case alone, brought with the support of the COVID-19
    Fraud Enforcement Task Force, recently seized and recovered $286
    million in stolen pandemic relief funds, and investigators have
    already identified several equally important cases. President
    Biden’s proposal requests $300 million for DOJ to add at least ten
    “strike forces” to target criminal syndicates and major fraudulent
    actors. These funds would ensure that the Department has the
    necessary resources to prosecute the full range of pandemic fraud,
    bring to justice the most egregious and sophisticated offenders, and
    recover stolen funds for the American people.  
      
    The strike forces will combine investigative, prosecutorial, and
    analytical capacities in tackling COVID fraud throughout the
    country. Each strike force will include a Supervisory Assistant U.S.
    Attorney, a team of Assistant U.S. Attorneys, along with
    investigative support analysts and law enforcement agents—including
    those drawn from the IG community and other federal law enforcement
    partners such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland
    Security Investigations, the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Postal
    Inspection Service, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal
    Investigation. Mechanisms exist for non-DOJ agency reimbursements,
    such as through DOJ’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces.
    This effort will include funds to hire 30-45 additional prosecutors,
    as we create a *Forfeiture Task Force  
    *
-   **Increase statute of limitations to 10 years for serious, systemic
    pandemic fraud including Pandemic Unemployment Insurance programs:**
    Building on our doubling of the extension of the statute of
    limitations for the Paycheck Protection Program and COVID-19
    Economic Injury Disaster Loans, which President Biden signed this
    summer, this proposal calls for ensuring that the Justice Department
    and Department of Labor’s Inspector General have the time and
    multi-year resources to go after criminal syndicates committing
    systemic or multi-state fraud. It will also ensure that systemic
    fraud in any pandemic program will face the same statute of
    limitations.  
-   **Pass bipartisan legislation supported by the Oversight Community
    to increase the cap in the Fraud Civil Remedies Act:** Supported by
    heads of both the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the
    Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC), this legislation
    would raise the administrative claims cap from $150,000 to $1
    million to ensure that all remedies are available to recapture
    large, six figure fraud that might otherwise fall below the
    prioritization threshold for prosecution.  
-   **Ensure that the Department of Labor (DOL) Office of Inspector
    General (OIG) can easily access multi-state data to detect instances
    of multi-state fraud where the same** **identity is inappropriately
    used to apply for benefits in multiple states:** Early in 2021, the
    Biden Administration reversed a Trump Administration policy that
    required the DOL OIG and PRAC to subpoena each state and territory
    individually to get the data needed to detect and investigate
    massive multi-state fraud in the unemployment insurance (UI)
    program. In addition, the Biden Administration made a portion of
    American Rescue Plan grants offered to all 53 state and territories
    for UI modernization conditional on giving the DOL OIG data from the
    beginning of the pandemic to December 2023 to save billions in
    multi-state identity fraud. Future grants will extend this agreement
    through 2025, and the Department of Labor is committed to ensuring
    that the OIG will not experience a gap in accessing multi-state
    data.  
-   **Provide at least $300 million for the Pandemic Inspectors General
    and PRAC investigative staff:** At current Small Business
    Administration (SBA) and DOL IG staff funding levels, it would take
    decades to prosecute the known caseload. This funding would ensure
    they can bring on the resources needed to recover billions of
    dollars in fraudulent payments. The SBA and DOL IGs would *<u>each
    get at least $100 million</u>* for the express purpose of long-term
    hiring of investigators to pursue special cases of organized
    pandemic fraud and to support the interagency strike forces led by
    the DOJ Chief Pandemic Fraud Prosecutor. Additionally, this proposal
    provides funding for PRAC to hire or provide reimbursements for
    investigators to support major prosecutions and ensure that other
    pandemic IGs have the resources they need.

**<u>Investing in Fraud Prevention and Stopping Identity Theft</u>**  
  
The pandemic exposed significant vulnerabilities in our government
benefits systems, especially in regard to preventing systemic identity
theft as a means to steal benefits designed for Americans coping with
the health and economic impacts of the pandemic. It is clear that
reliance on historic knowledge-based verification (e.g., Social Security
number, date of birth), is more and more susceptible to attacks given
the widespread ease of access by criminal syndicates to individuals’
personal information, which can be bought on the dark web for pennies.
Through an upcoming executive order, the President will direct actions
designed to provide guidance to federal agencies on the best ways to
prevent identity theft in public benefits. In addition, the
Administration is proposing significant resources to support stronger
preventative steps to prevent identity theft in public benefits.

***This proposal builds upon the lessons learned during the pandemic and
will ensure robust fraud prevention and identity theft prevention
investments totaling at least $600 million:***

-   **Prevent Future Fraud by expanding the PRAC’s Pandemic Analytics
    Center of Excellence:** The Pandemic Analytics Center of
    Excellence (PACE) is a cutting-edge analytic platform that provides
    analytic, audit, and investigative support to the Inspector General
    community. As evidenced by a recent PRAC Fraud Alert, this is a
    high-return investment. This proposal would establish a permanent
    anti-fraud data and analytics capability analogous to the PACE for
    the Inspector General community to be positioned to oversee future
    disaster relief and emergencies. The PRAC, the American Rescue Plan
    (ARP) Implementation Team and the Office of Management and Budget
    (OMB) pioneered a new model of early action fraud prevention—as
    opposed to chase and pay. This proposal would support further
    cooperative efforts to prevent fraud from taking place in the first
    place.  
-   **Expand Treasury’s Do Not Pay Service and increase checking tax
    transcripts:** During the pandemic, the previous Administration
    allowed 57,000 loans worth $3.6 billion to go out by August 2020,
    when all of them would have been flagged had the Trump
    Administration SBA simply checked them against Do Not Pay (DNP)
    databases. SBA loan applicants have also long allowed the SBA to
    check their IRS tax records to identify potential fraud before
    approving loans, but Congress at one point put in legislation
    language to discourage the checking of tax transcripts for potential
    fraud before giving out large SBA loans. Fortunately, the Biden
    Administration re-started checking DNP databases and authorized tax
    transcripts in 2021. This proposal will both add significant new
    funds to Treasury to increase capacity to identify, prevent, and
    recover improper payments and related fraudulent activity, and call
    on Congress to pass a law making clear that skipping payment
    integrity verifications for loans and grants above $25,000 should
    not happen again—even in an emergency situation.  
-   **Provide at least $300 million to prevent identity theft in public
    benefits:** To further prevent systemic identity theft and organized
    criminal syndicates from exploiting government benefits programs,
    this proposal would include funding to support the modernization of
    agency identity verification systems and support enhancements to
    lessen the impact on victims of identity theft. As recommended by
    the PRAC and outlined in their recent report, this funding would
    facilitate improved data sharing and enhancement of “yes” / “no”
    attribute validation services.  
-   **Invest $150 million to ensure lessons learned are applied going
    forward:** This funding would ensure that effective oversight and
    the best practices and lessons learned from the pandemic are
    institutionalized. This would include funding for under-resourced
    IGs, such as the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture,
    and the Environmental Protection Agency.  
-   **Formalize “Gold Standard” meetings:** “Gold Standard” meetings
    were started by the Biden ARP Implementation Team and OMB, in
    partnership with the PRAC, to institute a more cooperative and early
    prevention model for fraud prevention and program integrity, while
    still respecting the independence of the oversight community. The
    Chair of the PRAC testified that it is a “model for how to manage
    large-scale emergency spending initiatives and balance the need for
    robust independent oversight with timely program implementation.”
    These Gold Standard meetings brought together the White House ARP
    Implementation Team, OMB, agency program staff, the agency IG, and
    the PRAC in one meeting—so everyone could hear all concerns and
    issues at the same time, before major implementation started. These
    meetings were later institutionalized by OMB Guidance and are being
    used for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction
    Act implementation. This process has led to major new anti-fraud
    controls at the front end and should be required for new major
    programs.   
-   **Strengthen the unemployment systems’ program integrity and fraud
    prevention through new legislation and deployment of American Rescue
    Plan funding:  
    **
    -   **New UI program integrity resources for states in FY2024
        Budget:** In the upcoming release of the President’s Budget on
        March 9, 2023**,** the Administration will propose a package of
        legislative reforms to more effectively prevent, detect, and
        recover improper payments. These proposals would require states
        to use the tools already at their disposal to identify fraud and
        gives states access to more funding to reduce and recoup
        fraudulent and other improper payments, including an ability to
        reinvest 5 percent of recovered fraud into fraud prevention,
        detection and recovery. This proposal would also require states
        to check claims against the National Directory of New Hires and
        prisoner datasets.  
    -   **$1.6 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to be available to
        states to modernize, improve access and prevent fraud and
        identity theft by June 2023:** The American Rescue Plan
        committed $2 billion to strengthen UI oversight and help states
        modernize their UI systems to prevent fraud, identity theft and
        payment error, while at the same time promote equitable access
        and ensure the timely payment of benefits to legitimate
        claimants. By June 2023, $1.6 billion of these funds will be
        available to states to help them achieve these goals through
        measures including:  
        -   **$246 million for tiger teams to help states identify risks
            and implement fraud prevention solutions,** such as improved
            identity verification, claims risk scoring, and increasing
            state usage of the multi-state UI Integrity Data Hub.  
        -   **$380 million in anti-fraud grants and identity theft
            prevention,** including $140 million in anti-fraud grants
            already available to states, $200 million in new grants to
            strengthen identity theft prevention, and over $40 million
            in investments to make equitable innovations in identity
            verification available to states through Login.gov and the
            U.S. Postal Service.  
        -   **$600 million to modernize vulnerable state IT systems and
            improve program integrity**, countering decades of
            underinvestment that led to significant fraud and payment
            errors. These new grants will help states modernize IT
            systems, enabling faster responses to fraud, decreases in
            erroneous payments, and more efficient claims processing.  
        -   **$100 million for solutions to help states reduce common
            mistakes and improper payments,** such as simplifying
            difficult-to-complete forms to reduce the number of
            incorrect submissions that lead to payment errors and
            automating repetitive tasks that result in unnecessary staff
            burden and processing mistakes.  
        -   **$249 million in equity enhancements that improve payment
            accuracy,** such as translating web pages, using plain
            language, and building more accessible websites for people
            with disabilities. These enhancements show that equity and
            program integrity can go hand-in-hand by enabling applicants
            to better understand program requirements and providing more
            accurate information, ultimately decreasing improper
            payments.

**<u>Major Investment in Helping Victims of Identity Theft</u>**  
  
Identity theft exacts a devastating toll on its victims. Ever-evolving
and increasingly sophisticated identity theft schemes cause significant
tax and credit harms to the victims of identity fraud as well as equally
serious challenges in resolving those harms. Victims are saddled with
ruined credit scores and private sector debt, are liable for
government-provided loans and overpayment claims, and are unable to
qualify for home mortgages, auto loans, and other lines of credit—and
are often denied access to public benefits.

***President Biden is proposing $400 million in new funding for enhanced
help for victims of identity theft to:***

-   **Pilot an identity theft Early Warning System:** Funds should be
    provided to GSA to evaluate, create government-wide recommendations,
    and pilot with specific agencies an Early Warning System to notify
    individuals and entities when their identity information is being
    verified in order to access a federally- or state-administered
    public benefits program and give individuals and entities the option
    to stop potentially fraudulent transactions before they occur and
    report such transactions to law enforcement entities.  
-   **Provide one-stop remediation experience for victims:** Funds would
    support FTC’s enhancement of IdentityTheft.gov, which will provide
    individuals a one-stop shop experience to both report identity
    crimes and receive personalized identity theft recovery assistance,
    coordinating, as appropriate, with state and local non-profit legal
    services and community-based organizations.  
-   **Offer grants for additional services to victims**: Additional
    funding would be available to state and local non-profits and legal
    services organizations that provide direct services to victims.
    These grants will be administered by DOJ’s Office for Victims of
    Crime and will help scale on-the-ground support for victims and
    existing partnerships.
