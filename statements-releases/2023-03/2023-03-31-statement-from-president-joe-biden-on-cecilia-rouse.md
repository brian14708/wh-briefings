title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Cecilia\_Rouse"
---
 
The U.S. economy has been tested in the past two years, creating
challenges unlike any since the Great Depression.   
   
As Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Cecilia Rouse has been at
the forefront navigating this unprecedented economic moment. No matter
the challenge, Cecilia provided insightful analysis, assessed problems
in a new way, and insisted that we examine the accumulation of evidence
in drawing conclusions. And, she’s maintained steadfast calmness through
it all.  
   
Today’s economy looks very different than when Cecilia joined my
Administration: we’ve created over 12 million jobs, unemployment is near
a 50-year low, American manufacturing is booming, and over 10 million
new small businesses have been created.   
   
Cecilia shares my economic vision, and has always understood that my
north star was not just getting us back to a pre-pandemic economy, but
building one that is more resilient, fair, inclusive, and honors
everyday workers across the country.   
   
I want to thank Nidal and Safa for sharing their mom with us. We will
miss Cecilia greatly, but I know that she will continue this important
work back at Princeton and in the years to come.
