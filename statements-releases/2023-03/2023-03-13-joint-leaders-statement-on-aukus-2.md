title: "Joint Leaders Statement on\_AUKUS"
---
 
In September 2021, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States
announced AUKUS – a new security partnership that will promote a free
and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable.  
   
The first major initiative of AUKUS was our historic trilateral decision
to support Australia acquiring conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered
submarines (SSNs). Today, we announce our pathway to achieve this
critical capability.  
   
Together we will deliver SSN-AUKUS – a trilaterally-developed submarine
based on the United Kingdom’s next-generation design that incorporates
technology from all three nations, including cutting edge U.S. submarine
technologies. Australia and the United Kingdom will operate SSN-AUKUS as
their submarine of the future. Australia and the United Kingdom will
begin work to build SSN-AUKUS in their domestic shipyards within this
decade.   
   
In order to deliver conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines to
Australia at the earliest possible date, we intend to pursue the
following phased approach, moving through each phase based on mutual
commitments from each nation:  
 

-   Beginning in 2023, Australian military and civilian personnel will
    embed with the U.S. Navy, the Royal Navy, and in the United States
    and United Kingdom submarine industrial bases to accelerate the
    training of Australian personnel. The United States plans to
    increase SSN port visits to Australia beginning in 2023, with
    Australian sailors joining U.S. crews for training and development;
    the United Kingdom will increase visits to Australia beginning in
    2026.

<!-- -->

-   As early as 2027, the United States and United Kingdom plan to begin
    forward rotations of SSNs to Australia to accelerate the development
    of the Australian naval personnel, workforce, infrastructure and
    regulatory system necessary to establish a sovereign SSN capability.

<!-- -->

-   Starting in the early 2030s, pending Congressional approval, the
    United States intends to sell Australia three Virginia class
    submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed.
    This step will systematically grow Australia’s sovereign SSN
    capability and support capacity. 

<!-- -->

-   In the late 2030s, the United Kingdom will deliver its first
    SSN-AUKUS to the Royal Navy. Australia will deliver the first
    SSN-AUKUS built in Australia to the Royal Australian Navy in the
    early 2040s.

   
This plan is designed to support Australia’s development of the
infrastructure, technical capabilities, industry and human capital
necessary to produce, maintain, operate, and steward a sovereign fleet
of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines. Australia is fully
committed to responsible stewardship of naval nuclear propulsion
technology.  
   
When we announced the AUKUS partnership in September 2021, we committed
to set the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard. The plan we
announce today delivers on this commitment and reflects our longstanding
leadership in, and respect for, the global nuclear non-proliferation
regime. We continue to consult with the International Atomic Energy
Agency to develop a non-proliferation approach that sets the strongest
precedent for the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine
capability.  
   
Our plan elevates all three nations’ industrial capacity to produce and
sustain interoperable nuclear-powered submarines for decades to come,
expands our individual and collective undersea presence in the
Indo-Pacific, and contributes to global security and stability. In these
outcomes, AUKUS reflects the principle that shared action, taken in
partnership, can benefit all.  
   
Implementing AUKUS will also require robust, novel information sharing
and technology cooperation. Our nations are committed to further
trilateral collaboration that will strengthen our joint capabilities,
enhance our information and technology sharing, and integrate our
industrial bases and supply chains while strengthening the security
regimes of each nation.  
   
For more than a century, our three nations have stood shoulder to
shoulder, along with other allies and partners, to help sustain peace,
stability, and prosperity around the world, including in the
Indo-Pacific. We believe in a world that protects freedom and respects
human rights, the rule of law, the independence of sovereign states, and
the rules-based international order. The steps we are announcing today
will help us to advance these mutually beneficial objectives in the
decades to come.
