We are making progress in the fight against inflation. Today’s report
shows annual inflation down by nearly 30 percent from this summer,
against a backdrop of low unemployment and steady growth. The fight
against inflation isn’t over, and every day my Administration is working
to give families more breathing room. After decades of talk in
Washington, we are taking historic action to lower prescription drug
costs for seniors, capping insulin at $35 and allowing Medicare to
negotiate lower prices. In February we saw the lowest food inflation in
nearly two years.

Just as we are working to bring costs down, we are working to build
America up by investing in strong supply chains and good jobs here in
America. My Investing in America agenda is creating good-paying jobs for
the long term – good jobs in every community whether or not you have a
4-year college degree. These are jobs that we can be proud of as we
rebuild the country with modern infrastructure, supply chains, and
manufacturing here at home.

We should continue to invest in America from the middle out and the
bottom up. This is not the time to turn back to trickle-down economics
by cutting American manufacturing and other critical programs American
families count on, just to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, Big Pharma,
and Big Oil. The last thing our economy needs right now is the reckless
threat of a chaotic default. Those threats must be taken off the table.
