Vice President Harris met with President Samia Suluhu Hassan today in
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  The Vice President thanked President Samia for
her participation in the second Summit for Democracy and applauded her
leadership in opening political space and undertaking critical
democratic reforms.  Vice President Harris applauded President Samia’s
announcement that Tanzania intends to rejoin the Open Government
Partnership and encouraged her to continue efforts to strengthen civil
and political liberties.  The two leaders discussed opportunities to
boost U.S. private sector investment and make it easier for American
investors to do business in Tanzania.  In addition, the Vice President
reaffirmed U.S. support for Tanzania’s infrastructure development.  Vice
President Harris commended President Samia for Tanzania’s handling of
the recent Marburg virus outbreak and pledged continued U.S. support for
the response.  The two leaders also discussed the longstanding
partnership between the United States and Tanzania through the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has enabled
Tanzania to be on the cusp of epidemic control.
