title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Action to Lower Insulin\_Costs"
---
 
Today, Eli Lilly, the largest manufacturer of insulin in the United
States, announced that they are lowering their prices, capping what
patients pay out of pocket for the drug maker’s insulin products at $35.
 For far too long, American families have been crushed by drug costs
many times higher than what people in other countries are charged for
the same prescriptions. Insulin costs less than $10 to make, but
Americans are sometimes forced to pay over $300 for it. It’s flat
wrong.  
   
Last year, I signed a law to cap insulin at $35 for seniors and I called
on pharma companies to bring prices down for everyone on their own.
Today, Eli Lilly did that.  
   
It’s a big deal, and it’s time for other manufacturers to follow.
