The President is glad to see the Department of Justice is appealing the
judge’s decision, which blocks a key provision of the Affordable Care
Act that has ensured free access to preventive health care for 150
million Americans. This case is yet another attack on the Affordable
Care Act – which has been the law of the land for 13 years and survived
three challenges before the Supreme Court.

Preventive care saves lives, saves families money, and protects and
improves our health. Because of the ACA, millions of Americans have
access to free cancer and heart disease screenings. This decision
threatens to jeopardize critical care.

The Administration will continue to fight to improve health care and
make it more affordable for hard-working families, even in the face of
attacks from special interests.
