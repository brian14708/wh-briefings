  \ Commitment to Veterans and Military\_Families"
---
 
One of our country’s most sacred obligations is to care for America’s
veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. Last year, the
President delivered on this commitment by signing the Sergeant First
Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive
Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), the most significant bill in American
history to address veterans’ exposure to burn pits and other toxic
substances. Under the law, more than 5 million veterans will be eligible
for services, including expanded access to healthcare and disability
compensation benefits. Under the President’s leadership, the
Administration has also taken action to address veteran suicide, advance
equity across veterans’ services, and expand access to specialized
cancer screenings and reproductive health care.

The Budget builds on this progress with proposals to honor America’s
commitment to veterans and military families:

-   **Expands Health Care, Benefits, and Services for Military
    Environmental Exposures.** The PACT Act represents the most
    significant expansion of VA healthcare and disability compensation
    benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits and other environmental
    exposures in more than 30 years. As part of the PACT Act, the
    Congress authorized the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund (TEF) to
    fund increased costs above 2021 funding levels for health care and
    benefits delivery for veterans exposed to a number of environmental
    hazards—and ensure there is sufficient funding available to cover
    these costs without shortchanging other elements of veteran medical
    care and benefit delivery. The Budget provides $20.3 billion for the
    TEF in 2024, which is $15.3 billion above the 2023 enacted level.

<!-- -->

-   **Prioritizes VA Medical Care.** The Budget provides a total of $121
    billion in discretionary medical care funding in 2024, $2.3 billion
    above the 2023 enacted level, together with $17.1 billion in the
    TEF. In addition to fully funding inpatient, outpatient, mental
    health, and long-term care services, the Budget supports programs
    that enhance VA healthcare quality and delivery. The Budget
    reiterates that medical care for veterans should be considered
    separately from other appropriations categories in order to ensure
    that the needs of veterans are never traded off against other
    national priorities.

<!-- -->

-   **Prioritizes Veterans’ Mental Health Services and Suicide
    Prevention.** The Budget invests $139 million within VA research
    programs, together with $16.6 billion within the VA Medical Care
    program, to increase access to quality mental healthcare and lower
    the cost of mental health services for veterans, with the goal of
    helping veterans take charge of their treatment and live full,
    meaningful lives. This effort includes support for the Commander
    John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of
    2019, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies on risk and
    prevention factors. In addition, the Budget provides $559 million to
    further advance the Administration’s veteran suicide prevention
    initiatives, including continued expansion of the Veterans Crisis
    Line’s nationwide 988 number for 24/7 support and additional support
    for VA’s National Suicide Prevention Strategy.  
-   **Create a Housing Voucher Guarantee for Extremely Low-Income
    Veterans.** The President believes that no one should be forced to
    live on the street, especially not those who have served our nation.
    But an estimated 450,000 veteran renter households with extremely
    low incomes currently receive no rental assistance and have what HUD
    terms “worst-case housing needs.” Over a ten-year period and at a
    cost of $13 billion, the Budget expands rental assistance to
    extremely low-income (ELI) veteran families, starting with an
    allocation of 50,000 targeted vouchers in 2025 and paving a path to
    guaranteed assistance by 2033 for all who have served the Nation and
    are in need.

<!-- -->

-   **Honors the Memory of All Veterans**. The Budget includes $480
    million to ensure veterans and their families have access to
    exceptional memorial benefits. These funds maintain national shrine
    standards at the 158 VA-managed cemeteries and provide the initial
    operational investment required to continue or begin activation to
    open three new national cemeteries.

<!-- -->

-   **Invests in Critical Veteran Medical Facilities.** The Budget
    includes $1.6 billion in discretionary funding and $1.9 billion in
    mandatory funding for construction and expansion of critical
    infrastructure and facilities, in addition to a $5 billion
    investment in discretionary medical care for non-recurring
    maintenance to improve medical facility infrastructure. In addition,
    the Budget provides $164 million for grants for construction of
    State extended care facilities to deliver high-quality healthcare,
    benefits, and services for veterans.  
-   **Invests in Caregivers Support Programs.** Recognizing the critical
    role family caregivers play in supporting the health and wellness of
    veterans, the Budget provides robust funding for the VA’s Program of
    General Caregivers Support Services. The Budget provides $2.4
    billion for the Caregivers Support Program, including the VA’s
    Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, which
    includes stipend payments and support services to help empower
    family caregivers of eligible veterans.

<!-- -->

-   **Supports America’s Commitment to Military Families**. Military
    families are key to the readiness and well-being of the
    All-Volunteer Force, and therefore are critical to national
    security. The Budget continues to support military families by
    prioritizing programs, including the Secretary of Defense’s Taking
    Care of People initiatives, that directly support military families,
    caregivers, and survivors. Specific programming increases include
    the further expansion of community-based child care fee assistance,
    a public private partnership to increase child care capacity, and a
    reduction in parent fees for child care workers in order to recruit
    and retain staff. The Budget also invests $20 million through the
    Department of Education to ensure military-connected children with
    disabilities and other highly mobile children with disabilities
    maintain services when they change school districts.

<!-- -->

-   **Expands Employment Protections for Military Spouses.** Military
    families make significant sacrifices on behalf of the Nation,
    including overcoming the many challenges that spouses of active-duty
    service and reserve members experience in finding and retaining good
    jobs. A Department of Defense survey found that 33 percent of
    military families had experienced a permanent change in location
    within the last 12 months. Spouses of military servicemembers often
    face discrimination from current and prospective employers due to
    the frequent and unpredictable nature of deployment and relocations.
    The Budget addresses these challenges by expanding
    anti-discrimination and reemployment protections to spouses of all
    active-duty and reserve members, which would allow them to more
    easily find and keep good jobs.
