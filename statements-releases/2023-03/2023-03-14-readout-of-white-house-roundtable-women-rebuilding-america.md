Today, on Equal Pay Day, White House and Biden Administration leaders
convened workers, union leaders, construction contractors, heads of
tradeswomen organizations, and equal pay experts to discuss how
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is providing economic
opportunities for women in fields where they are historically
underrepresented, in turn helping to close the gender pay gap.   
  
Administration participants included Jennifer Klein, Director of the
Gender Policy Council; Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor to the President
and Infrastructure Coordinator; Lael Brainard, Director of the National
Economic Council; Heather Boushey, Chief Economist to the Invest in
America Task Force and Member of the Council of Economic Advisors;
Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo; Robin Carnahan, Administrator of
the General Services Administration; Deputy Secretary Polly Trottenberg,
Department of Transportation; and Seema Nanda, Solicitor of the
Department of Labor.  
  
Women working full-time, year-round are paid only 84 cents, on average,
for every dollar paid to men. Pay disparities are wider, on average, for
many women of color, including Black women, Latinas, Native American
women, and some groups of Asian American women. One of the primary
drivers of pay gaps is the difference in the types of jobs and sectors
where men and women typically work; women tend to work in low-wage
sectors and are underrepresented in many good-paying occupations.
Reducing barriers and opening pathways to good jobs is an important part
of closing gender and racial pay gaps. As part of President Biden’s
Investing in America agenda, the Biden-Harris Administration is making
historic investments and creating good-paying jobs in industries such as
advanced manufacturing, construction, and clean energy, and is providing
opportunities for more women to access those jobs.  
  
Today, as part of that work, the Administration announced the Department
of Labor’s Mega Construction Project (Megaproject) Program. As part of
that program, the Department of Labor will designate certain
construction projects funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
and the CHIPS and Science Act as Megaprojects. Through intensive
on-the-ground compliance assistance and community partnerships, the
Megaproject Program strengthens recruitment, hiring, and employment
practices for these construction projects, including by removing hiring
barriers and promoting consideration of a diverse pool of qualified
workers for jobs in the trades, including women, people of color,
veterans, and people with disabilities.  
  
This announcement comes on the heels of the Department of Commerce
releasing a notice of funding opportunity for the CHIPS Incentives
Program last week, which will provide direct funding, loans, and loan
guarantees to support semiconductor manufacturing in the United States.
As part of the notice of funding opportunity, Commerce is requiring that
companies who apply for more than $150 million in direct funding submit
a plan to provide access to child care for the semiconductor and
construction workforce who will build and power new and expanded
manufacturing facilities. This will help employers find the skilled,
trained workforce they need and enable parents, including mothers, to
obtain and stay in jobs that build and operate chip facilities.  
  
Today’s White House *Women Rebuilding America* roundtable convened
private employers and unions who support women’s access to jobs in the
trades to discuss strategies to recruit, train, and hire women,
especially women of color. Union leaders discussed their commitment to
diversify the construction trades, while construction contractors
discussed their role as employers to create fair and equitable
worksites. Workers and leaders of tradeswomen organizations discussed
how to ensure community engagement and participation from workers in
creating fair and equitable workplaces. White House officials
underscored how women will play a critical role in advancing the
progress of the President’s Investing in America agenda, thanked the
participants for their leadership, and affirmed the Administration’s
commitment to advancing equitable access to good jobs in communities
across the country.
