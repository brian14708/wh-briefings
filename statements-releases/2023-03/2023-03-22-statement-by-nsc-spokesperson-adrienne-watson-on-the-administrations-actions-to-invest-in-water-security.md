title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on the Administration\u2019\
  s Actions to Invest in Water\_Security"
---
 
On this World Water Day, we reflect on the importance of water and
recommit ourselves to pursuing a water-secure world. We are at a
significant inflection point in world history.  The Biden-Harris
Administration recognizes the critical role of sustainable and resilient
water systems and the transformational power that safe and accessible
water has in the life of each person on Earth.  Global water security is
intrinsic to our own national security objectives and foreign policy
investments. Our goal is to improve global health, prosperity, stability
and resilience through sustainable and equitable water resource
management coupled with access to safe drinking water, sanitation
services, and hygiene practices.  
   
At the UN Water Conference meeting in New York this week, the United
States will unveil a series of commitments of up to $49 billion toward
the Water Action Agenda that reflect President Biden’s
once-in-a-generation investment in equitable access as well as
climate-resilient water and sanitation infrastructure at home and around
the world. We will leverage learning from domestic investments and
programs to improve and expand the success of our work abroad.  
   
Thanks to historic investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and
the Inflation Reduction Act, we are helping Americans weather stronger
storms and longer droughts through sound investments in resilient
infrastructure and new technology. The U.S. government will also deploy
all of its available tools and resources to implement the Global Water
Strategy. We will leverage the President’s Emergency Plan of Adaptation
and Resilience (PREPARE) to bring together the diplomatic, development
and technical expertise of the United States to accelerate financing for
adaptation measures, with the goal of helping more than half a billion
people in developing countries adapt and manage the impacts of climate
change by 2030. In alignment with the Administration’s Partnership for
Global Infrastructure and Investment, the U.S. government will
collaborate with G7+ partners to unlock public and private capital for
quality infrastructure that is climate resilient in low- and
middle-income countries to strengthen the resilience of communities, and
support inclusive, sustainable development.  
   
On the occasion of World Water Day, we take hope in the growing chorus
of countries stepping forward to make water security a global priority.
Alongside partners and allies, we will seek to leverage our investments,
mobilize our expertise, and continue to commit ourselves to achieve
water security for all.
