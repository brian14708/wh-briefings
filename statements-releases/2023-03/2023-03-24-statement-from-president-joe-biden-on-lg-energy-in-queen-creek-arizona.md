title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on LG Energy in Queen Creek,\_Arizona"
---
 
LG Energy is building a new electric battery manufacturing facility in
Arizona — the largest investment in a single battery facility in North
America — because of my economic plan. For far too long, we outsourced
jobs and manufacturing, and imported goods, while the future was made
elsewhere. Because of my Investing in America agenda, we’re finally
making the future in America and Arizona again — and tackling the
climate crisis at the same time.    
  
We are investing in America to rebuild our infrastructure, supply
chains, and manufacturing here at home. In the process, we’re creating
millions of good jobs that Americans can build a family on, and can
strengthen entire communities like Queen Creek and beyond.
