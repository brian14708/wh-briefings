National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met yesterday with democratic
opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya of Belarus.  Mr. Sullivan
underscored the steadfast support of the United States for the
Belarusian people’s pursuit of a sovereign and democratic future,
including free and fair elections as well as human rights protections.
He affirmed that the United States, together with its allies and
partners, will continue to hold the Lukashenka regime accountable for
its actions. They discussed the recent measures taken by the United
States in response to the regime’s ongoing crackdown against the
pro-democracy movement, flagrant human rights abuses, including the
continued imprisonment of more than 1,400 political prisoners, and
facilitation of Russia’s war against Ukraine.
