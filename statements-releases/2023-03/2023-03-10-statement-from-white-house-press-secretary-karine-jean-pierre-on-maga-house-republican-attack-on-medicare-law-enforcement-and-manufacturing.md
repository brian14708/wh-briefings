title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on MAGA House\
  \ Republican Attack on Medicare, Law Enforcement and\_Manufacturing"
---
 
Today, extreme MAGA House Republicans showed us what they value: tax
breaks for the super wealthy and wasteful spending for special
interests.  
   
The House Freedom caucus’ proposal would be a gut-punch to the American
middle class and wouldn’t cut the deficit. Let me repeat that:
this proposal would bring devastating consequences to our national
security, working families, and community safety, and result in $0 in
deficit reduction when coupled with MAGA Republicans’ support for
trillions in tax cuts.   
   
Extreme MAGA Republicans’ proposals would ship manufacturing jobs
overseas, in a crushing blow to states from Ohio to Georgia to Arizona –
and would provide a windfall of economic benefits to China. They would
increase health care premiums for nearly 15 million Americans
and make the biggest Medicare benefits cut in decades, forcing America’s
seniors to pay more for prescription drugs so Big Pharma can see new
taxpayer handouts. They would defund the police, weaken our competition
with China, and slash border security funding. All so that the
super-wealthy and corporate special interests can enjoy their tax breaks
and cheat on their taxes.  
   
This is a blueprint for selling out the middle class, law enforcement,
and American competitiveness.  
   
Yesterday, the President laid out his budget – one that lowers costs for
families, protects Medicare and Social Security, invests in more
manufacturing, positions the United States to win the global competition
with China, strengthens our defense, funds the police, and reinforces
the border. This is what he values – and poll after poll shows Americans
agree.
