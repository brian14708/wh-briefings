*Biden will visit a manufacturer of clean energy technology in Fridley
that is helping to build America’s clean energy economy*

On Monday, April 3, President Biden will visit Cummins Power Generation
Facility in Fridley, Minnesota as part of his Administration’s
“Investing in America” tour. In October 2022, just two months after
President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, Cummins announced
that it will begin manufacturing electrolyzers in the United States for
the first time. Electrolyzers help produce clean hydrogen that is
essential for reducing emissions and creating good-paying jobs in
manufacturing and industrial sectors, and play a critical role in clean
energy supply chains that until now have largely been produced
overseas.  
  
The visit will highlight how the President’s Investing in America agenda
– including historic investments from the Inflation Reduction Act, the
CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the
American Rescue Plan – is building a clean energy economy, rebuilding
our infrastructure and bringing back supply chains, unleashing a
manufacturing boom, and creating good-paying jobs across the country.

Earlier this week, President Biden kicked off the Investing in America
tour with a stop at a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Durham,
North Carolina, and announced that since the beginning of his
Administration, private companies have announced $435 billion in
manufacturing investments in the United States. As part of the Investing
in America tour, President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill
Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, members of the Cabinet, and
senior White House officials are visiting over 20 states over the course
of three weeks to highlight the impact of the President’s Investing in
America agenda.

Next week:

    Cummins’ hydrogen electrolyzer production facility that will help
    power our clean energy future while bringing supply chains back to
    the United States, and creating good-paying jobs.

    highlight career-connected learning programs that are preparing high

    Education Miguel Cardona** will join the First Lady for part of the
    tour.

    opportunities created by signature legislation, including the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and the
    Inflation Reduction Act.
-   **Senior Advisor and Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu will
    travel to California** to participate in a ribbon cutting of a
    bridge that was rebuilt with funding from President Biden’s

As part of the Investing in America tour, the White House will also host
an Energy Communities Summit on Tuesday, April 4<sup>th</sup>, to
highlight how the President’s economic agenda is unleashing a

bringing clean energy supply chains back to the United States. The
Summit will include Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, Secretary of
Energy Jennifer Granholm, National Economic Council Director Lael
Brainard, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation
