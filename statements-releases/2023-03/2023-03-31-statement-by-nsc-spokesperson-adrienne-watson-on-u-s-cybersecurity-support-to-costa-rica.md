title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on U.S. Cybersecurity Support\
  \ to Costa\_Rica"

Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies
Anne Neuberger traveled to Costa Rica March 29-30 to announce the United
States’ plan to provide $25 million in cybersecurity support to the
Government of Costa Rica, demonstrating President Biden’s commitment to
help one of our closest partners secure its infrastructure and to
support strong democracies in the region.  
   
The U.S.’s support will enable Costa Rica to establish a national
security operations center to quickly detect and respond to cyber
attacks and implement cybersecurity protections for its government
systems.  This builds on the rapid support the U.S. provided to Costa
Rica following two major ransomware attacks in the spring of 2022 that
disrupted government services and led President Rodrigo Chaves Robles to
declare a state of emergency.  
   
While in Costa Rica, Neuberger met with senior government officials to
underscore the Biden-Harris Administration’s collaboration with our
global partners to bolster the government’s cyber infrastructure and
ensure their citizens can access critical services.  Additionally, she
emphasized the strength of the U.S.-Costa Rican partnership in
addressing a range of regional technology issues.  
   
This announcement came during the [Summit for
Democracy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/29/fact-sheet-advancing-technology-for-democracy-at-home-and-abroad/),
which featured Costa Rica as a co-host country, and reflects the U.S.’s
commitment to supporting democracies’ access to secure, open, and
reliable digital technology.
