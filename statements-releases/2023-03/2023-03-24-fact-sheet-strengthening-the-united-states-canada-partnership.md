title: "FACT SHEET: Strengthening the United\_States-Canada\_Partnership"
---
 
As President Biden has said, the United States has no closer friend,
partner, or ally than Canada.  Over the past 150 years, our two
countries have built one of the closest and most extensive
relationships. Canada is our largest trading partner, with nearly $2.6
billion in goods and services crossing our shared border, the world’s
longest land border, every day – an almost 20 percent increase in 2022
over the previous year. This trade supports millions of jobs on both
sides of the border. Our people also share deep personal and familial
ties, and we’ve worked together to tackle some of the biggest challenges
facing the world.  
  
Under this Administration, President Biden has restored trust and
confidence between our two countries while reaffirming the United
States’ enduring commitment to the U.S.-Canada partnership. The
U.S.-Canada partnership benefits not only our people, but the world –
and by working together, there is nothing we cannot achieve.   
  
**The United States and Canada are powering private sector investment to
promote inclusive economic growth and create good paying jobs. We will
use the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act to build
integrated supply chains and make North America more competitive.**

-   Last year, the United States announced $250 million in Defense
    Production Act (DPA) funding for U.S. and Canadian companies to mine
    and process critical minerals for electric vehicle and stationary
    storage batteries. Awards to U.S. and Canadian companies will be
    announced this spring. The Canadian Critical Minerals Infrastructure
    Fund will make CAD $1.5 billion available to support clean energy
    and transportation infrastructure projects and an additional CAD $
    1.5 billion available through the Strategic Innovation Fund to
    support advanced manufacturing, processing, and recycling. These
    mutual steps will strengthen U.S.-Canada collaboration on supply
    chain resilience.  
-   Both countries will advance a cross-border semiconductor packaging
    corridor, beginning with Canada and IBM providing significant
    incentives as part of a memorandum of understanding to develop new
    and expanded packaging and testing capabilities at its Bromont
    facility. The arrangement will generate jobs and economic activity
    in both Canada and the United States.   
-   The United States also announced $50 million of DPA funding for U.S.
    and Canadian companies to further strengthen advanced packaging of
    semiconductors and printed circuit boards in North America. Canada
    will provide up to CAD $250 million for semiconductor projects from
    its Strategic Innovation Fund.   
-   The United States and Canada committed to identify opportunities
    between the two countries to promote training and work opportunities
    in priority areas such clean energy and skilled trades, and bring
    together key players from multinational companies, unions, state and
    provincial governments, and educational and training institutions to
    grow the pool of talent needed for critical supply chains. The
    United States and Canada will work with automakers, battery
    manufacturers, and organized labor on sharing training efforts and
    cross-border credentials to meet the growing demands for electric
    vehicles in North America.  
-   The United States and Canada updated the Joint Action Plan on
    Critical Minerals Cooperation. Under the Plan, the Departments of
    State, Commerce, Defense, and Energy and the U.S. Geological Survey
    will work with Canadian counterparts on increased information and
    data sharing, joint efforts to promote private sector engagement,
    coordination on research and development, and cooperation at
    multilateral fora. 

**Tackling the climate crisis is a key issue for President Biden, and
both the United States and Canada – our largest energy trading partner –
are committed to taking decisive action. Our countries will grow the
clean energy economy by lifting up bold legislation like the U.S.
Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the clean energy transition and
make North America a clean energy powerhouse.**

-   The United States and Canada have built the world’s largest
    market-based energy trading relationship, which provides a firm
    foundation as we strive to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.
    We will work to harmonize charging standards and develop
    cross-border alternative fuel corridors, drawing on USD $7.5 billion
    in the U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and CAD $1.2 billion to
    build a network of electric vehicle fast chargers and community
    charging options on both sides of the border.   
-   The United States and Canada will work towards collaboration on the
    U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Earthshot™, which are decadal
    performance targets for critical technology areas. Canada plans to
    embrace the goals of the Long Duration Storage Shot (LDSS), which
    aims to reduce the cost of grid-scale energy storage by 90% for
    systems that deliver 10+ hours of duration within the decade. To
    drive toward the LDSS goal, Canada plans to focus on energy storage
    technologies for remote and off-grid applications.  
-   Canada will fund and provide in-kind support for the Foundational
    Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor
    Technology (FIRST) program, the Biden Administration’s leading
    international initiative to help partner countries develop nuclear
    energy programs under the highest standards for safety, security,
    and nonproliferation. The United States and Canada will also
    coordinate efforts to develop secure and reliable North American
    nuclear fuel supply chains that do not rely on authoritarian-based
    suppliers and will build broader partnerships with longstanding
    allies and partners, both of which will support ensuring access to
    low enriched uranium and High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium.   
-   Building on Canadian and U.S. commitments to achieve net-zero power
    grids by 2035 and to accelerate efforts to phasedown new, unabated
    coal power generation facilities, both countries intend to propose
    regulations before this fall that will reduce greenhouse gas
    emissions from their respective sectors. The United States and
    Canada also intend to work with other major energy importers and
    exporters to develop an internationally aligned approach to measure,
    monitor, report, and verify lifecycle methane and CO2 emissions
    across the fossil energy value chain.  
-   The United States and Canada committed to work in close partnership
    with Arctic Indigenous Peoples and will use Indigenous Knowledge as
    an integral part of the decision-making processes wherever possible.
    The two countries recognized the need to reduce localized emissions
    of carbon dioxide, methane, and black carbon in the Arctic to
    complement our global mitigation efforts. The two countries also
    committed to conserving and protecting Arctic biodiversity,
    ecosystems, habitats, and wildlife, and will collaborate to prepare
    for, prevent, and respond to oil spills and other environmental
    disasters in the Arctic.  
-   The Leaders recognized the challenges that the creation of the
    international border between the United States and Canada places on
    Indigenous communities. The leaders are committed to working
    together to address the impacts the shared border has on mobility,
    traditional practices, Native language preservation, kinship,
    cultural ties, and economic opportunities for Indigenous Peoples.
    This includes a commitment to work in partnership with Tribal
    Nations and Alaska Native Villages in the United States, and First
    Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples in Canada, to find solutions to
    these longstanding border challenges.  
-   Leaders committed to work over the coming months towards agreement
    on a modernized Columbia River Treaty regime that provides flood
    risk management, power generation, and environmental benefits that
    are shared equitably by both countries and the Indigenous and Tribal
    nations, communities, and stakeholders in this watershed.  
-   The United States and Canada are undertaking a joint technical
    review and assessment to examine whether the U.S.-Canada Air Quality
    Agreement (AQA), entered into in 1991, is meeting its environmental
    objectives as well as its sufficiency in addressing transboundary
    air pollution. The agreement includes commitments by both countries
    to address acid rain and ground-level ozone. The review will also
    examine pollutants/issues not currently addressed by the AQA, such
    as particulate matter (PM2.5). Under the agreement, the United
    States and Canada also cooperate on science and research topics such
    as wildfires, ammonia, and methane as an ozone precursor.

**Irregular migration is a critical issue for the Western Hemisphere. As
committed under the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection,
the United States and Canada are working closely to address these issues
by prioritizing orderly and safe migration through regular pathways.**

-   Canada will welcome an additional 15,000 migrants on a humanitarian
    basis from top sending countries in the Western Hemisphere, such as
    Haiti, Colombia, and Ecuador, over the course of the year. The
    United States and Canada also announced the implementation of an
    agreement to apply the terms of the Safe Third Country Agreement to
    migrants who cross between the ports of entry.

**The United States and Canada are committed partners in the North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the only binational military
command in the world. Recent events have made clear the importance of
NORAD and of our partnership on continental security and defense. The
United States and Canada will continue to closely coordinate to defend
our airspace.**

-   Canada confirmed commitments to modernize NORAD capabilities. Canada
    will procure and field two next-generation Over-the-Horizon Radar
    systems, at least one by 2028, to enhance early warning and domain
    awareness of North American approaches. Canada will also make
    investments in the northern forward operating locations to support
    5th Generation aircraft and mobility/refueling assets, capabilities
    that should be in place prior to the delivery of F-35s to Canada, to
    include airfield improvements to accommodate aircraft, personnel,
    fuel, and munitions.  
-   In the face of global threats, the leaders acknowledged the
    importance of investment in modern, ready, and capable forces in
    line with their commitments to NATO under the 2014 Wales Summit
    Defence Investment Pledge.  Such investments enable effective
    contributions to NATO, United Nations, and other global missions.

**The trafficking of illicit drugs, including synthetic opioids like
fentanyl, is a global challenge that causes needless death and
suffering. The United States and Canada are committed to continue our
close partnership to intensify and expand prosecution of drug
traffickers, dismantle criminal networks, disrupt the supply of
precursor chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl, and prevent the
trafficking of drugs, firearms, and people across our shared border.**

-   Canada will join the United States as we build a global coalition
    against synthetic drugs, underscoring U.S. and Canadian leadership
    in response to this shared public health and security challenge. The
    global coalition will be open to countries from all regions of the
    world that are interested in accelerating global efforts against
    synthetic drugs. The United States also looks forward to working
    with our North American partners through the Trilateral Fentanyl
    Committee to beat the synthetic opioid epidemic. 

**The United States and Canada redoubled efforts for stability in Haiti
by continuing to work together to find a path for meeting Haiti’s
security and humanitarian needs.**

-   The United States has committed over $90 million to support training
    and equipment for the Haitian National Police.  
-   The United States has provided more than $204.7 million in
    humanitarian funding to respond to complex humanitarian crises in
    Haiti, including a cholera outbreak, an earthquake, food insecurity,
    violence against vulnerable communities, and widespread population
    displacement.  
-   In the last six months, the United States announced an additional
    $56 million in humanitarian assistance for Haiti, delivered 450
    metric tons of health, logistics, and water, sanitation and hygiene
    commodities to Haiti, and transported 232 metric tons of personal
    protective equipment for health care workers, rehydration fluids for
    cholera patients, and water disinfection tablets.

**The United States and Canada also remain committed to improving health
outcomes.**

-   The United States and Canada will work to transform international
    clinical trials and research, accelerate biomanufacturing
    innovation, strengthen the role of research during outbreaks, and
    exercise response capabilities to promote development of life-saving
    medical products. Our two countries will also increase scientific
    collaboration on the development of new and next generation medical
    countermeasures to stop outbreaks.

**The United States and Canada also committed to strengthen space
cooperation.  **

-   The United States strongly welcomed Canada’s decision to support the
    extension of operation of the International Space Station
    through 2030. The United States also welcomed the upcoming
    announcement of the names of the Artemis II mission crew, which
    includes a Canadian astronaut.
