Today’s report shows annual inflation is down by a third from this
summer at a time when the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low.
  That is the slowest annual increase since September 2021.   I will
continue working to lower costs for hard-working Americans so they have
a little more breathing room at the end of the month.  
   
On that front, I am pleased at today’s announcement that, in line with
my call, Novo Nordisk will be lowering their insulin prices by 75
percent, following Eli Lilly’s action.  This builds on the important
progress we made last year when I signed a law to cap insulin at $35 for
seniors.  I urge all other manufacturers to follow suit and Republicans
in Congress to join us and cap insulin at $35 for all Americans.  
   
As I’ve long said, and as challenges in the banking sector remind us,
there will be setbacks along the way in our transition to steady and
stable growth. But we face these challenges from a position of strength.
More than 12 million jobs have been created since I took office and the
share of working age adults in jobs or looking for work is the highest
it has been in 15 years. We will continue to make progress in our fight
to build an economy from the bottom up and middle out, not top down.  
   
At the same time, I will do everything in my power to prevent us from
going backwards on the progress we’ve made – including by standing up to
Congressional Republicans who threaten economic catastrophe over the
debt limit in order to secure tax cuts for the wealthy and large
corporations and reckless cuts to critical programs that American
seniors and families count on.
