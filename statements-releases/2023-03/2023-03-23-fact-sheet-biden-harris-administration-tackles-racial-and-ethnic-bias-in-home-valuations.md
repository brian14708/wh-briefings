title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Tackles Racial and Ethnic Bias\
  \ in Home\_Valuations"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is highlighting progress made to
ensure that every American who buys a home has the same opportunities to
build generational wealth through homeownership.  
  
One year ago today, the Biden-Harris Administration’s Interagency Task
Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) – led by U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L.
Fudge and White House Domestic Policy Advisor Ambassador Susan Rice –
released the PAVE Action Plan, the most wide-ranging set of actions ever
announced to advance equity in the home appraisal process. Bias in home
valuations limits the ability of Black and brown families to enjoy the
financial returns associated with homeownership, thereby contributing to
the already sprawling racial wealth gap.  
  
In just 12 months, the PAVE Task Force has made critical progress
towards fully implementing the Action Plan, including by empowering
consumers with new tools and greater awareness of appraisal bias;
leveraging data to identify trends and crack down on offenders of
appraisal bias; and supporting a well-trained and dynamic appraiser
profession.  
  
The Action Plan addresses a real harm. For example: at the White House’s
release of the Action Plan last year, homeowner Tenisha Tate-Austin
spoke about her experience with misvaluation. Her family’s home was
appraised at roughly $500,000 more than its initial appraised value
after having a white friend stand in for them. Earlier this month, the
Tate-Austins settled a housing discrimination lawsuit. The U.S.
Department of Justice had filed a [statement of
interest](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1472031/download)
in their case early last year.  
  
Over the last year, the Biden-Harris Administration has executed on the
PAVE Action Plan by:

-   **Empowering consumers to take action against appraisal bias.**
    Consumers who seek to finance or re-finance a home are often unaware
    of their options when they receive a lower-than-expected valuation.
    In January 2023, HUD
    [published](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_011)
    draft guidance to make it easier and quicker for prospective
    borrowers applying for Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured
    loans to request a Reconsideration of Value (ROV) on a property if
    the initial valuation is lower because of suspected illegal bias.
    This week, HUD awarded $54 million to 182 fair housing organizations
    across the country. Eligible activities for the funding included
    testing for appraisal bias, enforcement activities and educating
    local communities on the issue. Further, earlier this year the
    federal Appraisal Subcommittee held its first-ever
    [hearing](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/events/archive-past-events/appraisal-subcommittee-hearing-on-appraisal-bias/),
    dedicated to the topic of appraisal bias. The hearing brought
    together federal agencies and industry experts to define the problem
    and discuss potential solutions.
-   **Increasing transparency and leveraging federal data to inform
    policy and improve enforcement against appraisal bias.**  In October
    2022, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
    [published](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Publishes-New-UAD-Aggregate-Statistics-Data-File.aspx)
    the first-ever publicly available datasets of aggregate statistics
    on appraisal records, providing the public with access to the data
    and trends found in appraisal reports. Using these new data,
    academic researchers have already published new analyses
    illustrating stark differences in home valuations across racial and
    ethnic groups.  FHFA, along with HUD, USDA and VA, are working to
    build a Federal database to share appraisal data across the Federal
    government; the database could allow agencies to share enhanced
    oversight and enforcement actions, and could facilitate new research
    related to property valuation.
-   **Cultivating an appraiser profession that is well-trained and looks
    like the communities it serves.**  As outlined in the PAVE Action
    Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to remove
    unnecessary educational and experience requirements that make it
    difficult for underrepresented groups to access the profession and
    to strengthen anti-bias, fair housing, and fair lending training of
    existing appraisers. In January 2023, the Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA) released new guidance to its appraiser workforce. Among
    other steps, the guidance enhances oversight procedures to detect
    potential discriminatory bias in appraisal reports filed by VA fee
    panel appraisers, and calls upon all VA fee panel appraisers and
    lender-approved staff to participate in appraisal bias, fair
    housing, and fair lending training. In addition, last year, the
    federal Appraisal Subcommittee awarded a grant to the state of
    Mississippi to create an innovative pathway to appraiser licensure,
    including for appraisers from underrepresented groups, and with a
    particular focus on underserved communities within the State where
    there is a shortage of appraisers. Mississippi’s success has
    inspired several other states to express interest in replicating the
    program.

In conjunction with the release of the PAVE Action Plan, last year the
Biden-Harris Administration launched **pave.hud.gov/gethelp**. Consumers
who suspect misvaluations due to racial bias may use this portal to
learn about their rights and steps they can take to file a
discrimination complaint.
