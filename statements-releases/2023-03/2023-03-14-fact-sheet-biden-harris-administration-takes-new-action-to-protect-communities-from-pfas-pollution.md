*EPA Announces First-Ever National Standard to Address PFAS in Drinking
Water*

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every community
has access to clean drinking water, free of chemicals and pollutants
that harm the health and wellbeing of children, families, and
communities. Today the Administration announced the first-ever national
drinking water standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
a major step to advance that commitment. This action builds on two years
of progress on [President Biden’s action
plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-plan-to-combat-pfas-pollution/#:~:text=Consistent%20with%20President%20Biden's%20commitment,from%20discharging%20PFAS%20into%20America's)
to combat PFAS pollution, safeguarding public health and advancing
environmental justice.

PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” are a set of human-made chemicals that can
cause cancer and other severe health problems. Found in air, drinking
water, and our food supply, PFAS pollution disproportionately affects
disadvantaged communities and poses a serious threat across rural,
suburban, and urban areas.

President Biden has secured historic resources to address emerging
containments like PFAS. His Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $9
billion over five years to help communities that are on the frontlines
of PFAS and other contamination reduce levels in drinking water. The
investments are part of the [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
which aims to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain
Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are
marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution.

In line with President Biden’s commitment last week to the International
Association of Firefighters, the President’s FY24 budget includes
additional resources for firefighters exposed to PFAS, including
increased funding for FEMA’s Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program
(AFG). Specifically, the budget requests $370 million for AFG that can
be used to support cancer screenings, fitness activities, and other
wellness initiatives.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to utilizing science and
holding polluters accountable to address and prevent PFAS contamination.
Today the Administration also released two new reports outlining the
latest science and progress on a government-wide plan to address and
prevent PFAS contamination.  
  
**First-Ever National Standard to Combat PFAS in Drinking Water**  
Today the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [proposed the first-ever
national
standard](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-proposes-first-ever-national-standard-protect-communities)
to address PFAS contamination in drinking water. EPA will require public
water systems to monitor for six PFAS chemicals, notify the public if
the levels of these PFAS exceed the proposed regulatory standards, and
take action to reduce the level of PFAS in the water supply. EPA
anticipates that if fully implemented, the rule will prevent thousands
of deaths and reduce tens of thousands of serious PFAS-attributable
illnesses.  
  
This proposal is part of EPA’s [PFAS Strategic
Roadmap](https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-strategic-roadmap-epas-commitments-action-2021-2024),
a comprehensive strategy that outlines concrete actions through 2024,
including steps to control PFAS at its sources, hold polluters
accountable, ensure science-based decision making, and address the
impacts of contamination on disadvantaged communities.  
  
**New Report on PFAS Science to Advance Federal PFAS Research
Activities**  
Today, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
[released a state of science
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OSTP-March-2023-PFAS-Report.pdf)
on PFAS. The report summarizes current PFAS research in key strategic
areas, including safe removal and destruction of PFAS and alternatives
to PFAS that are safer, as well as gaps in PFAS data and knowledge. It
also describes the state of federal PFAS research and development (R&D),
and underscores the importance of communities, the private sector and
governments at all levels working together to expand our nation’s
understanding of PFAS and alternatives. Over the next year, OSTP will
work with federal agencies to leverage this report as a roadmap for
establishing goals and priorities for federal PFAS R&D, harness existing
federal PFAS research activities, and accelerate transformative
advancements in the destruction and disposal of PFAS, the development of
PFAS alternatives, and in our understanding of the harmful effects of
PFAS as a chemical class on human health and our environment.  
  
**Building on Two Years of Combatting PFAS Contamination**  
Thanks to President Biden’s leadership, nearly two dozen Federal
agencies and offices have made systematic and substantive progress to
safeguard human health and protect the environment from PFAS over the
first two years of the Biden-Harris Administration. This includes
efforts to address the disproportionate health impacts on disadvantaged
communities, including those that are low income, rural, or located near
polluting facilities. Today the Council on Environmental Quality, which
leads the Interagency Policy Committee on PFAS, released [a new
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CEQ-PFAS-Report-March-2023.pdf)
on the Administration’s actions on PFAS and next steps.

Highlights include:

-   **<u>Measuring and Monitoring PFAS:</u>** The Centers for Disease
    Control Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (CDC ATSDR)
    completed the first multi-community blood PFAS assessment in over
    2000 residents across 10 communities. The Department of Defense
    (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are measuring
    blood PFAS in firefighters. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
    tested for PFAS in over 500 food samples and the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitored more than 20 PFAS in
    marine mammals, fish, and shellfish along U.S. coasts and the Great
    Lakes.
-   **<u>Accelerating PFAS Cleanup:</u>** Cleaning up PFAS from the
    environment is a massive task that will require our continuous and
    dedicated investment in the coming years. DoD continued site
    investigations at more than 700 installations, and initiated
    remedial investigations at over 250 sites addressing PFAS in
    drinking water at 53 military and National Guard facilities. The
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) restricted the
    use of PFAS-containing foams and installed cleanup procedures.
-   **<u>Strengthening Policy and Limiting PFAS Procurement:</u>** The
    National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) worked on
    PFAS measurement in farm animals, corn silage, fish, spinach, eggs,
    and milk. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provided policy
    guidance to airports to reduce the use of PFAS-containing
    firefighting foams. DoD issued new specifications for fluorine-free
    foam for land-based firefighting applications and began reducing
    procurement of PFAS-containing items.
-   **<u>Expanding Programs and Resources to Meet PFAS Challenges:</u>**
    EPA began distributing $10 billion in funding to address emerging
    contaminants such as PFAS under President Biden’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. DoD provided CDC ATSDR with $30 million over the
    last two years to study exposures and health risks from PFAS in
    drinking water in communities near former and current military
    bases. 
-   **<u>Closing Critical Research Gaps in PFAS Detection, Disposal,
    Health Effects and PFAS-alternatives:</u>** The National Institute
    of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) funded over 70 projects to
    investigate human and environmental PFAS exposures and impacts,
    novel detection and remediation technologies, and occupational
    health trainings. The VA launched the Military Exposures Research
    Program to better understand the health impact of chemical exposures
    including PFAS. The FDA completed studies to understand the
    potential health effects of certain PFAS in women and children, and
    developed methods to detect PFAS at low parts per trillion
    concentrations in human food and animal feed. The U.S. Department of
    Agriculture (USDA) led research on PFAS in ground water, wastewater,
    and livestock, and on farming practices to reduce risks of PFAS in
    food crops. The Department of Energy (DOE) focused research on using
    molecular probes for rapid detection, separation, and quantification
    of PFAS in water. DoD, DOE and EPA continued concerted work on safe
    and effective PFAS destruction technologies.
-   **<u>Bolstering Community Engagement and Information Sharing:</u>**
    EPA, DOE, and DoD continue to share PFAS information and action
    updates via dedicated PFAS websites. The Department of Homeland
    Security (DHS) crafted communication plans and PFAS guidance, and is
    expanding stakeholder engagement with a focus on mutual aid and
    interagency collaboration at facilities co-located with other
    agencies. CDC ATSDR provided webinars to clinicians with guidance
    for addressing PFAS in patient care, and published a user-friendly
    blood PFAS estimator tool for general use.
