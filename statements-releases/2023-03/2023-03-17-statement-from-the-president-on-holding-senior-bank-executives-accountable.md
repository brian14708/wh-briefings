title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Holding Senior Bank Executives\_Accountable"
---
 
This week, we took decisive action to stabilize the banking system
without putting taxpayer dollars at risk. That action was necessary to
protect jobs and small businesses, and no losses will be borne by the
taxpayers. Our banking system is more resilient and stable today because
of the actions we took.  On Monday morning, I told the American people
and American businesses that they should feel confident that their
deposits will be there if and when they need them.  That continues to be
the case.  

I also said that I’m firmly committed to accountability for those
responsible for this mess. No one is above the law – and strengthening
accountability is an important deterrent to prevent mismanagement in the
future. The law limits the administration’s authority to hold executives
responsible. When banks fail due to mismanagement and excessive risk
taking, it should be easier for regulators to claw back compensation
from executives, to impose civil penalties, and to ban executives from
working in the banking industry again. Congress must act to impose
tougher penalties for senior bank executives whose mismanagement
contributed to their institutions failing.
