title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Former Congresswoman\
  \ Pat\_Schroeder"

Pat Schroeder was a pioneer.  
   
In her 24 years in Congress, she seized every opportunity to advance
equality for women, and the laws she helped pass fundamentally reshaped
our country for the better.  
   
The 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which protected women from being
fired for having children.  
   
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which allowed millions of
women and men to care for family members without losing their jobs.  
   
The opening of military jobs – including flying combat missions – to
women.  
   
More access to early screening for breast and cervical cancer for
lower-income women.  
   
On issue after issue, Pat stood up for basic fairness, sensible policy,
and women’s equal humanity. The result was a legislative record that
changed millions of women’s lives – and men’s lives – for the better.  
   
I saw firsthand Pat’s moral compass, legal mind, and political savvy
when we worked together on the Violence Against Women Act. She was the
primary sponsor in the House; I led the charge in the Senate. Together,
we got it done. With Pat as my partner, I never doubted that we would.  
   
She inspired a generation of public servants, proved that a young mom
could be a formidable Congresswoman, and did it all with legendary
wit.  
   
Jill and I send our prayers to Pat’s husband James, her children Jamie
and Scott, and the entire Schroeder family.
