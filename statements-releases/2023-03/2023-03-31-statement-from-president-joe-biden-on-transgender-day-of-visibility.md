On Transgender Day of Visibility, we celebrate the strength, joy, and
absolute courage of some of the bravest people I know. Transgender
Americans deserve to be safe and supported in every community – but
today, across our country, MAGA extremists are advancing hundreds of
hateful and extreme state laws that target transgender kids and their
families. No one should have to be brave just to be themselves.

Let me be clear: These attacks are un-American and must end. The
bullying, discrimination, and political attacks that trans kids face
have exacerbated our national mental health crisis. More than half of
transgender youth say they have seriously considered suicide. Loving
parents are terrified for their children’s futures. To help, my
Administration is providing dedicated emergency mental health resources:
If you’re a transgender young person who needs help, you can call 988 to
reach the nationwide suicide prevention and crisis hotline. Press “3” to
speak with a counselor specifically trained to support LGBTQI+ youth.  

My Administration will never quit fighting to end discrimination, to
stand against these unjust state laws, and to guarantee everyone the
fundamental right and freedom to be who they are. We’ll never stop
working to create a world where everyone can live without fear; where
parents, teachers, and whole communities come together to support kids,
no matter how they identify; and every child is surrounded by compassion
and love.

I want every member of the trans community to know that we see you.
You’re each made in the image of God, and deserve love, dignity, and
respect. You make America stronger, and we’re with you.
