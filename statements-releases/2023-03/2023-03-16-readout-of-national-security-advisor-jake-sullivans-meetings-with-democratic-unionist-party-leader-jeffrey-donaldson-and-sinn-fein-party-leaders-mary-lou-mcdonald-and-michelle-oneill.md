National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met separately today with
Jeffrey Donaldson, Democratic Unionist Party leader as well as with
Michelle O’Neill, Sinn Féin Party vice president, and Mary Lou McDonald,
Sinn Féin Party leader.  Mr. Sullivan praised the peace and progress
achieved in Northern Ireland during the 25 years since the Belfast/Good
Friday Agreement, underscoring the unwavering commitment of the United
States to preserving and strengthening its dividends.  He condemned last
month’s attempted murder of a Police Service of Northern Ireland
detective in Omagh, welcoming the cross-party denunciation of this
violence and commitment to a peaceful future.  Looking ahead, Mr.
Sullivan and all of the party leaders discussed the importance of
investing in Northern Ireland’s vast economic potential and ensuring
prosperity for all communities.  They also expressed their readiness to
work with U.S. Special Envoy to Northern Ireland for Economic Affairs
Joe Kennedy III in this regard.
