---
 
Today, Jill and I send our best wishes to everyone celebrating Nowruz
across the United States and around the world—from the Middle East, to
Central and South Asia, to the Caucasus, to Europe.  
   
The Nowruz holiday brings loved ones together around the Haft-Sin table
to reflect on the year that has passed and renew hope for the year
ahead. This year, Nowruz comes at a difficult time for many families,
when hope is needed more than ever—including for the women of Iran who
are fighting for their human rights and fundamental freedoms. The United
States will continue to stand with them, and all the citizens of Iran
who are inspiring the world with their conviction and courage. And
together with our partners, we will continue to hold Iranian officials
accountable for their attacks against their people.  
   
As we welcome the season of spring—and the new growth and possibility it
brings—we have decorated our Haft-Sin table at the White House to
reflect our hopes for the new year. And, we join Americans everywhere in
celebrating the diverse diaspora communities who continue to strengthen
the fabric of our nation, generation after generation. To everyone
celebrating, Eid-eh Shoma Mobarak—we wish you a peaceful and prosperous
new year.
