title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Bipartisan Railway Safety Act of\_\
  2023"

I applaud the bipartisan group of senators for proposing rail safety
legislation that provides many of the solutions that my administration
has been calling for. This legislation provides us with tools to hold
companies accountable to prevent terrible tragedies like the Norfolk
Southern derailment in East Palestine and to make those communities
whole.  
   
This legislation strengthens safety requirements for all trains carrying
hazardous materials, and phases in newer, safer tank cars over the next
two years, not over the next decade. It will increase safety by
requiring hotbox detectors every 10 miles to prevent derailments like
the one that we saw in East Palestine. It increases HAZMAT fees for
railroads to pay for grants to train state and local firefighters and
other first responders to respond to hazmat incidents. The legislation
will also dramatically increase fines for safety violations from the
current cap of $225,000 to the greater of $1 million or 1% of a
railroad’s annual operating income, which for the largest carriers like
Norfolk Southern could be more than $50 million.  
   
This bill will make important progress – and we need to do even more,
like require state of the art braking systems, provide more funding for
federal safety inspections, invest in worker safety, fortify state
emergency management and response, and hold companies like Norfolk
Southern accountable not just for the immediate damage, but also the
long-term health and economic damage to communities like East
Palestine.  
   
I encourage Republicans and Democrats alike to move quickly to advance
these commonsense rail safety measures and send me a bill to sign into
law.
