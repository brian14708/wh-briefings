title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Budget Delivers for Tribal Nations and\
  \ Tribal\_Communities"
---
 
President Biden is continuing to ensure the Federal government honors
its commitment to Tribal Nations and Native communities. Under his
leadership, the Administration has deployed record investments to Tribal
Nations and Native communities, including through the American Rescue
Plan, the largest direct federal investment in Indian Country in
history, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest single
investment in infrastructure for Indian Country ever.

Over the past two years, the Administration has taken additional steps
to improve and standardize Tribal consultation in recognition of Tribal
communities’ inherent sovereignty; expand protections for Tribal victims
under the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022;
develop new public safety and justice strategies for Native communities,
including to address the epidemic of missing or murdered Indigenous
people; and secure—for the first time in history—advance appropriations
for the Indian Health Service, which will ensure a more predictable
funding stream and improve health outcomes across Indian Country.

The President’s Budget—informed by direct consultation with Tribal
leaders—continues to demonstrate the President’s commitment through
historic investments in the Indian Health Service, Tribal public safety,
affordable housing, education, and more. The Budget:

-   **Advances Health Equity for American Indians and Alaska Natives.**
    The Administration is committed to upholding the United States’
    trust responsibility to Tribal nations by addressing the historical
    underfunding of the Indian Health Service. The enactment of an
    advance appropriation for 2024 for IHS was a historic and welcome
    step towards the goal of securing adequate and stable funding to
    improve the overall health status of American Indians and Alaska
    Natives.  Building on the advance appropriation, the Budget requests
    an additional $3 billion in 2024 for a total of $8.1 billion in
    discretionary resources. In addition, the Budget reclassifies
    contract support costs and leases as mandatory for a total of $9.4
    billion in discretionary and mandatory resources for IHS in 2024.
    The Budget proposes all IHS resources as mandatory beginning in
    2025.

-   **Makes Historic Investments in Tribal Communities Through the
    Department of the Interior.** The Administration is committed to
    upholding the Federal Government’s trust and treaty responsibilities
    to Tribal nation and Native communities. Building on feedback from
    extensive Tribal consultations, the Budget provides $4.7 billion for
    DOI’s Tribal programs, more than $690 million above the 2023 enacted
    level, including investments that would support public safety and
    justice, social services, and educational needs to uphold Federal
    trust responsibilities and advance equity for Native communities.
    The Budget also reclassifies contract support costs and leases at
    DOI as mandatory in 2024.

-   **Invests in Tribal Infrastructure and Affordable Housing.** Native
    Americans are seven times more likely to live in overcrowded
    conditions and five times more likely to have inadequate plumbing,
    kitchen, or heating systems than other U.S. households. The Budget
    provides over $1 billion to fund Tribal efforts to expand affordable
    housing, improve housing conditions and infrastructure, and increase
    economic opportunities for low-income families. Of this total, $150
    million would prioritize activities that advance resilience and
    energy efficiency in housing-related projects. The Budget also
    reflects a reduction in mortgage insurance fees for the Indian
    Housing Loan Guarantee Program, which will save Native American
    borrowers over $500 on average in their first year and expand access
    to homeownership.

<!-- -->

-   **Supports Tribal Law Enforcement and Public Safety and Addresses
    the Crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons**. For the
    Department of Justice, the Budget provides $4.9 billion in
    discretionary resources for State and local grants and $30 billion
    in mandatory resources to support State, local, and Tribal efforts
    to protect U.S. communities and promote public safety. This includes
    $537 million for the COPS Hiring Program discretionary topline, an
    increase of $213 million or 66 percent over the 2023 enacted level.
    The Budget provides $717 million in Tribal Public Safety and Justice
    funding at DOI, an $86 million increase over the 2023 enacted level,
    to support pressing public safety needs in Indian Country, including
    continuing efforts to address the crisis of Missing and Murdered
    Indigenous Persons.

<!-- -->

-   **Creates Jobs in Tribal Communities Building Clean Energy
    Infrastructure.** The Budget invests $4.5 billion in clean energy
    across America, bringing jobs to rural communities and cities,
    leaving no one behind. The Budget supports clean energy workforce
    development and sustainable infrastructure projects across the
    country, including $1.8 billion to weatherize and retrofit
    low-income Americans’ homes and $83 million to electrify Tribal
    homes and transition Tribal Colleges and Universities to renewable
    energy.  

<!-- -->

-   **Advances Environmental Justice in Indian Country.** The
    Administration continues to prioritize efforts to deliver
    environmental justice in Tribal communities across the United
    States, including meeting the President’s Justice40 Initiative to
    ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of Federal
    investments in climate and clean energy reach disadvantaged
    communities, including rural and Tribal communities. The Budget
    bolsters these efforts by investing nearly $1.8 billion at EPA
    across numerous programs that will support securing environmental
    justice for communities that bear the brunt of toxic pollution and
    climate change. In addition, through the Army Corps of Engineers,
    the Budget provides $35 million to help disadvantaged and Tribal
    communities address their water resources challenges through
    technical and planning assistance, $13 million for the Tribal
    Partnership program, and $58 million to support Tribal access to
    legally recognized historic fishing areas.

<!-- -->

-   **Improves College Affordability and Expands Institutional Capacity
    for Tribal Colleges and Universities.** To help low- and
    middle-income students overcome financial barriers to postsecondary
    education, including students across Indian Country, the Budget
    proposes to increase the discretionary maximum Pell Grant by
    $500—helping more than 6.8 million students pay for college,
    building on successful bipartisan efforts to increase the maximum
    Pell Grant award by $900 over the past two years, and laying out a
    path to double the award by 2029. The Budget also invests mandatory
    and discretionary funding to expand free community college, and
    provides mandatory funding for two years of subsidized tuition for
    students from families earning less than $125,000 enrolled in a
    participating four-year Historically Black College or University
    (HBCU), Tribally-Controlled College or University (TCCU), or
    Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). Additionally, the Budget
    increases institutional capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, and
    low-resourced institutions, including community colleges, by
    providing an increase of $429 million above the 2023 enacted level.
    This significant funding includes $350 million for four-year HBCUs,
    TCCUs, and MSIs to expand research and development infrastructure at
    these institutions.

-   **Prioritizes Efforts to End Gender-Based Violence.** The Budget
    proposes $1 billion to support implementation of programs through
    the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA), which was recently
    reauthorized and strengthened in 2022. The Budget supports
    substantial increases for longstanding VAWA programs, including key
    investments in legal assistance for victims, transitional housing,
    and sexual assault services, including the Tribal Sexual Assault
    Services Program. The Budget will increase funding for the Tribal
    Governments Program and strongly supports underserved and Tribal
    communities by providing $35 million for culturally-speciﬁc
    services, $10 million for underserved populations, $15 million to
    assist enforcement of Tribal special domestic violence jurisdiction,
    and $3 million to support Tribal Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys.
    The Budget also includes $519 million for the Family Violence
    Prevention and Services (FVPSA) program and the National Domestic
    Violence Hotline to support domestic violence survivors—double the
    2023 enacted level.

<!-- -->

-   **Connects Indian Country to High-Speed, Affordable, and Reliable
    Internet.** The President is committed to ensuring that every
    American—including all of Indian Country—has access to high-speed
    internet. Installing high-speed internet creates high-paying union
    jobs and strengthens rural economies, which leads to higher property
    values, increased job and population growth, lower unemployment
    rates and new business formation. Reliable internet is also crucial
    for rural Americans to access healthcare services through
    telehealth. Building on the $2 billion for Tribal broadband grants
    at NTIA and the $2 billion rural broadband programs at USDA provided
    in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Budget provides $400
    million for USDA’s ReConnect program, which provides grants and
    loans to deploy broadband to unserved areas, especially Tribal
    areas. With the funding provided in BIL, USDA has provided nearly
    $548 million to people living and working across 21 States and
    Territories, which is expected to expand access to 43,189
    households.

<!-- -->

-   **Commits to Tribal Water Rights Settlements Funding.** Providing a
    stable, dedicated funding source for Indian water rights settlements
    is crucial to ensuring that Tribal communities have safe, reliable
    water supplies to improve public and environmental health and
    support economic opportunity. To build on investments in the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Budget provides $2.8 billion in
    mandatory funding to the Indian Water Rights Settlement Completion
    Fund, with $2.5 billion to cover the costs of enacted and future
    water rights settlements, and $340 million for operations and
    maintenance costs associated with enacted water settlements.

<!-- -->

-   **Supports Economic Opportunity in Rural and Tribal Communities.**
    The Budget provides $32 million to expand the Rural Partners Network
    (RPN), an all-of-government program led by USDA that partners with
    rural and Tribal communities to access resources and funding to
    create local jobs, build infrastructure, and support long-term
    economic stability on their own terms. Through RPN, USDA is hiring
    new full-time federal staff who are from the region to work hand in
    hand with RPN community leaders.

**These investments build on the Administration’s efforts to date to
uphold America’s trust and treaty responsibilities with Tribal
Nations:**

-   **Secured the Reauthorization of the Landmark Violence Against Women
    Act.** On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed into law the
    Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act, which expanded the
    recognition of special criminal jurisdiction of Tribal courts to
    cover non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse,
    stalking, sex trafficking, and assaults on Tribal law enforcement
    officers on Tribal lands; and supports the development of a pilot
    project to enhance access to safety for survivors in Alaska Native
    villages. The bipartisan funding bill the President signed in
    December 2022 included $700 million for the Violence Against Women
    Act, the highest funding level in history for the landmark law.

<!-- -->

-   **Provided the Most Support Ever for Tribal Communities.** Through
    the American Rescue Plan, the Administration invested $32 billion in
    Tribal Nations and Native communities, the largest single financial
    assistance investment to Tribal governments in history. The
    investments supported expanding healthcare, access to temporary
    housing, assistance, and supportive services to survivors of
    domestic and dating violence, as well as supplemental funding for
    the StrongHearts Native Helpline, and additional funding for
    services for sexual assault survivors. The President’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law is rebuilding Tribal roads, bridges and rails;
    expanding access to clean drinking water for Native communities;
    helping ensure every Native American has access to high-speed
    internet; tackling the climate crisis; advancing environmental
    justice; and investing in Tribal communities that have too often
    been left behind. It does so by investing more than $13 billion
    directly in Tribal communities across the country. The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law also makes Tribal communities eligible for
    billions more in much-needed investments. The Inflation Reduction
    Act takes the most aggressive action on climate and clean energy in
    American history – and it does so by providing funding specifically
    for Tribes to plan for and adapt to climate change, mitigate
    drought, support fisheries, and shift to clean energy production and
    use.

-   **Made Tribal Consultation an Administration Priority.** In his
    first days in office, the President issued a memorandum making it a
    priority of his Administration to make respect for Tribal
    sovereignty and self-governance, commitment to fulfilling Federal
    trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations, and regular,
    meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations cornerstones
    of Federal Indian policy. Since then, the Administration has been
    regularly meeting with Tribal Nations on a range of Administration
    priorities, from implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
    drafting the President’s Budget. To further strengthen consultation
    as a priority, at the 2022 Tribal Nations Summit, the President
    established uniform standards for conducting Tribal consultations
    across all agencies – and required annual training for all Federal
    agency staff working with Tribal Nations or on policies with Tribal
    implications. The Budget also proposes $20 million for the Economic
    Development Administration within the Department of Commerce to
    advance the agency’s commitment to increase outreach and support for
    Indigenous communities, with a particular focus on supporting
    awareness and technical assistance for financial assistance
    opportunities.

-   **Implemented Tribal Co-Management and Co-Stewardship of Federal
    Lands and Waters.** President Biden has recognized the importance of
    increasing Tribal participation in the management and stewardship of
    federal lands and waters of significance to Tribal communities. In
    2021, USDA and DOI committed to Tribal co-stewardship, including
    through written co-stewardship agreements with Tribal Nations. In
    2022, they delivered on this commitment: in total, USDA Forest
    Service and DOI signed over 20 new co-stewardship agreements with
    Tribes to further co-stewardship goals. In late 2022, the Department
    of Commerce announced that it will formally join in these
    co-stewardship efforts. This commitment furthers a
    whole-of-government approach to co-stewardship, and ensures that
    additional agencies—like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration—will further co-stewardship goals in their management
    of waters, fisheries, and other resources of significance and value
    to Tribes.

<!-- -->

-   **Strengthened Implementation of the Buy Indian Act.** President
    Biden committed to strengthening implementation of the Buy Indian
    Act, which provides special federal contracting preferences for DOI
    and HHS to procure supplies, services, and construction from
    Native-owned businesses. The federal government is the largest
    purchaser of goods and services in the country, buying everything
    from software and building construction to financial and asset
    management—making its procurement a powerful tool to advance equity
    and build wealth in underserved communities. At the 2022 Tribal
    Nations Summit, DOI announced its goal of awarding 75% of contract
    dollars from Indian Affairs (including Bureau of Indian Affairs,
    Bureau of Indian Education, and Bureau of Trust Funds
    Administration) and 10% of contract dollars across the rest of the
    Department to Native-owned businesses, using its authority under the
    Buy Indian Act. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is announcing its
    goal of 20%. These targets will raise Buy Indian Act utilization
    rates at the agencies, result in hundreds of millions of dollars
    being spent in Indian Country, and advance the President’s effort to
    increase the share of government-wide contract dollars going to
    small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) by 50% by 2025.
