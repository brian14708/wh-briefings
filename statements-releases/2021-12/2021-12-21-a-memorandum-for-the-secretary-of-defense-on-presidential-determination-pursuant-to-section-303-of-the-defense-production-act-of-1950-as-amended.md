title: A Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense on Presidential Determination Pursuant
  to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 303 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the “Act”) (50 U.S.C. 4533),
I hereby determine, pursuant to section 303(a)(5) of the Act, that:  
  
(1)  Radiation-Hardened and Strategic Radiation-Hardened
Microelectronics, their components, and the manufacturing systems to
produce such systems and components are industrial resources, materials,
or critical technology items essential to the national defense;

\(2\)  without Presidential action under section 303 of the Act, United
States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability
for the needed industrial resource, material, or critical technology
item in a timely manner; and

\(3\)  purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to
section 303 of the Act are the most cost-effective, expedient, and
practical alternative method for meeting the need.

Pursuant to section 303(a)(7)(B) of the Act, I find that action to
expand the domestic production capability for Radiation-Hardened and
Strategic Radiation-Hardened Microelectronics is necessary to avert an
industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall that would
severely impair national defense capability.  Therefore, I waive the
requirements of section 303(a)(l)-(a)(6) of the Act for the purpose of
expanding the domestic production capability for these supply chains.  
  
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the
*Federal Register*.  
  

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
