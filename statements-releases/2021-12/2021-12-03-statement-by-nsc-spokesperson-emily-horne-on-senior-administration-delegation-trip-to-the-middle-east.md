Advisor to the Secretary of State for Global Energy Security Amos

The purpose of this trip was to discuss a range of economic issues
including trade and investment, infrastructure, climate change and
sustainability goals. They also spoke about areas where the United
States can partner to invest in the clean energy future and find ways to
further collaborate to build a 21stcentury clean energy architecture,
including by potentially working together on global infrastructure
development, consistent with the Biden Administrationâ€™s commitment to
meeting the infrastructure needs of the developing world through the
Build Back Better World initiative. The delegation met with a range of
senior government officials in each country and agreed to follow up on
the issues discussed.
