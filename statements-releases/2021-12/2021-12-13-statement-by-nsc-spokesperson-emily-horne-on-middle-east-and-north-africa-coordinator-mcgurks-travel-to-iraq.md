Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Middle East
and North Africa Brett McGurk completed a two day visit to Iraq where he
consulted with a range of political and security leaders. In Baghdad,
McGurk met with President Barham Salih, Prime Minister
Mustafa al-Kadhimi, and former Speaker Mohammed al-Halbusi.  In Erbil,
McGurk met with President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Nechirvan
Barzani and other senior leaders. McGurk confirmed President Biden’s
commitment to the results of the Strategic Dialogue with the Government
of Iraq, underscoring that there are no longer U.S. forces serving in a
combat role in Iraq. This transition was made possible because of the
tremendous progress achieved by Iraqi Security Forces, including the
Peshmerga, in leading the fight against ISIS. Coalition forces remaining
in Iraq will be present at the invitation of the Government with a
mission limited to advising, assisting and enabling the Iraqi Security
Forces to ensure ISIS can never resurge. McGurk also congratulated the
Iraqi people on the centennial anniversary of the establishment of the
Iraqi State, and confirmed the United States’ long-term commitment to
Iraq under the Strategic Framework Agreement.
