title: "FACT SHEET: The National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking\_(NAP)"

Globally, an estimated [25 million
people](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_575479.pdf)
are subjected to human trafficking and forced labor, which is
responsible for an estimated $[150 billion
annually](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---declaration/documents/publication/wcms_243391.pdf)
in illicit profits.  It erodes the safety and health of our communities
and transportation networks, the security of our borders, the strength
of our economy, and the rule of law.  The Administration is committed to
keeping the fight to end human trafficking at the forefront of our
national security agenda by releasing the new [**National Action Plan to
Combat Human
Trafficking**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/National-Action-Plan-to-Combat-Human-Trafficking.pdf).   
  
***What Has Changed  
***  
Human trafficking disproportionately impacts some of the most vulnerable
and underserved members of our society.  The updated **National Action
Plan to Combat Human Trafficking** responds to this predatory behavior
by addressing the needs of underserved individuals, families, and
communities.  As such, it reflects the Administration’s commitments to
[gender and racial
equity](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01753/advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government)
by taking action against the systemic injustices that communities
experience, including underserved populations.  
  
The anti-trafficking efforts outlined in the National Action Plan are
directly linked to our broader efforts to address inequities for
marginalized groups.  These communities often experience overlapping
social and economic inequities, and individuals may suffer multiple
forms of abuse.  As a result, individuals from these communities may be
more vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking.  
  
The National Action Plan also reflects the Administration’s commitment
to workers’ rights and ending forced labor in global supply chains,
which the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated due, in part, to job
insecurity, supply chain disruptions, and exponential demand for
essential medical supplies and services.  The National Action Plan also
serves as an important component of advancing the Administration’s
priority of ensuring safe, orderly, and humane migration.  As we
continue to address the acute and long-term drivers of irregular
migration, we must ensure our legal immigration pathways provide safe
alternatives.  We must also reaffirm trust in the U.S. government’s
commitment to protect individuals who have experienced human
trafficking, including noncitizens.  
  
***What Remains Consistent***  
  
The **National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking** is grounded in
an integrated federal response to human trafficking.  It emphasizes the
importance of collaboration across government when investing resources
in anti-trafficking policies and programs.  Because human trafficking is
a complex issue that cuts across many federal agencies’ mandates, the
National Action Plan is focused on actions and directs resources to
where they are most needed.  The Action Plan also emphasizes
collaboration with state and local governments, the private sector, and
non-governmental partners.  
  
The Plan draws on survivor voices and recommendations over the years on
how to prevent human trafficking and provide the appropriate resources
to protect and respond to the needs of individuals who have experienced
human trafficking.  
  
Survivor engagement is critical for empowerment and establishing
effective victim-centered and trauma-informed anti-trafficking policies
and strategies. The National Action Plan emphasizes recommendations from
survivor-led groups, including the United States Advisory Council on
Human Trafficking, to include input from individuals with lived
experiences within our strategic responses.  
  
The National Action Plan retains a central focus on the foundational
pillars of U.S. and global anti-trafficking efforts – **prevention,
protection, prosecution, and partnerships:**  
  
**PREVENTION:** Strategic prevention programs are wide-ranging, from
educating vulnerable populations and mitigating risk factors to seeking
to prevent goods produced with forced labor from entering U.S. markets.

-   Enhance education and outreach efforts, including for at-risk
    populations.
-   Enhance community-coordinated responses to human trafficking.
-   Strengthen efforts to identify, prevent, and address human
    trafficking in global supply chains.
-   Build capacity to prevent the importation of goods produced with
    forced labor.
-   Address aspects of nonimmigrant visa programs that may facilitate
    the exploitation of visa applicants and visa holders.

**PROTECTION:** Protection encompasses the interventions, services, and
supports needed to protect and assist victims of human trafficking. 
Protection starts with robust outreach and proactive identification
efforts, and includes providing comprehensive victim services and
applying victim-centered, trauma-informed strategies.

-   Identify and engage with victims in a victim-centered,
    trauma-informed, and culturally competent manner.
-   Support survivor-informed interventions, in which survivors of
    trafficking are essential partners and help to improve service
    delivery and inform victim assistance policy decisions.
-   Seek to protect victims of human trafficking from incarceration,
    fines, or penalties for unlawful acts committed as a direct result
    of being subjected to trafficking.
-   Improve access to immigration benefits to help provide assistance to
    victims of human trafficking.
-   Expand and improve assistance to victims of human trafficking
    encountered by law enforcement agencies.
-   Seek financial remedies for victims of human trafficking.
-   Increase access to social services for victims of human trafficking
    to increase short- and long-term stability.

**PROSECUTION:** Prosecution involves holding individuals and entities
engaged in human trafficking accountable and dismantling human
trafficking networks.

-   Improve coordination among law enforcement to increase
    accountability for human trafficking.
-   Build capacity of Federal, state, local, Tribal and territorial law
    enforcement to investigate and prosecute human trafficking and its
    illicit proceeds using a trauma-informed, victim-centered approach.
-   Enhance efforts to bring traffickers to justice by deploying a broad
    range of tools, including, where appropriate, financial sanctions,
    federal contracting suspension and debarment, and travel
    restrictions.
-   Increase efforts to investigate and prosecute forced labor.

**PARTNERSHIPS:** Effectively combating human trafficking requires
collaboration to complement and support the other pillars of prevention,
protection, and prosecution. 

-   Deepen our understanding of human trafficking networks that
    primarily impact or operate in the United States.
-   Enhance information sharing to inform a strategic outcome.
-   Strengthen Federal anti-trafficking efforts through external
    partnerships, including with the private sector, civil society
    organizations, and survivor input.
-   Cooperate with allies, including trade partners, bilaterally and in
    regional and multilateral fora to address and combat human
    trafficking and forced labor.
-   Continuously reevaluate the authorities and resources of the U.S.
    Government to combat human trafficking.

“Human trafficking is an evil practice that contradicts who we are as
Americans and the rights we cherish. With this National Action Plan, we
reaffirm our commitment to preventing and punishing human trafficking in
all its forms and to addressing the social and economic conditions that
can create greater vulnerabilities for marginalized groups,” said
Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Liz
Sherwood-Randall.

We recognize and express our gratitude to the community leaders, service
providers, businesses, grassroots activists, and individuals with lived
experience of human trafficking across the United States and around the
world who continue to forge innovative anti-trafficking strategies and
push various forms of government to improve their response to human
trafficking.  This includes addressing the ways in which policies and
actions may have contributed to disparities that marginalize certain
communities, jeopardized safe, orderly, and humane migration, or
emboldened traffickers.  This Administration will continue to partner
with a growing cadre of interagency, civil society, and international
partners – to include those who have experienced human trafficking – to
improve our collective efforts to comprehensively address human
trafficking.
