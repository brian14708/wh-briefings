  \ Leader Harry\_Reid"

Harry Reid and I grew up on different sides of the country, but we came
from the same place where certain values run deep. Loyalty. Faith.
Resolve. Service.

During the two decades we served together in the United States Senate,
and the eight years we worked together while I served as Vice President,
Harry met the marker for what I’ve always believed is the most important
thing by which you can measure a person—their action and their word.

If Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word,
you could bank on it. That’s how he got things done for the good of the
country for decades.

Under his watch as Senate Majority Leader, Harry helped pass the
Recovery Act to prevent another Great Depression. He helped rescue the
American auto industry. He helped pass the Affordable Care Act and
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, ended Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, and ratified
the New Start Treaty.

Throughout his entire career in the Senate, he led battles over budgets,
fought to give our troops what they needed in battle and what they
earned and deserved upon their return home. He was a bulwark against
efforts to privatize Social Security. He was the champion who created
Nevada’s Great Basin National Park. And, he was a leader who believed
the Federal bench should reflect the diversity of America.

I’ve had the honor of serving with some of the all-time great Senate
Majority Leaders in our history. Harry Reid was one of them. And for
Harry, it wasn’t about power for power’s sake. It was about the power to
do right for the people.

A son of Searchlight, Nevada, Harry never forgot his humble roots. A
boxer, he never gave up a fight—whether in politics or even against
cancer. A great American, Harry looked at the challenges of the world
and believed it was within our capacity to do good, to do right, and to
do our part of perfecting the Union we all love.

But above all, Harry was first and foremost the devoted husband to his
dear Landra. Over six decades together, they built a remarkable family
with their children—Lana, Rory, Leif, Josh, and Key—and all of their
grandchildren and great-grandchild. Jill and I send our love and prayers
to Landra and the entire Reid family.

May God bless Harry Reid, a dear friend and a giant of our history.
