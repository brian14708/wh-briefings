title: "Statement by President Joe Biden On the FDA Emergency Authorization\_of the\
  \ Pfizer COVID- \u2060 19 Antiviral Treatment"
---
 
We received good news today in our fight against COVID-19. The Food and
Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization of the Pfizer
antiviral pill, a promising new treatment option that will significantly
reduce hospitalization and death as we battle the more transmissible
Omicron variant.    
   
With today’s action, we add the first-ever oral treatment to our
nation’s medicine cabinet and take a significant step forward in our
path out of the pandemic.    
   
As soon as emerging science showed the promise of this antiviral, we
acted quickly and aggressively to pre-purchase 10 million treatment
courses – more than any other country in the world.  
   
Recognizing that this pill takes time to make given the complex
scientific process, production will ramp up in the months ahead. We will
have over 250,000 treatment courses available to us in January and we
will be working with states to ensure those are being distributed
equitably and fairly and that our hardest-hit communities are reached.  
   
Today’s action is a testament to the power of science and the result of
American innovation and ingenuity. As Pfizer works to produce these
treatments as quickly as possible, we will work closely with them and
provide any resource needed, including using the Defense Production Act
if warranted.  
   
Even in the face of the more transmissible Omicron variant, America is
more prepared than ever to fight this virus. We have widespread
vaccination and boosters, testing, and now another effective treatment
option that will help us save lives and further reduce the impact of
COVID-19 on our country.
