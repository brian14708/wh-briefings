National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with National
Security Advisors, Foreign Ministers, and other officials from the
Bucharest Nine (B9) group of our eastern flank NATO Allies.  Mr.
Sullivan briefed on the latest U.S. engagements with Russian officials
and consulted his counterparts on issues of importance to Transatlantic
security.  Mr. Sullivan and his counterparts all underscored the need
for Russia to take immediate steps to deescalate the situation at its
border with Ukraine.  Mr. Sullivan affirmed the U.S. commitment to
continued close coordination, noting that our unity with Allies and
partners is our greatest strength and that we will not make any
decisions related to their security without them.  All
participants emphasized their commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and
territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression.  
  
The Bucharest Nine members are Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia.
