title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Black People and Communities Across the\_Country"
---
 
From the first day in office and every day since, the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken a historic approach to advancing racial equity,
including directing every agency across the whole of the federal
government to address the lasting impacts of systemic racism on Black
communities. For generations, entrenched disparities in our society and
economy, at times facilitated by the federal government, have made it
harder for Black Americans to have a fair shot at the American dream.
Centuries of injustice and decades of disinvestment in Black communities
not only undermine the American promise of equal opportunity, but also
keep our entire nation from reaching its potential.

Nearly one year in, the Administration has delivered real and lasting
change for Black Americans.

**Economic Opportunity for Black Families and Communities.** By signing
into law the historic American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and implementing robust regulatory reform, President
Biden has helped create new economic opportunities for Black Americans
and made long overdue investments in Black communities. The ARP has
expanded access to wealth creation through small business ownership in
Black communities, and President Biden has directed agencies to increase
the share of federal contracting from small disadvantaged businesses,
including Black-owned businesses, by over 50% by 2025. Under President
Biden, federal agencies are now working to ensure that projects proposed
for federal funding are reviewed for disparate impacts before they are
awarded and that federal funding does not go to grant applicants with a
record of racial discrimination. These transformative policies and
programs include:

-   ***Providing Immediate Relief to Black People and Families through
    the American Rescue Plan**.*** The
    [ARP](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/American-Rescue-Plan-Fact-Sheet.pdf)
    provides cash relief directly to low- and middle-income Americans,
    and has cut Black child poverty by
    [30.2%](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/monthly-poverty-october-2021),
    lifting more than 1 million Black children out of poverty in October
    alone. In addition, the ARP increased Supplemental Nutrition
    Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by 15% through September 2021.
    Through the ARP, the President has [reduced food insecurity in Black
    households](https://www.cbpp.org/blog/after-child-tax-credit-payments-begin-many-more-families-have-enough-to-eat)
    – which had been double the white household rate – between
    one-fourth and one-third since early July.
-   ***Reversing Decades of Disinvestment Through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law.*** For years, politicians have talked about
    investing in our national infrastructure, but up until now they have
    failed to follow through. The lack of investment has fallen most
    heavily on Black and other communities of color. The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law will replace lead pipes, increase access to
    good-paying jobs, expand affordable high-speed internet, reliable
    public transit, clean drinking water, reconnect Black neighborhoods
    divided by legacy highway infrastructure and other resources to
    finally give Black communities a fair shot at the American Dream.
    -   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law permanently authorizes the
        Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) for the first time
        since its inception and elevates the agency head to the position
        of Under Secretary, granting the agency expanded power to
        support Black and other minority-owned businesses. The
        President’s Build Back Better Act would supercharge MBDA by
        funding it at $1.6 billion through 2029.

    <!-- -->

    -   EPA announced that it will allocate [$2.9
        billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/12/16/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/)
        in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to states, Tribes, and
        territories for lead service line replacement in 2022. The 2022
        allocation is the first of five years of nearly $15 billion in
        dedicated EPA funding for lead service lines that states will
        receive through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. EPA will
        encourage states to use these funds to advance proactive lead
        line replacement programs with a particular focus on
        disadvantaged communities. Moving forward, EPA will prioritize
        communities with the highest lead levels and those with
        environmental justice concerns.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers the largest
        investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by
        cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned
        mine land, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. More than one
        in four Black Americans live within 3 miles of a [Superfund
        site](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-advances-environmental-justice/)–
        a higher percentage than for Americans overall. No community
        deserves to have contamination near where they live, work, play,
        pray, and go to school.
-   ***Leveraging Federal Procurement to Narrow the Racial Wealth Gap
    for Black Entrepreneurs and Families.*** Recognizing that the
    federal government spends more than $650 billion each year on
    purchasing goods and services, President Biden has directed agencies
    to use federal purchasing power to grow federal contracting with
    small disadvantaged businesses, including Black-owned businesses, by
    50%, translating to an additional $100 billion over five years, and
    helping more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams. The
    Administration recently
    [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-reforms-to-increase-equity-and-level-the-playing-field-for-underserved-small-business-owners/)
    reforms to the federal procurement process to meet the President’s
    ambitious target and deliver new opportunities for Black owned and
    other small disadvantaged businesses.
-   ***Extending a Lifeline to Struggling Small Businesses.*** The
    American Rescue Plan provided emergency grants, lending, and
    investment to hard-hit small businesses – including Black businesses
    – so they can rehire and retain workers and purchase the health and
    sanitation equipment they need to keep workers safe. This includes a
    Small Business Opportunity Fund to provide growth capital to main
    street small businesses in economically disadvantaged areas,
    including minority-owned businesses.
-   ***Ensuring Black Homeowners Get Full Value for their Homes.*** In
    June, President Biden directed the launch of a first-of-its-kind
    interagency effort to address inequity in home appraisals and
    conduct rulemaking to aggressively combat housing discrimination.
    The effort, led by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD) Secretary Marcia Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice,
    is developing a set of policy recommendations and actions for
    President Biden to redress racial bias in home appraisals.
-   ***Protecting Black Americans’ Access to Housing by Combating
    Housing Discrimination.*** Following President Biden’s Presidential
    Memorandum directing his Administration to address racial
    discrimination in the housing market, HUD published a rule in the
    Federal Register entitled “Restoring Affirmatively Furthering Fair
    Housing Definitions and Certifications” that requires HUD funding
    recipients to complete an assessment of fair housing issues,
    identify fair housing priorities and goals, and then commit to
    meaningful actions to meet those goals and remedy identified issues.
-   ***Helping Black Americans Stay in their Homes.*** President Biden’s
    American Rescue Plan has helped Americans stay in their homes by
    providing emergency aid to cover back rent. In addition, the ARP
    helps struggling homeowners catch up with their mortgage payments
    and utility costs through the Homeowners Assistance Fund. And, it
    provided additional funding for families and individuals who are
    recovering from or at risk of homelessness.
-   ***Assisting Black Land Owners in Resolving Title Issues.*** An
    estimated 60% of Black-owned land in the South is heirs’
    property—property that passes through inheritance without a will and
    that, as a result, has historically rendered owners ineligible for
    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including lending.
    In July, the USDA rolled out the Heirs’ Property Relending Program,
    which primarily aids underserved communities, including Black
    Americans. The new program provides funds to assist heirs in
    resolving ownership and succession issues on farmland with multiple
    owners.
-   ***Dismantling Barriers to Accessing USDA Programs and Services.***
    The ARP provides funding for USDA to establish one or more equity
    commissions to address historical discrimination and disparities in
    the agricultural sector. In September, USDA began requesting
    nominations for membership on the Equity Commission Advisory
    Committee and Equity Commission Subcommittee on Agriculture. The
    Equity Commission Advisory Committee will advise the Secretary of
    Agriculture by identifying USDA programs, policies, systems,
    structures, and practices that contribute to barriers to inclusion
    or access, systemic discrimination, or exacerbate or perpetuate
    racial, economic, health and social disparities.
-   ***Ensuring that Federal Grants Don’t Support Discriminatory
    Activities**.*** In June, the Department of Transportation (DOT)
    [issued an
    Order](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/Final-for-OST-C-210312-002-signed.pdf)
    requiring its offices to review the potential discriminatory impact
    of grantees’ proposed activities before awarding federal funds.
    Under the Order, the agency won’t award federal financial assistance
    unless and until the agency determines that the activities will not
    be discriminatory in intent or effect.****
-   ***Improving the Customer Experience and Service Delivery.*** This
    week, President Biden signed the Transforming Federal Customer
    Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government
    [*Executive
    Order*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/)
    – a commitment from federal agencies to remove red tape on critical
    government services like claiming retirement benefits or filing
    taxes and streamline and increase access to these services for all
    Americans.

**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity in K-12 Schools and an
Education Beyond High School.** As we continue to recover from the
COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden has delivered the support necessary
to enable every school to [safely
reopen](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/02/fact-sheet-reopening-schools-and-rebuilding-with-equity/#:~:text=The%20President%20made%20clear%20on%20Day%20One%20of,Services%20to%20safely%20reopen%20schools%20for%20in-person%20instruction)
for full-time, in-person instruction; accelerate academic achievement;
address the mental health needs of students; and build school
communities where all students feel they belong. At the same time,
President Biden has worked to ensure equitable access to high-quality
education for Black students. These policies and programs include:

-   ***Historic Investments to Safely Reopen Schools and Address the
    Needs of Students.*** The ARP provided $130 billion to help
    elementary and secondary schools safely reopen and address the
    academic, social and emotional and mental health needs of all
    students, with funding set-aside to address the needs of students
    disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including Black
    students. The Administration’s efforts to encourage all schools to
    adopt the CDC’s recommendations on masking, vaccinations and other
    COVID-19 protocols, have been particularly critical to the safe
    reopening of schools in Black communities hit hard by COVID-19. In
    addition to funding the implementation of COVID-19 protocols, these
    funds are being used to hire counselors and social workers, provide
    tutors, establish and expand summer and after-school programming,
    and provide a wide range of supports that address the needs of Black
    students.
-   ***Protecting Students from Funding Cuts.*** The ARP’s Elementary
    and Secondary School Emergency Relief program includes a first of
    its kind maintenance of equity requirement to ensure that
    high-poverty school districts and schools are protected in the event
    of future funding cuts***.*** The Department of Education has
    provided resources and technical assistance to states and school
    districts as they implement this new requirement, which will ensure
    that school districts and schools serving a large share of students
    from low-income backgrounds will not experience disproportionate
    cuts, and that school districts with the highest poverty levels do
    not experience any decrease in state per-pupil funding below their
    pre-pandemic level.
-   ***Historic Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities
    (HBCUs).*** Since January, the Biden-Harris Administration has
    delivered a historic $5.8 billion cumulative investment in and
    support for HBCUs, including:
    -   The ARP and other pandemic relief programs have provided
        approximately $3.7 billion to HBCUs since President Biden took
        office.

    <!-- -->

    -   Additionally, in April, the Department of Education provided
        approximately $1.6 billion in debt relief to 45 HBCUs, including
        13 public institutions and 32 private institutions.

    <!-- -->

    -   In July and August, the Department of Education awarded more
        than $500 million in grant funding to HBCUs for academic
        capacity-building and fiscal stability.

    <!-- -->

    -   President Biden signed an [Executive
        Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/03/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-through-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/)
        establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational
        Equity, Opportunity, and Excellence through HBCUs, which will
        create a government-wide approach to support the needs of HBCUs
        and the communities they serve and eliminate systemic barriers
        impeding HBCU participation in Federal programs.

    <!-- -->

    -   During HBCU week, President Biden named Tony Allen, President of
        Delaware State University, as Chair of the President’s Board of
        Advisors on HBCUs. The Board, established by the Carter
        Administration, is meant to advance the goals of the HBCU
        Initiative.

**Improving Health Outcomes for Black Communities.** Facing a once-in a
century pandemic that highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing racial
disparities in our health care system, President Biden took swift action
to promote better health access and outcomes for Black families. The ARP
lowered health care costs for millions of lower- and middle-income Black
families and invested billions to promote equitable vaccine distribution
and provide critical supplies to stop the spread of COVID-19. These
policies and programs include:

-   ***Lowering Health Care Costs.*** Millions of lower- and
    middle-income Black families enrolled in health insurance
    marketplaces saw their premiums lowered or eliminated as a result of
    the ARP and will continue to benefit through the end of 2022.
    Nationwide, existing consumers saved an average of
    [$67](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2021-sep-final-enrollment-report.pdf)
    per person per month on their premiums. These monthly savings were
    even higher in 20 states and the District of Columbia where existing
    consumers saved, on average, over $75 per month. In addition,
    millions of uninsured Americans gained coverage during the
    Administration’s 2021 Special Enrollment Period (SEP). Of those
    newly signing up for HealthCare.gov coverage who attested to race or
    ethnicity, 15% were Black Americans, up over 60% from 2019.
-   ***Improving Black Maternal Health.*** The Administration is also
    committed to improving maternal health outcomes, including
    addressing the unacceptably high rates of maternal mortality and
    morbidity that disproportionately impact Black mothers and families.
    In addition, the President’s FY 22 budget request includes more than
    $200 million to bolster Maternal Mortality Review Committees,
    implement implicit bias training for health care providers, and
    create State pregnancy medical home programs, among other actions.
    It also includes $6 billion for the critical Special Supplemental
    Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program to
    help vulnerable families put healthy food on the table and address
    racial disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.
    -   The Administration has also approved a number of Medicaid
        demonstrations to expand postpartum coverage, including in
        Illinois, Virginia, and New Jersey; these states will provide
        full Medicaid benefits for 12 months postpartum (other states
        have expanded to six months postpartum coverage or expanded
        coverage to 10 months for those with substance use disorders).
        The ARP gives states an easier pathway to extend coverage for
        pregnant women from 60 days to 12 months postpartum; the
        Administration is working to encourage all states to take up
        this option so women can get the care they need to stay healthy.

    <!-- -->

    -   Further, in December, Vice President Harris
        [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/07/fact-sheet-vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-call-to-action-to-reduce-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/)
        a nationwide call to action to both public and private sectors
        to improve health outcomes for Black mothers and their children.
        As part of this call to action, the Centers for Medicare &
        Medicaid Services issued new guidance to help states provide 12
        months (up from 60 days currently) of continuous postpartum
        coverage through their Medicaid programs. If every state adopted
        an extension — as required in the Build Back Better Act —then
        the number of Americans getting coverage for a full year
        postpartum would roughly double, extending coverage for an
        estimated 720,000 people in a given year. HHS also announced
        plans to create a new “Birthing Friendly” hospital designation,
        which would be the first-ever hospital quality designation by
        HHS specifically focused on maternity care.

    <!-- -->

    -   In April, President Biden issued the first ever [Presidential
        Proclamation on Black Maternal Health
        Week](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/13/a-proclamation-on-black-maternal-health-week-2021/),
        calling on all Americans to recognize the importance of
        addressing the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity.
-   ***Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response.*** Nationwide, Black
    people have died from COVID-19 at 1.4 times the rate of White
    people. The ARP provided $160 billion for the vaccines, tests,
    personal protective equipment, and public health workforce needed to
    address the spread of COVID-19, an investment that is helping to
    drive down racial disparities in prevention and care. Due to the ARP
    and the President’s other investments in equitable access to the
    COVID-19 vaccine, multiple studies show that the gap in COVID
    vaccination rates in Black Americans compared to Whites and Latinos
    has closed. Data show that more than 70% of Black Americans, 73% of
    Latinos and 71% of White Americans have received at least one shot,
    compared to 56%, 57%, and 65%, respectively, in May. Additionally:
    -   FEMA surged resources to vaccinate all eligible Americans,
        including by standing up 500 vaccine sites in underserved
        communities. These emergency measures have helped deliver
        community-based and culturally competent care. In fact, over 50%
        of vaccines administered at the federally-run community
        vaccination centers went to Black Americans and other people of
        color, and more than 75% of people vaccinated at Community
        Health Centers are people of color.

    <!-- -->

    -   In January, President Biden
        [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/21/executive-order-ensuring-an-equitable-pandemic-response-and-recovery/)
        an [Executive
        Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/21/executive-order-ensuring-an-equitable-pandemic-response-and-recovery/)
        on Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery,
        creating a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to provide specific
        recommendations to the President for mitigating the health
        inequities caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and
        for preventing such inequities in the future. Since February,
        there have been over 300 interim recommendations that the task
        force has developed on topics including interpersonal stress
        linked to racism, addressing the behavioral health consequences
        of the pandemic in communities of color, and vaccine access and
        acceptance. Some recommendations have already been implemented
        by the Administration, and final recommendations are slated for
        release in October.

**Taking Strong Action to Reform Our Criminal Justice System.** From
investing in community violence interventions, to reforming law
enforcement, to stopping harmful prosecution and incarceration
practices, to supporting reentry, the Biden-Harris Administration has
taken concrete actions to reform the criminal justice system and root
out racial disparities. These policies and programs include:

-   ***Reforming Law Enforcement Practices.*** In September, the
    Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a ban on use of chokeholds and
    carotid restraints except where deadly force is necessary, and new
    restrictions on no-knock warrants—implementing reforms for federal
    law enforcement administratively that the President had called on
    Congress to enact nationwide through the George Floyd Justice in
    Police Act. The Department also implemented a new policy requiring
    federal agents to wear body cameras when executing search warrants
    and pre-planned arrests. These changes make real the policy reform
    the country must undertake to prevent tragic killings like those of
    George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the future. The directives apply
    to all agencies overseen by the Department including the FBI, Drug
    Enforcement Agency, and U.S. Marshal’s Service. In September, the
    Department of Homeland Security announced the formation of the Law
    Enforcement Coordination Council (LECC)—the Department’s first
    unified law enforcement coordination body, chaired by the
    Secretary—to comprehensively review and revise its policies and
    training on use of force, compliance with civil rights and privacy
    interests, and other matters. In July, the Department of the
    Interior created a task force to study and recommend reforms for its
    law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Park Police.
-   ***Ensuring Constitutional Policing.*** The Department of Justice
    (DOJ) rescinded guidance issued in the previous Administration that
    curtailed the use of consent decrees, including within
    investigations into patterns or practices of discrimination and
    misconduct by police departments. Pattern and practice
    investigations and consent decrees are critical tools to promote
    constitutional policing in jurisdictions where reform is warranted.
-   ***Improving Prosecutorial Guidance to Prevent Unduly Harsh
    Sentencing.*** The DOJ withdrew guidance issued in the previous
    Administration that required prosecutors to always charge the
    harshest sentences, replacing it with guidance that restored
    discretion to make decisions about charging, plea agreements, and
    advocacy at sentencing based on an individualized assessment of
    relevant facts.
-   ***Supporting Legislation to Reform Racist Disparities in
    Sentencing.*** The President endorsed the EQUAL Act, which would
    eliminate the racist crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity once
    and for all and make the change fully retroactive.
-   ***Executive Order Limiting Use of Private Prisons.*** The President
    ordered DOJ not to renew contracts for privately-operated criminal
    detention facilities, covering the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and U.S.
    Marshals Service (USMS). When completed, this will result in up to
    14,000 people in BOP custody and 10,000 people in USMS custody being
    moved out of private prisons. To date, the administration has closed
    a total of 7 contracts, resulting in more than 4,000 people moved
    out of private prisons.
-   ***Support for Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs.***
    Black boys and young men ages 15-34 make up 2% of the population but
    are 37% of homicide victims, and homicide is the leading cause of
    death for Black men under the age of 45. Until this Administration,
    however, CVI programs like violence interrupters and hospital-based
    programs, which are demonstrated to reduce violence by up to 60%,
    have been badly underfunded. Under President Biden, the Treasury
    Department and Education Department issued guidance stating that CVI
    programs are eligible uses of American Rescue Plan funds—both the
    $350 billion in aid to state, Tribal, and local governments and the
    $122 billion to school districts. The Administration pivoted 26
    existing grant programs across five agencies to support CVI. And
    President Biden continues to seek $5 billion in dedicated funding
    for CVI programs through his Build Back Better legislation. These
    historic funds would help curtail the epidemic of gun violence that
    hits Black communities hardest.
-   ***Support for Reentry of Returning Citizens.*** In February,
    President Biden expanded access to Paycheck Protection Program loans
    by removing restrictions for entrepreneurs with certain past
    criminal records, bringing long overdue help to small businesses
    previously unable to access these funds. In June, the Department of
    Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly incarcerated adults and
    young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal
    justice system and connect with quality jobs. The President issued
    an Executive Order directing the Office of Personnel Management to
    evaluate the existence of any barriers that formerly incarcerated
    individuals face in accessing federal employment, and to expand
    federal employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated
    individuals. OPM provided its findings and a summary of actions to
    expand employment for this population to the President in October.
    Further, The Labor and Treasury Departments released new resources
    to help employers leverage tax credits and other federal programs to
    incentivize the hiring of formerly incarcerated persons. HUD
    clarified that returning citizens are eligible for the 70,000
    emergency housing vouchers created by the ARP. Further, President
    Biden’s Build Back Better Act includes an additional $1.6 billion of
    workforce development and job training funding to invest in re-entry
    employment efforts.
-   ***Addressing Domestic Violent Extremism.*** President Biden
    directed the U.S. government to assess the threat of domestic
    violent extremism in the United States. In January, Secretary of the
    Department of Defense (DOD) Lloyd J. Austin III ordered a DOD-wide
    stand down to discuss the problem of extremism in the ranks, and in
    April he established a countering extremism working group, directing
    DOD officials to review and update the definition of extremism
    contained in [DOD Instruction
    1325.06](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2567179/austin-orders-immediate-changes-to-combat-extremism-in-military/),
    and calling on the services to update transition instructions to
    prevent those leaving the military from being recruited by extremist
    groups. In March, the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence released the unclassified executive summary of the
    comprehensive assessment acknowledging that enduring domestic
    violent extremism motivations stem from biases against minority
    populations. In April, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
    Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ordered an internal review to root out
    white supremacy and extremism within DHS.

**Using Executive Authority to Protect Voting Rights, Democracy, and
Access to Justice.** These policies and programs include:

-   ***Signing Executive Order Promoting Access to Voter Registration
    and Voting.*** On the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Biden
    [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/)
    an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/)
    to leverage the resources of the federal government to provide
    information about the election process and increased access to voter
    registration opportunities. Agencies across the federal government
    have [announced
    steps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/28/fact-sheet-biden-administration-promotes-voter-participation-with-new-agency-steps/)
    they are taking to respond to the President’s call for an
    all-of-government action to enhance the ability of all eligible
    Americans to participate in our democracy, including the Centers for
    Medicare & Medicaid Services’ [recent
    commitment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/08/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-is-taking-action-to-restore-and-strengthen-american-democracy/)
    to make it easier for consumers using HealthCare.gov to connect to
    voter registration services.
-   ***Ensuring Compliance with Voting Rights Laws*.** The Department of
    Justice has taken a variety of steps to help protect the right to
    vote, including doubling the number of voting rights attorneys,
    taking steps to ensure compliance with voting rights statutes,
    launching a task force to combat the increase of threats against
    election officials and election workers, and issuing guidance on (1)
    the civil and criminal statutes that apply to post-election
    audits, (2) methods of voting, including early voting and voting by
    mail, and (3) the vote-dilution protections that apply to all
    jurisdictions under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as they
    engage in redistricting.
-   ***Reviewing Agency Practices to Promote Civil Rights Compliance.***
    In September, the DOJ launched a broad 90-day internal review to
    assess how it enforces prohibitions on racial discrimination by law
    enforcement agencies that receive federal funding, building on
    administration efforts to combat systemic racism in policing,
    prisons and courts.

-   ***Expanding Access to Justice***. To expand the promise of equal
    justice under law, the President
    [asked](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/18/memorandum-on-restoring-the-department-of-justices-access-to-justice-function-and-reinvigorating-the-white-house-legal-aid-interagency-roundtable/)
    the Attorney General to consider expanding the Department of
    Justice’s access to justice work. In October, the Attorney
    General announced the reestablishment of the Office for Access to
    Justice as a standalone component within the Justice Department
    dedicated to improving the federal government’s understanding of and
    capacity to address the most urgent legal needs of communities
    across America. The President also reinvigorated the White House
    Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable to prioritize and expand access to
    legal services and federal programs, including in the areas of
    criminal indigent defense, civil legal aid, and pro bono services.
-   ***Appointing and Confirming Black Judges***. President Biden is
    committed to ensuring that the judiciary is filled with highly
    qualified individuals who bring both personal and professional
    diversity to the bench. Since January, President Biden has nominated
    a total of 73 individuals for federal judgeships, 20 of whom are
    African American, and 13 individuals for local judgeships in
    Washington, D.C., 5 of whom are African American. Of the 31
    individuals who have been confirmed to positions on federal courts,
    11 are African American.

**President Biden has reduced barriers for Black communities facing
natural disasters.** In
[September](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/09/02/dhs-announces-changes-individual-assistance-policies-advance-equity-disaster),
FEMA implemented policy changes to reduce barriers that contributed to
disparities experienced by Black Americans through programs that provide
individual assistance to disaster survivors. These included changes to
FEMA policies to make it easier for people living on heirs’ property –
which is estimated to be the majority of Black-owned land in the South –
to apply for disaster aid.

**The President is not done.** The Biden-Harris Administration will
continue promoting equity and racial justice, including for Black
Americans, as we build back better. These policies and programs include:

-   ***President Biden’s Proposed Build Back Better Plan Will Promote
    Investment and Economic Opportunity in Black Communities.***
    President Biden’s Build Back Better Act will reverse decades of
    disinvestment and wealth extraction in Black communities, other
    communities of color and rural communities, and drive good jobs and
    opportunity to every corner of the country, making long needed,
    once-in-a-generation investments in underserved communities: It will
    make universal preschool a reality, reduce housing costs and
    increase the supply of affordable housing, lower health care costs,
    improve maternal health, expand coverage to millions of low-income
    Americans by closing the Medicaid coverage gap, and extend the ARP’s
    historic child tax credit expansion, facilitating a 29% reduction in
    Black poverty relative to the projected poverty rate for 2022. The
    Build Back Better Plan also includes a $3 billion investment focused
    on improving maternal health in this country.
-   ***Sustained Investment in HBCUs.*** President Biden’s Build Back
    Better Act provides sustained investments in HBCUs and their
    students. The bill provides $10 billion to HBCUs, Tribal Colleges
    and Universities (TCUs), and minority-serving institutions (MSIs).
    Of that total, $2 billion is dedicated specifically for HBCUs—a
    five-fold increase from the amounts HBCUs typically receive annually
    through existing funding streams to address a wide range of needs,
    including student financial aid, infrastructure upgrades, and campus
    services. HBCUs can compete for another $4 billion of the Build Back
    Better Act funds to support research and development programs.
    -   Additionally, President Biden’s FY22 budget request for the
        Department of Education includes a total of $807 million in
        discretionary funding to HBCUs, an increase of $72 million over
        last year’s funding level, which will substantially increase key
        HBCU funding streams to support research, infrastructure, and
        student support services, amongst other programming.
-   ***Transforming Public Education with Historic Funding Increases.***
    Black students are less likely to have access to high-quality
    preschool, resulting in disparate outcomes before students even
    enter kindergarten. They are more likely to attend rundown and
    unsafe schools. They are taught by less experienced teachers. And
    they have lower college completion rates and higher student loan
    debt burdens than their white peers. The President has outlined a
    [far-reaching
    agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/23/fact-sheet-how-the-biden-harris-administration-is-advancing-educational-equity/)
    that will transform public education, advancing equity for Black
    students and prepare all students to succeed.
    -   The President’s proposed Build Back Better Plan would provide
        universal, high-quality preschool for all three- and
        four-year-olds; invest in school infrastructure so all students
        learn in safe and healthy school buildings with the technology
        and labs they need to prepare for the jobs of the future; and
        strengthen and diversity the teacher pipeline.

    <!-- -->

    -   The President’s FY22 budget proposal includes a $20 billion
        increase in Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title
        I funding, which would more than double funds available under
        the flagship program for students in high-poverty schools, while
        providing meaningful incentives for states to address
        inequitable school funding systems and close gaps in access to
        rigorous coursework, like advanced math and science courses.
        Over 80% of Black students attend a Title I-eligible school, and
        there is a $23 billion annual funding gap between majority white
        and majority non-white school districts.
    -   Through the President’s Build Back Better Act and the FY22
        budget, the President has requested a $950 increase to the
        maximum Pell Grant for students enrolled in public and private
        non-profit colleges, benefitting [75% of HBCU
        students](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2021/11/05/what-does-the-build-back-better-framework-mean-for-bipoc-communities/)
        who receive them.
-   ***Unwavering Support for the Fundamental and Sacred Right to
    Vote.*** President Biden has firmly and repeatedly called for
    Congress to enact the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and
    the Freedom to Vote Act, which would together set national standards
    that make it easier to vote, and deliver new tools to prevent voting
    discrimination. And the President will continue to use every tool at
    his disposal to protect the right to vote in free, fair, and secure
    elections.
-   ***Addressing Police Misconduct.*** The President strongly supports
    the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. He is disappointed that
    legislation has not yet reached his desk, and he will not wait to
    advance meaningful police reform through executive action. The White
    House is currently consulting with the families of those killed in
    acts of police violence, civil rights groups, law enforcement, and
    others to determine further steps to advance police reform.
