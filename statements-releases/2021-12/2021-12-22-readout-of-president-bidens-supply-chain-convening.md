Today, President Biden held a meeting with members of his Cabinet,
National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, Port Envoy John Porcari,
and private sector leaders to discuss progress that has been made over
the last few months to lower costs for families by alleviating
bottlenecks that are rooted in the global pandemic. Less than one week
since the Administration announced its Trucking Action Plan, nearly 30
companies have reached out to start developing registered
apprenticeships—the gold standard of workforce training—and one company
has approved a new registered apprenticeship as of yesterday.

The President kicked off the meeting with remarks noting progress on
supply chains and that fears about empty shelves during holiday shopping
season have failed to materialize amidst record demand for goods because
of strong collaboration between government, business leaders, and labor.
He noted progress the Administration has made in tackling gas prices and
how passing Build Back Better will reduce costs for families. The
President also thanked the participants for their work, saying he will
continue to partner with them on addressing supply chain challenges.

The meeting first focused on ports and retail inventories. Envoy Porcari
noted the progress in moving containers at the Ports of Los Angeles and
Long Beach as well as the Administration’s investment in pop-up
container yards that are helping reduce congestion at the Port of
Savannah, the country’s fourth largest container port. Participants
noted that ports nationwide are working well. CEOs noted their efforts
to successfully stock shelves, move goods, and work toward 24/7
operations. They discussed the investments they made in their supply
chains to improve efficiency and throughput, and commended their
workforce for handling record levels of goods. They welcomed the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and noted that it will help reposition the
U.S. to be more competitive in global trade and draw in more private
sector investment in the supply chain. Secretary Vilsack discussed the
work the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of
Transportation are doing to improve agricultural exports. Secretary
Raimondo noted the long-term solution is to make more goods in America,
and discussed the new investments being made in U.S. manufacturing.

The meeting also discussed the Task Force’s work on trucking.
Participants noted that trucking is the lifeblood of the supply chain,
and truckers were heroes throughout the pandemic moving the vaccines and
goods that people needed. Secretaries Walsh and Buttigieg discussed the
progress their agencies are making on implementing the Administration’s
90-day Trucking Action Plan to boost job quality and recruitment in
truck driving. The Department of Labor has reduced the red tape for
companies to join their Registered Apprenticeship program from two
months to two days. Trucking companies also discussed the potential to
bring recent veterans into the trucking industry, which can provide
solid, well-paying jobs.

*The New York Times* [reported
today](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/business/christmas-gifts-delivery-supply-chain.html)
that the vast majority of packages delivered by USPS, UPS, and FedEx
this holiday season have arrived on time or with minimal delays and that
delivery times are 26-40 percent faster than before the pandemic.

And this week, the Administration is announcing $230 million in Port
Infrastructure Development Grants—the only federal grant program wholly
dedicated to investments in port infrastructure. This is the latest step
in the [Port Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/09/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-action-plan-for-americas-ports-and-waterways/)
(PAP) announced in November, which accelerates investments in our ports,
waterways, and freight networks after passage of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Deal.
