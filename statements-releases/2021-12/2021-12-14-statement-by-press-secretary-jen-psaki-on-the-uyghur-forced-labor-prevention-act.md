title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention\_\
  Act"
---
 
The President welcomes the agreement by Congress on the bipartisan
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. We agree with Congress that action
can and must be taken to hold the People’s Republic of China accountable
for genocide and human rights abuses and to address forced labor in
Xinjiang. That is why the Administration has already taken concrete
measures including imposing visa restrictions, Global Magnitsky Act and
other financial sanctions, export controls, import restrictions, and the
release of a business advisory. The President also rallied the G7 to
commit to ensure all global supply chains are free from the use of
forced labor—including from Xinjiang. The Administration will work
closely with Congress to implement this bill to ensure global supply
chains are free of forced labor, while simultaneously working to
on-shore and third-shore key supply chains, including semiconductors and
clean energy.
