title: "Statement from Senior Advisor and Chief Spokesperson Symone Sanders on Staff\
  \ Member Close Contact to the Vice\_President"
---
 
It is in the public’s interest to know if any of the four principals
(President, Vice President, First Lady, and Second Gentleman) are
considered to have been in close contact with a White House official who
subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after that contact.
The criteria for what is considered a “close contact” with the
principals is determined by the White House Medical Unit, in line with
CDC guidance.  
  
On Wednesday morning, a staff member who staffed the Vice President
throughout the day Tuesday received a positive test result for COVID-19.
 Yesterday, Monday and every day last week, this staff member tested
negative for COVID-19. This staff member is fully vaccinated and boosted
and did not experience symptoms. Others who were in close contact with
this staff member are being contacted and will be advised to get tested
per CDC guidance.

The Vice President is tested on a regular basis. As a part of that
regular testing, the Vice President received an antigen test this
morning and tested negative.

Earlier today, after being notified of the staffer’s positive test, the
Vice President received a PCR test and tested negative. She will be
tested again on Friday then again on Monday per CDC guidance.  

As CDC guidance does not require fully vaccinated people to quarantine
after an exposure, the Vice President will continue with her daily
schedule. This evening, she will depart Joint Base Andrews for Los
Angeles where she and the Second Gentleman will remain through the New
Year.
