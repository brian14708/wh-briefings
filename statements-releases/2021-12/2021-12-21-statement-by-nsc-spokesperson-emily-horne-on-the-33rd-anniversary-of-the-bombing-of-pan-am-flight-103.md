title: Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on the 33rd Anniversary of the Bombing
  of Pan Am Flight 103
---
 
Today, the United States remembers the 270 innocent lives, including 190
Americans, lost 33 years ago in a brazen act of terrorism aboard Pan Am
Flight 103 in the skies over Lockerbie, Scotland. The victims included
35 Syracuse University students returning from studying abroad, spouses
heading home after business trips, parents traveling with their children
for the Christmas holiday, and Scottish families sitting down to dinner
in their homes. Each of these tragedies was a story that ended too
soon.  
Â   
As we honor the victims of Pan Am Flight 103, we thank our Scottish
partners for their continued pursuit of justice, and we remember the
families and friends who have continued fighting for the loved ones they
lost. Their courage and dedication remind us that there is no room in
this world for terror of any kind, and that we all must remain
persistent and vigilant in combating these evils, together.
