WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate
Sandra L. Thompson to serve as the Director of the Federal Housing
Finance Agency (FHFA).

FHFA was created by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 to
oversee Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System
and is responsible for oversight of the $7.2 trillion mortgage finance
market. Earlier this year, President Biden designated Sandra L. Thompson
the Acting Director of FHFA.

Thompson has over four decades of government experience in financial
regulation, risk management, and consumer protection. She has served as
the Deputy Director of the Agency’s Division of Housing Mission and
Goals (DHMG) since 2013. As DHMG Deputy Director, Thompson oversaw
FHFA’s housing and regulatory policy, capital policy, financial
analysis, fair lending, and all mission activities for Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Prior to joining FHFA,
Thompson worked at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), for
more than 23 years in a variety of leadership positions, most recently
as Director of the Division of Risk Management Supervision. During her
time at FDIC, Thompson led the Agency’s examination and enforcement
program for risk management and consumer protection at the height of the
financial crisis. She also led the FDIC’s outreach initiatives in
response to a crisis of consumer confidence in the banking system.

Thompson is a native of Chicago, a graduate of Howard University, and
has two adult sons.
