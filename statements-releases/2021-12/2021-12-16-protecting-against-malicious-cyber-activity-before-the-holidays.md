SUBJECT: Protecting Against Malicious Cyber Activity before the Holidays

DATE: December 16, 2021

The holidays are an opportunity to spend time with our loved ones and
enjoy some well-earned rest. Unfortunately, malicious cyber actors are
not taking a holiday – and they can ruin ours if we’re not prepared and
protected. Historically we have seen breaches around national holidays
because criminals know that security operations centers are often
short-staffed, delaying the discovery of intrusions. Beyond the
holidays, though, we’ve experienced numerous recent events that
highlight the strategic risks we all face because of the fragility of
digital infrastructure and the ever- present threat of those who would
use it for malicious purposes.

**There are specific steps that you, as leaders, can initiate now to
reduce the risk of your organizations during this time of heightened
risk and into the New Year.**

Below are some recommendations for actions you can take immediately to
have an incident-free holiday season.

**Ensuring a Cyber Safe and Secure Holiday Season**

In many cases criminals plan *and actually begin* an intrusion before
the holiday itself – they infiltrate a network and lie in wait for the
optimal time to launch an attack. It is therefore essential that you
convene your leadership team now to make your organization a harder
target for criminals.

*Here are some best practices that can be implemented immediately. We
recommend that you confirm with your IT teams that these are in place:*

-   **Updated Patching**. Criminals count on victims failing to patch
    their systems and usually take advantage of long-known and fixable
    vulnerabilities. Patching should be up-to-date, against all
    [known](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities)
    vulnerabilities.
-   **Know your Network:** Enable logs; pay attention; investigate
    quickly. Intrusions can be stopped before the impact. Secure
    organizations assume they will be compromised, but work to minimize
    the effect of a compromise.
-   **Change Passwords and Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
    Ask your IT staff how long it has been since employees changed their
    passwords. Many criminals use stolen credentials, so forcing a reset
    (with adequate length and complexity) before the holidays can deny
    malicious actors access to your systems. At the same time, confirm
    that your organization has implemented MFA and that it is required
    without exception. If you have MFA available, but are not requiring
    it, change that – require all staff to use the security technology
    that you have already acquired. MFA significantly reduces your risk
    from almost all opportunistic attempts to gain entry into key
    systems.
-   **Manage Schedules**. Review staffing plans for your IT and security
    teams to ensure you have sufficient holiday coverage. Similarly,
    identify those IT and security employees who are on 24/7 call in the
    event of a cybersecurity incident or ransomware attack. Minutes
    count in the event of an attack and any delays in response typically
    magnify the consequences of a successful attack. Having current,
    validated information and a plan to reach out is critical.
-   **Employee Awareness**. Conduct spear phishing and other exercises
    to raise employee awareness of common attacks. Reinforce the
    imperative to report computers or phones exhibiting any unusual
    behavior. Deny the criminals the initial entry into your systems
    that allows them to execute attacks over the holidays and beyond.
-   **Exercise Makes an Organization Healthy.** Exercise your incident
    response plan now, so that if the worst happens you can respond
    quickly to minimize the impact. Conducting rigorous security stress
    tests now also gives you time to make needed improvements or to
    develop a basic plan if you do not have one.
-   **Backup up your Data**. Confirm that you are backing up key data.
    Ask your IT staff to test the backup system, and verify that that
    these backups are offline and COMPLETELY out of the reach of
    criminals. Many attacks succeed simply because the organizational
    back-up strategy is incomplete or permits criminals access to the
    backed-up information.

Please encourage your IT and Security leadership to visit the websites
of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) and the
[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber) where they will find
technical information and other useful resources.

All of us can, and must, play a part to improve the Nation’s
cybersecurity. The U.S. government and the private sector have
accomplished much together in the past year, and we have much more to do
in 2022 and beyond.

Please accept our best wishes for a happy holiday season and a safe and
secure New Year.
