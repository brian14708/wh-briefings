*“In the face of the sustained and alarming challenges to democracy and
universal human rights around the world, more than ever, democracy needs
champions.”*

President Joe Biden, December 9, 2021

Today, President Biden opened the first-ever Summit for Democracy, a
forum for leaders from around the world to discuss the challenges and
opportunities facing democracies in the 21st century. As a core U.S.
Government commitment toward achieving the Summit’s objectives, today
President Biden announced the establishment of the **Presidential
Initiative for Democratic Renewal**, a landmark set of policy and
foreign assistance initiatives that build upon the U.S. Government’s
significant, ongoing work to bolster democracy and defend human rights
globally.

The United States has long worked to strengthen democracy and advance
respect for human rights. Not only is this the right thing to do, it is
in the United States’ national security interest, because strong,
rights-respecting democracies are more peaceful, prosperous, and stable.
Democracies also make stronger partners for the United States, as we
work together to address the world’s most pressing international
challenges, from combating the climate crisis to preventing the next
pandemic.

The Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal represents a
significant, targeted expansion of U.S. Government efforts to defend,
sustain, and grow democratic resilience with likeminded governmental and
non-governmental partners. In the coming year, the United States is
planning to provide up to **$424.4 million** toward the Presidential
Initiative, working with Congress and subject to the availability of
appropriations. These efforts will center on five areas of work crucial
to the functioning of transparent, accountable governance:

1.  Supporting Free and Independent Media
2.  Fighting Corruption
3.  Bolstering Democratic Reformers
4.  Advancing Technology for Democracy
5.  Defending Free and Fair Elections and Political Processes

**I. Supporting Free and Independent Media**

-   **Bolstering Independent Media.** Under the Presidential Initiative,
    USAID will provide up to $30 million to the **International Fund for
    Public Interest Media**, a new multi-donor fund designed to enhance
    the independence, development, and sustainability of independent
    media, especially in resource-poor and fragile settings.
    Additionally, USAID will provide up to $5 million to launch a
    **Media Viability Accelerator,** which will improve the financial
    viability of independent media outlets in both under-developed and
    more-developed media markets.

<!-- -->

-   **Protecting Journalists Physically, Digitally, and Legally.** To
    guard the essential work of journalism from spurious legal claims
    aiming to silence legitimate work, USAID will provide up to $9
    million to support a global **Defamation Defense Fund for
    Journalists**, which will offer liability coverage to investigative
    reporters and their organizations. In parallel, the State Department
    will provide up to $3.5 million to establish a **Journalism
    Protection Platform,** which will provide at-risk journalists with
    digital and physical security training, psychosocial care, legal
    aid, and other forms of assistance. And the U.S. Government will
    increase its engagement with the **Media Freedom Coalition**, an
    intergovernmental partnership working to advocate for media freedom
    and the safety of journalists worldwide.

**II. Fighting Corruption**

-   **Supporting Anti-corruption Change Agents.** To support and connect
    anti-corruption actors across civil society, media, academia, and
    labor organizations, USAID will provide up to $5 million to launch
    the **Empowering Anti-Corruption Change Agents Program**, which will
    promote protective measures for whistleblowers, civil society
    activists, journalists, and others at risk due to their
    anti-corruption work. The State Department, joined by other donors,
    will build on its support for the **Global Anti-Corruption
    Consortium (GACC)** by providing up to $6 million to enhance the
    GACC’s work to connect media and civil society organizations with
    one another, expose ill-gotten gains, and support legal or policy
    changes in support of anti-corruption objectives.

<!-- -->

-   **Curbing Corruption through Strategic and Regulatory Action.**
    Earlier this week, the U.S. Government unveiled its first-ever
    **United States Strategy on Countering Corruption**, which provides
    a blueprint for cracking down on corruption at home and abroad. In
    support of this strategy, the Treasury Department will enact
    regulations to **increase** **transparency in the U.S. real estate
    market** by establishing reporting requirements for those closest to
    real estate transactions. In parallel, the State Department, working
    with the Departments of Treasury and Justice, will provide up to
    $15.1 million to launch the **Democracies Against Safe Havens
    Initiative,** which will work to build the capacity of partner
    governments to deny corrupt actors the ability to hide ill-gotten
    gains through anti-money laundering measures, to encourage
    like-minded partners to adopt anti-corruption sanctions and visa
    restriction regimes, and to detect and disrupt complex corruption
    schemes.  
     
-   **Innovating and Partnering to Combat Corruption.** To identify
    novel approaches to address transnational corruption and its
    enablers, USAID will provide up to $15.7 million to launch the
    **Combating Transnational Corruption Grand Challenge**, a
    partnership platform to crowd-source innovative solutions from
    businesses, technologists, philanthropies, and other actors.

<!-- -->

-   **Strengthening Anti-Corruption Ecosystems.** To enhance partner
    countries’ ability to build resilience against kleptocracy and
    illicit finance, including by supporting beneficial ownership
    disclosure, strengthening government contracting and procurement
    regulations, and improving anti-corruption investigation and
    disruption efforts, USAID will provide up to $11.5 million to launch
    a **Global Accountability Program**. Additionally, to advance the
    fight against corruption at transitionary moments such as during
    political openings, USAID will provide up to $17.6 million for an
    **Anti-Corruption Response Fund**, and the State Department will
    provide up to $6.5 million to establish a **Global Initiative to
    Galvanize the Private Sector as Partners in Combatting Corruption**,
    to energize and institutionalize existing public sector
    anti-corruption engagement with the business community.

**III. Bolstering Democratic Reformers**

-   **Empowering Historically Marginalized Groups and Ensuring All Have
    a Say in Democracy.** To advance the civic and political leadership
    of women, USAID and the State Department will provide up to $33.5
    million to launch the **Advancing Women’s and Girls’ Civic and
    Political Leadership Initiative,** which will help facilitate the
    full and safe exercise of women’s rights and representation. The
    State Department will also provide up to $5 million to launch the
    **Global LGBTQI+ Inclusive Democracy and Empowerment (GLIDE) Fund,**
    a new program under the Global Equality Fund that will facilitate
    the participation and leadership of LGBTQI+ community members in
    democratic institutions.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Activists, Workers, and Reform-Minded Leaders.**
    Responding to the increased threat against human rights defenders
    and activists globally, the State Department will provide up to $10
    million for **Lifeline: Embattled CSOs Assistance Fund,** a
    multilateral initiative which supports civil society organizations
    under threat as a consequence of their democracy and human rights
    work. The State Department will also provide up to $1 million to
    establish the **Bridging Understanding, Integrity, and Legitimacy
    for Democracy (BUILD) Initiative,** which will lay the groundwork
    for providing career professionals in closed political spaces the
    skills and resources to navigate democratic openings when they
    occur. USAID will provide up to $15 million to launch the **Powered
    by the People** initiative, which will assist nonviolent social
    movements by increasing coordination through exchanges, seed grants,
    and engagement with younger pro-democracy actors. Additionally, the
    Departments of Labor and State, and USAID, will provide up to $122
    million to establish a **Multilateral Partnership for Organizing,
    Worker Empowerment, and Rights (M-POWER)**, which will help workers
    around the world claim their rights and improve wages and conditions
    by strengthening democratic and independent worker organizations and
    supporting labor law reform and enforcement.

**IV. Advancing Technology for Democracy**

-   **Advancing an Open, Interoperable, Reliable, and Secure Internet.**
    The United States embraces a vision of an Internet that is open,
    interoperable, reliable, and secure, and reaffirms our commitment to
    protecting and respecting human rights online and across the digital
    ecosystem. The use of digital technologies should reinforce, not
    weaken, democracy and respect for human rights; offer opportunities
    for innovation in the digital ecosystem, including businesses large
    and small; and maintain connections between societies. To achieve
    this vision and maintain a high level of security, privacy
    protection, stability, and resilience of the technical
    infrastructure of the Internet, the U.S. Government will work with
    partners to protect and fortify the multi-stakeholder system of
    Internet governance. As part of this effort, the United States will
    work to strengthen the **Freedom Online Coalition (FOC)**, a
    multi-stakeholder effort to support Internet freedom and promote
    human rights online. The U.S. Government will seek not only to
    expand FOC membership, but also to deepen the Coalition’s diplomatic
    efforts to address the challenges and opportunities of digital
    technologies.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding Digital Democracy Programming**. To assist partner
    countries in realizing the benefits of digital technologies that
    support democratic values and respect human rights, rather than
    undermining them, USAID will provide up to $20.3 million to build on
    **programming supporting open, secure, and inclusive digital
    ecosystems**. This programming will help governments enshrine
    democratic principles in their countries’ use, development, and
    governance of technology, while empowering civil society,
    technologists, and the private sector to encourage the same.

<!-- -->

-   **Advancing Democracy-Affirming Technologies.** To incentivize
    innovation in technologies that asymmetrically advantage democratic
    values and governance, the National Science Foundation, the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Open Technology Fund,
    alongside international partners, will provide up to $3.75 million
    for a series of **International Grand Challenges on
    Democracy-Affirming Technologies**. This series of prize
    competitions will focus on topics such as harnessing artificial
    intelligence for an open Internet and advancing and deploying
    privacy-preserving technologies.

<!-- -->

-   **Defending against Digital Authoritarianism.** To reduce the
    potential for human rights abuses enabled by some dual-use
    technologies, the U.S. Government and likeminded partners will
    launch an **Export Controls and Human Rights Initiative**, in which
    participating governments will work together to determine how export
    control tools could better monitor and, as appropriate, restrict the
    proliferation of such technologies. In parallel, to counter
    authoritarian censorship of the Internet, the State Department will
    provide up to $4 million to establish and seed a **Multilateral
    Surge and Sustain Fund for Anti-Censorship Technology,** which will
    enable the connection of more users to the uncensored Internet,
    sustain those connections in times of greatest need, and invite
    likeminded partners to contribute jointly.

  
**V. Defending Free and Fair Elections and Political Processes**

-   **Strengthening Electoral Integrity.** To advance electoral
    integrity globally, USAID will provide up to $2.5 million to launch
    a **Coalition for Securing Electoral Integrity**, which will bring
    together governmental and non-governmental partners within the
    international electoral integrity community to develop norms,
    guiding principles, and codes of conduct on prioritized electoral
    integrity issues, while promoting adherence to those basic
    standards.

<!-- -->

-   **Piloting and Scaling Innovative Approaches to Defend Democratic
    Elections.** As a complement to the Coalition for Securing Electoral
    Integrity, USAID will provide up to $17.5 million to establish a
    **Defending Democratic Elections Fund** to pilot, scale, and apply
    evidence-based responses to threats to electoral integrity and
    related political processes globally. This Fund will address issues
    such as cybersecurity; domestic and foreign electoral manipulation;
    electoral violence, including gender-based violence; illicit
    domestic and foreign political financing; election-related
    disinformation; and barriers to the political participation of
    marginalized populations.

Finally, as part of the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal,
the U.S. Government will launch two new cross-cutting rapid response
programs aimed at supporting the Summit for Democracy’s objectives.

-   **Demonstrating that** **Democracy Delivers.** To help countries
    experiencing a democratic transition demonstrate democracy’s
    tangible benefits, USAID will provide up to $55 million to launch
    **Partnerships for Democracy**. This new, global, and flexible
    funding mechanism will enable the U.S. Government to surge
    cross-sectoral assistance to reform-minded partner governments to
    assist them in delivering visible benefits to their populations in
    areas such as health care and education.

<!-- -->

-   **Advancing the Democratic Renewal Agenda.** To advance global
    democracy priorities that frequently intersect, such as
    strengthening rule of law, fighting corruption, bolstering civilian
    security, and promoting human rights, the State Department will
    provide up to $10 million to launch the **Fund for Democratic
    Renewal (FDR)**. This flexible, rapid-response fund will enable
    State Department bureaus and offices under the Under Secretary for
    Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights to respond
    collectively and collaboratively to support partners working on
    democracy’s front lines.
