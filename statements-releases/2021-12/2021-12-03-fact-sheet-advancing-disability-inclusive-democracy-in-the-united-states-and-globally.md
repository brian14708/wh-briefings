  \ and\_Globally"

When the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed 31 years ago,
it provided historic civil rights protections for disabled Americans.
Grounded in the four core outcomes of full participation, equal
opportunity, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency, the ADA
prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in many contexts of
American life: public accommodations, employment, transportation, and
community living. However, Americans with disabilities still face
barriers in fully participating in many aspects of their lives.

Today, on [International Day of Persons with
Disabilities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/02/a-proclamation-on-international-day-of-persons-with-disabilities-2021/),
the United States is partnering with other governments, civil society,
and experts across the globe to discuss disability inclusive democracy
around the world. [This
event](https://interactive.america.gov/disability-inclusive-democracy/),
which is being co-hosted by Norway and the United Kingdom, is a part of
the U.S. Summit for Democracy. The discussion will include how to
improve the accessibility of voting, increase support for disabled
political leaders, and expand civic engagement. 

The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken a number of steps to
develop a more disability inclusive democracy, including:

-   **Appointing U.S. Special Advisor on International Disability
    Rights.** President Biden appointed Sara Minkara to be the U.S.
    Special Advisor on International Disability Rights. As the
    senior-level disability human rights position at the State
    Department, the Special Advisor leads the U.S. comprehensive
    strategy to promote and protect the rights of persons with
    disabilities internationally and across the Department. Special
    Advisor Minkara was sworn in on November 8, 2021.

-   **Increasing Access to Democracy for Voters with Disabilities.** In
    March, President Biden signed Executive Order 14019 on Voting Access
    that takes significant steps to ensure disabled Americans can access
    key voting resources, requires an assessment of barriers to the
    right to vote independently and privately, and will help ensure that
    all Americans, including voters with disabilities, can exercise
    their right to vote.

<!-- -->

-   **Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Across
    the Federal Government.** In June, President Biden signed Executive
    Order 14035 advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and
    accessibility (DEIA) across the federal government. The Executive
    Order charges agencies with assessing their state of DEIA to
    eliminate barriers employees encounter. For federal workers with
    disabilities, the Executive Order sets a path for the federal
    government to become a model employer to improve accessibility,
    ensure accommodations can be requested, increase opportunities for
    advancement and hiring, and reduce physical accessibility barriers.
    On November 23, the Biden-Harris Administration released its
    [Strategic Plan to Advance DEIA in the Federal
    Workforce](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Strategic-Plan-to-Advance-Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-and-Accessibility-in-the-Federal-Workforce-11.23.21.pdf)
    to provide federal agencies a roadmap for implementation of the
    Executive Order.

-   **Expanding Access and Inclusion for Disabled Americans.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration has taken [significant
    steps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-marks-anniversary-of-americans-with-disabilities-act-and-announces-resources-to-support-individuals-with-long-covid/)
    to achieve a more inclusive, accessible, and equitable country for
    people with disabilities, including people with disabilities that
    experience multiple forms of discrimination and bias on the basis of
    race, gender, sexual orientation and other factors. These steps
    include a focus on funding supporting economic self-sufficiency;
    advancing independent living through home- and community-based
    services and accessible, affordable housing; and improving access to
    services needed during the pandemic.  Through quick policy action,
    the Administration has ensured disabled Americans are receiving
    resources and are included in key administrative proposals.

<!-- -->

-   **Developing Inclusive International Health Systems**. In early
    2021, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
    launched Learning, Acting, and Building for Rehabilitation in Health
    Systems (ReLAB-HS). This global project will support the development
    of health systems to respond to populations’ growing needs for
    rehabilitation. Through this project, USAID will co-design and
    implement innovative, comprehensive, cost-effective interventions
    that strengthen health systems to provide rehabilitation services,
    including assistive technology.

-   **Helping Individuals Cope with Challenges Posed by COVID-19.** In
    July, the Departments of Health and Human Services ([Office for
    Civil
    Rights](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/civil-rights-covid19/guidance-long-covid-disability/index.html)
    and [Administration for Community
    Living](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/COVID19/ACL_LongCOVID.pdf)),
    [Justice](https://www.ada.gov/long_covid_joint_guidance.pdf),
    [Education](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/files/ocr-factsheet-504-20210726.pdf),
    and
    [Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/topics/coronavirus-covid-19-long-covid)
    provided guidance and information about where individuals with
    disabilities can access resources and accommodations and clarified
    their rights with regard to health and educational services and
    supports. USAID launched a [Distance Learning
    Toolkit](https://www.edu-links.org/resources/designing-comprehensive-distance-learning-toolkit),
    which provides guidance for designing a comprehensive distance
    learning strategy. These strategies can be implemented during crises
    such as the COVID-19 pandemic, when learning institutions are
    closed. They can also be implemented beyond crises, to increase and
    promote access to quality, equitable, and inclusive teaching and
    learning.

In the coming year, the Administration will take the following steps to
create a more disability inclusive democracy:

-   **Launching the Disability Inclusive Democracy Year of Action. **The
    year of action will explore innovative approaches and common
    challenges to promote disability-inclusive democracy globally. As
    part of the Summit for Democracy, on December 3, the United States
    is co-hosting an event with Norway and the United Kingdom that will
    bring together more than 100 leaders and experts across sectors to
    identify and discuss the most important issues in access to voting,
    elections, and political and civil participation. Building on the
    event, the year of action will lead to a “Disability Inclusive
    Democracy Action Plan” that lays out best practices and
    recommendations for the United States and our international
    partners.  This framework will engage civil society, foreign
    governments, multilateral partners, and the private sector to
    promote equitable, inclusive, and accessible democratic principles
    and practices for more than one billion people with disabilities
    globally.

-   **Focusing on Inclusive Climate Planning**. USAID announced the
    Disability Program Fund that is committed to supporting people with
    disabilities and their representative organizations in responding to
    climate change next year. Announced at the 26th United Nations
    Climate Change Conference of the Parties, this initiative will
    bolster persons with disabilities’ resilience to the effects of
    climate change.

<!-- -->

-   **Announcing Partnerships to Improve Access.** USAID launched a
    partnership with ATscale, the Global Partnership for Assistive
    Technology, and is committing $25 million towards the goal of
    providing 500 million people with life changing assistive products
    by 2030, including wheelchairs, eyeglasses, prosthetic devices, or
    hearing aids. This partnership will assist the more than one billion
    people in the world who utilize assistive technology or devices.

<!-- -->

-   **Committing to Inclusive Disability Policy**. President Biden’s
    Build Back Better Act invests in the caregiving economy, advances
    competitive integrated employment, and expands inclusive and
    accessible preschool and child care. Once enacted, the Build Back
    Better Act will provide significant investments to children and
    adults with disabilities to achieve independent living, economic
    self-sufficiency, equitable educational opportunities, and full
    participation in the workforce and in communities.
