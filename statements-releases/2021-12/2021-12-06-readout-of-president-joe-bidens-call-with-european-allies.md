Today, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of
Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy, Prime Minister Boris
Johnson of the United Kingdom, and President Biden of the United States
held a call. The leaders discussed their shared concern about the
Russian military build-up on Ukraine’s borders and Russia’s increasingly
harsh rhetoric. They called on Russia to de-escalate tensions and agreed
that diplomacy, especially through the Normandy Format, is the only way
forward to resolve the conflict in Donbas through the implementation of
the Minsk Agreements. The leaders underscored their support for
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. They agreed that their
teams will stay in close touch, including in consultation with NATO
allies and EU partners, on a coordinated and comprehensive approach.
