title: Statement by President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden on the Passing of
  Archbishop Desmond Tutu
---
 
On this morning after Christmas, we are heartbroken to learn of the
passing of a true servant of God and of the people, Archbishop Desmond
Tutu of South Africa.

We were blessed to spend time with him on several occasions over
the past many years. His courage and moral clarity helped inspire our
commitment to change American policy toward the repressive Apartheid
regime in South Africa. We felt his warmth and joy when we visited him
during the 2010 World Cup that celebrated the diversity and beauty of
his beloved nation. And, just a few months ago, we joined the world in
celebrating his 90<sup>th</sup> birthday and reflecting on the power of
his message of justice, equality, truth, and reconciliation as we
confront racism and extremism in our time today.

Born to a school teacher and a laundress and into poverty and entrenched
racial segregation, Desmond Tutu followed his spiritual calling to
create a better, freer, and more equal
world. His legacy transcends borders and will echo throughout the ages.

On behalf of the Biden family, we send our deepest condolences to his
wife Leah and their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. And
on behalf of the people of the United States, we send our deepest
condolences to the people of South Africa who are mourning the loss
of one of their most important founding fathers.

May God bless Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
