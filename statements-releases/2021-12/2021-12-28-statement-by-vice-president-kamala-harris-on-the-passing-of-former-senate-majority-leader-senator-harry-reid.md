title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Former Senate\
  \ Majority Leader Harry\_Reid"
---
 
Our country has lost an honorable public servant. Harry Reid rose
through the ranks in Washington, becoming Senate Majority Leader, but he
never forgot his humble beginnings in Searchlight, Nevada – and he
always fought for working families and the poor. Leader Reid also got
things done: from expanding access to healthcare through the Affordable
Care Act, to getting economic relief to families and businesses through
the Recovery Act, and much more, he made a meaningful difference in
people’s lives. 

Whenever we had a chance to speak, Leader Reid was kind, generous, and
always to the point. Tonight, Landra and the entire Reid family are in
our thoughts.
