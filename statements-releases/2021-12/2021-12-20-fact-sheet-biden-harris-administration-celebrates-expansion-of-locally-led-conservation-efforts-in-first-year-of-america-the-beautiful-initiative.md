*Progress Report Highlights Land and Water Projects Underway as U.S.
Pursues First-Ever National Conservation Goal*

  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration issued its first annual [progress
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AtB-Year-One-Report_.pdf)
on the [*America the Beautiful
<u>initiative</u>*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2021/05/06/biden-harris-administration-outlines-america-the-beautiful-initiative/),
highlighting steps the Administration has taken over the past year to
support locally-led and voluntary efforts to conserve, connect, and
restore lands and waters across the nation that sustain the health of
our communities, power local economies, and help combat climate change.

Released by the U.S. Departments of the Interior, Agriculture and
Commerce, and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the
report outlines the collective work to pursue the first-ever national
conservation goal established by a President – a goal of conserving at
least 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. The federal actions
and activities described in the progress report align with the America
the Beautiful initiative’s [guiding
principles,](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/report-conserving-and-restoring-america-the-beautiful-2021.pdf)
which include commitments to honor the nation’s conservation traditions,
private property rights, the sovereignty of Tribal Nations, and the
values and priorities of local communities.

In particular, the report centers on work that federal agencies are
undertaking around six areas of focus: creating more parks and safe
outdoor opportunities; building connectivity and corridors for fish and
wildlife; supporting Tribally-led conservation and restoration;
increasing access for outdoor recreation; incentivizing voluntary
conservation; creating jobs and growing local economies; and deploying
nature to increase climate resilience and remove carbon from the
atmosphere. The report also includes a brief review of land-cover
changes and the status of fish and wildlife habitats and populations.

The report also reviews steps the Administration took this year to
restore protections for important natural and cultural resources; to
deepen partnerships and leverage resources with Tribes, states, private
landowners, and other stakeholders; to restore science and incorporate
Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge into decision-making; and to
take an inclusive and collaborative approach to the stewardship of the
land and water resources that sustain the nation’s communities and
economies. 

Notably, President Biden’s [Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law](https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/) provides
a major boost to the America the Beautiful initiative. The new law
provides the largest investment in the resilience of physical and
natural systems in American history and will help communities be more
prepared for drought and wildfire; address the legacy of pollution from
orphan wells and abandoned mines; invest in clean drinking water; fund
watershed rehabilitation and flood prevention projects; and improve
coastal resilience efforts.

**<u>ADDITIONAL AGENCY ACTION  
</u>**  
In addition to the progress report, the Biden-Harris Administration is
also announcing today several steps to ensure that the America the
Beautiful initiative is both guided by and reflective of the priorities,
needs, and inputs of local communities, Tribes, States, landowners,
hunters and fishers, and other important stakeholders. These steps are:

-   **Gathering Public Input on the American Conservation and
    Stewardship Atlas.** As initially described in the [Conserving and
    Restoring America the Beautiful May 2021
    report](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/report-conserving-and-restoring-america-the-beautiful-2021.pdf),
    the American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas will be a tool to
    provide a more accessible and comprehensive picture of conservation
    and restoration work nationwide. The co-lead agencies are initiating
    a formal comment period to collect input specific to the development
    of the Atlas, recognizing that many uses of lands and waters can be
    consistent with the long-term health of natural systems and
    contribute to addressing climate change and environmental
    injustices. This period will include a 60-day public comment period
    and public listening sessions in the first quarter of 2022.  More
    details will be available in the coming weeks in the Federal
    Register and on federal agencies’ America the Beautiful webpages.  
-   **Engaging the Hunting and Wildlife Conservation Council.** The U.S.
    Fish and Wildlife Service will re-engage an advisory council that
    will provide recommendations to the Departments of the Interior and
    Agriculture to help advance wildlife conservation and outdoor
    recreation, including hunting and fishing. This effort builds on the
    Wildlife Hunting and Heritage Conservation Council, first
    established in 2010. This contemporary group of subject matter
    experts will focus on policies that benefit wildlife resources;
    encourage partnership among the public, sporting conservation
    organizations, and Federal, State, Tribal, and territorial
    governments; and benefit fair chase recreational hunting and safe
    recreational shooting sports. Information on how to submit formal
    nominations for the advisory council will be forthcoming.  
-   **Improving the Conservation Reserve Enhancement
    Program** **(CREP).** USDA is improving
    [CREP](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/conservation-programs/conservation-reserve-enhancement/index)
    to bring in new partners who will work with producers on voluntary
    conservation practices and ultimately increase benefits for the
    nation’s agricultural producers and private landowners. The
    [Conservation Reserve
    Program](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/conservation-programs/conservation-reserve-program/) enables
    the USDA Farm Service Agency and partners to invest
    in partner-led projects. In direct response to feedback from State
    agencies, Tribes, non-profit organizations and other groups, USDA
    has updated matching fund requirements to include any desired
    combination of cash, in-kind contributions, or technical
    assistance; expanded its outreach efforts; and expanded the CREP
    team to increase capacity to work directly with existing and
    potential new partners. This effort is in line with the America the
    Beautiful initiative’s focus on incentivizing and rewarding
    voluntary conservation on private lands.   
-   **Establishing the Marine and Coastal Area-Based Management Federal
    Advisory Committee.** The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA) will establish an advisory committee that will
    provide advice to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and
    Atmosphere (NOAA Administrator) on science-based approaches to
    area-based protection, conservation, restoration, and management in
    marine and coastal areas, including the Great Lakes. The committee
    would be composed of representatives of diverse interests and
    perspectives, providing a forum for discussion and advice on
    opportunities to advance key priorities through NOAA programs and
    authorities: conservation of biodiversity, climate resilience, and
    expanding access to nature for underserved communities. Information
    on how to submit formal nominations for the advisory committee will
    be forthcoming.  
-   **Investing in Coastal Wetlands Restoration.** Today, the U.S. Fish
    and Wildlife Service will award more
    than $20 million to support 25 projects in 13 coastal states to
    protect, restore, or enhance more than 61,000 acres of coastal
    wetlands and adjacent upland habitats under the National Coastal
    Wetlands Conservation Grant Program. State, local and Tribal
    governments, private landowners, conservation groups and other
    partners will contribute more than $17.6 million in additional funds
    to these projects. These grants will have wide-reaching benefits for
    local economies, people, and wildlife – boosting coastal resilience,
    reducing flood risk, stabilizing shorelines and protecting natural
    ecosystems. 

**<u>CONSERVATION LEADERSHIP BY STATES, TRIBES, AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES  
</u>**  
Since President Biden announced the first-ever national goal to conserve
at least 30 percent of America’s lands and waters by 2030, states,
Tribes, local governments, and private sector leaders across the
country have advanced the effort, forging their own paths to conserve,
connect, and restore more lands and waters. More than [50 Tribal leaders
and organizations](https://www.natureamerica.org/supporters) and
[h](https://www.lcv.org/article/letter-state-and-local-elected-officials-support-protecting-30-of-americas-land-and-ocean-by-2030/)[undreds
of locally elected
officials](https://www.lcv.org/article/letter-state-and-local-elected-officials-support-protecting-30-of-americas-land-and-ocean-by-2030/)
across the country have expressed support for the national conservation
goal, recommendations, and guiding principles of the America the
Beautiful initiative. 

Many Governors are pursuing their own related goals and efforts in
alignment with the America the Beautiful initiative. These efforts
will support local economies, communities, and wildlife populations and
habitats. Activities of note this year include:  

-   **California:** The State convened advisory panels and held
    listening sessions over the course of 2021 to inform its draft plan
    and mapping tool in support of the Governor Gavin Newsom’s [goal to
    conserve and
    restore 30 percent ](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/10/07/governor-newsom-launches-innovative-strategies-to-use-california-land-to-fight-climate-change-conserve-biodiversity-and-boost-climate-resilience/)of
    its land and coastal waters by 2030. 
-   **Florida:** In July 2021, Governor Ron DeSantis signed the [Florida
    Wildlife Corridor
    Act](https://www.flgov.com/2021/07/19/governor-ron-desantis-celebrates-the-signing-of-senate-bill-976-creating-the-florida-wildlife-corridor-act/),
    allocating $300 million to conserve interconnected natural areas in
    the state. This act aligns with the America the Beautiful early
    focus areas, specifically collaborative conservation to expand fish
    and wildlife habitats and corridors.
-   **Hawaii:** The Division of Aquatic Resources continued developing
    its strategy for management of nearshore resources, consistent with
    its [2016 commitment](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dar/30x30/), and the
    State also worked to support its ongoing [30×30 Watershed Forest
    Initiative](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/forestry/frs/initiatives/freshwater-replenishment/)
    over the past year. 
-   **Illinois:** Lawmakers established the bipartisan [Illinois 30×30
    Conservation Task
    Force ](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=102-0618)in
    2021 to host listening sessions statewide. 
-   **Maine:** Governor Janet Mills [included a
    proposal](https://www.mainepublic.org/environment-and-outdoors/2020-11-13/maines-new-climate-action-plan-calls-for-lowered-emissions-land-conservation-job-creation)
    in the state’s Climate Action Plan to conserve at least 30 percent
    of Maine’s lands by 2030. 
-   **Michigan:** Lawmakers introduced a [bipartisan
    resolution](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(vjahx5v0wdgor2segkr5nuz4))/mileg.aspx?objectname=2021-HR-0025&page=GetObject)
    urging a statewide goal of conserving at least 30 percent of land
    and water as part of the nationwide effort. 
-   **Nevada:** Lawmakers became the first in the nation to [pass a
    resolution](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/81st2021/Bill/7487/Overview)
    supporting the national conservation goal and urging State and local
    agencies to work cooperatively. 
-   **New Mexico:** Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham [signed an executive
    order](https://www.krwg.org/post/broad-coalition-new-mexicans-praise-governor-s-order-protect-30-lands-and-waters-2030)
    establishing a statewide goal of protecting 30 percent of lands and
    waters by 2030. 
-   **New York:** Lawmakers
    [passed State legislation](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/s6191#:~:text=Scientists%20warn%20that%20in%20order,water%20systems%20globally%20by%202030.)
    setting a goal that would conserve at least 30 percent of
    the State’s land by 2030.

Leaders in the private sector also recognize that thriving ecosystems
support successful businesses and communities and that world class
natural areas can coexist alongside economic growth. For example, 342
organizations and businesses have already [formally voiced their
support](https://www.wilderness.org/sites/default/files/media/file/30x30%20Community%20Sign-On%20Letter.pdf)
for the President’s national conservation goal.
