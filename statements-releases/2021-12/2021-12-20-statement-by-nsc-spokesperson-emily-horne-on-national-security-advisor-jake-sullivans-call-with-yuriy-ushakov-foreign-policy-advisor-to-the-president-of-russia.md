  \ Sullivan\u2019s Call with Yuriy Ushakov, Foreign Policy Advisor to the President\
  \ of Russia"
---
 
Today, Jake Sullivan spoke with Yuriy Ushakov, Foreign Policy Advisor to
President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He indicated U.S. readiness to
engage in diplomacy through multiple channels, including bilateral
engagement, the NATO-Russia Council, and the OSCE. He made clear that
any dialogue must be based on reciprocity and address our concerns about
Russiaâ€™s actions, and take place in full coordination with our European
Allies and partners. He also noted that substantive progress can only
occur in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation.
