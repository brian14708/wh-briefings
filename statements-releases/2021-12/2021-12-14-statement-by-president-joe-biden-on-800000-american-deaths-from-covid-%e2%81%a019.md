As we mark the tragic milestone of 800,000 American deaths due to
COVID-19, we remember each person and the lives they lived, and we pray
for the loved ones left behind. I know what it’s like to stare at an
empty chair around the kitchen table, especially during the holiday
season, and my heart aches for every family enduring this pain.

To heal, we must remember. We must also act. That’s exactly what we have
done over the past 11 months. We stood up a historic vaccination
program, and 240 million Americans have stepped up and gotten at least
one shot. As a result, we have saved over one million American lives,
and spared families in every community across the country the
incalculable loss that too many others have suffered.

Today, more than 200 million Americans are fully vaccinated, and each
day, more people are getting boosted than ever before. As we head into
the winter and confront a new variant, we must resolve to keep fighting
this virus together. This means getting vaccinated and getting your
booster shot, and taking other prevention measures, such as masking.

The vaccines are safe, effective, free, easy, and our best tool to
prevent more loss and pain. If you were fully vaccinated before
mid-June, please go get your booster shot as soon as possible. And if
you haven’t already — please get yourself and your school-age children
vaccinated.

I urge all Americans: do your patriotic duty to keep our country safe,
to protect yourself and those around you, and to honor the memory of all
those we have lost. Now is the time.
