**Statement by President Joe Biden**

I have accepted Saule Omarova’s request to withdraw her name from
nomination for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. I
nominated Saule because of her deep expertise in financial regulation
and her long-standing, respected career in the private sector, the
public sector, and as a leading academic in the field. She has lived the
American dream, escaping her birthplace in the former Soviet Union and
immigrating to America, where she went on to serve in the Treasury
Department under President George W. Bush and now works as a professor
at Cornell Law School.  
  
As a strong advocate for consumers and a staunch defender of the safety
and soundness of our financial system, Saule would have brought
invaluable insight and perspective to our important work on behalf of
the American people. But unfortunately, from the very beginning of her
nomination, Saule was subjected to inappropriate personal attacks that
were far beyond the pale. I am thankful to Chairman Brown for giving her
a fair hearing and the opportunity to demonstrate her qualifications.  
  
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is a critical agency,
supervising and regulating about 1,200 national banks in the federal
banking system.  I will continue to work to find a nominee for this
position, and plan to make an announcement at a future date.

  
**Letter from Saule Omarova Withdrawing Her Nomination**

Dear Ambassador Russell –  
  
I am writing to you today with a request to withdraw my candidacy from
further consideration for the position of the U.S. Comptroller of the
Currency.  
  
It was a great honor and a true privilege to be nominated by President
Biden to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency overseeing
the U.S. national banking system. I deeply value President Biden’s trust
in my abilities and remain firmly committed to the Administration’s
vision of a prosperous, inclusive, and just future for our country. At
this point in the process, however, it is no longer tenable for me to
continue as a Presidential nominee.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Saule T. Omarova
