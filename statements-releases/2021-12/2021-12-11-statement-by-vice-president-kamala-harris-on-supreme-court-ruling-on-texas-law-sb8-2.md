  \ Law\_SB8"

In the United States of America, the right of women to make decisions
about their own bodies is non-negotiable. For nearly 50 years, this
right has been protected. Yesterday’s Supreme Court decision allows SB8,
which threatens women’s health and rights, to remain in effect. The ban
on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy remains. The cash incentives
for vigilantes remain. And the harm to women remains.

We must protect the constitutional right recognized under Roe v. Wade by
codifying it into law. We must pass the Women’s Health Protection Act.
And we must continue to do everything in our power to defend women’s
reproductive rights.
