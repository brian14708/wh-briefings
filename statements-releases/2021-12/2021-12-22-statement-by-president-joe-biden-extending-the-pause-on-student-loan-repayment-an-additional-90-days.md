title: Statement by President Joe Biden Extending the Pause on Student Loan Repayment
  an Additional 90 Days
---
 
When I came into office, we were facing a number of unprecedented
crises. Our economy was creating only 50,000 new jobs per month, less
than 1 percent of Americans were fully vaccinated, many schools were
closed, and Americans across the country were struggling to pay their
bills and stay afloat. That is why, on my very first day as President, I
directed the Department of Education to pause federal student loan
repayments through September. In August, my Administration once again
extended the pause, through January 31, 2022. That pause has given 41
million Americans badly-needed breathing room during the economic
upheaval caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.  
   
Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly
6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for
unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2
percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still
coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before
resuming payments. This is an issue Vice President Harris has been
closely focused on, and one we both care deeply about.  
   
Given these considerations, today my Administration is extending the
pause on federal student loan repayments for an additional 90 days —
through May 1, 2022 — as we manage the ongoing pandemic and further
strengthen our economic recovery. Meanwhile, the Department of Education
will continue working with borrowers to ensure they have the support
they need to transition smoothly back into repayment and advance
economic stability for their own households and for our nation.  
   
As we are taking this action, I’m asking all student loan borrowers to
do their part as well: take full advantage of the Department of
Education’s resources to help you prepare for payments to resume; look
at options to lower your payments through income-based repayment plans;
explore public service loan forgiveness; and make sure you are
vaccinated and boosted when eligible.
