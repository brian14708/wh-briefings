title: 'Fact Sheet: Export Controls and Human Rights Initiative Launched at the Summit
  for Democracy'
---
 
As part of its commitment to put human rights at the center of U.S.
foreign policy, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken meaningful
action to curb the proliferation of technology that has been misused by
governments for repression. Today at the Summit for Democracy, the
United States, Australia, Denmark and Norway announced *the Export
Controls and Human Rights Initiative* to help stem the tide of
authoritarian government misuse of technology and promote a positive
vision for technologies anchored by democratic values. **[*Read the
joint statement

We were joined in support by Canada, France, the Netherlands, and the
United Kingdom.

Too often, cyber intrusion, surveillance, and other dual-use
technologies are misused to stifle dissent; harass human rights
defenders; intimidate minority communities; discourage whistle-blowers;
chill free expression; target political opponents, journalists, and
lawyers; or interfere arbitrarily or unlawfully with privacy. 

The Export Controls and Human Rights Initiative will seek to address
this challenge by:

-   Working to develop a voluntary written code of conduct intended to
    guide the application of human rights criteria to export licensing
    policy and practice.

<!-- -->

-   Building policy alignment with likeminded partners that leads to
    common action, and concrete and practical outcomes.

<!-- -->

-   Bringing together policy makers, technical experts, and export
    control and human rights practitioners to ensure that critical and
    emerging technologies work for, and not against, democratic
    societies.

<!-- -->

-   During the Summit for Democracy’s Year of Action, we will shape this
    Initiative collaboratively with our partners and explore how best to
    strengthen domestic legal frameworks; share information on threats
    and risks; share, develop and implement best practices; and improve
    others’ capacity to do the same. Over the coming year, we will also
    engage in further coordination with other governments, as well as
    consult with industry and academia.

The United States is also working with allies and partners to reinforce
our democratic values and our democratic institutions in key emerging
technology areas:

-   Quad leaders launched [a statement of principles on
    technology](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/24/fact-sheet-quad-leaders-summit/),
    along with new efforts that together will advance critical and
    emerging technologies shaped by our shared democratic values and
    respect for human rights.

<!-- -->

-   Through the [Trade and Technology
    Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/29/fact-sheet-u-s-eu-establish-common-principles-to-update-the-rules-for-the-21st-century-economy-at-inaugural-trade-and-technology-council-meeting/),
    the United States and European Union determined shared principles
    and areas for export control cooperation, including capacity
    building assistance to third countries to support multilateral
    export control regimes, prior consultations on current and upcoming
    legislative and regulatory developments, and developing convergent
    control approaches on sensitive dual-use technologies. An additional
    working group is addressing the misuse of technology threatening
    human rights.  

<!-- -->

-   We’ve launched new bilateral cooperative partnerships on critical
    and emerging technologies with both Japan and the Republic of Korea.

These efforts build on steps the United States has already taken to stem
the misuse of technology to abuse human rights:

-   In July, the United States Government added to the Commerce
    Department’s Entity List entities located in the People’s Republic
    of China (PRC) that have been enabling human rights abuses against
    Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in
    Xinjiang, where the PRC continues to commit genocide. This action
    prevents the entities from gaining access to U.S. technology.
-   Similarly, following the coup in Burma earlier this year, the United
    States Government added companies and ministries controlled by the
    Burmese military to the Entity List. 
-   In mid-October, the United States Government released an interim
    final rule establishing controls on the export, re-export, or
    transfer of certain items used for malicious cyber activities. The
    proposed rule will target custom-made hacking tools, which have
    legitimate law enforcement and intelligence applications, but which
    have also been misused.
-   In early November, the United States Government added four foreign
    companies to the Entity List to stem the proliferation and misuse of
    tools used for repression: NSO Group and Candiru of Israel were
    designated for their development and supply of spyware to foreign
    governments that used these tools to maliciously target government
    officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and
    embassy workers.  Additionally, Russia’s Positive Technologies and
    Singapore’s Computer Security Initiative Consultancy PTE (COSEINC)
    were designated for misusing and trafficking cyber tools that were
    used to gain unauthorized access to information systems in ways that
    are contrary to the national security or foreign policy of the
    United States and threatened the privacy and security of individuals
    and organizations worldwide.
