title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Trucking Action Plan to\
  \ Strengthen America\u2019s Trucking\_Workforce"
---
 
Trucking plays a critical role in the U.S. supply chain and economy.
America’s truck drivers have been on the frontlines of this pandemic,
delivering goods to every corner of this country. Seventy-two percent of
goods in America are shipped by truck, and in most communities, trucks
are the only form of delivery. A strong, stable, and safe trucking
workforce that offers good-paying jobs to millions of truck drivers is a
critical lifeblood of our economy. But outdated infrastructure, the
COVID-19 pandemic, and a historic volume of goods moving through our
economy have strained capacity across the supply chain, including in
trucking.  
  
The pandemic exacerbated longstanding workforce challenges in the
trucking industry, including high turnover rates, an aging workforce,
long hours away from home, and time spent waiting–often unpaid–to load
and unload at congested ports, warehouses, and distribution centers.
According to [one
estimate](https://transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2021-11-17%20Hearing%20Testimony%20-%20David%20HC%20Correll%20UPDATED.pdf),
long-haul full-truckload drivers only spend an average of 6.5 hours per
working day driving despite being allowed to drive a maximum of 11
hours. That means about 40 percent of their capacity is not being used.
Many truckers also bear the burden of gas, insurance, and maintenance
costs, which reduces their take home pay, creating significant
challenges in recruiting and retaining drivers with the right
credentials and experience into today’s trucking jobs. At the same time,
the industry reports historic demand for its services. Reflecting that
demand, wages for employed drivers in all trucking segments have
increased 7-12% in the last year alone, but employment in some segments
is still below pre-pandemic levels.  

The Administration is taking action, and now we are asking industry,
labor, and all levels of government to partner with us to address these
trucking workforce challenges and begin building a next generation
trucking workforce. A stronger trucking workforce is one where trucking
jobs are good, safe, and stable — jobs that employers can attract a new
generation of drivers into while retaining existing drivers to deliver
for clients and grow their businesses. The nation’s trucking workforce
also demands clear, debt-free paths into these good jobs through
high-quality training, such as Registered Apprenticeships, which prepare
trainees and provide employers with a steady pipeline of skilled, safe,
and experienced drivers. 

Trucking employers across the U.S. are taking steps to make trucking
jobs better and to develop innovative workforce programs that recruit,
train, and retain drivers, especially from underrepresented communities
like women, the formerly incarcerated, and service-disabled veterans.
But the scale of the challenge means we need action to scale up these
strategies.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law creates a pathway to address these
challenges in the long-term. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is
announcing a set of concrete actions to address the expansion of
trucking. These actions will support the ongoing economic recovery and
lay the foundation for a next generation trucking workforce that will
strengthen U.S. competitiveness and support millions of good driving
jobs for years to come.

Today, the Departments of Transportation and Labor are launching an
effort to support and expand access to quality driving jobs now and in
the years ahead. The Departments are accelerating the expansion of
Registered Apprenticeship programs for drivers that put more skilled,
safe drivers on the road; taking immediate steps to address the
pandemic-driven delays in getting a commercial driver’s license; curbing
the proliferation of low-quality training that increases the supply of
less qualified drivers who end up in debt or being exploited; and
expanding more seamless paths for veterans and underrepresented
communities, such as women, to access good driving jobs.

**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the following
immediate actions:**

-   **Take steps to reduce barriers to drivers getting CDLs**: DOT and
    the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) are
    supporting state departments of motor vehicles as they return to—or
    even exceed—pre-pandemic commercial driver’s license (CDL) issuance
    rates, which is helping bring more truck drivers into the field.
    FMCSA will provide over $30 million in funding to help states
    expedite CDLs. Today, FMCSA is sending all 50 states a toolkit
    detailing specific actions they can take to expedite licensing and
    will work hand-in-hand with states to address challenges they are
    facing. FMCSA will also begin closely tracking delays, identifying
    states that have challenges with issuing CDLs, and communicating
    with all 50 governors about ways they can reduce delays in issuing
    CDLs.

In 2021, on average, more than 50,000 CDLs and Learners Permits have
been issued each month, which is 20% higher than the 2019 monthly
average and 72% higher than the 2020 monthly average. In fact, by the
end of October 2021, states had issued more licenses and permits than in
all of 2019. While backlogs and delays exist in some States, they can be
cleared by using proven strategies. For example, using these tools this
past summer, New York reduced testing delays by 37%. California recently
expanded hours and locations and increased the number of personnel who
can administer the road test. North Carolina increased the availability
of testing appointments, and Texas has expanded hours, testing capacity,
and shifted much of the process online. There is more work to do, and
FMCSA is using the levers of government to make it easier for truck
drivers to get their CDLs, while also taking actions to address
retention issues.

-   **Kick off a 90-day Challenge to accelerate the expansion of
    Registered Apprenticeships:**  This 90-day challenge is a national
    effort to recruit employers interested in developing new Registered
    Apprenticeship programs and expanding existing programs to help put
    more well-trained drivers on the road in good trucking jobs.
    Trucking employers of all sizes and across industry segments——from
    long haul to last mile, from cargo containers fresh off of ships to
    tank trucks transporting essential fuel – are seeing the potential
    value of Registered Apprenticeship. Registered Apprenticeship is the
    gold-standard of workforce training that provides paid, on-the-job
    learning, and today there are more than 10,000 apprentices in the
    trucking industry. Expanding this proven workforce strategy in
    trucking is critical for ensuring high-quality training for new
    drivers and helping employers develop and retain a skilled and safe
    workforce.  For employers ready to step up, DOL and national
    partners will help accelerate new program development in as little
    as two days. To kick off the Challenge, DOL is announcing today: 
    -   FASTPORT, a DOL-funded national apprenticeship intermediary
        partner with a focus on the transportation sector, is committing
        to work with trucking employers, unions, and industry
        associations to establish Registered Apprenticeship programs for
        their organizations in as little as 48 hours.  
    -   DOL’s Office of Apprenticeship’s (OA) consultants located across
        the country will be available to assist organizations interested
        in starting a new program or joining an existing program. OA
        launched a [90 Day Apprenticeship Trucking Challenge
        website](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/90-day-trucking-apprenticeship-challenge)
        for interested employers, unions, and intermediaries to express
        their interest in developing Registered Apprenticeship programs
        to meet their workforce needs.
    -   DOL is investing 8 million in more national apprenticeship
        intermediaries who can help employers start Registered
        Apprenticeships in trucking and other supply chain industries.
    -   Today, we are announcing that EVO Trucking, D.M. Bowman, Yellow
        Corporation, Florida Rock and Tank, Total Transportation and
        CRST are committing to launch, expand, and work with our
        Administration on a Registered Apprenticeship through our
        Accelerator.
    -   We are going to work with the Trucking Alliance and the American
        Trucking Associations, who will help engage their members on the
        value of a Registered Apprenticeship to support quality, safety,
        and retention.  
-   **Conduct veterans-focused outreach & recruitment:** There are
    approximately 70,000 veterans who are likely to have certified
    trucking experience in the last five years. The
    DOL Veterans’ Employment and Training Service (VETS) and the
    Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will work with Veterans Service
    Organizations, Military Service Organizations, unions, industry
    trucking associations, training providers, and private partners
    to enable transitioning service members and veterans to attain good
    jobs in the trucking industry. DOL and VA will work to ensure
    veterans’ driving experience is recognized for those seeking a CDL
    and will build on proven models, such as SkillBridge programs
    for transitioning service members. This includes:
    -   Expanding outreach with partners and stakeholders in the veteran
        employment space to support veteran career pathways
        into the trucking industry.  
    -   Helping employers seeking CDL drivers connect with federal,
        state, and other resources to facilitate connecting those
        employers to job-seeking veterans.
    -   Expanding partnerships between the Employment Navigator and
        Partnership Pilot (ENPP) to the trucking industry to more
        effectively assist transitioning service members with the
        establishment of career goals and to connect them with
        best-in-class employment partners to facilitate positive
        employment outcomes.
    -   Exploring use of the Off-Base Transition Training Pilot Program
        (OBTT) to extend employment readiness curriculum to connect
        veterans, National Guard and Reserve members, and their spouses
        to a career path in trucking.
    -   Amplify VA programs that provide truck driving and related
        training to include the Veteran Readiness & Employment (VR&E)
        program and the Veteran Rapid Retraining Assistance Program
        (VRRAP). VA currently offers 120 approved commercial driving
        programs to veterans eligible for the VRRAP program, of which 31
        are currently being used. More than 8,400 commercial driving
        programs are approved for use by eligible veterans under the GI
        Bill.  
-   **Launch joint DOT- DOL *Driving Good Jobs* initiative**: Supporting
    drivers and ensuring that trucking jobs are good jobs is
    foundational for a strong, safe, and stable trucking workforce.  
    DOT and DOL are announcing today the launch of the joint *Driving
    Good Jobs* initiative, which marks a new partnership between the
    agencies that will include: hosting listening sessions that engage
    drivers, unions and worker centers, industry, and advocates; lifting
    up employers and best practices that support job quality and driver
    retention that can be scaled; working together to implement research
    and engagement efforts outlined in the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law, including studying the issue of truck driver pay and unpaid
    detention time; identifying effective and safe strategies to get new
    entrants in the field from underrepresented communities, including
    women and young drivers between the ages of 18-20; setting up a task
    force to investigate predatory truck leasing arrangements; and
    identifying longer term actions, such as potential administrative or
    regulatory actions that support drivers and driver retention by
    improving the quality of trucking jobs.

Over the next 90 days, the Administration will bring together state
partners, labor, training providers, truckers, the trucking industry,
and others to advance these efforts:

**In the next 30 days:**

-   DOL and DOT will kick off listening sessions with drivers, industry
    and labor leaders, and advocates to hear their perspectives, profile
    promising practices, and source scalable solutions to retention and
    job quality issues for truckers.  The first events in this series
    are happening today in South Carolina with Secretary Buttigieg,
    Deputy Administrator Joshi, and representatives from DOL and at the
    White House co-chaired by Secretary Buttigieg, Secretary Walsh, and
    National Economic Council Director Deese.
-   FMCSA will issue funding opportunities for states to streamline CDL
    processing and reduce testing delays.
-   DOL, DOT, and intermediary partners will work closely with committed
    trucking employers to launch the first group of Apprenticeship
    Challenge programs.
-   FMCSA and DOL will begin an in-depth study of driver compensation,
    as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to examine truck
    driver pay, including the time drivers spend waiting to pick up or
    drop off freight without getting paid.
-   DOL’s VETS and the Department of Veteran Affairs will organize a
    meeting with Veterans Service Organizations and Military Service
    Organizations to discuss opportunities to employ veterans in the
    trucking industry, including leveraging Veteran Affairs’ education
    and training benefits.

**In the next 60 Days:**

-   Acknowledging that safety is the highest priority for truck drivers,
    FMCSA will launch a pilot for drivers ages 18-21 as mandated by the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, incorporating Registered
    Apprenticeships to ensure rigorous training standards and pairing
    each young driver with an experienced mentor.
-   DOL and DOT will host a series of national Apprenticeship
    Accelerator meetings to help more firms develop new programs and
    release a quick-start toolkit for apprenticeships in the trucking
    sector.
-   DOL VETS, DOL Employment and Training Administration, and DOT’s
    Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration will conduct a
    roundtable to discuss efforts to facilitate a CDL for transitioning
    service members and veterans. The meeting will include
    representatives from the United Services
    Military Apprenticeship Program as well as Veterans Affairs.
-   In FY21, VETS initiated and implemented ENPP to more effectively
    assist transitioning service members with the establishment of
    career goals and to connect them with best-in-class employment
    partners to facilitate positive employment outcomes. ENPP is
    currently at 16 military installations. DOL will expand the
    Employment Navigator and Partnership Pilot (ENPP) program to now
    include the trucking industry. 

**In the next 90 Days:**

-   The Department of Labor will announce the results of the 90-day
    Apprenticeship Challenge and announce new partnerships to continue
    to expand apprenticeships in the trucking industry.
-   DOT and DOL will launch the task force dedicated to promoting the
    recruitment, inclusion, and advancement of women in trucking
    established in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This task force
    will be the first of many strategies to help build the pipeline and
    diversify the trucking workforce.
-   DOT and DOL will launch the task force to investigate predatory
    truck leasing arrangements that dissuade drivers from entering or
    staying in the industry established in the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law.
-   DOT and DOL will deliver a comprehensive action plan, informed by
    its series of listening sessions, outlining any further
    administrative and regulatory actions the Administration can take to
    support quality trucking jobs.

The Truck Action Plan is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
[Supply Chain Disruptions Task
Force](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-supply-chain-disruptions-task-force-to-address-short-term-supply-chain-discontinuities/),
launched in June to address near-term supply chain bottlenecks as the
economy rapidly reopened following the Administration’s historic
vaccination and economic relief efforts. The Task Force is co-chaired by
the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and Agriculture to lead a
whole of government effort to address these disruptions. The Task Force
has been convening stakeholders to diagnose problems and surface
solutions—large and small, public or private—that will help alleviate
bottlenecks and supply constraints, in order to minimize the impacts on
workers, consumers, and businesses, and bolster a strong economic
recovery.
