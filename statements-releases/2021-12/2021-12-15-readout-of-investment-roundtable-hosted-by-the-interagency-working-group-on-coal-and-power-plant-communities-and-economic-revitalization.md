*Interagency Working Group Co-Chairs Convene Cross-Sector Leaders Who
Are Catalyzing Economic Activity and Job Creation in Energy Communities
Now*

Today, Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and
Economic Revitalization (IWG) Co-Chairs National Climate Advisor Gina
McCarthy and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese hosted a
roundtable with stakeholders from the private sector, philanthropy,
labor and community-based organizations. They were joined by IWG members
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who houses the IWG, Secretary of
Commerce Gina Raimondo, and Appalachian Regional Commission Federal
Co-Chair Gayle Manchin.

The roundtable focused on new private sector and philanthropic
investments that have been spurred by the Administration’s efforts to
support economic revitalization in energy communities. The roundtable
also discussed the announcement of initial awards from the Department of
Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) $300 million [Coal
Communities Commitment](https://eda.gov/arpa/coal-communities/) to
support economic revitalization, infrastructure investments, and quality
jobs in coal communities with funding from the American Rescue Plan.

The discussion highlighted how President Biden’s American Rescue Plan
and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are already catalyzing economic
activity in energy communities and how the Build Back Better Act will
further expand economic opportunity in these communities. The discussion
also emphasized how executive actions like the formation of the IWG and
the launch of the Justice40 Initiative have catalyzed a whole of
government effort to invest in historically disadvantaged communities.
The Co-Chairs also released [an end of year
report](https://energycommunities.gov/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-tops-off-a-banner-year-of-investment-in-energy-communities/)
highlighting how the Administration’s administrative and legislative
actions have bolstered economic activity in energy communities.

To further support energy communities and facilitate access to federal
resources, the IWG announced the launch of the [IWG federal funding
clearinghouse](https://energycommunities.gov/funding-opportunities/),
which includes more than $45 billion in open and planned investment
opportunities relevant or targeted to energy communities for
infrastructure, environmental remediation, union job creation, and
community revitalization efforts.

Roundtable participants included representatives working in West
Virginia, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Wyoming, and North
Carolina. The group discussed:

-   Opportunities to reposition existing assets, like coal-fired power
    plants, to service new and growing industries and technologies,
    preserving jobs for workers in those communities.  
-   The role of labor unions as a key partner to support training of
    workers as they prepare to move into new functions or jobs.  
-   How institutions of higher education support workforce development
    and training, including in secondary school pipelines, and how
    land-grant universities like West Virginia University and
    Historically Black Colleges and Universities like Xavier University
    of Louisiana serve as anchor institutions with deep community
    ties.  
-   How philanthropic organizations are making long-term investments to
    support communities in accessing resources and building the capacity
    to realize economic revitalization opportunities.

Participants included:

-   **Xavier University** of Louisianawhich described their partnership
    with the Greater New Orleans Development Foundation to use an EDA
    Build Back Better Regional Challenge grant to build a green hydrogen
    energy cluster to decarbonize the South Louisiana industrial
    corridor that will support equitable job creation.  
-   The **Coalfield Development Corporation**, who described the efforts
    of the Appalachian Climate Technology (ACT Now) coalition, to use an
    EDA [Build Back Better Regional
    Challenge](https://eda.gov/news/press-releases/2021/12/13/build-back-better-regional-challenge-finalists.htm)
    grant to support the transition from coal to solar power, implement
    sustainable reuse projects on abandoned mine sites, invest in
    innovation zones and centers to create a skilled workforce and
    provide the infrastructure for manufacturing, and create a climate
    task force and entrepreneurial programs to support employment in
    field of environmentalism.  
-   **Hecate Energy** described its plans to use the clean energy tax
    credits in the BBBA to develop a solar manufacturing hub in the I-79
    corridor from Pittsburgh, PA to Fairmont, West Virginia that
    includes a consortium of manufacturers of ingots, wafers, cells,
    modules, tracker, inverters, batteries, as well as an operations and
    maintenance center that will create more than 2,000 permanent
    manufacturing jobs.  
-   **Malta Inc.** announced the initial findings of a DOE-funded study
    on retrofitting retired coal power plants with thermal energy
    storage. They noted how the $500 million for energy storage
    demonstration projects in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will
    enable them to demonstrate the viability of their technology on a
    retiring coal plant in an energy community.  
-   **Sparkz Inc.** using technology licensed from the Department of
    Energy’s Oak Ridge National Lab, described their plans to
    commercialize a cobalt-free, American-made lithium-ion battery that
    would be manufactured in Appalachia.  
-   **Escalante H2 Power** described how the 45Q tax credit in the Build
    Back Better Act will support their effort to repower a closed
    coal-fired generating station in New Mexico for hydrogen fueled
    power production while capturing and sequestering carbon produced
    from the hydrogen production.  
-   **TerraPower,** discussed how, thanks to the passage of the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and DOE funding, it recently announced
    its next-generation demonstration Natrium nuclear reactor at the
    site of a coal-fired power plant slated to be retired near Kemmerer,
    Wyoming.  
-   **AFL-CIO** discussed how its affiliate members are supporting
    projects in energy communities and how union energy and construction
    workers will be crucial to the success of implementation of the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Build Back Better Act and economic
    revitalization of energy communities.  
-   **United Mine Workers of America** discussed how their members in
    energy communities are ready to support the next-generation projects
    described in the room, and how their union-led worker training
    programs can position coal workers to provide a skilled, qualified
    workforce in energy communities across the country.  
-   The **Just Transition Fund** which announced a new initiative with
    national and regional partners to drive $100 million over the next
    five years in new investments, including developing a national
    response center to help communities access federal funds. Key
    partners include Google.org, Bloomberg Philanthropies, The JPB
    Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, and the Mertz
    Gilmore Foundation, as well as regional donors like Pittsburgh-based
