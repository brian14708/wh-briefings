title: Statement from President Joe Biden on the Appointment of Catherine Russell
  as Executive Director of UNICEF
---
 
Ambassador Cathy Russell has been a trusted and indispensable advisor to
Jill and me for nearly 30 years. In that time, Jill and I have witnessed
— and benefited countless times from — Cathy’s leadership, experience,
wisdom, and empathy. And it is because of those qualities that I could
not be more proud that the UN Secretary-General has announced his intent
to appoint her as the next Executive Director of UNICEF.

We will miss Cathy. But our loss is UNICEF’s gain, because children
around the world will lead richer, safer, and healthier lives as a
direct result of Cathy’s leadership in this new role. As a first-rate
public servant, policy expert, and manager who has worked tirelessly to
advocate for children and empower women and girls — including as the
United States Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues in the Obama-Biden
Administration — Cathy is exceptionally well-prepared to lead UNICEF’s
critical work on behalf of young people around the world. UNICEF is
lucky to have her.

Under Cathy’s leadership, the White House Office of Presidential
Personnel (PPO) has broken records in both speed and diversity of
hiring, working relentlessly to ensure that our federal government
reflects America and delivers for the American people. I am also pleased
that Gautam Raghavan, who has worked in tandem with Cathy from Day One,
will become PPO’s new Director — a seamless transition that will enable
us to continue building a federal workforce that is efficient,
effective, dependable, and diverse.
