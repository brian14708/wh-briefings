Today President Biden joined White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator
Jeff Zients, Chief Medical Advisor to the President Dr. Anthony Fauci,
and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky for their regular call with the
bipartisan National Governors Association regarding the country’s
COVID-19 response. After his public remarks, President Biden joined Jeff
Zients, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Walensky to answer questions from several of
the nation’s governors. The group discussed a range of topics, including
the latest science on the Omicron variant, the use and distribution of
COVID-19 treatments, expanding Federal partnerships and resources on
testing, and keeping the Nation’s schools open. President Biden
concluded the call by reiterating his gratitude to NGA Chairman Asa
Hutchinson of Arkansas and NGA Vice Chairman Phil Murphy of New Jersey
for their bipartisan leadership on the COVID-19 response, and that his
Administration stands ready to provide any additional resources needed
by the states.
