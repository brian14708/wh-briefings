title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Build Back Better\_Act"
---
 
I had a productive call with Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer
earlier today. I briefed them on the most recent discussions that my
staff and I have held with Senator Manchin about Build Back Better. In
these discussions, Senator Manchin has reiterated his support for Build
Back Better funding at the level of the framework plan I announced in
September. I believe that we will bridge our differences and advance the
Build Back Better plan, even in the face of fierce Republican
opposition.  
  
My team and I are having ongoing discussions with Senator Manchin; that
work will continue next week. It takes time to finalize these
agreements, prepare the legislative changes, and finish all the
parliamentary and procedural steps needed to enable a Senate vote. We
will advance this work together over the days and weeks ahead; Leader
Schumer and I are determined to see the bill successfully on the floor
as early as possible.  
  
Build Back Better is urgently needed to lower the cost of prescription
drugs, health care, child care, and elder care. Notwithstanding the
unrelenting Republican obstruction – not a single Republican is willing
to move forward on the bill – I am determined to see this bill enacted
into law, to give America’s families the breathing room they deserve. We
also need urgent action on climate change and other priorities in the
Build Back Better plan.   
  
We will – we must – get Build Back Better passed, even in the face of
Republican opposition.   
  
At the same time, we must also press forward on voting rights
legislation, and make progress on this as quickly as possible. I had a
productive conversation today with several Senators about how we can get
this vital legislation passed. Our democracy is at stake.
