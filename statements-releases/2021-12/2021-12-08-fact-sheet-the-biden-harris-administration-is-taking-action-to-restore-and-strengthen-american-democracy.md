title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration is Taking Action to Restore\
  \ and Strengthen American\_Democracy"
---
 
From the first day in office and every day since, the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken decisive action to restore and strengthen
American democracy, from cracking down on corruption and promoting
transparency to taking critical steps to ensure the federal government
works for every American — no matter what they look like or where they
live. This cause will be a guiding principle throughout the President’s
time in office, and that includes prioritizing the fight to pass the
Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to
protect the sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections.

Sustaining democracy is also a shared challenge and commitment for our
allies and partners overseas. Against the backdrop of a rise in
authoritarianism and increasing threats to democracy around the world,
President Biden is convening world leaders for a [Summit for
Democracy](https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy/) to provide an
opportunity to listen, learn, and share how governments and
non-governmental actors can strengthen their commitment to democratic
principles and practices, and their responsiveness to the people they
serve.

As President Biden made clear in his first Address to the Joint Session
of Congress on April 28, 2021, “We have to prove democracy still works —
that our government still works and we can deliver for our people.”
Demonstrating that democracy can deliver to improve people’s lives and
address the greatest challenges of our time — and that we, the people,
can work together to address the threats facing our democracy — is at
the heart of the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to Build Back
Better.

Last month, after working across the aisle to negotiate with Members of
Congress from both parties, **President Biden signed the bipartisan
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).** This
once-in-a-generation investment in America’s infrastructure and
competitiveness will drive the creation of good-paying union jobs, grow
the economy sustainably and equitably, and shows that democracy can
deliver results for the American people. **President Biden continues to
work with Congress to enact the Build Back Better Act**, historic
legislation that will cut the cost of child care and elder care, invest
in affordable housing, position the U.S. to tackle the climate crisis,
make health care and prescription drugs more affordable, and much more —
fully paid for by ensuring the wealthiest individuals and corporations
pay their fair share. These transformational pieces of legislation also
make critical investments in American democracy, including:

-   ***Delivering Broadband Access and Digital Literacy Skills.*** The
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $65 billion to help ensure
    that every American has access to reliable high-speed internet,
    close the digital divide, and fund digital literacy initiatives to
    provide individuals with the skills needed to critically evaluate
    information online. These investments will democratize access to
    information, services, and opportunity while promoting information
    awareness and education.
-   ***Foster Civic Engagement and a Culture of National Service***. The
    Build Back Better Act will create a new Civilian Climate Corps
    (CCC), bringing together a diverse generation of over 300,000
    Americans to work together in common purpose to conserve our public
    lands and waters, bolster community resilience, and address the
    changing climate. It will provide AmeriCorps with a historic $15
    billion investment to expand service opportunities and increase the
    living allowance and education award for all AmeriCorps members,
    making national service a more accessible pathway to good-paying
    union jobs for more Americans of all backgrounds.

<!-- -->

-   ***Investing in Civic Infrastructure.*** The Build Back Better Act
    contains $3 billion to create a new Community Restoration and
    Revitalization Fund, which will fund community-led civic
    infrastructure projects to create shared amenities that spark local
    economic activity, provide services, and strengthen communities’
    civic fabric.
-   ***Supporting Local Journalism.*** The Build Back Better Act will
    provide tax credits for local newsrooms to hire journalists, helping
    to stabilize newsroom budgets in the face of unprecedented
    challenges and sustaining Americans’ access to the independent
    journalism that informs citizens and holds the powerful accountable.

The Biden-Harris Administration firmly believes that renewing democracy
around the globe begins by working diligently and transparently to
strengthen its foundations at home. The Administration is taking bold
action across the Summit’s three broad themes: **strengthening democracy
and defending against authoritarianism; fighting corruption; and
promoting respect for human rights.**

**Strengthening Democracy and Defending Against Authoritarianism**

In addition to pressing for essential legislation to protect voting
rights and strengthen our democracy, the Biden-Harris Administration is
using available authorities and resources to defend the right to vote.
The Administration has also advanced a broad range of actions to repair
the fabric of our democracy, from bolstering [workers’
rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/26/fact-sheet-executive-order-establishing-the-white-house-task-force-on-worker-organizing-and-empowerment/)
and unions, an essential bulwark of democratic societies, to combating
[domestic violent
extremism](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/15/fact-sheet-national-strategy-for-countering-domestic-terrorism/).
This work includes:

-   ***Ensuring Compliance with Voting Rights Laws.*** The Department of
    Justice (DOJ) has taken a variety of steps to help protect the right
    to vote, including doubling the number of voting rights attorneys,
    taking steps to ensure compliance with voting rights statutes, and
    issuing guidance on (1) the civil and criminal statutes that apply
    to [post-election
    audits](/www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1417796/download%3c), (2)
    [methods of
    voting](/www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1417801/download%3c),
    including early voting and voting by mail, and (3) the vote-dilution
    protections that apply to all jurisdictions under [Section 2 of the
    Voting Rights
    Act](/www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1429826/download%3c) as
    they engage in redistricting.

<!-- -->

-   ***Making it Easier for Americans to Register to Vote.*** Federal
    agencies
    [continue](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/28/fact-sheet-biden-administration-promotes-voter-participation-with-new-agency-steps/)
    to robustly implement President Biden’s [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/)
    on Promoting Access to Voting, including among many other things:
    -   The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will make it
        easier for consumers using HealthCare.gov to connect to voter
        registration services and receive assistance. CMS will also work
        with states on improving access to voter registration.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Department of Veterans Affairs will provide materials and
        assistance in registering and voting for tens of thousands of
        inpatients and residents, including VA Medical Center inpatients
        and residents of VA nursing homes and treatment centers for
        homeless veterans.  The Department will also facilitate
        assistance in registering and voting for homebound veterans and
        their caregivers through VA’s home-based and telehealth teams. 

    <!-- -->

    -   The U.S. Small Business Administration became the first federal
        agency to request designation as a voter registration agency
        pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act, committing to
        offer Americans seeking services at the agency’s District Field
        Offices the opportunity to register to vote.
-   ***Combating Misinformation and Disinformation.*** Today, the White
    House announced that an interagency [Information Integrity Research
    and Development Working
    Group](https://www.nitrd.gov/coordination-areas/information-integrity-rd/)
    will develop and release a first-of-its-kind strategic plan
    concerning government-wide research and development to better
    understand the full information ecosystem; design strategies for
    preserving information integrity and mitigating the effects of
    information manipulation, including mis- and disinformation; support
    information awareness and education; and foster a multi-disciplinary
    and collaborative research environment.

**Fighting Corruption**

Since Day One, the administration has worked to earn and keep the trust
of Americans by cracking down on corruption and promoting an accountable
and transparent government that works for the people, from  requiring
all appointees to take a stringent [ethics
pledge](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-ethics-commitments-by-executive-branch-personnel/),
to releasing the President’s and Vice-President’s
[taxes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/2021/05/17/the-president-and-vice-president-release-their-2020-tax-returns/),
to issuing policies to restore [DOJ’s
independence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/21/white-house-releases-policy-for-contacts-with-agencies-and-departments/).
In addition to the steps we’ve already taken, this week we will be
highlighting actions including:

-   ***Developing a Strategy on Countering Corruption.*** The
    Biden-Harris Administration [released the
    first-ever](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/06/fact-sheet-u-s-strategy-on-countering-corruption/)
    United States Strategy on Countering Corruption, outlining a
    whole-of-government approach to elevating the fight against
    corruption both at home and abroad. The Strategy includes the
    Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
    (FinCEN) publishing proposed
    [regulations](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-proposed-rule-beneficial-ownership-reporting-counter-illicit)
    requiring companies to identify to FinCEN the real people who own or
    control them, making it harder for criminals to launder illicit
    proceeds through shell companies. The Strategy also commits FinCEN
    to
    [launching](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-launches-regulatory-process-new-real-estate-sector-reporting-requirements)
    a regulatory process for potential new reporting and recordkeeping
    requirements to increase transparency in real estate transactions,
    diminishing the ability of corrupt actors to launder ill-gotten
    proceeds through real estate purchases.
-   ***Restoring Ethics, Transparency, and the Rule of Law.*** The
    Administration will continue working with Congress to restore
    democratic guardrails to prevent future abuses of presidential power
    and curtail corruption, with legislation that is consistent with our
    constitutional principles and that appropriately addresses the
    balance of powers between the three branches of our federal
    government. In doing so, the Administration will work to ensure that
    no branch is able to abuse its authority or undermine a co-equal
    branch’s constitutional prerogatives, no matter who is in power.

**Promoting Respect for Human Rights**

The Biden-Harris Administration has centered equity and the advancement
of fundamental rights as a priority to ensure that all Americans are
able to fully participate in our democracy and have a fair shot at the
American dream. The Administration has worked to embed equity across
many fronts, including taking concrete steps to [advance gender
equality](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/22/fact-sheet-national-strategy-on-gender-equity-and-equality/);
accelerate [LGBTQI+
equality](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-advancing-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-government/);
expand access and inclusion for Americans with disabilities; support and
respect [Native
communities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/15/fact-sheet-building-a-new-era-of-nation-to-nation-engagement/);
combat [hate
crimes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/20/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-the-covid-19-hate-crimes-act/);
and reform our [criminal justice
system](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/29/the-biden-administration-continues-its-work-to-expand-access-to-justice/).
In addition to all of the work that has happened over the past year,
this week we are proud to highlight new announcements including:

-   ***Combating Human Trafficking.*** In a new [National Action
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/03/fact-sheet-the-national-action-plan-to-combat-human-trafficking-nap/)
    to Combat Human Trafficking, the Biden-Harris Administration is
    reaffirming its commitment to addressing this abhorrent crime, which
    disproportionately impacts some of the most vulnerable and
    underserved members of our society. The plan lays out foundational
    pillars of U.S. and global anti-trafficking efforts
    **—** prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnerships.
-   ***Closing the Racial Wealth Gap.*** The Biden-Harris Administration
    — the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world —
    recently [announced new
    reforms](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-reforms-to-increase-equity-and-level-the-playing-field-for-underserved-small-business-owners/)
    to the federal procurement process that will increase equity, help
    close the racial wealth gap, and level the playing field for
    underserved small businesses. The President is delivering on his
    goal of increasing the share of federal procurement dollars to small
    disadvantaged businesses, which Black-owned, Latino-owned, and other
    minority-owned businesses are presumed to qualify, by 50 percent
    by 2025. This ambitious target will mean an additional $100 billion
    for underserved small businesses over the next five years.

<!-- -->

-   ***Promoting Equality for Transgender and Gender Diverse
    Americans.*** Building on the State Department’s announcement that
    it will offer a third gender marker on U.S. passports, the White
    House is [convening an interagency policy
    committee](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/20/biden-harris-administration-memorializes-transgender-day-of-remembrance/)
    to advance a coordinated federal approach to expanding access to
    accurate and inclusive federal identity documents for transgender
    and gender diverse people.

Democracy is always a work-in-progress, a constant striving to build a
more perfect union. Following the Summit, the Biden-Harris
Administration and democracies across the globe will convene
governmental, civil society, and private sector partners during a year
of consultation, coordination, and action (“**Year of Action**”) to
advance democracy, after which time President Biden intends to again
gather world leaders to showcase our collective progress and forge a
path forward. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue its
steadfast work to strengthen democracy, with additional actions and
commitments to be announced throughout the year to come.

The Biden-Harris Administration’s record of accomplishments and ongoing
efforts to restore and reinvigorate American democracy includes:

**Strengthening Democracy**

**Protecting the Sacred Right to Vote in Free, Fair, and Secure
Elections.** The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to prioritize
the unrelenting fight for federal democracy reform legislation —
including the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act — to establish national baselines for access to the
ballot box, prevent discrimination in voting, curtail extreme partisan
gerrymandering, secure our elections and ensure the will of the voters
is upheld, reform our campaign finance system so that it is free from
foreign interference and amplifies the voices of the people rather than
powerful special interests, and establish Washington, D.C. as our
Union’s 51<sup>st</sup> state. And President Biden will use every tool
at his disposal to protect the fundamental right to vote, the right that
protects all other rights.

-   ***Promoting Access to Voting*.** In March, the President issued an
    [Executive Order on Promoting Access to
    Voting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/),
    launching a first-of-its-kind effort to expand access to voter
    registration and election information. Agencies across the federal
    government have
    [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/28/fact-sheet-biden-administration-promotes-voter-participation-with-new-agency-steps/)
    initial steps they are taking to respond to the President’s call for
    a whole-of-government effort to enhance the ability of all eligible
    Americans to participate in our democracy. These steps will benefit
    all Americans, but will particularly increase access for a range of
    underserved communities, including voters who are younger and older,
    rural and urban; new citizens; servicemembers and veterans; Native
    Americans; voters with disabilities; voters with language access
    concerns; and voters in federal custody. The ongoing work to
    implement the Executive Order includes the following initial
    commitments:

<!-- -->

-   The **Department of Defense** will support a comprehensive approach
    to information and voting awareness for servicemembers and civilian
    personnel voting at home, in addition to the structure currently
    assisting members of the military stationed away from home and
    citizens overseas. The Department will develop materials in
    additional languages and send nonpartisan information at regular
    intervals before federal elections to ensure that eligible
    servicemembers and their families — particularly first-time voters —
    have opportunities to register and vote if they wish.

        ensure that eligible servicemembers and their families —
        particularly first-time voters — have opportunities to register
        and vote if they wish.
    -   The **Department of Education** will prepare a toolkit of
        resources and strategies for increasing civic engagement at the
        elementary school, secondary school, and higher education level,
        to help more than 67 million students — and their families —
        learn about civic opportunities and responsibilities. The
        Department will also remind educational institutions of their
        existing obligations and encourage institutions to identify
        further opportunities to assist eligible students with voter
        registration.

    <!-- -->

    -   The **General Services Administration** will ensure **vote.gov**
        is a user-friendly portal for Americans to find the information
        they need most to register and vote.  When available in over ten
        languages and in a format accessible for voters with
        disabilities, vote.gov will make it easier for eligible users to
        register to vote or confirm their registration status.  Agencies
        across the federal government will link to vote.gov to encourage
        Americans to participate in the electoral process. 

    <!-- -->

    -   The **Department of Health and Human Services**’ Administration
        for Community Living will launch a new voting access hub to
        connect older adults and people with disabilities to
        information, tools and resources to help them understand and
        exercise their right to vote. The Indian Health Service will
        offer its patients assistance with voter registration. The
        Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will make it
        easier for consumers using HealthCare.gov to connect to voter
        registration services and receive assistance. CMS will also work
        with states on improving access to voter registration.

    <!-- -->

    -   The **Department of Justice** has created an online resource for
        the public that will provide links to state-specific information
        about registering and voting; detail the Department’s
        enforcement of federal voting rights laws and guidance it has
        issued to jurisdictions on the scope of those laws; and explain
        how to report potential violations. The Department will also
        provide information about voting to individuals in federal
        custody, facilitate voting by those who remain eligible to do so
        while in federal custody, and educate individuals before reentry
        about voting rules and voting rights in their states. And after
        the Census Bureau determines localities with specific
        responsibilities for language access, the Department will send
        letters to every covered jurisdiction and conduct outreach to
        each newly covered jurisdiction to facilitate compliance.

    <!-- -->

    -   The **Department of the Interior** will disseminate information
        on registering and voting, including through on-site events, at
        schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Education and Tribal
        Colleges and Universities, serving about 30,000 students.  The
        Department will also, where possible, offer Tribal College and
        University campuses for designation by states as voter
        registration agencies under the National Voter Registration Act.

    <!-- -->

    -   The **Department of Labor** will issue guidance encouraging
        states to designate the more than 2,400 American Job Centers,
        which provide employment, training, and career services to
        workers in every state, as voter registration agencies under the
        National Voter Registration Act. The Department of Labor will
        continue to require Job Corps centers to implement procedures
        for enrollees to vote, and where local law and leases permit,
        encourage Job Corps centers to serve as polling precincts.  The
        Department will also provide guidance that grantees can use
        federal workforce development funding, where consistent with
        program authority, to conduct nonpartisan voter registration
        efforts with participants.

    <!-- -->

    -   The **U.S. Small Business Administration** became the first
        federal agency to request designation as a voter registration
        agency pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act,
        committing to offer Americans seeking services at the agency’s
        District Field Offices the opportunity to register to vote.
    -   The **Department of Veterans Affairs** will provide materials
        and assistance in registering and voting for tens of thousands
        of inpatients and residents, including VA Medical Center
        inpatients and residents of VA nursing homes and treatment
        centers for homeless veterans. The Department will also
        facilitate assistance in registering and voting for homebound
        veterans and their caregivers through VA’s home-based and
        telehealth teams**. **

<!-- -->

-   ***Collaborating with and Listening to Voting Rights
    Stakeholders.*** Vice President Harris has brought together a broad
    coalition of voting rights stakeholders to listen and learn from one
    another on how to navigate attacks on voting rights and how to work
    toward passage of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting
    Rights Advancement Act. Vice President Harris has held listening
    sessions in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and
    Virginia. She has brought together leaders from Black communities,
    Latino communities, Asian American and Pacific Islander communities,
    Native American and Tribal communities, voters with disabilities,
    youth, poll workers and election officials, and democracy advocacy
    groups, among others.
-   ***Promoting Native American Voting Rights*.** President Biden’s
    [Executive Order on Promoting Access to
    Voting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-to-promote-voting-access/)
    also created a Native American Voting Rights Steering Group and
    directed the Steering Group to engage in meaningful and robust
    consultation with Tribal Nations and Native leaders to inform a
    report on the status of Native American voting rights. The Steering
    Group has held six consultations across the country with Tribal
    leaders and Tribal voting rights advocates, and an additional
    listening session with Native Hawaiians, to inform the drafting of a
    final report and recommendations. The Executive Order also directed
    that federal websites with voting information and opportunities to
    register be translated into Native American languages.

<!-- -->

-   ***Protecting Election Workers.*** In July, DOJ announced the
    [launch](https://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/justice-department-launches-task-force-combat-threats-against-election-workers-0)
    of a law enforcement task force that includes the FBI’s Criminal
    Investigative Division and the Department of Homeland Security’s
    Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to combat the
    increase of threats against election officials and election workers.
    In addition to receiving and assessing allegations and reports of
    threats against election workers, the task force will equip election
    officials with guidance, training, and other resources to help them
    identify and report threats against themselves and their fellow
    election workers.
-   ***Ensuring Secure and Reliable Elections.*** Democracy thrives when
    the infrastructure of democracy is strong. The President’s FY22
    Budget contains $100 million in Help America Vote Act (HAVA) grants
    to support the administration and security of our elections, the
    first time a president included funds for elections in a budget in
    over a decade. The Biden-Harris Administration will ensure
    transparency and clarity on the federal government’s roles and
    responsibilities in ensuring smooth elections, and strengthen
    efforts to provide state and local election officials with the
    support and resources they need.
-   ***Defending Against Foreign Interference***. President Biden
    [extended](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/07/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-foreign-interference-in-or-undermining-public-confidence-in-united-states-elections/)
    the national emergency with respect to foreign interference in or
    undermining confidence in United States elections, preserving the
    ability to impose sanctions on foreign actors who meddle in U.S.
    elections. The Administration also held Russian and Iranian actors
    accountable for attempting to interfere in the 2020 U.S. elections.
    The Department of Treasury sanctioned Russian and Iranian actors for
    attempting to interfere in the 2020 U.S. elections.

**Galvanizing Civic Engagement. ** President Biden believes that there
is not a single thing “We the People” cannot accomplish when we work
together. Yet toxic polarization is increasing across society and
Americans’ trust in institutions and in one another is decreasing. The
Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to support Americans’
ability to fully participate in civic life, foster a shared sense of
community, and empower people to strengthen our democracy from the
ground up.

-   ***Supporting National Service and Volunteerism***. The
    Administration is investing in national service and volunteer
    programs to bring together people from different backgrounds to
    serve their communities and country in common purpose, harnessing
    the power of civic engagement to tackle some of our nation’s most
    pressing challenges. The President’s American Rescue Plan (ARP)
    [provided](https://americorps.gov/newsroom/press-release/americorps-receives-historic-1-billion-american-rescue-plan)
    $1 billion to make service opportunities more accessible to all
    Americans.

<!-- -->

-   Supported by an additional $400 million in ARP funds, the
    Administration
    [launched](https://americorps.gov/newsroom/press-release/white-house-announces-400-million-public-health-americorps)
    Public Health AmeriCorps in partnership with the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention. This new program will develop a new
    generation of public health leaders who are ready to respond to the
    needs of the nation by providing public health service, particularly
    within underserved communities.

    Crisis at Home and
    Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/)
    that directed the creation of a new Civilian Climate Corps (CCC) to
    mobilize Americans to address climate change adaptation, resiliency,
    and mitigation. As highlighted above, the Build Back Better Act will
    provide a historic $15 billion to fund the creation of the CCC and
    expand service opportunities and increase the living allowance and
    education award for all AmeriCorps members.

<!-- -->

-   ***Promoting Civics Education.*** President Biden believes that all
    Americans should be afforded the opportunity to learn our nation’s
    rich history — including both our triumphs and the times at which we
    have failed to live up to our founding ideals — and build the skills
    required to fully participate in civic life and engage in the
    democratic process. In March, the Educating for American Democracy
    initiative, a diverse and cross-ideological collaboration of
    scholars and educators supported by an award from Department of
    Education and National Endowment for Humanities (NEH), released a
    [roadmap](https://www.educatingforamericandemocracy.org/) for
    educators’ use in teaching history and civics and provided guidance
    regarding funding available to support these efforts. The Department
    has committed to releasing additional resources for improving civics
    education and fostering civic engagement at the K–12 and higher
    education levels. Moreover, throughout the Year of Action, the
    National Endowment for Humanities’ [More Perfect
    Union](https://www.neh.gov/250) project will provide funding to
    support civics programming in all 56 states and jurisdictions.

**Strengthening Democracy by Advancing Workers’ Rights to Organize and
Bargain Collectively*.*** As President Biden said in his September 8,
2021, [Labor Day
Address](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/08/remarks-by-president-biden-in-honor-of-labor-unions/),
“\[w\]orkers who join unions gain power — power over the decisions and
the decision-makers that affect their lives. Workers’ voices are heard
and heeded. In a simple word, a union means there is democracy.
Democracy. Organizing, joining a union — that’s democracy in action.” 
Independent and democratically responsive unions are an essential
bulwark of democracies: They are multi-racial organizations that build
solidarity around their members’ shared interests and elect leadership
from their own ranks to give workers a voice in their workplaces, their
communities, and their nation’s political debates, serving as
counter-weights to the economic and political power of Wall Street and
large corporations.

-   ***Restoring and Expanding the Effective Right to Organize and
    Bargain Collectively***. President Biden has consistently called on
    Congress to pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to
    Organize (PRO) Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.
    These bills would ensure more private-sector workers and many more
    public-sector workers nationwide have a genuine right to organize
    and bargain collectively. President Biden has endorsed several
    proposals to expand labor rights to more workers, especially workers
    of color, women, and immigrants. These include guaranteeing labor
    rights to farmworkers and domestic workers—two segments of the labor
    force excluded from the protections of the National Labor Relations
    Act. For example, the National Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights,
    which Vice President Harris championed in the Senate and the
    President has endorsed, would expand federal labor law to domestic
    workers and create a new wage and standards board for regulating
    working conditions in the sector.
-   ***Identifying Executive Actions to Increase Worker Organizing and
    Empowerment.*** In April, President Biden issued an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/26/fact-sheet-executive-order-establishing-the-white-house-task-force-on-worker-organizing-and-empowerment/)
    establishing the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and
    Empowerment, led by Vice President Harris and Secretary of Labor
    Walsh. This first-of-its-kind government-wide initiative will issue
    recommendations to mobilize the federal government’s policies,
    programs, and practices to empower workers to organize and
    successfully bargain with their employers, including removing
    barriers to union organizing in the federal workplace and with
    respect to federal contractors. And in October, consistent with the
    Executive Order and a recommendation of the Task Force, the Office
    of Personnel Management issued two pieces of
    [guidance](https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-eo-14025-highlighting-bargaining-unit-employee-rights-join-union-and)
    highlighting bargaining unit employee rights for federal workers.
-   ***Restoring Federal Employees’ Organizing and Bargaining Rights.***
    On January 22, the President signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/22/executive-order-protecting-the-federal-workforce/)
    repealing the prior administration’s harmful actions on workplace
    protections, restoring the collective bargaining power of federal
    employee unions and protections for career civil servants and
    contractors.

**Promoting Information Integrity and Democratic Values in Technology.**
Our democracy depends on the free flow of ideas, informed public
discourse, and trust in institutions.The digital revolution has the
potential to foster these elements of democracy, but without sustained
care and commitment to shared standards, emerging technologies can be
used to spread disinformation, sow mistrust, and undermine and repress
fundamental rights and freedoms. The Biden-Harris Administration is
working to mitigate threats that mis- and disinformation pose to public
safety and national security while upholding the constitutional right to
freedom of expression, and it is committed to fostering a technological
ecosystem that promotes transparency and accountability and reflects
democratic values.

-   ***Delivering Broadband Access and Digital Literacy Skills***. As
    highlighted above, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $65
    billion to help ensure that every American has access to reliable
    high-speed internet, close the digital divide, and fund digital
    literacy initiatives to provide individuals with the skills needed
    to critically evaluate information online. These investments will
    democratize access to information, services, and opportunity while
    promoting information awareness and education.
-   ***Accelerating Information Integrity Research*.** As highlighted
    above, the Administration has organized an [interagency working
    group](https://www.nitrd.gov/coordination-areas/information-integrity-rd/)
    to prepare a strategic plan for research and development regarding
    information integrity across the federal government, and to promote
    coordination and foster multi-disciplinary collaboration. In
    September, the National Science Foundation’s novel [Convergence
    Accelerator](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/convergence-accelerator)
    initiative awarded $9 million to facilitate research on practices
    that help improve individual and community resistance to mis- and
    disinformation. In September, the Department of Education launched a
    [Digital Literacy Accelerator](https://tech.ed.gov/dla/) to identify
    promising school-based programs that help increase students’ digital
    literacy and combat misinformation.
-   ***Addressing Health Misinformation*****.** In July, the U.S.
    Surgeon General issued an
    [Advisory](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf)
    to warn the American public about the urgent threat of health
    misinformation, calling for a whole-of-society approach to address
    it. In November, the Surgeon General followed up with a
    [toolkit](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/health-misinformation-toolkit-english.pdf)
    for community members to discuss and address health misinformation.

<!-- -->

-   ***Implementing Safeguards for New Technology*.** The U.S. Office of
    Science and Technology Policy
    [outlined](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/10/22/icymi-wired-opinion-americans-need-a-bill-of-rights-for-an-ai-powered-world/)
    the Biden-Harris Administration’s intent to create a Bill of Rights
    for an Automated Society that aims to clarify existing rights and
    protections for people affected by emerging technologies, inform
    strategic enforcement of these rights, and advance the development
    and use of democratic rights-affirming technology use. To create
    this bill of rights for an automated society, the Office will lead a
    broad stakeholder engagement process which began with the issuance
    of a request for information on public and private use of biometric
    technologies and a series of [public
    panels](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/11/10/join-the-effort-to-create-a-bill-of-rights-for-an-automated-society/)
    on issues from employment to health care.
-   ***Protecting Americans’ Data*.** The President
    [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/09/executive-order-on-protecting-americans-sensitive-data-from-foreign-adversaries/)
    an Executive Order directing Cabinet-level assessments and
    recommendations to protect against risks from foreign adversaries’
    access to Americans’ sensitive data and continuing evaluation of
    transactions involving software applications that threaten U.S.
    national security. Additionally, the Executive Order warned that the
    United States may impose consequences on those who use connected
    software applications that engage in serious human rights abuses.
    The President’s [Executive Order on Promoting
    Competition](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/)
    also encouraged the FTC to establish rules on tech platforms’
    surveillance and accumulation of data to protect Americans’
    sensitive personal information.
-   ***Deploying Privacy-Enhancing Technologies for Better
    Governance.*** The United States realizes the importance of
    privacy-enhancing technologies and their role in facilitating and
    reinforcing democratic norms. The U.S. Census Bureau will launch a
    series of pilots to deploy privacy-enhancing technologies over the
    Year of Action. The Bureau will collaborate with both other U.S.
    federal agencies and the United Nations to build a platform that
    will enable secure multi-party computation, encryption technologies,
    and differential privacy to promote better data sharing both
    domestically and abroad.

**Combating Domestic Violent Extremism.** Domestic terrorism poses a
direct challenge to America’s national security, our democracy, and our
national unity. Acts of domestic terrorism often deliberately and
viciously target communities on the basis of hatred and bigotry, or, as
demonstrated by the attack on January 6, 2021, they are often committed
by those opposing government institutions. President Biden is taking
aggressive, comprehensive, and responsible action to counter this threat
while safeguarding bedrock American civil rights and civil liberties.

-   ***Developing a National Strategy for Countering Domestic
    Terrorism.*** On his first day in office, President Biden ordered
    the creation of the first-ever National Strategy for Countering
    Domestic Terrorism to improve the federal response to this
    challenge, while embracing the protections of civil rights and civil
    liberties. In June, the Administration
    [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf)
    the government-wide effort to prevent, disrupt, and deter unlawful
    domestic terrorist violence and confront the long-term contributors
    to domestic terrorism.
-   ***Addressing Extremism within Government.*** In January, Secretary
    of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III
    [ordered](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2492530/austin-orders-military-stand-down-to-address-challenge-of-extremism-in-the-ranks/)
    a DOD-wide stand down to discuss the problem of violent extremism in
    the ranks, and in April he established a countering violent
    extremism working group, directing DOD officials to review and
    update the military’s definition of extremism, and calling on the
    services to update transition instructions to help prevent those
    leaving the military from being recruited by violent extremist
    groups. In March, the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence
    [released](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2021/item/2194-unclassified-summary-of-assessment-on-domestic-violent-extremism)
    the unclassified executive summary of the comprehensive assessment
    acknowledging that enduring domestic violent extremism motivations
    stem from biases against minority populations. In addition, DOJ and
    DHS have each ordered an internal review to prevent violent
    extremism within the federal workforce.

**Supporting and Defending Independent Media.** Independent media that
informs citizens and holds the powerful accountable is essential to
building prosperous, resilient, and free societies. The Biden-Harris
Administration is committed to protecting press freedom, and to
promoting Americans’ access to independent journalism in the face of
unprecedented challenges that confront the industry.

-   ***Protecting Journalists’ Rights***. The Department of Justice
    changed long-standing policy by instituting new guidance from the
    Attorney General restricting prosecutors from using compulsory legal
    process to obtain information from or records of members of the news
    media acting within the scope of newsgathering activities. The
    Department is undertaking a review to further explain, develop, and
    codify the new policy.
-   ***Supporting Local Journalism*.** A highlighted above, the Build
    Back Better Act will provide tax credits for local newsrooms to hire
    journalists, helping to stabilize newsroom budgets in the face of
    unprecedented challenges and sustaining Americans’ access to the
    independent journalism that informs citizens and holds the powerful
    accountable.

**Proving that Democracy Delivers.** President Biden is committed to
restoring people’s faith in democracy to deliver tangible results. The
Biden-Harris Administration took swift action to address the COVID-19
pandemic and corresponding economic crisis, getting at least one vaccine
dose to more than 83% of the adult population and lowering unemployment
to 4.2%—the lowest level since before the pandemic. President Biden
signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP) to deliver immediate relief to
families and workers and build a lasting bridge to an equitable economic
recovery, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to rebuild our
crumbling infrastructure and provide shared prosperity. President Biden
is committed to passing the Build Back Better Act, a
once-in-a-generation investment in American families. Americans can see
it and feel it in their own lives that democracy is opening doors of
opportunity, guaranteeing more fairness and justice.

-   ***Passing and Implementing the American Rescue Plan (ARP)*.** This
    [landmark
    legislation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/)
    invests in an equitable recovery for underserved communities,
    including addressing food insecurity, health equity, unemployment
    benefits, and housing insecurity. The ARP provided billions of
    dollars to states for Medicaid funding for home- and community-based
    services, and direct support for students, toddlers, and infants
    with disabilities. The ARP provided $130 billion to help schools
    serve all students and is reducing the childhood poverty rate by
    more than 50%. The Administration is also committed to working with
    the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) and agency
    Inspector Generals to strengthen payment integrity and minimize the
    risk of waste, fraud, and abuse; and improving the overall award and
    administration of financial assistance programs with an increased
    focus on human-centered program and service design to achieve more
    equitable results.
-   ***Delivering the Transformational Infrastructure Investment and
    Jobs Act.*** This [historic
    legislation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/)
    will rebuild America’s roads, bridges, and rails; expand access to
    clean drinking water; ensure every American has access to high-speed
    internet; tackle the climate crisis; advance environmental justice;
    and invest in communities that have too often been left behind. The
    legislation will help ease inflationary pressures and strengthen
    supply chains by making long overdue improvements for our nation’s
    ports, airports, rail, and roads. It will drive the creation of
    good-paying union jobs and grow the economy sustainably and
    equitably so that everyone gets ahead for decades to come. Combined
    with the President’s Build Back Better Framework, it will add on
    average [1.5 million jobs per
    year](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/macroeconomic-consequences-of-the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-and-build-back-better-framework.pdf) for
    the next 10 years.
-   ***Promoting Competition and Limiting Abuse of Corporate Power.***
    Lack of competition threatens basic economic liberties, democratic
    accountability, and the welfare of American families, workers, and
    small businesses. Constraining the power of giant corporations and
    promoting competition is essential to building an economy that works
    for everybody and ensuring a healthy democracy. President Biden
    issued an historic [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/)
    establishing a whole-of-government effort to promote competition,
    including 72 initiatives by more than a dozen federal agencies to
    promptly tackle some of the most pressing competition problems
    across our economy. These initiatives range from calling on the
    leading antitrust agencies to revise merger guidelines to
    encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to address non-compete
    agreements that limit workers from moving to better jobs with higher
    wages.****
-   ***Improving the Federal Government’s Delivery of Services.*** In
    November, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with the
    President’s Management Council (PMC),
    [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/11/18/office-of-management-and-budget-launches-biden-harris-management-agenda-vision/)
    the Biden-Harris Management Agenda Vision, outlining the
    Administration’s roadmap for ensuring an equitable, effective, and
    accountable federal government that delivers results for all. The
    Administration reinforced its commitment to incorporating feedback
    from its customers to better respond to Americans’ needs and restore
    their trust in government. Agencies will review how administrative
    burdens may cause inequity in access and outcomes, and design,
    build, and manage service delivery for key life experiences that cut
    across federal agencies.

**Fighting Corruption**

**Prioritizing Anticorruption and Bringing Transparency to the Financial
System.** The global scourge of corruption corrodes public trust;
hobbles effective governance; distorts markets and equitable access to
services; undercuts development efforts; and contributes to national
fragility, extremism, and migration. The Biden-Harris Administration is
determined to hold corrupt actors accountable, both at home and abroad,
and to prevent authoritarians and kleptocrats from parking their
ill-gotten wealth in the United States, bringing additional transparency
to the U.S. and international financial systems.

-   ***Developing a National Strategy*.** In response to President
    Biden’s [National Security Study
    Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/memorandum-on-establishing-the-fight-against-corruption-as-a-core-united-states-national-security-interest/)
    establishing the fight against corruption as a core U.S. national
    security interest and a priority across the federal government, the
    Biden-Harris Administration released the first-ever [United States
    Strategy on Countering
    Corruption](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/06/fact-sheet-u-s-strategy-on-countering-corruption/).
    This strategy outlines how U.S. and its allies can curb illicit
    finance, effectively hold corrupt actors accountable, build stronger
    international partnerships, and improve foreign assistance.
-   ***Reducing the Ability of Corrupt Actors to Launder their
    Ill-gotten Gains via Shell Companies.*** Right now, criminals and
    kleptocrats can use opaque corporate structures to launder their
    criminal proceeds while keeping their identities hidden. The
    Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
    will shine a light on these bad actors by [finalizing
    requirements](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-proposed-rule-beneficial-ownership-reporting-counter-illicit)
    to make companies report who their true (“beneficial”) owners are.
    Companies will need to report this information at two key points:
    when new entities are formed (or, for non-U.S. companies, when they
    register with a state to do business in the U.S.), and when they
    change beneficial owners. FinCEN is also developing a new beneficial
    ownership database for this critical information so that law
    enforcement, among others, can use it to assist in investigations
    into corruption, money laundering, and other illicit finance
    transactions.
-   ***Supporting Enforcement.*** In June, the Financial Crimes
    Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
    [issued](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-first-national-amlcft-priorities-and-accompanying-statements)
    the first government-wide priorities for anti-money laundering and
    countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) policy. The
    Priorities, which identify corruption as a significant threat, will
    guide institutions’ allocation of compliance resources and inform
    the promulgation of regulations.

**Ensuring an Accountable and Transparent Government that Works for the
People.** A core mission of the Biden-Harris Administration is to earn
and keep the trust of the American people. To that end, the Biden-Harris
Administration has made significant strides in restoring ethics, the
rule of law, and democratic norms. President Biden is also pushing for
legislation to reform our campaign finance system so that it is free
from foreign interference and amplifies the voices of the people, not
powerful special interests.

-   ***Restoring Ethics in Government*.** On Day One, the President
    [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-ethics-commitments-by-executive-branch-personnel/)
    an Executive Order requiring administration officials to take a
    stringent ethics pledge, which extends lobbying bans, limits shadow
    lobbying, and makes ethics waivers more transparent. This Executive
    Order closes the “revolving door” of registered lobbyists or those
    registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act coming and
    going from government service to work for special interests.
-   ***Restoring DOJ’s Independence*.** The independence of the Justice
    Department is essential to its ability to carry out its mission to
    “ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all
    Americans.” The President issued an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-ethics-commitments-by-executive-branch-personnel/)
    on Day One requiring administration officials to commit to
    preserving DOJ’s independence. The White House and DOJ have each
    [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/21/white-house-releases-policy-for-contacts-with-agencies-and-departments/)
    strong policies restricting contacts between the White House and DOJ
    to prevent improper political interference in investigations and
    cases.
-   ***Reinstating a White House Visitor Log Policy.*** President Biden
    [reinstated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/2021/05/07/biden-harris-administration-reinstates-visitor-log-policy-will-be-first-administration-to-post-records-from-first-full-year-in-office/)
    a policy to voluntarily disclose White House visitor logs, ensuring
    that the American public knows whom the President, the Vice
    President, and their staffs meet with at the White House. The
    Biden-Harris Administration will be the first to post visitor logs
    from its first full year in office.
-   ***Releasing the President’s and Vice President’s Taxes*.**
    Restoring a longstanding norm, the President and Vice President
    released their 2020 federal income tax returns, as well as their
    financial disclosure reports. With this release, the President has
    shared a total of 23 years of tax returns with the American public,
    and both he and the Vice President will continue to release their
    tax returns and financial disclosure reports every year they are in
    office.
-   ***Adding Transparency to Federal Contracting*.** To maintain the
    public’s trust, government must be open and transparent about the
    entities that receive taxpayer dollars. The Biden-Harris
    Administration is implementing a requirement that all companies
    receiving federal contracts in excess of $500,000 publicly disclose
    their true owners.
-   ***Supporting Whistleblowers*.** Whistleblowers are essential to
    holding institutions and government accountable. In June, President
    Biden signed the bipartisan CFTC Fund Management Act, to preserve a
    whistleblower program that provides rewards to individuals who help
    root out waste, fraud and abuse. The SEC has also ramped up its
    whistleblower program: The SEC paid out a record $564 million to
    whistleblowers in FY2021 — more than the last 10 years combined —
    and it has taken enforcement action against employers for impeding
    whistleblowers from reporting misconduct to the Commission. In
    August, Chair Gensler
    [directed](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-whistleblower-celebration)
    staff to provide recommendations to the Commission to examine
    whether and how the whistleblower program could be further
    strengthened.
-   ***Protecting Scientific Integrity*.** The Administration
    [launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/memorandum-on-restoring-trust-in-government-through-scientific-integrity-and-evidence-based-policymaking/)
    a 50-member Scientific Integrity Task Force to restore public trust
    in government data and safeguard evidence-based policy making. The
    Task Force’s mandate includes a sweeping review across government
    and making recommendations to prevent improper political
    interference with research or the distortion of data. Upon
    completion of the review, policies supporting the highest standards
    in scientific integrity will be implemented across government.
-   ***Safeguarding the Census*.** On his first day in office, President
    Biden
    [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-ensuring-a-lawful-and-accurate-enumeration-and-apportionment-pursuant-to-decennial-census/)
    an Executive Order to restore the ability of the Census Bureau to
    deliver a national statistical portrait including every American.
    President Biden also provided career scientists with the time and
    independence to deliver results preserving the privacy and accuracy
    of the count.

<!-- -->

-   ***Reinvigorating U.S. Participation in the Open Government
    Partnership.*** The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to
    reengaging in OGP as a mechanism for driving innovative policies
    promote transparency, prevent corruption, and support civic
    participation. That commitment begins with renewing active
    collaboration with civil society during the Year of Action as the
    United States prepares its fifth National Action Plan.
-   ***Reinforcing a Commitment to Achieving Results and Evidence-Based
    Policy Making*.** Within the first two months, the Administration
    showed its commitment to effective government for all Americans by
    [directing](https://www.performance.gov/blog/a-11-part-6-return/)
    its agencies to develop measurable goals and track progress that
    improve the delivery of government services in key priority areas. 
    Furthermore, in June, OMB
    [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/M-21-27.pdf)
    agencies to use evidence whenever possible to further mission
    through operations, and to commit to build evidence where it is
    lacking.  Agencies are required to establish Learning Agendas and
    Agency Evaluation Plans. The Administration will be clear about our
    goals, show the public our plans to get there, and then will be
    transparent about our results as a way to continue building trust
    with the American public.

**Advancing Human Rights**

**Advancing Racial Justice and Equity.** Equal opportunity is the
bedrock of American democracy, and our diversity is one of our country’s
greatest strengths. The Biden-Harris Administration has centered racial
justice and equity as a priority since Day One to ensure all Americans
are able to fully participate in and enjoy the benefits of our democracy
and have a fair shot at the American dream. This includes a commitment
to a federal government that looks like America, with a historically
diverse Cabinet and a historically diverse roster of federal judicial
nominations.

-   ***Launching a Historic Whole-of-Government Initiative to Advance
    Racial Justice and Equity*.** On Day One, President Biden signed an
    [Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
    Underserved Communities Through the Federal
    Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/),
    an unprecedented effort to advance equity and redress systemic
    racism in policies, laws, and programs. The EO directs agencies to
    review barriers to accessing their policies and programs, creates an
    Equitable Data Working Group to inform the promotion of equity
    through more robust information and increased accountability, and
    directs OMB to identify opportunities to promote equity in the
    budget and throughout federal resources. Under President Biden,
    certain federal agencies are also now working to ensure that
    projects proposed for federal funding are reviewed for disparate
    impacts before they are awarded.
-   ***Narrowing the Racial Wealth Gap and Ensuring Opportunity for
    All.*** The Administration is expanding access to wealth-creators —
    home ownership and small business ownership — in communities of
    color and disadvantaged communities. Following President Biden’s
    [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-on-redressing-our-nations-and-the-federal-governments-history-of-discriminatory-housing-practices-and-policies/)
    directing his Administration to address racial discrimination in the
    housing market, HUD published an [interim
    regulation](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/10/2021-12114/restoring-affirmatively-furthering-fair-housing-definitions-and-certifications)
    in the Federal Register that requires HUD funding recipients to
    complete an assessment of fair housing concerns, identify fair
    housing priorities and goals, and then commit to meaningful actions
    to meet those goals and remedy identified issues. In June, President
    Biden directed the launch of a first-of-its-kind interagency effort
    to address inequity in home appraisals and conduct rulemaking to
    aggressively combat housing discrimination. Recognizing that the
    federal government spends more than $650 billion each year on
    purchasing goods and services, President Biden has
    [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-reforms-to-increase-equity-and-level-the-playing-field-for-underserved-small-business-owners/)
    agencies to use federal purchasing power to grow by 50% federal
    contracting with small disadvantaged businesses, including Black and
    Brown-owned businesses, translating to an additional $100 billion
    over five years, and helping more Americans realize their
    entrepreneurial dreams.
-   ***Embedding Equity into the Federal Workforce.*** In June,
    President Biden established a [government-wide
    initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/)
    to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in
    all parts of the federal workforce. This Executive Order reaffirms
    that the United States is at its strongest and most effective when
    our Nation’s public servants and decision-makers reflect the full
    diversity of the American people. As part of this effort, President
    Biden charged federal agencies with taking an ambitious, systematic
    approach to embedding DEIA in federal hiring and employment
    practices by reviewing whether members of underserved communities
    face barriers at the recruitment, retention and promotion stage of
    employment, or professional development, as well as advancing pay
    equity, promoting safe workplaces free from harassment, and
    expanding inclusive training.
-   ***Ensuring Equity in Transformational Infrastructure Investment.***
    President Biden signed the [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
    Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/)
    into law, baking equity explicitly into our federal infrastructure.
    The Act encompasses several provisions designed to mitigate historic
    inequities for minority and other underserved communities, including
    enhanced funding for reconnecting communities split by
    transportation projects, enhanced funding to discourage the use of
    racial profiling in traffic safety stops, and set-asides, subsidies,
    and priorities for disadvantaged businesses, disadvantaged or
    distressed communities, and low-income communities and households.
-   ***Promoting Inclusion, Belonging, and Opportunity for Asian
    Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders*.** In
    May,President Biden re-instated and expanded the [White House
    Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific
    Islanders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-establishes-the-white-house-initiative-on-asian-americans-native-hawaiians-and-pacific-islanders/)
    (AA and NHPIs) and expanded the Initiative’s mandate to coordinate a
    whole-of-government agenda to combat anti-Asian bias and to promote
    inclusion, belonging, and opportunity for AA and NHPIs.  For the
    first time in the history of the Initiative, Native Hawaiians are
    explicitly named and recognized. AA and NHPI communities together
    constitute the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and
    make invaluable contributions to our society, our economy, and our
    culture. Yet for far too long, systemic barriers to equity, justice,
    and opportunity have put the American dream out of reach for many AA
    and NHPI communities, and racism, nativism, and xenophobia against
    AA and NHPI communities continues to threaten safety and dignity of
    AA and NHPI families. The President also created a new White House
    [Senior
    Liaison](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/14/president-biden-announces-erika-l-moritsugu-as-deputy-assistant-to-the-president-and-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-senior-liaison/)
    charged with advancing the President’s priorities and ensuring that
    the Administration’s policies are inclusive of AA and NHPI
    communities.

**Advancing Gender Equity and Equality*.*** In a strong and sustainable
democracy, all people, regardless of gender, must have the opportunity
to reach their full potential and women and girls must be fully
represented at the tables at which decisions are made.

-   ***Establishing the Gender Policy Council*.** In March 2021,
    President Biden issued an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/)
    creating the White House Gender Policy Council to advance gender
    equity and equality in both domestic and foreign policy.  The
    existence of the Council reflects the commitment of the Biden-Harris
    Administration to a government-wide approach to gender equity and
    equality.
-   ***National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality*.** In October
    2021, as required by the President’s Executive Order, the
    Administration issued our country’s first-ever [National Strategy
    for Gender Equity and
    Equality](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/22/fact-sheet-national-strategy-on-gender-equity-and-equality/),
    making the United States one of only a handful of nations to do so.
    The strategy outlines a whole-of-government effort to improve gender
    equity and equality through both domestic and foreign policy,
    uniting our efforts to close gender gaps at home and abroad—and
    reinforcing our country’s commitment to this issue.
-   ***Addressing Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse*.** In the
    [National Strategy for Gender Equity and
    Equality](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/22/fact-sheet-national-strategy-on-gender-equity-and-equality/),
    the Administration committed to convene a U.S. government task force
    to address online abuse and harassment—including against women
    politicians, journalists, and activists, which undermines political
    and civic participation and the health of democracies. To address
    this issue globally, the U.S. will also lead a Global Partnership
    for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse, in
    partnership with Denmark’s Tech for Democracy Initiative, to bring
    together a core set of partner countries to jointly commit to a Year
    of Action—in consultation with government partners, international
    organizations, academics, civil society, and the private sector—to
    improve the response to technology-facilitated gender-based violence
    and promote effective prevention strategies.

**Promoting LGBTQI+ Equality.** To accelerate the march toward full
LGBTQI+ equality, the Administration has taken historic actions
beginning with one of the most comprehensive executive orders in history
on LGBTQI+ rights.

-   The President issued a Day One [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/)
    establishing that it is the official policy of the Administration to
    prevent and combat discrimination against LGBTQI+ individuals, and
    to fully enforce civil rights laws to prevent discrimination on the
    basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. As a result of this
    Executive Order, agencies have taken historic steps to advance
    non-discrimination protections for LGBTQI+ people in housing,
    healthcare, lending and credit services, and education. These steps
    include:

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it will
    interpret and enforce Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and
    Title IX to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual
    orientation and gender identity.
-   To address the pervasive discrimination LGBTQI+ families continue to
    face in housing, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD) announced it will interpret the Fair Housing Act to prevent
    discrimination in housing and rental assistance against LGBTQI+
    people. HUD will require state and local jurisdictions who receive
    funding through its Fair Housing Assistance Program to apply the
    same protections.
-   In response to the continuing discrimination many LGBTQI+
    individuals face in credit and lending services, the Consumer
    Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced that it will enforce
    against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender
    identity in credit and lending services.
-   The Department of Justice (DOJ) issued new guidance to agencies
    clarifying that Title IX sex discrimination protection includes
    protection on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and
    sex characteristics.
-   To ensure that LGBTQI+ Veterans are treated with dignity and
    respect, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has undertaken an
    agency-wide review of its policies and practices to remove barriers
    that transgender veterans and their families face.

<!-- -->

-   ***Welcoming Transgender Servicemembers*.** In his first week in
    office, President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/)
    reversing the ban on openly transgender servicemembers serving in
    the Armed Forces, enabling all qualified Americans to serve their
    country in uniform. President Biden believes that America’s strength
    is found in its diversity, and an inclusive military strengthens our
    national security. As a result of his Executive Order, the
    Department of Defense issued new policies which prohibit
    discrimination against transgender servicemembers, provide a path
    for transgender servicemembers to access gender-affirming medical
    care, and require that all transgender servicemembers are treated
    with dignity and respect. Patriotic transgender servicemembers are
    once again able to openly and proudly serve our Nation in uniform.

<!-- -->

-   ***Promoting LGBTQI+ Rights at Home and Abroad*.** President Biden
    signed a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/memorandum-advancing-the-human-rights-of-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-persons-around-the-world/)
    on Advancing the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
    Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Persons Around the World which
    directed all agencies engaged abroad to ensure that United States
    diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human
    rights of LGBTQI+ persons. His Memorandum establishes that it “shall
    be the policy of the United States to pursue an end to violence and
    discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity
    or expression, or sex characteristics, and to lead by the power of
    our example in the cause of advancing the human rights of LGBTQI+
    persons around the world.”

**Expanding Access and Inclusion for Disabled Americans.** The
Administration has taken significant steps to achieve a more inclusive,
accessible, and equitable country for people with disabilities.

-   ***Helping People with Disabilities During Economic Recovery.***
    President Biden’s American Rescue Plan included explicit provisions
    for people with disabilities:

<!-- -->

-   The American Rescue Plan provided states with an additional $11.4
    billion in Medicaid funding for home- and community-based services
    (HCBS) for one year. The additional Medicaid funding will help
    expand access to home and community-based services for people with
    disabilities as well as older adults, and ensure that caregivers are
    fairly compensated for their work.
-   The American Rescue Plan also provided direct support to students
    with disabilities and infants and toddlers with disabilities through
    the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. On July 1, the
    Department of Education released $2.58 billion to elementary and
    secondary education students with disabilities, $200 million for
    preschool students with disabilities, and $250 million for infants
    and toddlers with disabilities and their families.

<!-- -->

-   ***Ensuring Equitable Access to Transportation***. President Biden
    fought for the [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
    Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/),
    which provides several programs to help ensure equitable access to
    transportation, including enhanced funding to eliminate transit
    barriers to access for seniors and individuals with disabilities.
-   ***Expanding Access to Competitive Integrated Employment.*** The
    Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and
    the Social Security Administration released a [fact
    sheet](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ODEP/pdf/508_odep_cie_07152021.pdf)
    on funding opportunities to expand access to competitive integrated
    employment for youth and adults with disabilities.
-   ***Expanding Opportunities for Accessible, Affordable Housing.***
    The Departments of Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban
    Development
    [announced](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/ada/HHS-HUD_HousingFactSheetpdf.pdf)
    a partnership in July to increase access to accessible, integrated,
    affordable housing and the services that support community living
    for people with disabilities. One focus of the collaboration is
    working with states participating in the Money Follows the Person
    program and public housing authorities with available housing choice
    vouchers targeted to people leaving or at risk of entering nursing
    homes and other institutions, which can include people experiencing
    homelessness.

**Historic Support for Native Americans.** The Biden-Harris
Administration has taken swift and bold action to support and respect
Native communities.

-   ***Investing in Indian Country*.** President Biden’s ARP is the most
    significant funding legislation for Indian Country in the long
    history of our Nation. The ARP includes $31.2 billion for Tribal
    communities and Native people, $20 billion of which is going
    directly to Tribal governments as emergency funding to combat the
    crisis. The funding also includes $900 million for Bureau of Indian
    Affairs programs, in addition to funding for the Indian Health
    Service and Tribal & Native Hawaiian housing programs at the
    Department of Housing and Urban Development, described in further
    detail below. These new resources will open the way for Tribal
    Nations to create sustainable economies and redress severe
    deficiencies, equipping tribes to be more resilient in facing future
    pandemics and disasters. Additionally, the [Infrastructure
    Investment and Jobs
    Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/)
    follows through on our commitments to Tribal Nations. The Act
    designates significant funding specifically to underserved Tribal
    communities across the country, for essential improvements in
    transportation, water, sanitation, broadband, and climate
    resilience.
-   ***Honoring Indigenous People*.** On October 8, President Biden
    became the first President to recognize [Indigenous Peoples’
    Day](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/10/08/a-proclamation-indigenous-peoples-day-2021/),
    celebrating Indigenous peoples’ resilience and strength as well as
    the immeasurable positive impact that they have made on every aspect
    of American society.
-   ***Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships*.** On January 26,
    only six days into office, the President issued a
    [memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-on-tribal-consultation-and-strengthening-nation-to-nation-relationships/)
    on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation
    Relationships, stating that it is the Administration’s policy to
    respect Tribal sovereignty and self-governance and committing to
    regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations.
    The White House held meetings with representatives at all federal
    agencies to provide expectations and training on implementing the
    Presidential Memorandum; agencies conducted almost 90 consultation
    sessions in February, March and April; and more than 80 federal
    agencies so far have created and revised their Tribal consultation
    plans, ensuring strong communication and constructive relationships.
-   ***Advancing Native American Education*.** President Biden issued an
    [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/10/19/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for-black-americans/)
    in October establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing
    Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Native
    Americans and Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities.
-   ***Improving Public Safety and Criminal Justice for Native Americans
    and Addressing the Crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous
    People.*** In November, President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/15/executive-order-on-improving-public-safety-and-criminal-justice-for-native-americans-and-addressing-the-crisis-of-missing-or-murdered-indigenous-people/)
    directing the Departments of Justice, Interior, Homeland Security,
    and Health and Human Services to create a strategy to improve public
    safety and justice for Native Americans and to address the crisis of
    missing or murdered Indigenous peoples. Pursuant to the Executive
    Order, DOJ, DOI, and DHS will coordinate to address specific law
    enforcement issues, as well as providing support for Tribal Nations
    to implement Tribally-centered responses. The Executive Order also
    directs HHS to develop a plan for prevention and survivor support
    initiatives.

**Combating Hate Crimes and Hate Incidents.** Hate has no place in a
democratic society, but all too often throughout our history, acts of
hate and violence have been directed at marginalized communities. The
Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to help prevent and improve
the response to hate crimes and incidents.

-   ***New Hate Crimes Law and Hate Incidents*.** In May, the President
    [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/20/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-the-covid-19-hate-crimes-act/)
    into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. This bipartisan legislation
    addresses the unacceptable and un-American increase in hate crimes
    and violence against Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific
    Islanders during the COVID-19 pandemic. This critical new law
    strengthens the federal coordination and response to hate crime
    incidents by appointing a designated official at the DOJ to
    facilitate the expedited review of hate crimes related to COVID-19,
    and provides, among other things, that the Attorney General will
    issue guidance to state, local, and tribal agencies to establish
    online reporting of hate crime or incidents that is equally
    effective for people with disabilities and that is available in
    multiple languages. It also includes the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act,
    which seeks to improve hate crimes reporting to the federal
    government by funding and supporting law enforcement prevention,
    training, and education on hate crimes and establishing hate crime
    victim support and assistance services like hate crime reporting
    hotlines.
-   ***Reinvigorating Our Response to Hate Crimes*.** On March 30, 2021,
    Attorney General Merrick B. Garland’s first directive to the
    Department of Justice was a 30-day expedited [internal
    review](https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1381396/download) to
    determine how the department could deploy all the tools at its
    disposal to counter the rise in hate crimes and hate incidents.
    Informed by that review, and with new tools provided by the
    *COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and Jabara-Heyer No Hate Act*, on May 27,
    Attorney General Garland issued a [comprehensive
    memorandum](https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1399221/download)
    on improving the Department’s efforts to combat hate crimes and hate
    incidents.
-   ***Addressing Racism and Intolerance Against Asian Americans, Native
    Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders*.** In his first week in office,
    the President issued a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-condemning-and-combating-racism-xenophobia-and-intolerance-against-asian-americans-and-pacific-islanders-in-the-united-states/)
    condemning racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against the AA and
    NHPI community, stating that the government should combat racism,
    xenophobia, and intolerance against AA and NHPIs and should work to
    ensure that all members of AA and NHPI communities — no matter their
    background, the language they speak, or their religious beliefs —
    are treated with dignity and equity. The President has directed all
    departments and agencies to ensure that their official actions —
    especially in responding to COVID-19 — mitigate anti-Asian bias and
    xenophobia.

**Protecting Religious Freedom.** The Biden-Harris Administration is
safeguarding the bedrock principles of religious freedom and tolerance
as enshrined in the United States Constitution.

-   ***Ending the Muslim Ban***. On his first day in office, President
    Biden
    [rescinded](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/proclamation-ending-discriminatory-bans-on-entry-to-the-united-states/)
    the prior administration’s discriminatory travel ban that prevented
    individuals from primarily Muslim and African countries from
    entering the United States.
-   ***Reestablishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and
    Neighborhood Partnerships*.** Within weeks of taking office,
    President Biden
    [reestablished](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-reestablishes-the-white-house-office-of-faith-based-and-neighborhood-partnerships/)
    the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships,
    which was originally established by President George W. Bush and
    continued by the Obama-Biden administration. The mission of the
    office is to serve people in need by working with religious and
    secular organizations. The Office also helps to ensure that the
    voices of religious and community leaders are heard throughout the
    administration.

**Combating Human Trafficking.** As highlighted above, the Biden-Harris
Administration reaffirmed its commitment to responding to this abhorrent
crime that disproportionately impacts some of the most vulnerable and
underserved members of our society by releasing a new [National Action
Plan to Combat Human
Trafficking](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/National-Action-Plan-to-Combat-Human-Trafficking.pdf).
The plan lays out the foundational pillars of U.S. and global
anti-trafficking efforts — **prevention, protection, prosecution, and
partnerships**.

**Taking Strong Action to Reform Our Criminal Justice System and
Ensuring Equal Justice for All.** In a healthy democracy, citizens must
be afforded equal justice under the law and be free from state violence.
From enhancing police accountability, to reforming law enforcement and
investing in complementary community-based public strategies, to
improving prosecution and incarceration practices, to supporting
reentry, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken concrete action to
reform the criminal justice system and begin to root out racial
disparities.

-   ***Moratorium on Capital Punishment*.** The Justice Department
    [imposed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-imposes-moratorium-federal-executions-orders-review)
    a moratorium on federal executions and is reviewing practices and
    procedures related to capital punishment. 
-   ***Ensuring Constitutional Policing.*** The Department of Justice
    (DOJ) rescinded guidance issued in the previous Administration that
    curtailed the use of consent decrees, including within
    investigations into patterns or practices of discrimination and
    misconduct by police departments. Pattern and practice
    investigations and consent decrees are critical tools to promote
    constitutional policing in jurisdictions where reform is warranted. 
-   ***Reforming Federal Law Enforcement Practices.*** In September, the
    Department of Justice
    [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-announces-department-wide-policy-chokeholds-and-no-knock-entries)
    a ban on use of chokeholds and carotid restraints except where
    deadly force is necessary, and new restrictions on no-knock
    warrants—implementing reforms administratively that the President
    had called on Congress to enact through the George Floyd Justice in
    Policing Act. The Department also implemented a new policy requiring
    federal agents to wear body cameras when executing search warrants
    and pre-planned arrests. Also in September, the Department of
    Homeland Security
    [announced](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/09/29/dhs-announces-continued-efforts-outlines-steps-taken-address-best-practices-law)
    the formation of the Law Enforcement Coordination Council (LECC) —
    the Department’s first unified law enforcement coordination body,
    chaired by the Secretary — to comprehensively review and revise its
    policies and training on use of force, compliance with civil rights
    and privacy interests, and other matters. In July, the Department of
    the Interior
    [created](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-announces-task-force-strengthen-trust-and-collaboration-between-law)
    a task force to study and recommend reforms for the its law
    enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Park Police. 
-   ***Improving Prosecutorial Guidance to Prevent Unduly Harsh
    Charging.*** The Department of Justice (DOJ) withdrew guidance
    issued in the previous Administration that required prosecutors to
    always charge cases in a way that generated the harshest sentences,
    replacing it with guidance that restored discretion to make
    decisions about charging, plea agreements, and advocacy at
    sentencing based on an individualized assessment of relevant facts.
-   ***Supporting Legislation to Reform Racial Disparities in
    Sentencing.*** President Biden endorsed the EQUAL Act, and the
    Department of Justice also advocated its support for the bill, which
    would eliminate the racist crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity
    once and for all and make the change fully retroactive.
-   ***Limiting Use of Private Prisons.*** President Biden directed DOJ
    not to renew contracts for privately operated detention facilities,
    covering the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and U.S. Marshals Service
    (USMS). When completed, this will result in at least 14,000 people
    in BOP custody and 10,000 people in USMS custody being moved out of
    private prisons.
-   ***Support for Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs.***
    Black boys and young men ages 15–34 make up 2% of the population but
    are 37% of homicide victims, and homicide is the leading cause of
    death for Black men under the age of 45. Until this Administration,
    however, CVI programs like violence interrupters and hospital-based
    programs, which are demonstrated to reduce violence by up to 60%,
    have been badly underfunded. Under President Biden, the Department
    of the Treasury and Department of Education issued guidance stating
    that CVI programs are eligible uses of American Rescue Plan
    funds—both the $350 billion in aid to state, Tribal, and local
    governments and the $122 billion to school districts. The
    Administration pivoted 26 existing grant programs across five
    agencies to support CVI. And the administration continues to seek $5
    billion in dedicated funding for CVI programs through the Build Back

    federal sentences who were sent to home confinement by the Bureau of
    Prisons—in light of the risks they faced in institutional settings
    due to the COVID-19 pandemic—are not unnecessarily returned to
    prison at the end of the pandemic, the President directed the BOP
    and Office of the Pardon Attorney to implement an expedited clemency
    screening program for drug offenders with less than 4 years left on
    their sentences.

    the Attorney General to consider expanding the Department of
    Justice’s access to justice work. In October, the Attorney
    General announced the reestablishment of the Office for Access to
    Justice as a standalone component within the Justice Department
    dedicated to improving the federal government’s understanding of and
    capacity to address the most urgent legal needs of communities
    across America. The President also reinvigorated the White House
    Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable to prioritize and expand access to
    legal services and federal programs, including in the areas of
    criminal indigent defense, civil legal aid, and pro bono services.
