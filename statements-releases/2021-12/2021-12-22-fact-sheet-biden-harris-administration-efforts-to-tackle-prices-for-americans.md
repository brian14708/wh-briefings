title: "FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Efforts to Tackle Prices for\
  \ Americans"
---
 
The American economy has delivered stronger growth in President Biden’s
first year of office than any other president in the last 50 years.
Since Day 1, President Biden has been laser-focused on reopening the
economy and has taken aggressive action to lower the price of goods and
gasoline for Americans.  
  
The President’s Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force has made significant
progress to alleviate bottlenecks that are rooted in the global
pandemic, and today the President will convene members of his Cabinet
and private sector CEOs for an update.

-   **Moving record amounts of goods to keep shelves stocked:** Due to
    record demand, our nation’s ports are moving more goods than ever
    before. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach—which handle 40% of
    the nation’s containerized imports—[moved 15% more
    containers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nec/briefing-room/2021/12/17/months-of-coordination-bring-signs-of-good-cheer/)
    between January and November this year than 2018, the previous
    record. That’s why the President convened our largest ports and
    retailers to move towards 24/7 operations to help alleviate
    bottlenecks in our global supply chain and ensure the smooth
    delivery of goods for businesses large and small. Retailers are
    [confirming](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/politics/biden-supply-chain-holiday/index.html)
    shelves are stocked and they are prepared for a robust holiday
    season.

The Administration also continues to closely watch how the Omicron
variant could compound global supply chain disruptions at Asian or U.S.
ports, and is working with ports around the world to prioritize critical
medical supplies and PPE.

-   **Cracking down on delays and shining a light on profiteering:**
    When cargo sit on docks for extended periods, bottlenecks worsen,
    goods can’t make it to stores, and prices can rise for consumers.
    That’s why the Administration worked with the Ports of Los Angeles
    and Long Beach in early November to impose a fee on ocean carriers
    if their cargo sits on docks for over eight days. Since then, the
    number of containers sitting on the docks for over eight days has
    fallen [by nearly
    50%](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nec/briefing-room/2021/12/17/months-of-coordination-bring-signs-of-good-cheer/)
    and the average amount of time containers sit on docks has fallen by
    a week. The price of shipping a container between Asia and the West
    Coast has [fallen by more than
    25%](https://fbx.freightos.com/freight-index/FBX01?vgo_ee=%2BjFcGnLfZ0Rb7Kpf17tmOSDubjtu2oxuQBxUtyX%2ByCk%3D)
    since its peak in September. Nevertheless, the price of shipping
    remains elevated and, as the ocean carriers report profits 9 times
    larger than a year ago, the President looks forward to working with
    Congress on bipartisan legislation to strengthen the Federal
    Maritime Commission.  
-   **Launching the Port Action and Trucking Action Plans:** This week,
    the Administration is announcing $230 million in Port Infrastructure
    Development Grants—the only federal grant program wholly dedicated
    to investments in port infrastructure. This is the latest step in
    the [Port Action
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/09/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-action-plan-for-americas-ports-and-waterways/)
    (PAP) announced in November, which accelerates investments in our
    ports, waterways, and freight networks after passage of the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. The PAP helped the Port of Savannah
    launch three “pop-up” container yards to reduce congestion and
    includes $12.6 million for marine highway projects and over $50
    billion in highway funding that can be used to modernize freight
    corridors. This builds on investments in port and freight
    infrastructure communities have made using the American Rescue Plan
    such as Florida’s [$250 million investment in
    ports](https://www.flgov.com/2021/07/29/governor-desantis-announces-250-million-to-support-economic-recovery-for-florida-ports/).
-   **Taking bold action to reduce gasoline prices:** Last month, the
    President authorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to make 50
    million barrels of crude oil available to increase global oil
    supplies. The Administration also engaged with Japan, South Korea,
    India, and the United Kingdom, each of whom acted in parallel to
    boost supplies, as well as with OPEC+ members who maintained their
    schedule for increasing production levels heading into January.
    These actions have helped contribute to falling prices at the pump.

Last week, the Administration announced its Trucking Action Plan (TAP)
to recruit and retain more truckers by improving job quality. The TAP
will help states reduce their commercial drivers license backlogs, kick
off a 90-day challenge to expand Registered Apprenticeships with the
private sector, step up the recruitment of veterans, and launch a
Driving Good Jobs Initiative to address issues that hurt retention such
as unpaid wait times.  **The average price at the pump is down 12 cents
per gallon since the peak last month, and prices are continuing to
fall.  **

**The average price at the pump is now $3.30. This price is in line with
the real price of gasoline over the previous ten years from
2011-2020. **While current price levels aren’t unprecedented, the
President believes that they are too high especially given that we are
emerging from a once-in-a-century pandemic.

loading="lazy" width="500" height="281" />  
  
**Right now, twenty-one states have state-level averages below $3.15.** 
That puts those states below both the 10-year real average of $3.30 per
gallon and also below the 20-year real average of $3.18 per gallon. That
number is increasing week by week, with only 11 states below that $3.15
threshold a month ago.
