title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Senator Bob\_Dole"
---
 
A month after being sworn in as President, one of the first
conversations I had with anyone outside the White House was with our
dear friends, Bob and Elizabeth Dole, at their home in Washington. Bob
had recently been diagnosed with lung cancer, and I was were there to
offer the same support, love, and encouragement that they showed me and
Jill when our son Beau battled cancer, and that the Doles have shown us
over the half century we’ve been friends.   
  
Like all true friendships, regardless of how much time has passed, we
picked up right where we left off, as though it were only yesterday that
we were sharing a laugh in the Senate dining room or debating the great
issues of the day, often against each other, on the Senate floor. I saw
in his eyes the same light, bravery, and determination I’ve seen so many
times before.   
  
In the Senate, though we often disagreed, he never hesitated to work
with me or other Democrats when it mattered most. He and Ted Kennedy
came together to turn Bob’s lifelong cause into the Americans with
Disabilities Act — granting tens of millions of Americans lives of
greater dignity. On the Social Security Commission, he led a bipartisan
effort with Pat Moynihan to ensure that every American could grow old
with their basic dignity intact. When he managed the bill to create a
federal holiday in the name of Martin Luther King, Jr. — a bill that
many in his own caucus opposed — I will never forget what he said to our
colleagues: “No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class
citizens.”  
  
Another bipartisan effort, the McGovern-Dole International Food for
Education and Child Nutrition Program, provided school meals and food
for nursing mothers and young children. It saved the lives of countless
young people who would otherwise have died in infancy — and brought
dignity to tens of millions of families at home and abroad. This work,
for Bob, was about more than passing laws. It was written on his
heart.  
  
Bob was an American statesman like few in our history. A war hero and
among the greatest of the Greatest Generation. And to me, he was also a
friend whom I could look to for trusted guidance, or a humorous line at
just the right moment to settle frayed nerves. I will miss my friend.
But I am grateful for the times we shared, and for the friendship Jill
and I and our family have built with Liddy and the entire Dole family.  
  
Bob was a man to be admired by Americans. He had an unerring sense of
integrity and honor. May God bless him, and may our nation draw upon his
legacy of decency, dignity, good humor, and patriotism for all time.
