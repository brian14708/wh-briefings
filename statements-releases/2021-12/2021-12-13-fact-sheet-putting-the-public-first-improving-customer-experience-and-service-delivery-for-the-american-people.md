title: "FACT SHEET: Putting the Public First: Improving Customer Experience and Service\
  \ Delivery for the American\_People"
---
 
The Federal Government interacts with millions of people each day and
provides vital services during some of the most critical moments in
people’s lives. Whether searching for vaccine safety information,
claiming retirement benefits, receiving health insurance, passing
through a security checkpoint, or checking the status of a farm loan
application, Americans expect Government services to be responsive to
their needs. But too often, people have to navigate a tangled web of
Government websites, offices, and phone numbers to access the services
they depend on. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring
an effective, equitable, and accountable Government that meets the needs
of its people.  
  
Today, the President is taking decisive action to promote fiscal
stewardship by improving the Government’s service delivery to its
customers, the American people. The President will sign an Executive
Order, *Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to
Rebuild Trust in Government*, directing that Government leaders account
for the experiences of the public in seeking Government services. The
President is making sure we’re building accountability and transparency
into everything we do and that we’re good stewards of taxpayer dollars.
As the President has said: “We have to prove democracy still works, that
our government still works and can deliver for our people.”  
  
The Executive Order directs Federal agencies to put *people* at the
center of everything the Government does. Specifically, the Executive
Order includes 36 customer experience (CX) improvement commitments
across 17 Federal agencies, all of which aim to improve people’s lives
and the delivery of Government services. The Executive Order also
creates a sustained, cross-government service delivery process that
aligns to the moments that matter most in people’s lives – like turning
65, having a child, or applying for a small business loan. As part of
this framework, the Administration will work to identify and define
critical services that meet customers’ needs and expectations, assess
performance delivery and report it publicly, incorporate customer
feedback during each interaction, and ultimately ensure services deliver
a better experience to the public. Every interaction between the
Government and the public, whether it involves filing taxes or renewing
a passport, is an opportunity to deliver the value, service, and
efficiency that the public expects and deserves.  
  
The Government has designated [35 High-Impact Service
Providers](https://www.performance.gov/cx/assets/files/HISP-listing-2021.pdf)
in Federal agencies as key service providers due to the volume and types
of benefits, services, and programs they deliver to the public. As part
of this Executive Order, agencies commit to putting their customers at
the center of everything they do. These actions include modernizing
programs, reducing administrative burdens, and piloting new online tools
and technologies that can provide a simple, seamless, and secure
customer experience. The types of high-quality interactions the American
people should expect to have with their Government, and that the
Executive Order addresses, include:

**RETIRING**

For the [54.1
million](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20America/2020ProfileOlderAmericans.Final_.pdf)
Americans who are over the age of 65, and the nearly 4 million Americans
who become eligible for Social Security benefits each year, who manage
their retirement and health care benefits:

-   Retirees will be able to claim their benefits online, receiving
    updates on the status of their application throughout the process.
-   Medicare recipients will receive personalized online tools so they
    can save money on drugs, manage their health care, access expanded
    customer support options (including an in-network pharmacy finder
    tool), and enjoy a streamlined enrollment experience with the Social
    Security Administration.

**FILING AND MANAGING YOUR TAXES**

For the [240
million](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-irs-data-book)
individuals and businesses who file tax returns each year and the [167
million](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/national-taxpayer-advocate-assesses-tax-filing-season-and-identifies-areas-for-irs-improvement-in-midyear-report-to-congress#:~:text=During%20the%202021%20filing%20season,during%20the%202019%20filing%20season.&text=The%20IRS%20reported%20a%20%22Level,calls%20reaching%20a%20telephone%20assistor.)
people who call the IRS for help: 

-   Filers will save time by having the option to schedule customer
    support call-backs.
-   Filers will be provided with new online tools and services to ease
    the payment of taxes, which may include automatic direct deposit
    refunds based on prior year tax returns, tax credit eligibility
    tools, and expanded electronic filing options. 

**SURVIVING A DISASTER**

For the [25
million](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20210318/fema-reflects-historic-year)
individuals, families, and small businesses who live through a Federally
recognized natural disaster each year:

-   After a disaster, more survivors will be able to focus on helping
    their families, businesses, and communities because of streamlined
    assistance processes, rather than having to navigate a complex
    Government bureaucracy to get the help they need. Disaster survivors
    will no longer need to navigate multiple assistance forms across
    multiple agencies to get the help they need, saving time and energy
    to allow them to focus on their recovery and well-being. Survivors
    will have access to more flexible mechanisms to provide supporting
    documentation, such as virtual inspections and submitting photos of
    disaster damage from a mobile phone.

**TRAVELING**

For the more than [2
million](https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/factsheets/tsa-numbers) daily
passengers who travel through U.S. airports each year:

-   Americans will be able to renew their passports securely online,
    saving time from having to wait and the effort and cost required to
    print, go to a post office, and use a paper check. This new online
    process will be done with safety and security.
-   Passengers will have shorter security and check-in lines at airports
    due to increased use of technologies, like new security machines and
    computers with advanced screening features that streamline these
    processes.
-   Passengers with urgent, time-sensitive questions or concerns will
    find it easier to connect with and get help from the Transportation
    Security Administration through additional channels of
    communication.

**FINANCING POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION**

For the 1 in 6 Americans, or approximately [45
million](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio) people,
who are managing their student loans:

-   Direct Loan borrowers will need to navigate only a single repayment
    portal on StudentAid.gov, so that they can apply for, manage, and
    repay their loans without having to visit multiple websites and
    manage multiple sets of credentials for different aspects of their
    student loans.
-   Public Service Loan Forgiveness candidates, including civil servants
    and active-duty service members, will be able to apply for the
    program with less paperwork than currently and without having to
    fill out forms with information they have already provided to the
    Federal government previously.
-   Students and borrowers can receive relevant recommendations for
    other benefits and services they may qualify for, like health care
    subsidies, broadband support, and food assistance, in order to
    connect them with support to lower additional economic barriers to
    post-secondary education completion.  

**MANAGING VA HEALTH CARE AND BENEFITS**

For the [200,000](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/programs/tap)
service members who transition to civilian life each year and the more
than [18
million](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2021/veterans-day.html)
Veterans across the United States:

-   Service members and veterans will be able to use Login.gov accounts
    to access VA.gov and its information about the health care and
    benefits they’ve earned, and outdated and duplicate VA.gov sign-in
    options will be removed across VA websites and mobile apps.
-   Veterans and beneficiaries, and their caregivers or other designated
    representatives, will be able to access digital services through a
    single, integrated, and fully inclusive digital platform on VA.gov
    and a flagship VA mobile application so that VA’s customers don’t
    have to use separate portals, websites, or mobile applications when
    managing their health care and benefits online.  

**REDUCING BARRIERS FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING POVERTY**

For the [tens of
millions](https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap)
of Americans who rely on critical safety net programs:

-   Low-income families can more easily enroll in Federal benefits and
    recertify their income status more easily across programs using
    direct certification, a process that automatically certifies
    income-eligible individuals without extra paperwork, instead of
    managing multiple, complicated processes that waste time and cause
    frustration.
-   Those navigating across multiple programs can expect a “no-wrong
    door” approach – interacting with one Federal program can help get
    them connected with other benefits and streamline enrollment for
    which they are eligible.  

**FINANCING YOUR BUSINESS**

For the more than [30
million](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf)
small business owners who may seek credit to grow their businesses and
the [90% of U.S.
farms](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/95547/eib-214.pdf?v=5651)
that are small and family-owned:

-   Small business owners will be able to submit applications knowing
    that they will receive prompt and consistent service, such as
    reduced call center wait times, across Small Business Administration
    programs, including loans, grants, and certifications, because the
    agency will measure these experiences.
-   Farmers will be able to quickly and easily apply for loans from the
    Department of Agriculture with the support of digital tools, saving
    time, reducing unnecessary paperwork, and avoiding unnecessary trips
    to a county office.

**SUPPORTING WOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN**

For women seeking maternal health care and nutrition access in the
critical early years of children’s lives:

-   More patients will be able to get more automated access to their
    electronic prenatal, birth, and postpartum health records (including
    lab results, genetic tests, ultrasound images, and clinical notes)
    to improve their experience and support better care coordination.
-   For the women who deliver [43% of all
    births](https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chapter-2-Advancing-Maternal-and-Infant-Health-by-Extending-the-Postpartum-Coverage-Period.pdf)
    in the United States each year covered by Medicaid, patients will
    have access to safer and more equitable care because of strengthened
    requirements for maternal health quality measurement, including
    perinatal quality and patient care experience, and measures will be
    evaluated by race and ethnicity to better identify and address
    inequities in maternal health care delivery and outcomes.
-   [7 million](https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/wic-program) women and their
    children, including half of all infants born in the United States
    who are eligible for benefits through the Special Supplemental
    Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), will be
    able to grocery shop online, providing an alternative way to access
    healthy foods for their families.  

**MANAGING YOUR HEALTH**

All Americans should be able to access the vital health services they
need at the time that they need them. Under this Executive Order:

-   Patients will have increased ability to use telehealth with their
    doctors, connecting rural Americans, individuals with disabilities,
    or individuals seeking the convenience of remote options with the
    health care they need.

**UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ONCE**

For the more than [30
million](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/migration/guidance/calculating-migration-expectancy.html)
people who move each year, and approximately 2 million people who change
their names each year:

-   Individuals who move their residences can update their addresses one
    time with the Federal Government and choose which other Federal or
    State entities they would like that information shared with.
-   Individuals seeking to change their names will be able to do so
    without having to appear in person at a Social Security
    Administration office, provide a wet signature, and submit original
    documents.

**ADDITIONAL ACTIONS**

-   USA.gov will be redesigned as a centralized and streamlined “digital
    Federal front door” so the public can get access to all Government
    benefits, services, and programs in just 1 to 3 clicks, taps, or
    commands from the USA.gov homepage, without navigating duplicate and
    outdated Federal websites. That home page will feature a new user
    experience based on the key life events, moments that matter most,
    and top tasks that Americans experience throughout their lives when
    interacting with Government.
-   Tribal communities will be able to expect more streamlined and
    integrated grants application processes, rather than having to
    provide information over and over again to the Federal government
    and navigate across multiple agency websites.
-   The Fish and Wildlife Service will provide more of their service
    transactions online, including for special use permits for National
    Wildlife Refuge System locations and several high-volume application
    forms required for individuals and businesses that import, export,
    or re-export animals, plant, and their products internationally.
    These transactions currently can take weeks or even months to
    process, and can require multiple paper forms to be mailed.

This Executive Order is a continuation of the launch of the [President’s
Management Agenda (PMA) Vision](https://www.performance.gov/pma/), which
prioritizes delivering excellent, equitable, and secure Federal services
and customer experience. The PMA recognizes that improving the delivery,
efficiency, security, and effectiveness of Government programs will
advance equity, enhance people’s everyday interactions with public
services, and provide greater opportunities for those who need it the
most.  
  
The Government’s primary mission is to serve. By placing people at the
center of everything we do, the Government will be able to deliver
timely, modern, and secure services to you – the people. We will rebuild
trust in our Government, ensure no one is left behind, and inspire
others to join us in serving future generations of Americans.
