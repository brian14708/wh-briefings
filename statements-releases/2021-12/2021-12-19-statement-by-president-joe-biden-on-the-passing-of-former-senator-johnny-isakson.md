title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Passing of Former Senator Johnny Isakson
---
 
Jill and I and the entire Biden family are saddened to learn of the
passing of Johnny Isakson, the distinguished former United States
Representative and Senator from Georgia.  
  
Senator Isakson was a colleague and a friend.  We served together on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, traveled together, and found common
ground built on mutual respect for each other and the institutions that
govern our nation.   
  
Johnny was a proud Republican, but he put country before party, and
valued building consensus over political combat. I always loved Johnny’s
description of the only division he saw as between “friends and future
friends.”  
  
In Johnny’s memory, let us heed the wisdom he offered upon retiring from
the Senate, where he urged everyone to devote less energy to describing
problems and more effort to working together to provide answers.  
  
Johnny Isakson was a patriot and a gentleman.   
  
Georgia has lost an indispensable son.  
  
America has lost an exemplary leader.  
  
Our prayers are with Dianne and the entire Isakson family.
