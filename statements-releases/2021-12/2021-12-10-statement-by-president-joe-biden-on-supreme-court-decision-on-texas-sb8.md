title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Supreme Court Decision on Texas\_SB8"
---
 
I am very concerned by the Supreme Court’s decision to allow SB8 to
remain in effect in light of the significant consequences that law has
for women in Texas and around the country, and for the rule of law. As I
have made clear from Day One, I am deeply committed to the
constitutional right recognized in *Roe v. Wade* nearly five decades
ago.

While it is encouraging that the Court ruled that part of the providers’
lawsuit may continue, this ruling reinforces that there is so much more
work to be done—in Texas, in Mississippi, and in many states around the
country where women’s rights are currently under attack. I will continue
to work with Congress to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act. We have
more work to do, but I will always stand with women to protect and
defend their long-recognized, constitutional right under *Roe v. Wade*.
