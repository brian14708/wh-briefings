title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden On Kellogg Collective Bargaining\_Negotiations"
---
 
Collective bargaining is an essential tool to protect the rights of
workers that should be free from threats and intimidation from
employers.  
   
That’s why I am deeply troubled by reports of Kellogg’s plans to
permanently replace striking workers from the Bakery, Confectionery,
Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International during their ongoing
collective bargaining negotiations.  
   
Permanently replacing striking workers is an existential attack on the
union and its members’ jobs and livelihoods.  I have long opposed
permanent striker replacements and I strongly support legislation that
would ban that practice.  
   
And such action undermines the critical role collective bargaining plays
in providing workers a voice and the opportunity to improve their lives
while contributing fully to their employer’s success.  
   
Unions built the middle class of this country. My unyielding support for
unions includes support for collective bargaining, and I will
aggressively defend both.  
   
I urge employers and unions to commit fully to the challenging task of
working out their differences at the bargaining table in a manner that
fairly advances both parties’ interests.
