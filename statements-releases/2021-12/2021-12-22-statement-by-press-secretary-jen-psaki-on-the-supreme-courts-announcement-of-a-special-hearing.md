Especially as the US faces the highly transmissible Omicron variant, it
is critical to protect workers with vaccination requirements and testing
protocols that are urgently needed. At a critical moment for the
nationâ€™s health, the OSHA vaccination or testing rule ensures that
employers are protecting their employees and the CMS health care
vaccination requirement ensures that providers are protecting their
patients. We are confident in the legal authority for both policies and
DOJ will vigorously defend both at the Supreme Court.
