Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened a follow-up meeting with
Black women leaders to discuss progress on the Build Back Better Act,
the Administration’s efforts to amplify and implement the Bipartisan
Infrastructure law, and voting rights.  This group of leaders previously
met with the Vice President on July 16, 2021 to discuss protecting the
fundamental right to vote.  
  
During today’s meeting, the leaders engaged with the Vice President on
specific provisions of the Build Back Better Act that would benefit all
communities, including the Child Tax Credit, Universal Pre-K, and
investments in childcare. They discussed the importance of ensuring all
Americans have accessible and affordable high-speed internet, which the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes possible.  The Vice President
thanked the leaders for their continued work on these issues, and
reiterated her commitment to seeing the passage of the Build Back Better
Act, the Freedom to Vote Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act.
