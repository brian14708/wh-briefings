title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with Colorado Governor Jared\_Polis"
---
 
The President spoke this morning with Governor Jared Polis to discuss
the no-notice wildfires that have caused significant property damage and
loss in Colorado. Governor Polis described the impacts and the need for
additional Federal support, and the President assured him that every
effort will be made to provide immediate help to people in the impacted
communities. FEMA Administrator Criswell and her team are already
working with their counterparts in Colorado to surge
assistance. Fortunately, snowfall will help bring an end to the fires,
and recovery efforts can get underway. The President is grateful to all
of the first responders who have come to the aid of Colorado communities
and families impacted by the fires.
