President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. held a secure video call today with
President Vladimir Putin of Russia to discuss a range of issues on the
U.S.-Russia agenda. President Biden voiced the deep concerns of the
United States and our European Allies about Russia’s escalation of
forces surrounding Ukraine and made clear that the U.S. and our Allies
would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of
military escalation. President Biden reiterated his support for
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for
de-escalation and a return to diplomacy. The two presidents tasked their
teams to follow up, and the U.S. will do so in close coordination with
allies and partners. The presidents also discussed the U.S.-Russia
dialogue on Strategic Stability, a separate dialogue on ransomware, as
well as joint work on regional issues such as Iran.
