National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with
Poland’s National Security Bureau Chief Pawel Soloch and Head of the
International Policy Bureau Jakub Kumoch. They exchanged views on
Russia’s military build-up near Ukraine’s border and affirmed the
importance of Allied unity in diplomatic and deterrence efforts. Mr.
Sullivan reiterated U.S. support for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization’s Article 5 and underscored the United States’ readiness to
support our Eastern Flank Allies as they defend their countries. Mr.
Sullivan also conveyed President Biden’s appreciation for Polish
President Duda’s veto this morning of a controversial media amendment,
noting that this sent a positive signal just before Poland takes over
the Chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on
January 1.
