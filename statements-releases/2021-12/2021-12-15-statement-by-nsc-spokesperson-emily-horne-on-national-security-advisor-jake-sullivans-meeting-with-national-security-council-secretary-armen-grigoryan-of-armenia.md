National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with National Security
Council Secretary Armen Grigoryan of Armenia today. Mr. Sullivan
conveyed the commitment of the United States to peace, security, and
prosperity in Armenia and the South Caucasus region. He expressed
concern over ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and
emphasized that military movements near un-demarcated borders
are irresponsible and provocative.  He welcomed the ongoing
communication between the two sides and emphasized the U.S. commitment
to continue supporting confidence-building measures and regional
reconciliation both bilaterally and as a Minsk Group Co-Chair.  Mr.
Sullivan welcomed the announcement yesterday that Turkey and Armenia
will appoint special envoys to discuss the normalization process.  Mr.
Sullivan appreciated Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s participation in
The Summit for Democracy and underscored our strong cooperation on
reform, democratic institution-building, and economic development in
Armenia.
