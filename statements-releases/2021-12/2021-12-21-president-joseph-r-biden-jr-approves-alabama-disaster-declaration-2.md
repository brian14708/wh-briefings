Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Alabama and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by severe storms and flooding from October 6 to October 7,
2021.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Jefferson and Shelby.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named James R. Stephenson as
the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
counties can begin applying for assistance by registering online at
