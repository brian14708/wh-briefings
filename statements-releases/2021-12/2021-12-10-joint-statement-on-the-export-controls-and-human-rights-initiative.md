title: "Joint Statement on the Export Controls and Human Rights\_Initiative"
---
 
*The following is the text of a joint statement signed by the
governments of Australia, Denmark, Norway, and the United States*

*Begin Text:*

We, Australia, Denmark, Norway, and the United States, recognize that
advanced technologies are a vital part of global economic growth and
communication, helping people become more interconnected, share
knowledge, and advance freedom, democracy, and opportunity. Legitimate
trade in these technologies, and responsible use, is essential for the
well-being of our future generations. At the same time, authoritarian
governments increasingly are using surveillance tools and other related
technologies in connection with serious human rights abuses, both within
their countries and across international borders, including in acts of
transnational repression to censor political opposition and track
dissidents. Such use risks defeating the benefits that advanced
technologies may bring to the world’s nations and peoples.

Over the coming year of action, we commit to working to establish a
voluntary, nonbinding written code of conduct around which like-minded
states could politically pledge, to use export control tools to prevent
the proliferation of software and other technologies used to enable
serious human rights abuses. In addition, we will use the year of action
to consult with industry and academia in our efforts.
