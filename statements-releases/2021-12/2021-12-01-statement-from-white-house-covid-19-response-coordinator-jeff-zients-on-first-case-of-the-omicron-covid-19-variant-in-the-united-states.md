title: "Statement from White\_House COVID-\u206019 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients\
  \ on First Case of the Omicron COVID-\u206019 Variant in the United\_States"
---
 
Today, the CDC has confirmed the first case of the Omicron variant
detected in the United States.      
  
As the President said last Friday, it was only a matter of time before
the first case of Omicron was detected in the U.S. We are prepared to
meet this challenge with science and speed.   
  
The President’s medical team continues to believe that existing vaccines
will provide some level of protection against severe illness from
Omicron, and individuals who have gotten boosters have even stronger
protection. As such, we urge all adults to get their booster shots and
to get themselves and their kids vaccinated, if they haven’t already.   
  
The President will have more to say about our strategy for fighting
COVID this winter tomorrow, but for now, we know that: This new variant
is cause for continued vigilance, not panic.  We know what it takes to
limit the spread of COVID: Get vaccinated, get boosted, and take public
health measures like masking and distancing.  
  
We will remain steadfast in our fight against this virus. And we will
continue to be guided by the science and proven public health measures
to keep people safe.
