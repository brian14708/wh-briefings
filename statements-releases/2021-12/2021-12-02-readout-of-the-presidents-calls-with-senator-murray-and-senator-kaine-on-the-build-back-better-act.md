title: "Readout of the President\u2019s Calls with Senator Murray and Senator Kaine\
  \ on the Build Back Better\_Act"
---
 
This afternoon, as he and his team continue to work toward passage of
the Build Back Better Act in the Senate, the President had phone calls
about this economic growth package for the middle class with Senator
Patty Murray, and then with Senator Tim Kaine.    
  
Each call focused on the need to reduce families’ biggest costs –
including prescription drugs and child care – to build on historic job
creation by moving more Americans into the workforce, and fighting
inflation for the long term, all of which independent experts confirm
the Build Back Better Act would accomplish.  
  
Senator Murray and the President discussed the unprecedented steps this
legislation would take to help middle class families afford child care
and to create the first-ever universal pre-k program across the United
States. And Senator Kaine and the President spoke about the urgent need
for action that reduces financial burdens on families.  
  
The President looks forward to continued engagement with Senators on the
Build Back Better Act in the coming days.
