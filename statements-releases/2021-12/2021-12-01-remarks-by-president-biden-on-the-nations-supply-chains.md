1:03 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Sorry to keep you waiting.  Good afternoon.  It’s
wonderful to see the holiday decorations here in the White House. 
Tomorrow, I’m going to light the National Christmas Tree to help kick
off the holiday season.  
   
Whatever you celebrate, we are looking ahead to a  
brighter and happier December with an economy markedly stronger than it
was last year.  
   
It’s been a tough couple of years, but we’ve made incredible progress. 
And, today, I’d like to speak about some of the steps we’re taking to
address challenges in the economy and how those actions are already
starting to pay off for American families.  
   
First, however, I want to quickly reiterate what I spoke about on Monday
concerning Omicron, the vir- — the variant — and the steps we’re taking
to combat it.  
   
As I said, this new variant is a cause for concern but not a cause for
panic.  
   
We have the best vaccines in the world, the best medicines, the best
scientists.  We’re learning more every single day.  And we’ll fight this
variant with science and speed, not chaos and confusion.   
   
So, let me repeat what the doctors and scientists have affirmed: The
best protection against Omicron is getting a booster shot.  Right now,
about 135 million Americans are eligible for a booster but only about 40
million have gotten one thus far.  
   
If you’re over 18 years of age, you got vaccinated before January —
excuse me, June 1, go get your booster today.  And if you’re not
vaccinated, now is the time to get vaccinated and take your children to
get vaccinated.  Every child over the age five can get a safe, effective
vaccination.  
   
Tomorrow, I’ll be putting forward the next steps that we’ll be taking to
fight COVID this winter — not with shutdowns or lockdowns but with more
widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing, and more.  
   
Now, on to the economy.  If you’ve watched the news recently, you might
think the shelves in all our stores are empty across the country, that
parents won’t be able to get presents for their children on holidays —
this holiday season.  
   
But here’s the deal: For the vast majority of the country, that’s not
what’s happening.  Because of the actions the administration has taken
in partnership with business and labor, retailers and grocery stores,
freight movers and railroads, those shelves are going to be stocked.  
   
And many have heard that the CEO of Walmart, who I met with this week,
speaking about the steps we’ve taken.  He said, and I quote, “The
combination of private enterprise and government working together has
been really successful… All the way through the supply chain, there’s
been a lot of innovation.”  End of quote.   
   
Here’s what the progress has looked like.  The first thing we had to do
was speed up the operations at our ports.  Americans are buying more
goods than ever and a lot of those goods come through our ports.  40
percent of the goods that come into the country on the West Coast come
through two ports: Los Angeles and Long Beach.  
   
To help relieve congestion, I brought together labor and management and
asked them to step up and cooperate more — to move toward operating
those ports not five days a week, 40 hours a week; but 24 hours a day,
seven days a week by adding more shifts at night and on the weekends.  
   
Then we had to make sure people could transport those goods  
from the ports to stores and homes across the country.  We’ve broken up
logjams there as well.  
   
Private-sector port terminal operators at the ports of Los Angeles and
Long Beach, for example, have announced that they will eliminate fees
when truck drivers come on the port — come into the port to pick up the
containers if they do it at night or on weekends when roads are less
congested.  
   
Working with my administration, a major ocean carrier — the fourth
largest in the world — announced on Monday a new $100 discount when
containers are picked up quickly, with larger discounts for nighttime
and weekend pickups.  
   
And we’ve announced this week that we are extending through February
extra flexibility that allows truckers to drive more hours when they
transporting critical goods like gas, food, and medical supplies.  
   
Paired with the — these important safety measures, all of them are going
to help move goods more quickly and get products that people want onto
store shelves all across the country.  
   
Over the last month, the number of containers left sitting on docks
blocking movement to those stores is over — was for over eight days. 
Now it’s down — it’s down by 40 percent, which means they’re heading to
shelves in stores more quickly.   
   
That’s an incredible success story.  The Ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach have moved 16 percent more containers so far this year than last
year.  
   
By working with business and labor, my administration has been able to
handle the huge surge in goods moving through some of our biggest
ports.  And that has translated into shelves across our country being
well-stocked.  
   
You don’t have to take my word for it.  On Monday, I convened a group of
CEOs from some of the largest retailers and grocery stores in the
nation, as well as companies who work with small businesses across
America, including the CEO of Walmart, as I mentioned, along with Best
Buy, CVS, Samsung, Mattel, Etsy, and QVC.  
   
My administration has been working with many of the C- — CEOs and others
to keep goods moving through our supply chains to ensure the shelves are
stocked heading into the holiday season.

The CEOs I met with this week reported that their inventories are up,
shelves are well-stocked, and they’re ready to meet the consumer demand
for the holidays.  
   
The CEO of — of Etsy represents over 5 million small businesses and
entrepreneurs.  He told me, and I quote, “Our survey data says there are
less — they are less concerned about supply chain challenges this year
than they were last year.”  End of quote.  
   
I’ve also spoken with the CEOs of UPS and FedEx, which are on track to
deliver more packages than ever.  
   
Now, I can’t promise that every person will get every gift they want on
time.  Only Santa Claus can keep that promise.  But there are items
every year that sell out, that are hard to find.  
   
Some of you moms and dads may remember Cabbage Patch Kids back in the
‘80s or Beanie Babies in the ‘90s, or other toys that have run out at
Christmas time in past years when there was no supply chain problem.  
   
But we’re heading into a holiday season on very strong shape.  And it’s
not because of luck.  We averted potential crisis by figuring out what
needed to get fixed and then we brought people together to do the hard
work of fixing it.  
   
That’s exactly what we’re doing with the second concern I want to talk
about today: prices.  
   
Here are a few things you should know: Just about every country in the
world is grappling with higher prices right now as they recover from the
pandemic.

In the United Kingdom, price increases have hit a 10-year high.  In
Germany, a 28-year high.  In Canada, price increases are the highest
they’ve been since the ‘90s.  
   
This is a worldwide challenge — a natural byproduct of a world economy
shut down by the pandemic as it comes back to life.  
   
Prices are still out of sunk — excuse me — prices are still out of sync
as the world comes back.  But as we continue to overcome these
obstacles, the more price pressures will ease.  
   
But I have not been content to sit back and wait.  I’ve used every tool
available to address the price increases.  And it’s working. 

Take gas prices: Last week, I announced the largest-ever release from
the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase the supply of
oil and help bring down prices.  
   
I brought together other nations to continue and contribute to the
solution.  India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom
all joined us.  They all agreed to release additional oil from their
reserves.  And China may be doing so as well.  
   
This worldwide effort we’re leading will not solve the problem of high
gas prices overnight, but it has been making a difference.  
   
Over the last month, likely due in part to anticipation of this action,
we’ve seen the price of oil and gasoline on the wholesale markets come
down significantly.  
   
In fact, since the end of October, the average weekly price of gasoline
in the wholesale market has fallen by about 10 percent.  That’s a drop
of 25 cents per gallon.  
   
Those savings should reach the American people very soon, and it can’t
happen fast enough.  
   
And I’ve asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether
potentially illegal and anti-competitive behavior in the oil and gas
industry is causing higher prices to remain — be maintained for
consumers when the overall cost of oil is down.  We can also ensure that
American people are paying a fair price for gas.

So, let’s take a step back and take stock of where our economy is. 
Wages are up.  Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’ve delivered
significant tax cuts for families raising kids.  
   
Tax cuts and rising wages for middle-class families mean that Americans,
on average, have about $100 more in their pockets every month and — than
they did last year — about $350 more each month than they did before the
pandemic, even after accounting for inflation.  
   
Let me repeat that: Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical
American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year
or the year before that.  
   
In fact, we’re the only leading economy in the world where household
income and the economy as a whole are stronger than they were before the
pandemic.  
   
You know, there are other signs of strength too.  The number of small
businesses is up 30 percent compared to before the pandemic.  
   
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’ve cut child poverty in America
by more than 40 percent.  Think about that: Millions of children who
spent last Christmas in poverty will not bear that burden this holiday
season.  And the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, described it
yesterday, that it is, quote, “A profound economic and moral victory for
\[our\] country.”  End of quote.  
   
Since I took office, we’ve had record job creation: 5.6 million new jobs
since January 20th of this year.  The unemployment rate has fallen to
4.6 percent.  We’re seeing more new small businesses, higher wages, and
more disposable income.  Fewer children in poverty.  Fewer people
getting unemployment checks.   
   
None of this was inevitable.  It was because of the American Rescue
Plan, which virtually every Democrat in Congress voted for and every
Republican voted against.  
   
It was because of the hard work my administration has done to try to
solve the challenges in our economy, instead of just pointing fingers
and complaining.  
   
Now — now it’s time to build on our success and cut costs further for
families.  That’s what my Build Back Better plan does.  
   
It will lower out-of-pocket costs for childcare, eldercare, housing,
college, healthcare, and prescription drugs.  These are the biggest
costs that most families face.  
   
In fact, a new independent analysis released today showed that my Build
Back Better plan would mean $7,400 in tax cuts and savings for the
typical family with four — excuse me — the typical family of four with
two kids.  
   
Seventeen Nobel laureate winners in the — Nobel economics winners have
written a letter affirming that this bill will reduce inflationary
pressure in the economy.   
   
Two of the leading rating agencies on Wall Street confirmed this month
that my plan will not — will not add to inflationary pressures.  In
fact, they will, quote, “take the edge off of inflation.”  
   
Now my Republican friends are talking a lot about prices, but they’re
lined up against my Build Back Better plan, which would go right at the
problem for rising costs for families.  Why is that?  
   
I don’t want to speculate on anyone’s motive.  But it’s always easier to
complain about a problem than to try to fix it.   
   
One Republican senator even said that rising prices were, quote, “a gold
mine,” end of quote, for Republicans politically.  Imagine rooting for
higher costs for American families just to score a few political
points.  
   
The fact is the Build Back Better plan is fiscally responsible.  And
it’s the first major piece of legislation in more than a decade that is
not only fully paid for, but will generate more than $100 billion in
deficit reduction.  
   
It fully covers the cost of its investments by making the largest
corporations and the richest Americans pay a little more in taxes. 
Think about that.  Because that’s a trade-off worth making, in my view:
having those who have done very well pay their fair share in order to
provide a little breathing room for millions of American families.  
   
But my critics don’t seem to agree.  They have a lot of speeches about
high prices, supply chains, and other challenges we are facing, but they
don’t offer any answers.  So, they’re just doing the “no” vote.  That’s
their plan: Vote “no.”   
   
But what does that mean?  What does a “no” vote mean on this bill?  Not
on cable news, not on Fox, not — in the real world, in your life, around
your kitchen table.  
   
Well, here’s what it’s going to mean: It means for millions of American
families, this bill — the bills you’re paying right now for daycare
could be substantially lowered, capped at 7 percent of your income.  But
the Republicans said, “No, pay more.”  
   
It means the bills you’re paying right now to take care of your elderly
parent could have been lower — a lot lower.  But Republicans said, “No,
don’t vote for this bill.  Pay more.”  
   
It means the cost of your prescription drugs could have been lower — a
lot lower.  But Republicans think that those 200,000 children, for
example, who need regular doses of insulin should continue to pay as
much as $1,000 a month, instead of $35 a month.   
   
Think of that.  It not only affects the health of the child and the
family, but imagine you’re being a parent and not being able to afford
$1,000 a month.  Not only it risks the health of your child, but it robs
you of your dignity.  
   
The list goes on, but the point is the same.  
   
What I have proposed is a way to lower some of the most difficult costs
families have to pay every month by asking big corporations — 40 of the
Fortune 500 companies paid zero in taxes; making $40 billion in the
process — and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes.  
   
Look, remember: We’re in a situation that as far as Republicans are
concerned, they’d rather the bills at your kitchen table be higher so
the tax bills of corporate conference rooms and big mansions can be
lower.  
   
In this case, let me tell you something: Nothing will be more expensive
for American families than a “no” vote on the Build Back Better plan.   
   
I believe we simply can’t afford to do nothing and wait and see what
happens.  In the moments we face today, that just isn’t a responsible
course.  
   
We live in uncertain times.  Families are anxious about COVID, the
economy, the cost of living.  And the way to relieve that anxiety is
with consistent, determined, focused action.  
   
I started my presidency with the American Rescue Plan.  Now that law is
carrying our nation forward on vaccinations, boosters, keeping our
schools open, and so much more.  
   
I designed it as a year-long plan because I knew we’d have a lot of
obstacles to overcome.  
   
Next, we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law because a lot of our
infrastructure is crumbling.  We have to prepare ourselves to compete
and win the 21st century global economy.  
   
For most of the 20th century, we led the world in signif- — by a
significant margin because we invested in ourselves — not only in our
roads and highways and bridges, but in our people and our families.   
   
We built the Interstate Highway System.  We invested to win the space
race.  We were among the first to provide access to free education,
beginning back in the late 1800s.  These decisions to invest in our
country and our families are a major reason why we were able to lead the
world for much of the last century.  
   
But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves.  America
is still the largest economy in the world.  We still have the most
productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world.  
   
But we’ve risked losing our edge as a nation.  Our infrastructure used
to be the best in the world.  Today, according to the World Economic
Forum, we rank 13th.   
   
And we have to invest in our greatest asset as well: our people.  For
example, we used to lead the world in educational achievement.  Now, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranks America 35
out of 37 major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood
education and care.  
   
We can’t be competitive in the 21st century global economy if we
continue to slide.  
   
One of the reasons I believe so firmly in this is because I know what
this country can be.  We’ve always been a nation of possibilities.  We
didn’t become this nation we know by dreaming small.  Throughout our
history, we’ve emerged from crisis by investing in ourselves.  
   
During and after the wa- — the Civil War, we built the transcontinental
railroad, uniting America.  
   
During the Cold War, we built the Interstate Highway and — System,
transforming the way Americans are able to live their lives.  
   
And now, we’ll build the economy for the 21st century.  
   
I truly believe that 50 years from now, when historians look back at
this moment they’re going to say this was the beginning of the moment
when America won the competition for the 21st century.  I think that’s
what we’re going to see happen, God willing.   
   
May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you very
much.   
   
Q    Mr. President, what’s your level of concern that the new variant
will end up exacerbating the very issues on supply chains your team has
been working on the last several months?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, you know me; I’m an optimist.  What we have
seen so far does not guarantee that’s the outcome.  As a matter of fact,
we’re going to know in the next several weeks that — just — not only how
transmissible disease is but how extensive it is, how dangerous it is,
and what damage it does — and, most importantly whether, the vaccines we
have are capable of dealing with this virus, particularly if the
boosters we’re trying to get everyone to get.  
   
So, I think the jury is still out.  I think it’s a little early to make
that judgment.  But am I concerned?  Of course I am until we get the
final answers.  
   
I’ll take couple more questions.  Yes.  
   
Q    Mr. President, what is your reaction — the Supreme Court heard the
abortion case today and the Justices signaled that they’re on the verge
of major changes to abortion law in the United States.  Do you have any
plans to try to clarify the law?  What is your reaction to that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I haven’t — I didn’t see any of the
debate today — or just the presentation today.  And I support Roe v.
Wade.  I think it’s a rational position to take, and I continue to
support it.  
   
Q    Mr. President, thank you so much.  There are a number of
Presidents, from Jimmy Carter to Richard Nixon, who really tried to
impact inflation and supply chains and weren’t able to largely do that. 
How confident are you that you have the tools and the power to do
something about supply chains that help Americans find some relief?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Because what I’ve seen so far, based on what we’ve done
— this is the first time I’ve seen where labor and business is so ready
to cooperate, because they didn’t go through a period of a year — over
two years almost — of the impacts of a terrible virus that has caused
real damage to the world economy.   
   
So, I think people are in a different state of mind than they may have
been during the Carter years, as well as the Nixon years.  It’s just a
different world.   
   
Q    Mr. President, Mark Meadows has written a book revealing that
President Trump tested positive for COVID three days before your first
debate.  Do you think the former President put you at risk?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think about the former President.  
   
Thank you.
