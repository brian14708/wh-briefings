title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden\u2019s Briefing on Severe\_Weather"
---
 
The President was briefed by FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, White
House Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, White House Deputy
Chief of Staff Jen Oâ€™Malley Dillon, and White House Director of
Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Chavez Rodriguez on the severe weather
and tornadoes that impacted seven states overnight and which continues
to affect communities across multiple states today. Administrator
Criswell described the severe consequences, including in Kentucky, and
tragic losses of life. She also briefed on the rapid deployment of FEMA
emergency response personnel, water and other needed commodities. The
President has directed that Federal resources be surged immediately to
the locations where there is the greatest need to alleviate suffering
from the devastating consequences of these storms. Because damage
assessments are ongoing, further briefings will be provided to the
President in the course of the day.
