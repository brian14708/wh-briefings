title: "Statement from Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on Staff Member Close Contact to\
  \ the\_President"

As we stated last summer, we believe it is in the public’s interest to
know if any of the four principals (President, Vice President, First
Lady, and Second Gentleman) are considered to have been in close contact
with a White House official who subsequently tests positive for COVID-19
shortly after that contact. The criteria for what is considered a “close
contact” with the principals is determined by the White House Medical
Unit, in line with CDC guidance.  
  
On Monday morning, a mid-level staff member, who does not regularly have
contact with the President, received a positive result for a COVID-19
test.  Three days earlier, on Friday, that staff member had spent
approximately 30 minutes in proximity to the President on Air Force One,
on the way from Orangeburg, South Carolina to Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. This staff member is fully vaccinated and boosted, and
tested negative prior to boarding Air Force One, as is required for
everyone traveling with the President. This staff member did not begin
to experience symptoms until Sunday, and was tested on Monday.    
  
Others on Air Force One who were in close contact with this staff member
are being contacted and will be advised to get tested per CDC
guidance.  
  
The President is tested on a regular basis.  As part of that regular
testing, the President received an antigen test Sunday, and tested
negative.  
  
This morning, after being notified of the staffer’s positive test, the
President received a PCR test and tested negative. He will be tested
again on Wednesday.    
  
As CDC guidance does not require fully vaccinated people to quarantine
after an exposure, the President will continue with his daily
schedule.
