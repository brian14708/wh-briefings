  \ and Omicron Variants as We Battle COVID-\u206019 this\_Winter"
---
 
*New Actions Aim to Get Americans Boosted for Even Greater Protection
Against the Delta and Omicron Variants, Keep Schools and Businesses
Open, and Help Quickly Respond to Surges if Needed During the Colder
Months*

Today, President Biden will announce new actions to combat COVID-19 as
the United States heads into the winter months and with the emergence of
a new variant, Omicron.  
  
The United States has come far in its fight against the virus and is
more prepared than ever to deal with the challenges of COVID-19. We have
the public health tools we need to continue to fight this virus without
shutting down our schools and businesses. As we head into winter, today,
the President will announce actions to provide additional protection to
Americans and fight the Omicron and Delta variants, while keeping our
economy growing.  
  
This plan includes:

1.  Boosters for All Adults
2.  Vaccinations to Protect Our Kids and Keep Our Schools Open
3.  Expanding Free At-Home Testing for Americans
4.  Stronger Public Health Protocols for Safe International Travel
5.  Protections in Workplaces to Keep Our Economy Open
6.  Rapid Response Teams to Help Battle Rising Cases
7.  Supplying Treatment Pills to Help Prevent Hospitalizations and Death
8.  Continued Commitment to Global Vaccination Efforts
9.  Steps to Ensure We Are Prepared for All Scenarios 

Last week, after the World Health Organization (WHO) named the Omicron
variant as a Variant of Concern, the President took immediate steps to
restrict travel from the most impacted countries in order to give the
U.S. time to learn more about the variant and prepare. We have more
tools today to fight the Omicron variant than we have had to fight
previous variants, including Delta. Nearly 60 percent of Americans are
fully vaccinated, booster shots are authorized for all adults, and a
vaccine is authorized for kids aged 5 and older. The U.S. is leading the
world in vaccinating children, and millions of Americans have already
gotten their boosters. And, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
reviewing additional antiviral treatments for when people do get sick.  
  
Today’s actions will ensure we are using these tools as effectively as
possible to protect the American people against this variant and to
continue to battle the Delta variant during the winter months when
viruses tend to thrive. These actions will help keep our economy growing
and keep Americans safe from severe COVID-19.  
  
Today, President Biden will announce the following actions: 

1.  **<u>Boosters for All Adults:</u>** President Biden will announce
    new steps to ensure that the nearly 100 million eligible Americans
    who have not yet gotten their booster shot, get one as soon as
    possible. As we face the Omicron variant, boosters are more
    important than ever. Boosters increase the strength of your antibody
    response, so when the virus mutates, a booster makes it more likely
    that your antibodies can protect you against the new variant. This
    week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued
    updated guidance recommending that every adult get a booster. All
    adults who completed a primary vaccination series with an mRNA
    vaccine at least six months ago and those who received a Johnson &
    Johnson shot at least two months ago are eligible for a booster. The
    Biden Administration has made booster shots free and convenient at
    over 80,000 locations nationwide. To date, over 41 million Americans
    have already received a booster shot, including half of eligible
    seniors. The President will announce additional steps to help in
    this effort.

-   **Expanding pharmacy availability through December and reaching out
    to all eligible customers to get their booster:** As demand for
    boosters increases, the largest federal pharmacy partners will be
    ready to help meet that demand. Pharmacy partners are launching
    broad-based outreach campaigns to encourage the public to get their
    boosters, and are sending millions of texts, calls, and emails to
    eligible customers with information on how to schedule an
    appointment or walk-in for their booster shot. In addition, pharmacy
    partners will continue to offer call center services to support
    members of the public who need assistance, including in multiple
    languages. The President will also announce that the pharmacy
    program will continue to take steps to expand availability, so that
    adults can continue to receive their booster shots at trusted,
    convenient pharmacies near them. Nationwide, more than two in three
    COVID-19 vaccinations are already happening at local pharmacies.
    Federal pharmacy partners will continue to expand access by adding
    capacity across their network to meet the needs of their local
    communities. They will also work to ensure equitable access to
    boosters by offering vaccinations at convenient hours, including
    evenings and over weekends, so that adults can get boosted at a time
    that works best for them.  
-   **Launching a new public education campaign to encourage adults to
    get boosters, with a special focus on seniors:** The Department of
    Health and Human Services (HHS) will launch a new public education
    campaign to ensure every adult American is getting their booster as
    soon as they are eligible. This effort will put a special focus on
    seniors who are the most vulnerable, including seniors from
    communities of color and seniors from underserved communities. The
    campaign will feature paid advertising across multiple channels,
    engagement with community organizations, robust stakeholder
    outreach, and earned media campaigns.  
-   **Collaborating with AARP on an education campaign focused on
    getting seniors boosted:** AARP has been engaged in a robust
    education effort around COVID-19 and primary vaccinations throughout
    the pandemic. As we shift toward getting more seniors boosted, AARP
    will build on these efforts, and in collaboration with the
    Administration, will serve seniors through:  
-   Town Halls: The Administration will participate in AARP-sponsored
    tele-town halls to reach thousands of seniors over the coming months
    and educate older Americans about the importance of boosters.  
-   Rides to Booster Shots: AARP has committed to delivering rides
    through volunteers and partnerships with other organizations to help
    seniors get boosted at local pharmacies, clinics, events, churches,
    or other trusted locations.  
-   Events and Call Center: AARP and the Administration will participate
    in local events and media opportunities across the country in the
    weeks ahead. In addition, the Administration has provided new
    training to help CDC’s National COVID-19 Vaccine Assistance hotline
    answer AARP members’ and all seniors’ questions about boosters or
    find an appointment at 1-800-232-0233.  
-   **Targeting outreach to Medicare beneficiaries:** As part of a
    comprehensive plan to get older adults the extra protection they
    need through a booster, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
    (CMS) is launching an education and outreach initiative to get
    Medicare beneficiaries boosted. This will include sending a notice
    from the CMS Administrator to all Medicare beneficiaries encouraging
    them to get boosted and providing information about how to easily
    access a booster shot in their community. Approximately 63 million
    people are enrolled in Medicare, and this is the first time in more
    than 4 years that Medicare has sent all Medicare beneficiaries a
    notice of this kind. CMS will also send emails, add messages to the
    1-800-MEDICARE call center and incorporate messaging into
    advertising campaigns highly targeted to high-risk audiences with
    lower booster uptake.  
-   **Calling on employers to follow the federal government’s lead and
    provide paid time off to their employees to get boosted:** All
    federal employees currently receive paid time off to get booster
    shots. The President will call on employers throughout the country
    to remove a barrier to vaccination access by providing the same paid
    time off for their employees if they are not doing so already,
    including paid time off for family members getting their first,
    second, or booster shots. No one should have to choose between their
    pay check and getting the additional protection of a booster shot or
    a child vaccination. Currently, about one-third of workers report
    not receiving paid time off for vaccinations, and thirty-five
    percent of parents report being concerned about having to take time
    off work to get their child vaccinated or care for them if they
    experience side effects. Over the course of our pandemic response,
    these concerns have been even more pressing in our underserved
    communities; earlier this year, 64 percent of unvaccinated
    Hispanic/Latino adults and 55 percent of unvaccinated Black adults
    reported concern about missing work to get vaccinated.

1.  **<u>Vaccinations to Protect Our Kids and Keep Our Schools
    Open:</u>** The President will announce new actions to get more kids
    ages 5 and older vaccinated and to keep our schools open. When the
    President came into office, more than half the schools in our
    country were closed. Today, 99 percent of schools across the country
    are fully open and in person. The steps the President is announcing
    today will ensure that remains the case. As we face the Omicron
    variant, we now have an important new tool: vaccines for kids ages
    5-11. The U.S. leads the world in vaccinating children in this age
    group. To date, we have already vaccinated over 4 million 5- to
    11-year-olds and 15 million adolescents. Vaccinating our kids
    protects them, keeps schools open, and protects everyone around
    them. The Biden Administration has made it easy for parents to get
    their kids vaccinated with over 35,000 sites that parents know and
    trust, including pharmacies, pediatricians’ offices, children’s
    hospitals and school-based clinics. The President will announce new
    actions to get kids vaccinated and ensure that schools stay open.

-   **Launching hundreds of family vaccination clinics to get the whole
    family vaccinated or boosted in one trusted and convenient
    location:** The President will announce a new effort to launch
    hundreds of family vaccination clinics across the country. Together,
    these clinics will offer vaccinations for the whole family – with
    first shots for parents, teens, and kids, and boosters for those
    eligible. This model builds on the Administration’s ongoing efforts
    – in coordination with states, localities, providers and community
    leaders – to meet people where they are and make vaccinations
    accessible and convenient in communities across the country. HRSA
    will launch Family Vaccination Days – with hundreds of community
    health centers across the country hosting family vaccination clinics
    throughout December. Over two in three shots at community health
    centers are administered to people of color. FEMA will launch
    *Family Mobile Vaccination Clinics*, deploying sites, staff, and
    support to states across the country that need help – beginning with
    its first deployments to Washington and New Mexico. States and
    localities will pioneer this model nationwide – with full federal
    funding and support, and receive a new playbook to provide all
    partners with the information they need to stand up these sites and
    increase equitable access to vaccination. And, at thousands of
    pharmacies nationwide, federal pharmacy partners – including CVS and
    Rite Aid – will make available family-based scheduling over the
    coming months so that parents have a one-stop-shop to get their
    family their vaccination appointments all at once.  
-   **Requiring Medicaid to pay health care providers to talk to
    families about getting their kids vaccinated:** Increasing COVID-19
    vaccinations and centering equity in COVID-19 vaccinations requires
    meeting our hardest-hit and highest-risk communities where they are
    with information from trusted sources. To help parents get their
    questions answered and make informed decisions about COVID-19
    vaccination for their children, all Medicaid programs will pay
    health care providers to talk to parents about the importance of
    kids’ vaccination. Medicaid will cover COVID-19 vaccine counseling
    visits for most children and youth up to age 21 with 100% federal
    funding throughout the public health emergency and the following
    year. Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program provide
    health insurance coverage to over 40 percent of all children in the
    United States and are a significant source of coverage for Black and
    brown children. Today’s action will help expand access to
    individualized medical advice in all of our communities and give
    families the support they need to engage with trusted community
    providers.   
-   **Reviewing school COVID-19 prevention policies to avoid closures of
    entire classrooms or schools when there is a positive case:** Thanks
    to efforts from the Biden Administration, 99 percent of schools are
    now open for full-time in-person learning – up from 46 percent at
    the beginning of the Administration. This progress has been crucial
    to making sure all students can safely be back where they belong –
    learning alongside their peers – and to help them accelerate through
    any learning loss they may have experienced in the last year and a
    half. Schools can stay open safely by implementing layered
    prevention strategies, and with the tools, guidance, and resources
    the Administration has provided, schools should not have to close
    due to COVID-19. To make sure schools can remain safely open:

<!-- -->

-   CDC will release findings on quarantine and testing policies in
    schools: Today, close contacts who are not fully vaccinated should
    be referred for COVID-19 testing and quarantine at home for up to 14
    days after exposure. While it is crucial to take proper measures to
    contain spread of the virus following COVID-19 exposure, this period
    of quarantine can significantly interrupt student’s learning, and
    make it challenging for parents to work. States and districts around
    the country have been pioneering alternative approaches to
    quarantine, including “test to stay” policies – where exposed
    students remain in school, wear masks, and test repeatedly in the
    days following exposure to identify and contain infection. CDC has
    been studying approaches to quarantine and testing, including
    looking at the science and data of how they may keep school
    communities safe. CDC will release their findings on these
    approaches in the coming weeks.

<!-- -->

-   The Administration will issue a new “Safe School Checklist” to give
    schools a clear game plan for how to get as many of their staff and
    students vaccinated as possible: The best way to avoid outbreaks in
    schools is to stop transmission before it happens – and the best
    tool we have to stop transmission and keep schools open is
    vaccinating everyone who is eligible. Now, all students ages 5 and
    up are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. Today, the Administration
    will issue a new “Safe Schools Checklist” to all K-12 schools,
    detailing a set of actions that every school can take to get their
    staff and students vaccinated – including hosting school-located
    vaccination clinics, hosting community-based and family vaccination
    clinics and events, implementing vaccination requirements for school
    staff, and getting eligible vaccinated school staff booster shots.
    The Checklist will also link to resources schools can use to set up
    these initiatives and talk to families about the importance of
    vaccination.  
-   **Providing every resource to the FDA to support timely review of
    applications for vaccines for individuals under the age of 5:** The
    President will announce that, as he did for a vaccine for kids ages
    5-11, he supports the independent scientific review of a vaccine for
    those individuals under the age of 5 and will provide the FDA with
    any needed resources to do this safely and as quickly as possible
    once data is submitted to the agency.

1.  **<u>Expanding Free At-Home Testing for Americans:</u>** Today, the
    President will announce new steps to ensure that Americans has
    access to free at-home testing. First, the more than 150 million
    Americans with private insurance – who now are able to get tests
    covered in physician offices, pharmacies, and clinics with no cost
    sharing – will also be able to get at-home tests reimbursed by their
    insurance. Second, for those not covered by private insurance, in
    addition to more than 20,000 federally-supported free testing sites
    across the U.S., at-home tests will be distributed through key
    community sites, such as health centers and rural clinics. The Biden
    Administration has taken significant steps to increase testing in
    the country since January. We are on track to quadruple the supply
    of rapid at-home tests that we had in late-Summer. Today’s actions
    will help Americans access the tests they need to help them stop the
    spread of COVID-19 to others.

-   **Providing health plan coverage of no-cost rapid, over-the-counter
    (OTC) COVID-19 tests:**  To expand access and affordability of
    at-home COVID-19 tests, the Departments of Health and Human
    Services, Labor and the Treasury will issue guidance by January
    15<sup>th</sup> to clarify that individuals who purchase OTC
    COVID-19 diagnostic tests will be able to seek reimbursement from
    their group health plan or health insurance issuer and have
    insurance cover the cost during the public health emergency.
    Workplace screening would remain consistent with current guidance.
    Today’s announcement follows the President’s September action
    directing more than $2 billion to accelerate the production of rapid
    tests and an additional $1 billion investment in procuring at-home
    tests. Over the same time period, FDA authorized five additional
    over-the-counter tests. A total of 8 tests are on the market today;
    no test was on the market when the President took office.  
-   **Expanding community distribution of free at-home tests through
    neighborhood sites such as health centers and rural clinics:** To
    ensure equitable access to free at-home tests for our uninsured and
    underserved communities, the President will double the commitment
    from September to distribute 25 million free tests to community
    sites to 50 million tests and will add rural clinics to the program.
    Partnerships with trusted community providers will aid in getting
    these important testing supplies into the homes of our hardest-hit
    communities.

1.  **<u>Stronger Public Health Protocols for Safe International
    Travel:</u>** Last month, the Administration implemented stronger
    international travel protocols, including requirements for foreign
    travelers to be fully vaccinated. The very day the WHO identified
    the new Omicron variant, the Biden Administration took immediate
    steps to restrict travel from the countries in the region where it
    was confirmed to be spreading quickly. The President will announce
    additional steps to strengthen the safety of international travel as
    we face this new threat – just as we have faced those that have come
    before it. 

-   **Strengthening global pre-departure testing protocols:** Early next
    week, the United States will tighten pre-departure testing protocols
    by requiring all inbound international travelers to test within one
    day of departure globally, regardless of nationality or vaccination
    status. This tighter testing timeline provides an added degree of
    public health protection as scientists continue to assess the
    Omicron variant.  
-   **Extending the requirement to wear a mask on airplanes, rail
    travel, and public transportation:** The Administration will
    continue to require masking during international or other public
    travel – as well as in transportation hubs such as airports or
    indoor bus terminals – through March 18 as we continue to battle
    COVID-19 this winter. The Transportation Security Administration
    will extend its implementing orders to maintain these requirements
    through March 18. Fines will continue to be doubled from their
    initial levels for noncompliance with the masking requirements –
    with a minimum fine of $500 and fines of up to $3,000 for repeat
    offenders.

1.  **Protecting Workplaces to Keep Businesses Open: **Today, the
    President will announce additional progress we’re making in
    protecting workers and keeping our economy growing and businesses
    open. Since President Biden took office, the economy has added 5.6
    million jobs, new unemployment claims have fallen by 70 percent, and
    applications for new businesses have risen 30 percent above the
    pre-pandemic average. To protect this progress and to ensure workers
    stay safe and on the job, we have to slow the spread of COVID-19 in
    our workplaces and places of businesses. Vaccination requirements do
    just that. The President is calling on businesses to continue to
    take steps to ensure workers are protected as we head into the
    winter. 

-   **Calling on businesses to move forward with vaccination or testing
    programs:** The President will call on businesses to move forward
    expeditiously with requiring their workers to get vaccinated or
    tested weekly. This is especially important given the Omicron
    variant. No business should shut down this winter because of
    COVID-19. The Department of Labor has provided a clear roadmap to
    help businesses keep workers safe and their doors open. Already, 60
    percent of businesses report they are moving forward with
    implementing a program to ensure their workers are either vaccinated
    or tested on a weekly basis, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
    more than 100 leading public health experts have encouraged
    businesses to not delay in implementing these protective measures.
    The President will urge businesses to take steps now to protect
    workers, customers, and the economy.

1.  **Rapid Response Teams to Help Battle Rising Cases:** Today, the
    President will announce new actions to help states battle any
    potential COVID-19 outbreaks this winter, including of the Omicron
    variant. As we worked to bring down the Delta surge throughout this
    summer and fall, we successfully deployed thousands of federal
    personnel to help 27 states and two territories. These COVID-19
    Surge Response Teams mobilized to address critical needs on the
    ground, including personnel, therapeutics, and technical expertise.
    To date, we have deployed over 2,000 personnel, including 1,300
    clinical providers; surged over 3,200 ventilators, ambulances and
    other critical supplies; and shipped over 2.3 million courses of
    lifesaving monoclonal antibody treatments. As we face the potential
    of a new variant and rising cases during the winter months, today,
    the President will make clear that federal government will once
    again be prepared to help.

-   **Making 60+ Winter COVID emergency response team deployments
    available to states:** To ensure states have the help they need as
    they battle rising cases, the President will announce new emergency
    response teams that will be available to help supplement state
    efforts. These teams include:
    -   20+ Department of Defense Medical Response Team deployments to
        support clinical staffing at strained hospitals.
    -   10 National Disaster Medical System team deployments to provide
        clinical support at strained hospitals.
    -   20+ monoclonal antibody strike team deployments to support the
        administration of these lifesaving treatments.
    -   15+ CDC expert deployments to conduct outbreak investigations
        and provide epidemiological or technical support whenever
        needed.  
-   **Strengthening our national volunteer emergency medical response
    corps to support communities in need**: To help local municipalities
    strengthen their health preparedness and response, today the
    President will announce $20 million in funding from the American
    Rescue Plan to strengthen the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), a network
    of medical and public health volunteers organized locally to improve
    the health of their communities. This funding will provide
    additional resources needed to support the roughly 300,000 MRC
    medical and public health professionals who have already volunteered
    more than 2 million hours toward local COVID-19 response. HHS will
    also lead a national effort to mobilize volunteers, including
    retired doctors and nurses, in areas with rising COVID cases.

1.  **<u>Supplying Treatment Pills to Help Prevent Hospitalizations and
    Death:</u>** As we head into winter, new COVID-19 treatments may be
    on the horizon that could help prevent hospitalization and death. As
    these treatments continue to be developed and reviewed, today, the
    President will announce that we are ensuring that if and when any
    new COVID-19 treatment pills have been found to meet FDA’s
    scientific standards, they are equitably accessible to all
    Americans, regardless of their income or their zip code.

-   **Securing enough supply and ensuring pills are widely available in
    the hardest-hit, highest-risk communities**: The Administration is
    taking steps to secure 13 million doses of antiviral courses to
    ensure we have ample supply for Americans who need treatment. That
    number is six times the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations reported
    throughout this entire year. As more and more treatments may become
    available in the coming months, the Administration will ensure our
    underserved communities, often at highest risk from the virus, will
    be able to conveniently access these potentially lifesaving
    treatments.

1.  **Continued Commitment to Global Vaccination Efforts: **Today, the
    President will reaffirm his commitment to help vaccinate the globe,
    and call on other countries to do the same to combat this pandemic
    globally and help prevent the development of new variants.

-   **Donating 1.2 billion doses to the world:** To date, the U.S. has
    committed to donate 1.2 billion doses to the world. For every one
    shot the Biden Administration has administered in the U.S., we are
    donating about three doses to people around the world. The U.S. is
    also the first country to give up its place in line for vaccines,
    allowing the African Union to immediately start receiving up to 110
    million doses of Moderna at a reduced rate negotiated by the United
    States. And, we are working with partners to expand supply of
    critical ancillary needs like syringes.  
-   **Accelerating the delivery of more vaccines to countries in need by
    pledging to deliver 200 million more doses in the next 100 days.**
    To build on our donations of over 275 million doses that have been
    shared with 110 countries, including 94 million doses to Africa, we
    are pledging to deliver 200 million more doses in the next 100 days
    – accelerating the delivery of vaccines to countries in need. These
    doses are being delivered for free with no strings attached. The
    U.S. is also the first country to negotiate a deal with J&J and the
    COVAX facility to send vaccines directly to humanitarian settings
    and conflict zones to vaccinate displaced people.  
-   **Taking** **steps to ramp up manufacturing here and abroad,
    building out a sustainable supply chain and increasing capacity
    globally to make vaccines:** We are ramping up vaccine
    manufacturing, building a sustainable supply chain and increasing
    global capacity to make additional vaccines. We will continue our
    work to invest in companies that have experience manufacturing mRNA
    vaccines to help them expand capacity by an additional 1 billion
    doses per year, with production starting by the second half of
    2022.  
-   **Turning vaccines into vaccinations:** We are working with country
    partners to get doses into arms with plans tailored to specific
    country needs. With lines of effort ranging from communications
    campaigns to build vaccine confidence, to funding for vaccinators on
    the front line – the U.S. government is committed to getting people
    vaccinated around the world.

1.  **<u>Steps to Ensure We Are Prepared for All Scenarios:</u>** Health
    and medical experts believe that the current vaccines authorized in
    the U.S. provide at least some protection against the Omicron
    variant and that boosters strengthen that protection significantly.
    However, to ensure that we are prepared for all scenarios, the
    Administration is taking steps now to be able to quickly act if
    updated vaccinations or boosters are needed to respond to the
    Omicron variant.

-   **Accelerating the development and deployment of new vaccines and
    boosters if needed for the Omicron variant:** The President is
    committed to using every resource and tool available to the U.S.
    government to ensure that we can quickly get updated vaccines and
    boosters to the American people in the unlikely event they are
    needed to battle the Omicron variant. The Administration is working
    closely with executives at Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson to
    develop contingency plans for other vaccinations or boosters if
    needed. The President will also use every resource available to help
    support the FDA and CDC to quickly review new vaccines, if needed,
    while ensuring that the rigorous safety review process is upheld.
    The President is also committed to doing the same for any COVID-19
    treatment that may be needed for this variant.
