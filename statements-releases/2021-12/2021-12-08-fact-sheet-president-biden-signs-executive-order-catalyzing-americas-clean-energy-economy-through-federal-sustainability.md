*U.S. Government Will Lead by Example to Leverage Scale and Procurement
Power to Drive Clean, Healthy, and Resilient Operations*

Today, President Biden will sign an executive order that demonstrates
how the United States will leverage its scale and procurement power to
lead by example in tackling the climate crisis. The executive order will
reduce emissions across federal operations, invest in American clean
energy industries and manufacturing, and create clean, healthy, and
resilient communities. The President is building on his
whole-of-government effort to tackle the climate crisis in a way that
creates well-paying jobs, grows industries, and makes the country more
economically competitive.

The President’s executive order directs the federal government to use
its scale and procurement power to achieve five ambitious goals:

-   100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity (CFE) by 2030, at
    least half of which will be locally supplied clean energy to meet
    24/7 demand;
-   100 percent zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) acquisitions by 2035,
    including 100 percent zero-emission light-duty vehicle acquisitions
    by 2027;
-   Net-zero emissions from federal procurement no later than 2050,
    including a Buy Clean policy to promote use of construction
    materials with lower embodied emissions;
-   A net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045, including a 50
    percent emissions reduction by 2032; and
-   Net-zero emissions from overall federal operations by 2050,
    including a 65 percent emissions reduction by 2030.

In addition to the five new commitments that form the pillars of today’s
executive action, the President also directed the federal government to
orient its procurement and operations efforts in line with the following
principles and goals:

-   Achieving climate resilient infrastructure and operations;
-   Building a climate- and sustainability-focused workforce;
-   Advancing environmental justice and equity;
-   Prioritizing the purchase of sustainable products, such as products
    without added perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS);
    and
-   Accelerating progress through domestic and international
    partnerships.

Today’s executive action is a part of the President’s broader commitment
to increasing investments in America’s manufacturing industries and
workers to build back our country better.  By transforming how the
federal government builds, buys, and manages its assets and operations,
the federal government will support the growth of America’s clean energy
and clean technology industries, while accelerating America’s progress
toward achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035.

President Biden’s executive order demonstrates how the United States
government will lead by example to provide a strong foundation for
American businesses to compete and win globally in the clean energy
economy while creating well paying, union jobs at home. Today’s
executive action further reinforces the President’s directive to Buy
American and ensure that equity and environmental justice are key
considerations in federal operations planning and decision making.

The White House also released a detailed description of this plan: [*The
Federal Sustainability Plan: Catalyzing America’s Clean Energy
Industries and Creating Jobs Through Federal
Sustainability*](http://www.sustainability.gov).

**Together, the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Budget for
Fiscal Year 2022, and Build Back Better Act will provide agencies with
the funding necessary to achieve the goals of the executive order.**

**<u>Catalyzing America’s Clean Energy Industries and Jobs through
Federal Sustainability Executive Order</u>**

Through this executive order, the federal government will transform its
portfolio of 300,000 buildings, fleet of 600,000 cars and trucks, and
annual purchasing power of $650 billion in goods and services to:

1.  Transition federal infrastructure to zero-emission vehicles and
    buildings powered by carbon pollution-free electricity, which will
    reduce the federal government’s greenhouse gas emissions by 65
    percent by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

-   Make federal agencies more adaptive and resilient to the impacts of
    climate change, and increase the sustainability of federal supply
    chains, achieving net-zero emissions from federal procurement
    by 2050.  

<!-- -->

-   Mainstream sustainability within the federal workforce, advance
    equity and environmental justice, and leverage partnerships to
    accelerate progress.

**Transition federal infrastructure to zero-emission vehicles and energy
efficient buildings powered by carbon pollution-free electricity:**

-   **Achieve 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity use by
    2030,** **including 50 percent on a 24/7 basis.** The federal
    government will work with utilities, developers, technology firms,
    financiers and others to purchase electricity produced from
    resources that generate no carbon emissions, including solar and
    wind, for all its operations by 2030. Half of the federal
    government’s 100 percent carbon pollution-free annual electricity
    demand will be procured on a 24/7 basis, meaning that the federal
    government’s real-time demand for electricity will be met with clean
    energy every hour, every day, and produced within the same regional
    grid where the electricity is consumed. With the scope and scale of
    this electricity demand, the federal government expects it will
    catalyze the development of at least 10 gigawatts of new American
    clean electricity production by 2030, spurring the creation of new
    union jobs and moving the country closer to achieving a carbon
    pollution-free electricity sector by 2035.

<!-- -->

-   **Transition to 100 percent acquisition of zero-emission vehicles by
    2035 for the federal vehicle fleet, including 100 percent light duty
    vehicle acquisition by 2027.** The federal government will work with
    American vehicle, battery, and charging equipment manufacturers and
    installers to transform its fleet into the largest zero-emission
    vehicle fleet in the Nation, reaching 100 percent zero-emission
    vehicle acquisitions by 2035. This will accelerate the advancement
    of America’s industrial capacity to supply zero-emission vehicles
    and electric vehicle batteries and create and sustain good union
    jobs in manufacturing, engineering, and skilled-trades.

<!-- -->

-   **Modernize the federal buildings portfolio to reach net-zero
    emissions by 2045, including a 50 percent reduction in building
    emissions by 2032**. The federal government will work across
    existing real property and during new building construction and
    major renovations to increase water and energy efficiency, reduce
    waste, electrify systems, and promote sustainable locations for
    federal facilities to strengthen the vitality and livability of the
    communities in which federal facilities are located. Additionally,
    the Biden-Harris Administration will implement the first-ever
    Federal Building Performance Standard, and will use performance
    contracting to improve buildings with no up-front costs.

**Make federal agencies more adaptive and resilient to the impacts of
climate change, and** **increase the sustainability of federal**
**supply chains, achieving net-zero emissions from federal procurement
by 2050.**

-   **Make federal agencies more adaptive and resilient to the impacts
    of climate change.** The intensifying impacts of climate change
    present physical, operational, and financial risks to federal
    infrastructure, agency missions, and our services to the American
    people. Agencies will implement the actions identified through their
    [October 7, 2021, Climate Adaptation and Resilience
    Plans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/07/fact-sheet-biden-administration-releases-agency-climate-adaptation-and-resilience-plans-from-across-federal-government/)
    and modernize federal policy, programs, operations, and
    infrastructure to support climate resilience investment. By taking
    action now to better manage and mitigate climate risks, we will
    minimize future disruptions and destruction to federal operations,
    assets, and programs and ensure the federal government can continue
    providing critical services to the Nation.

<!-- -->

-   **Increase the sustainability of federal** **supply chains,
    achieving net-zero emissions from federal procurement by 2050.** The
    companies that supply the federal government are critical partners
    in achieving our climate goals and growing the economy and American
    jobs. Cutting emissions from the federal government’s procurement
    also means buying materials with a lower carbon footprint. The
    federal government will launch a “buy clean” initiative for
    low-carbon materials and prioritize the purchase of sustainable
    products, such as products without added perfluoroalkyl or
    polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Through these actions, the
    federal government will provide a large and stable signal to the
    market for sustainable and low-carbon goods made in America,
    advancing America’s industrial capacity to supply the goods and
    materials of the future while growing good jobs for American
    workers.

**Mainstream sustainability within the federal workforce, advance equity
and environmental justice, and leverage partnerships to accelerate
progress.**

-   **Mainstream sustainability within the federal workforce.** The
    federal government’s 4.2 million employees are critical stakeholders
    and leaders in the shift to sustainable and resilient operations.
    The federal government will build capacity through engagement,
    education, and training so that federal workers are ready to embed
    sustainability, climate adaptation, and environmental stewardship
    analysis and action in their jobs as we work to Build Back Better.

<!-- -->

-   **Advance equity and environmental justice.** The federal government
    will advance the goals of the Administration’s [Justice40
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2021/07/20/the-path-to-achieving-justice40/)
    by ensuring that economic equity and environmental justice are key
    considerations in operations planning and decision making. A federal
    environmental justice representative will serve on the newly
    established Chief Sustainability Officer Council. To incorporate
    equity, agencies will implement this executive order consistent with
    the President’s Executive Order on *Advancing Racial Equity and
    Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government,*
    which helps ensure that government contracting and procurement
    opportunities are available on an equal basis.

<!-- -->

-   Collaboration with leading American unions, businesses, States,
    Tribes, municipalities, and other countries will accelerate progress
    and catalyze greater climate action at home and abroad. The federal
    government will build upon its newly launched [Greening Government
    Initiative,](https://www.sustainability.gov/ggi/) which convenes
    governments around the world to collaborate on greening government
    operations. Further, the Administration will launch a Presidential
    Sustainability Executives Program, placing senior leaders from the
    private and non-profit sectors to serve across the federal
    government, bringing innovative perspectives and critical expertise
    to achieve these ambitious, and imperative, sustainability and
    climate preparedness goals.

**<u>Actions Agencies are Taking to Meet the Goals of the Sustainability
Executive Order</u>**

Across the federal government, agencies are moving expeditiously to meet
the President’s call for action and are positioned to meet the ambitious
goals of his executive order and Federal Sustainability Plan. Highlights
are included below:

**100 percent CFE by 2030,** **including 50 percent on a 24/7 Basis**

-   In 2022, the **Department of Defense’s (DOD)** Edwards Air Force
    Base in California will add 520 megawatts (MW) of CFE to the grid by
    completing one of the country’s largest solar photovoltaic (PV)
    array projects and in the process creating more than 1,000 union and
    other construction jobs.

<!-- -->

-   In 2022, **DOD’s** Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii will
    complete construction of the nation’s largest 100 percent clean
    energy microgrid. By leveraging a 14-megawatt (MW) solar facility
    paired with a 70 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery energy storage system
    sited on the base, the Pacific Missile Range Facility can become
    self-sufficient for all its electricity needs in the event of a loss
    of transmission feed from the utility grid.

**100 Percent ZEV Acquisitions by 2035, including 100 percent Light-Duty
ZEV Acquisitions by 2027**

-   In 2021, the **Department of the Interior** (DOI) began
    transitioning its fleet of U.S. Park Police lightweight motorcycles
    and dirt bikes to 100 percent ZEVs at its Washington, D.C., New York
    City, and San Francisco locations, with plans to reach a 100 ZEV
    fleet by 2025.

<!-- -->

-   In early 2022, the **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** will
    begin field testing the Ford Mustang Mach-E ZEV for use in its law
    enforcement fleet, which currently consists of over 30,000 vehicles.

**Net-Zero Emissions Buildings by 2045, including a 50 percent reduction
by 2032**

    majority of its energy infrastructure improvements at an Internal
    Revenue Service Center outside of New York City through a 17-year,
    $30.9 million energy savings performance contract (ESPC). The ESPC
    has so far delivered nearly $14 million in capital improvements and
    $2.2 million in annual utility bill savings. ESPCs allow federal
    agencies to procure energy savings and facility improvements with no
    up-front capital costs or special appropriations from Congress.

**Net-Zero Emissions Procurement by 2050**

-   In 2021, **DOD** collected information from its suppliers on their
    efforts to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. DOD is
    using this information to develop low-carbon purchasing guidelines
    that will become part of its standard operating procedures.

<!-- -->

-   In 2022, the **General Services Administration** (GSA) will require
    contractors to disclose the embodied carbon of building materials
    for new building and major modernization contracts. Embodied carbon
    refers to the greenhouse gas emissions (mostly carbon dioxide)
    resulting from the mining, harvesting, processing, manufacturing,
    transportation, and installation of materials. 

**Net-Zero Emissions from overall Federal Operations by 2050, including
a 65 percent reduction by 2030**

-   By January 2022, **DOD’s** Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany in
    Georgia anticipates achieving net-zero energy status.

**Climate Resilient Infrastructure and Operations**

-   In 2021, [more than 20 major federal agencies released
    plans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/07/fact-sheet-biden-administration-releases-agency-climate-adaptation-and-resilience-plans-from-across-federal-government/)
    describing how they will integrate climate-readiness across missions
    and programs and bolster resilience of Federal assets. For example,
    the **Department of Housing and Urban Development** (HUD) is
    collecting building-level data across HUD programs to map existing
    climate risks to help inform the Department on how to best address
    climate impacts and protect HUD-assisted assets and their occupants.
-   **DOD** is integrating climate change considerations across its
    strategic guidance and planning documents, including the National
    Defense Strategy, which will be released in 2022.

**Develop a Climate- and Sustainability-Focused Workforce**

-   The **Department of State** is assessing its climate and
    sustainability management staffing and training gaps to inform a
    longer-term plan that will prioritize areas of concern and greatest
    needs.
-   In 2022, the **Department of Labor** will launch a new training
    course for its senior leadership team on climate change management
    considerations and environmental justice principals. The Department
    will also include climate change literacy in new employee
    orientation material.

**Advance Environmental Justice and Equity**

-   In 2021, **GSA** [launched an Environmental Justice and Equity Task
    Group](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-commits-to-renewable-energy-pledging-100-percent-renewable-electric-resources-by-2025-04222021)
    to identify and propose effective approaches to improve
    environmental justice and equity in federal sustainable building
    processes, enhancing engagement with communities and key partners
    throughout the building lifecycle.
