*“Corruption threatens United States national security, economic equity,
global anti-poverty and development efforts, and democracy itself.  But
by effectively preventing and countering corruption and demonstrating
the advantages of transparent and accountable governance, we can secure
a critical advantage for the United States and other democracies.”*

*President Joe Biden  
June 3, 2021*

Corruption is a cancer within the body of societies—a disease that eats
at public trust and the ability of governments to deliver for their
citizens. The deleterious effects of corruption impact nearly all
aspects of society. It exacerbates social, political, and economic
inequality and polarization; impedes the ability of states to respond to
public health crises or to deliver quality education; degrades the
business environment and economic opportunity; drives conflict; and
undermines faith in government. Those that abuse positions of power for
private gain steal not just material wealth, but human dignity and
welfare.  
  
Recognizing corruption’s ability to corrode democracy, on June 3, 2021,
President Biden established the fight against corruption as a core U.S.
national security interest. Accordingly, he directed his national
security team to lead the creation of a comprehensive strategy that,
when implemented, would improve the U.S. Government’s ability to prevent
corruption, more effectively combat illicit finance, better hold corrupt
actors accountable, and strengthen the capacity of activists,
investigative journalists, and others on the front lines of exposing
corrupt acts. 

Today, in line with the President’s direction, the Biden-Harris
Administration is releasing the first-ever [United States Strategy on
Countering
Corruption](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/United-States-Strategy-on-Countering-Corruption.pdf).
The Strategy outlines a whole-of-government approach to elevating the
fight against corruption. It places particular emphasis on better
understanding and responding to the threat’s transnational dimensions,
including by taking additional steps to reduce the ability of corrupt
actors to use the U.S. and international financial systems to hide
assets and launder the proceeds of corrupt acts.   
  
To guide implementation, the Strategy organizes U.S. Government efforts
to fight corruption under five mutually-reinforcing pillars:   
  
**Modernizing, coordinating, and resourcing U.S. Government efforts to
fight corruption:** While the United States has long been a leader in
the global fight against corruption, addressing the threat as a national
security imperative requires an updated approach. This will include:

-   Better understanding and responding to the transnational dimensions
    of corruption, including by prioritizing intelligence collection and
    analysis on corrupt actors and their networks.
-   Elevating anti-corruption work as a cross-cutting priority in key
    departments and agencies across the federal government, including
    through coordinating bodies at the Departments of State, Treasury,
    and Commerce, and the U.S. Agency for International Development
    (USAID).
-   Increasing law enforcement resources and bolstering information
    sharing between the intelligence community and law enforcement.

**Curbing illicit finance:** Corrupt actors and their facilitators rely
on vulnerabilities in the United States and international financial
systems to obscure ownership of assets and launder the proceeds of their
illicit activities.  As the world’s largest economy, the United States
bears responsibility to address gaps in our own regulatory system and
work with our allies and partners to do the same.  This means addressing
deficiencies, including by:

-   Issuing beneficial ownership transparency regulations that help
    identify bad actors hiding behind opaque corporate structures.
-   Enacting first-of-their-kind regulations that target those closest
    to real estate transactions to reveal when real estate is used to
    hide ill-gotten cash or to launder criminal proceeds.
-   Working with the Congress and within existing regulations to make it
    harder for certain gatekeepers to the financial system – including
    lawyers, accountants, and trust and company service providers – to
    evade scrutiny.
-   Working with partner countries through multilateral fora, diplomatic
    engagement, law enforcement cooperation, and capacity building to
    strengthen their anti-money laundering regimes to bring greater
    transparency to the international financial system.

**Holding Corrupt Actors Accountable:** While the U.S. Government shores
up regulatory gaps and works with partners and allies to do the same, we
will also hold accountable those who choose to engage in corruption,
including by:

-   Elevating diplomatic and development efforts to support, defend, and
    protect civil society and media actors, including investigative
    journalists who expose corruption.
-   Launching a new initiative to engage partner countries on detecting
    and disrupting foreign bribery.
-   Establishing a kleptocracy asset recovery rewards program that will
    enhance the U.S. Government’s ability to identify and recover stolen
    assets linked to foreign government corruption that are held at U.S.
    financial institutions.
-   Working with the private sector to improve the international
    business climate by encouraging the adoption and enforcement of
    anti-corruption compliance programs by U.S. and international
    companies.

**Preserving and strengthening the multilateral anti-corruption
architecture:** The U.S. Government is committed to strengthening the
international anti-corruption architecture, which includes multilateral
initiatives, commitments, and standards that push countries to make real
improvements in countering corruption.  The United States will continue
to preserve and strengthen this vital architecture, including by:

-   Working with the G7 and G20 to implement strong transparency and
    anti-corruption measures across ministerial tracks.
-   Building and expanding accountable, effective, and resilient
    security institutions to target corruption in finance, acquisition,
    and human resources functions.
-   Reinvigorating U.S. participation across a number of initiatives,
    including the Open Government Partnership and Extractive Industries
    Transparency Initiative.

**Improving diplomatic engagement and leveraging foreign assistance
resources to achieve anti-corruption policy goals:** Diplomatic
engagement and foreign assistance, including security assistance, are
vital to the United States’ efforts to counter corruption.  Taken
together, these efforts can bolster partner governments’ capacity and
will to counter corruption, and support civil society and others engaged
in advocacy and action.  To safeguard assistance dollars from
inadvertently supporting corrupt actors, the United States will improve
its risk management processes and better understand local political,
economic, and social dynamics.  The United States will therefore expand
and enhance its efforts, including by:

-   Elevating anti-corruption work as a priority within its diplomatic
    efforts.  
-   Reviewing and re-evaluating criteria for government-to-government
    assistance, including around transparency and accountability.
-   Expanding anti-corruption focused U.S. assistance, and monitoring
    the efficacy of this assistance.
-   Building additional flexibility into anti-corruption initiatives and
    broader assistance efforts to respond to unexpected situations
    worldwide.
-   Bolstering public sector anti-corruption capacity and support,
    including to independent audit and oversight institutions.

[The United States Strategy on Countering
Corruption](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/United-States-Strategy-on-Countering-Corruption.pdf)
marks a new chapter in the United States’ efforts to curb corruption’s
harmful effects.  As accountability is vital, Federal departments and
agencies will report annually to the President on progress made against
the Strategy’s objectives.
