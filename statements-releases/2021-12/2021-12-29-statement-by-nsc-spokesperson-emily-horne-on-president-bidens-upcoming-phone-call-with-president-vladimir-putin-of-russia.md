President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will hold a phone call with President
Vladimir Putin of Russia on Thursday, December 30, 2021 to discuss a
range of topics, including upcoming diplomatic engagements with Russia.

The Biden Administration continues to engage in extensive diplomacy with
our European Allies and partners, consulting and coordinating on a
common approach in response to Russiaâ€™s military build-up on the border
with Ukraine. President Biden has spoken with leaders across Europe, and
Biden Administration officials have engaged multilaterally with NATO,
the EU, and the OSCE. Officials have also held numerous consultations
with their counterparts, including those from eastern flank countries
bilaterally and in the B9 format as well as Ukraine.
