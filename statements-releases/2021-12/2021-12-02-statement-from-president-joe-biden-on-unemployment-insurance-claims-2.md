title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Unemployment Insurance\_Claims"
---
 
This morning, we received additional evidence of the strength of
America’s historic economic recovery and Americans getting back to
work. New unemployment claims are now at a level not seen since March 7,
2020 and last week’s claims were revised down to their lowest level
since 1969. In addition, the four-week average of unemployment claims
fell to their lowest level since the pandemic began – just 225,500.
Initial unemployment claims are now down more than 70 percent since I
became President, and total claims filed each week are now down by
around 16 million over that same period.  
  
America’s jobs recovery is strong, and our COVID strategy is allowing
millions of workers to find and keep jobs. There is still more work to
do build our economy back better, including addressing recent increases
in prices. In addition to recent steps I have taken to address supply
chain bottle necks and reduce the price of gas at the pump, the historic
Build Back Better Act will cut costs that American families have
struggled with for years. Today’s data underscore the historic progress
we are making and the importance of building on that progress in the
weeks ahead.
