title: "Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate on Imposing\
  \ Sanctions on Foreign Persons Involved in the Global Illicit Drug\_Trade"
---
 
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq.*), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order
imposing sanctions on foreign persons involved in the global illicit
drug trade.   
  
I have determined that the trafficking into the United States of illicit
drugs, including fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, is causing the
deaths of tens of thousands of Americans annually, as well as non-fatal
overdoses with their own tragic human toll.  Drug cartels, transnational
criminal organizations, and their facilitators are the primary sources
of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals that fuel the current opioid
epidemic, as well as drug-related violence that harms our communities. 
I find that international drug trafficking — including the illicit
production, global sale, and widespread distribution of illegal
drugs; the rise of extremely potent drugs such as fentanyl and other
synthetic opioids; as well as the growing role of Internet-based drug
sales — constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  This
serious threat requires our country to modernize and update our response
to drug trafficking.  I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with
that threat.  
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.  
                               

Sincerely,  
                                JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
