  Pill"

I am encouraged by the promising data released by Pfizer today, showing
that its antiviral pill is effective at reducing the risk of severe
illness in people infected with COVID-19. This news provides another
potentially powerful tool in our fight against the virus, including the
Omicron variant.  
   
Several steps remain before the Pfizer pill can become available,
including authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. To make
sure that we are ready, my Administration has already placed an order
for enough of these pills to treat 10 million Americans.  
   
Getting vaccinated and getting your booster shot remain the most
important tools we have to save lives. But if this treatment is indeed
authorized — and once the pills are widely available — it will mark a
significant step forward in our path out of the pandemic. The
combination of widespread vaccinations and boosters, testing, and
effective pills for those who become ill will help us further reduce the
impact of COVID-19 on our lives and our economy as we continue to build
back better.
