title: 'FACT SHEET: Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Call to Action to Reduce
  Maternal Mortality and Morbidity'
---
 
*As part of the Call to Action, the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) releases new report estimating that 720,000 more people
would gain Medicaid postpartum coverage if states act; the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) proposes establishment of
“Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation and issues guidance to states
on how to provide Medicaid coverage for a full year postpartum*

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have long
championed policies to improve maternal health and equity, and
addressing the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis is a key priority
of their Administration. America’s maternal mortality rates are among
the highest in the developed world, and they are especially high among
Black women and Native American women, regardless of their income or
education levels. On behalf of the Biden-Harris Administration, Vice
President Harris is issuing a nationwide Call to Action to both the
public and private sectors to help improve health outcomes for parents
and infants in the United States.  
  
Today marks the first-ever White House Maternal Health Day of Action. In
addition to substantial investments proposed in the Build Back Better
Act, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new commitments to
support safe pregnancies and childbirth, and reduce complications and
mortality in the year following birth.  
  
**The Administration will:**

-   **Build Back Better**: The Build Back Better Act, passed by the U.S.
    House of Representatives, includes an historic $3 billion investment
    in maternal health.
-   **Encourage states to expand postpartum coverage**: CMS is releasing
    new guidance to help states provide 12 months of continuous
    postpartum coverage through their Medicaid programs, up from 60
    days. Currently, states are only required to provide coverage for 60
    days postpartum, despite research showing that many deaths and
    complications occur more than 60 days following delivery. This
    easier pathway for states was established by the American Rescue
    Plan and will become available in April 2022. States, including
    Virginia, New Jersey, and Illinois, have already extended postpartum
    coverage for families in their states and CMS is encouraging all
    states to take up the new option.
-   **Report on the impact of postpartum coverage: **HHS’s Office of the
    Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) is releasing
    a new report showing the dramatic impact of state extensions of
    Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months. If every state adopted an
    extension — as required in the Build Back Better Act —then the
    number of Americans getting coverage for a full year postpartum
    would roughly double, extending coverage for an estimated 720,000
    people in a given year.
-   **Create a new designation of the quality of maternal health
    services for our nation’s hospitals: **CMS is planning to propose
    the establishment of a “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation,
    which would be the first-ever hospital quality designation by HHS
    specifically focused on maternity care. This designation is intended
    to be awarded to those hospitals that participate in a collaborative
    program aimed at improving maternal outcomes and implement patient
    safety practices. CMS would add the designation to their “Care
    Compare” website to allow consumers to choose hospitals that have
    implemented best practices.

**The Build Back Better Act’s Investment in Maternal Health**  
  
Once passed, the Build Back Better Act’s maternal health provisions
will:

-   Invest over $3 billion in new maternal health funding, with
    transformative new investments in growing and diversifying the
    perinatal workforce, improving data collection and maternal health
    risk monitoring, addressing the social factors that contribute to
    poor maternal health outcomes, addressing substance use disorders
    that impact maternal health, promoting increased maternal health
    research, improving postpartum coverage, and better coordinating
    care.
-   Require all states to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12
    months postpartum, eliminating potentially deadly gaps in health
    insurance at a critical time for individuals. Currently, states are
    only required to provide coverage for 60 days postpartum, despite
    research showing that many deaths and complications occur more than
    60 days following delivery.
-   Spark innovation by allowing states to establish maternal health
    homes to better coordinate health care for individuals before,
    during, and following birth.

**Additional Background on Biden-Harris Efforts to Combat the Maternal
Health Crisis**  
  
The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any wealthy
nation in the world. Every year, people in the United States die of
pregnancy-related causes at more than double the rate among nations with
similar levels of income. Maternal mortality statistics in the United
States have actually worsened over the past 20 years, even as rates
among peer nations have generally improved. In addition, each year, tens
of thousands of mothers experience severe morbidity—unintended
consequences of pregnancy that result in life-altering health
challenges, such as severe heart issues, hemorrhages, seizures, and
blood infections.  
  
This maternal health crisis is particularly devastating for Black and
Native American women, and women in rural communities. Black women are
more than three times as likely to die from pregnancy-related
complications as white women, and Native American women are more than
twice as likely, regardless of their income or education. Pregnant women
who live in rural communities are about 60 percent more likely to die
before, during, or following birth than women in urban communities.  
  
In April, the President issued the first-ever [presidential
proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/13/a-proclamation-on-black-maternal-health-week-2021/) for
Black Maternal Health Week, which emphasized the importance of
addressing this crisis. The Administration simultaneously released
a [fact
sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/13/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initial-actions-to-address-the-black-maternal-health-crisis/) outlining
significant requests for new funding related to maternal health, actions
to expand Medicaid coverage for pregnancy and postpartum care, and grant
funding for rural maternal care.  
  
As a Senator, Vice President Harris introduced the Maternal CARE Act and
the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, which would provide significant
additional resources to address the crisis. This maternal health work by
Vice President Harris and other Congressional leaders is now a key
component of the Build Back Better Act, which will expand access to
maternal care and make unprecedented new investments to drive down
mortality and morbidity. President Biden and Vice President Harris call
on the Senate to swiftly pass Build Back Better, and make these reforms
a reality for America’s families.
