President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine.  President Biden voiced the deep concerns of the
United States and our European Allies about Russia’s aggressive actions
towards Ukraine and made clear that the U.S. and our Allies would
respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of a
further military intervention.  He reaffirmed the United States’
unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity.  President Biden made clear that the United States and its
allies and partners are committed to the principle of “no decisions or
discussions about Ukraine without Ukraine.”  The leaders called on
Russia to de-escalate tensions and agreed that diplomacy is the best way
to make meaningful progress on conflict resolution.  President Biden
underscored the readiness of the United States to engage in support of
confidence-building measures to advance the implementation of the Minsk
Agreements, in support of the Normandy Format.
