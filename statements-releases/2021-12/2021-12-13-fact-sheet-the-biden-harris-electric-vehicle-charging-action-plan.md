*Vice President Kamala Harris to Announce Action Plan that Fast Tracks
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Investments*

President Biden has united automakers and autoworkers to drive American
leadership forward on clean cars, and he set an [ambitious
target](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/)
of 50% of electric vehicle (EV) sale shares in the U.S. by 2030. Now,
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will supercharge America’s efforts to
lead the electric future, Building a Better America where we can
strengthen domestic supply chains, outcompete the world, and make
electric cars cheaper for working families.  
  
President Biden, American families, automakers, and autoworkers agree:
the future of transportation is electric. The electric car future is
cleaner, more equitable, more affordable, and an economic opportunity to
support good-paying, union jobs across American supply chains as
automakers continue investing in manufacturing clean vehicles and the
batteries that power them.  
  
**Today, the Biden-Harris-Administration is releasing an EV Charging
Action Plan to outline steps federal agencies are taking to support
developing and deploying chargers in American communities across the
country.** As a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the
Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Transportation (DOT) will
establish a Joint Office of Energy and Transportation focused on
deploying EV infrastructure, working hand-in-hand to collect input and
guidance from industry leaders, manufacturers, workers, and other
stakeholders that will ensure the national network provides convenient
charging for all. The initial focus will be building a convenient,
reliable public charging network that can build public confidence, with
a focus on filling gaps in rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach
locations.  
  
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the most transformative
investment in electric vehicle charging in U.S. history that will put us
on the path to a convenient and equitable network of 500,000 chargers
and make EVs accessible to all Americas for both local and long-distance
trips. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes **$5 billion** in
formula funding for
[states](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/04/white-house-releases-state-fact-sheets-highlighting-the-impact-of-the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-nationwide/)
with a goal to build a national charging network. 10% is set-aside each
year for the Secretary to provide grants to States to help fill gaps in
the network. The Law also provides **$2.5 billion** for communities and
corridors through a competitive grant program that will support
innovative approaches and ensure that charger deployment meets
Administration priorities such as supporting rural charging, improving
local air quality and increasing EV charging access in disadvantaged
communities. Together, this is the largest-ever U.S. investment in EV
charging and will be a transformative down payment on the transition to
a zero-emission future.  
  
With the historic investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the
Biden-Harris Administration is laying the foundation for a nationwide
network of EV charging infrastructure to provide a reliable, affordable,
convenient, seamless user experience that is equitable and accessible
for all Americans. This network will enable:

-   An accelerated adoption of electric vehicles for all private
    consumers and commercial fleets, including those who cannot reliably
    charge at their home that can improve our air quality, reduce
    emissions, put us on a path to net-zero emissions by no later than
    2050, and position U.S. industries to lead global efforts.
-   Targeted equity benefits for disadvantaged communities, reducing
    mobility and energy burdens while also creating jobs and supporting
    businesses.
-   Create family-sustaining union jobs that can’t be outsourced.

**<u>Electric Vehicle Infrastructure</u>**  
  
**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the following
actions:**

-   **Establishing a Joint Office of Energy and Transportation**:
    Tomorrow, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and Transportation
    Secretary Pete Buttigieg will sign an agreement enabling them to
    leverage the best resources, talent, and experience at the DOT and
    the DOE, including the DOE’s National Labs. The Joint Office will
    ensure the agencies can work together to implement the EV charging
    network and other electrification provisions in the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. This will provide states, communities, industry,
    labor, and consumer groups with a coordinated Federal approach and a
    “one-stop-shop” for resources on EV Charging and related topics. The
    agencies will complete a Memorandum of Understanding on December
    14<sup>th</sup> to formally launch the Joint Office.  
-   **Gathering Diverse Stakeholder Input:** The White House is
    convening a series of initial stakeholder meetings on topics
    including partnerships with state and local government, domestic
    manufacturing, equity and environmental justice, civil rights,
    partnering with tribal communities, and maximizing environmental
    benefits. DOT and DOE will also launch a new Advisory Committee on
    Electric Vehicles and is targeting to appoint members to this
    committee by the end of the first quarter of 2022. DOT released an
    updated guide to deploying EV Charging in highway right-of-way in
    response to stakeholder interest. To gather input from the widest
    possible array of stakeholders, DOT has a new [EV Charging Request
    for
    Information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/29/2021-25868/development-of-guidance-for-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-deployment),
    where stakeholders can submit their priorities for Federal standards
    and guidance for consideration.  
-   **Preparing to Issue Guidance and Standards for States and Cities**:
    The Administration is already hard at work developing the guidance
    and standards described in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. No
    later than February 11<sup>th</sup>, DOT will publish guidance for
    States and cities to strategically deploy EV charging stations to
    build out a national network along our nation’s highway system. 
    This guidance will look at where we already have EV charging and
    where we need—or will need—more of it.  It will focus on the needs
    of disadvantaged and rural communities, catalyze further private
    investment in EV charging, and ensure we’re smartly connecting to
    our electric grid. No later than May 13<sup>th</sup>, DOT will
    publish standards for EV chargers in the national network to ensure
    they work, they’re safe, and they’re accessible to everyone.  
-   **Requesting Information from Domestic Manufacturers:** EV charger
    manufacturing, assembly, installation, and maintenance all have the
    potential to not only support our sustainability and climate goals,
    but also to drive domestic competitiveness and create good-paying,
    union jobs in the United States. To ensure this network of EV
    chargers can be built in America, by America, DOT and DOE are
    working directly with manufacturers, automakers and labor to
    understand what domestic sourcing is available today, and what may
    be possible in the future.  In November, DOT and DOE  released a
    [request for
    information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/24/2021-25717/buy-america-request-for-information)
    from domestic manufacturers to identify EV chargers and other
    charging related components that meet USDOT Buy America requirements
    and to highlight the benefits of shifting all manufacturing and
    assembly processes to the United States.  
-   **New Solicitation for Alternative Fuel Corridors:** Today, the DOT
    is announcing a forthcoming solicitation for the 6th round of
    Alternative Fuel Corridors designations. This program, created by
    the FAST Act in 2015, recognizes highway segments that have
    infrastructure plans to allow travel on alternative fuels, including
    electricity. FHWA will establish a recurring process to regularly
    update these corridors.

The current network of over 100,000 public chargers operates with
different plug types, payment options, data availability, and hardware
hookups. Today’s actions will establish a more uniform approach, provide
greater convenience for customers, and offer increased confidence for
industry.  These federal programs will spur additional private sector
investments and drive the build-out of a user-friendly, cost-effective,
and financially sustainable national network creating well-paying jobs
across manufacturing, installation, and operation. A ubiquitous charging
infrastructure targeted to meet different consumers’ needs will provide
equitable benefits to all Americans and provide flexibility for future
investments, effective integration with a clean power system, and
support a growing and diversifying fleet of electrified vehicles.  
  
**<u>Electric Vehicle Batteries</u>**  
  
Another key component of our electric vehicle strategy is to increase
domestic manufacturing of EV batteries and components and advance
environmentally responsible domestic sourcing and recycling of critical
minerals.  
  
In June, the Biden-Harris Administration released [100-day
reviews](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf?utm_source=sfmc%E2%80%8B&utm_medium=email%E2%80%8B&utm_campaign=20210610_Global_Manufacturing_Economic_Update_June_Members)
of the supply chains of four critical products, including high-capacity
batteries and critical minerals and materials. The reviews made dozens
of recommendations across Federal agencies securing a reliable and
sustainable end-to-end domestic supply chain for advanced batteries.
These recommendations include supporting sustainable and responsible
domestic mining and processing of key battery minerals, such as lithium,
cobalt, and nickel, and ensuring new domestic automotive battery
production adheres to high-road labor standards.  

-   The Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries released the [National
    Blueprint for Lithium
    Batteries](https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/national-blueprint-lithium-batteries),
    codifying the findings of the battery supply chain review in a
    10-year, whole-of-government plan to urgently develop a domestic
    lithium battery supply chain that combats the climate crisis by
    creating good-paying clean energy jobs across America.  
-   The DOE Loan Programs Office (LPO) published new
    [guidance](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/critical-materials) and a
    [fact
    sheet](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/DOE-LPO_Program_Handout_Critical_Materials_June2021_0.pdf)
    for the approximately **$17 billion** in loan authority in the
    Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) to
    support the domestic battery supply chain. LPO will leverage full
    statutory authority to finance key strategic areas of development
    and fill deficits in the domestic supply chain capacity. This will
    include the ATVM program making loans to manufacturers of advanced
    technology vehicle battery cells and packs for re-equipping,
    expanding or establishing such manufacturing facilities in the
    United States.  
-   DOE’s Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) launched a new effort
    to support deployment of energy storage projects by federal
    agencies, including a federal government-wide energy storage review
    that will evaluate the current opportunity for deploying battery
    storage at federal sites and a call for projects from federal sites
    interested in deploying energy storage projects. These actions build
    on steps taken earlier this year to leverage **$13 million** in
    FEMP’s Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation
    Technologies grants to unlock an estimated **$260 million** or more
    in project investments, including battery storage projects.

There are already promising signs that the Administration strategy is
working and industry is ready to step up. For example, Lithium is a
critical input to batteries where the United States currently has very
little domestic supply. The Biden Administration has funded two dozen
teams to expand sourcing of lithium from geothermal brines and approved
a permit for the Nevada-based Thacker Pass lithium mine. Automakers area
also signing contracts that leverage domestic supply, including Ford
sourcing lithium from recycled content through Redwood Materials, GM
sourcing lithium from geothermal brines in the Salton Sea with
Controlled Thermal Resources, and Tesla sourcing lithium from a Piedmont
project in North Carolina.  
  
The investments proposed by the Biden Administration will accelerate and
amplify this progress. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes more
than **$7 billion** in funding to accelerate innovations and facilities
across the battery supply chain from battery materials refining,
processing and manufacturing to battery manufacturing, including
components, to battery recycling and reuse. These investments will
support the development of a North American battery supply chain, help
expand manufacturing and recycling facilities in the United States and
substantially advance the battery recycling through research,
development and demonstration projects in collaboration with retailers
as well as state and local governments.  
  
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes:

-   **$3 billion** in competitive grants for battery minerals and
    refined materials aimed at accelerating the development of the North
    American battery supply chain.
-   An additional **$3 billion** for competitive grants aimed at
    building, retooling, or expanding manufacturing of batteries and
    battery components (such as cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes), and
    to establish recycling facilities in the United States.
-   Recognizing the need for innovative and practical approaches to
    battery and critical mineral recycling, the act includes research,
    development, and demonstration recycling projects (**$60 million**)
    and efforts in cooperation with retailers (**$15 million**) and
    state and local governments (**$50 million**) to increase the
    collection of spent batteries for reuse, recycling or proper
    disposal. The electric drive vehicle battery recycling and
    second-life applications program (**$200 million**) is focused on
    making electric vehicles batteries (e.g., optimized designs) easier
    to recycle and utilize in secondary applications before recycling.
-   An additional **$750 million** “Advanced Energy Manufacturing and
    Recycling Grant Program” to re-equip, expand or establish an
    industrial or manufacturing facility to reduce GHG emissions of that
    facility substantially below current best practices.
