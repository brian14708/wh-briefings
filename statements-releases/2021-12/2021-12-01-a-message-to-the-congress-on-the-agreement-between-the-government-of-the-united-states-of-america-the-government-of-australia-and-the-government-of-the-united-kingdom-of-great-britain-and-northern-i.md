title: A Message to the Congress on the Agreement between the Government of the United
  States of America, the Government of Australia, and the Government of the United
  Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to section 123 d. of
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(d)), the text
of an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America,
the Government of Australia, and the Government of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the “United Kingdom”) for the
Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information (the “Agreement”).  I
am also pleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and
determination concerning the Agreement.  The memorandum submitted to me
by the Secretary of Energy providing a summary position on the Agreement
is also enclosed.

Pursuant to the enhanced trilateral security partnership called “AUKUS”
announced earlier this year, our three governments are engaging in an
18-month consultation period to seek an optimal pathway for delivery of
nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy at the earliest
achievable date.  The Agreement would permit the three Parties to
communicate and exchange Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information and would
provide authorization to share certain Restricted Data as may be needed
during trilateral discussions, thereby enabling full and effective
consultations.  

In my judgment, the Agreement meets all statutory requirements.

I have determined that the United Kingdom and Australia, by
participating with the United States pursuant to international
arrangements, are making substantial and material contributions to the
mutual defense and security.  The United Kingdom is party to the North
Atlantic Treaty, and Australia is party to the Australia, New Zealand,
and United States Security Treaty. 

I have approved the Agreement, authorized its execution, and urge that
the Congress give it favorable consideration.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
December 1, 2021.
