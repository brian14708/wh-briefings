title: "President\_Biden Names Twelfth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing two new judicial nominees, both of whom are
extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law
and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.  
  
For example, the President’s nominee for the United States Court of
Appeals or the Eleventh Circuit, Nancy Gbana Abudu, would be the first
African-American woman judge ever to sit on the Eleventh Circuit, the
second woman of color ever to sit on that court, and only the third
African-American judge ever to sit on that court. She would also be the
first person of color to serve on the Eleventh Circuit from Georgia.  
  
This is President Biden’s twelfth round of nominees for federal judicial
positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to
75.  
  
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies.  
  
These are the President’s final judicial nominations for 2021, a year
during which 40 circuit and district court judges were confirmed – the
most since Ronald Reagan was President. And 80% of those confirmed
judges are women, with 53% being people of color.
