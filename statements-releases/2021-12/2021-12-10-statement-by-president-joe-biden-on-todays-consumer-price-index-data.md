title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Today\u2019s Consumer Price Index\_Data"
---
 
Today’s numbers reflect the pressures that economies around the world
are facing as we emerge from a global pandemic — prices are rising.  But
developments in the weeks after these data were collected last month
show that price and cost increase are slowing, although not as quickly
as we’d like.  
  
Half of the price increases in this report are in cars and energy costs
from November. Since then, we have seen significant energy price
reductions. Gas prices nationally are down from their peak; prices in 20
states are already below their 20-year average and the price of natural
gas is down 25% from its November average. On cars, we have in recent
weeks begun to see a decline in used car prices on the wholesale market
which should translate into lower prices for Americans in the months
ahead.  
  
Even with this progress, price increases continue to squeeze family
budgets.  We are making progress on pandemic related challenges to our
supply chain which make it more expensive to get goods on shelves, and I
expect more progress on that in the weeks ahead.   
  
Finally, the challenge of prices underscores the importance that
Congress move without delay to pass my Build Back Better plan, which
lowers how much families pay for health care, prescription drugs, child
care, and more. American families should not have to wait to get relief
on the cost of prescription drugs like insulin, or see their childcare
costs cut by more than half. Independent economists have projected that
this plan will save a typical family of four $7,400 every year — while
easing long-run inflationary pressures on our economy. For anyone who,
like me, is concerned about costs facing American families, passing BBB
is the most immediate and direct step we can take to deliver.    
  
Our economy — like the economies of other major countries — was
devastated by the pandemic.  Yesterday, we got more proof that our jobs
recovery is on track and setting records – with unemployment insurance
claims falling to their lowest level in 50 years and nearly 6 million
Americans back to work.  Economic growth is stronger here than virtually
any other nation. Americans have more money in their pockets than this
time last year – $100 more each month than last year – even after
accounting for price increases.  But we have to get prices and costs
down before consumers will feel confident in that recovery.  That is a
top goal of my administration.
