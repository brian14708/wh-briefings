Led by Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer and
President Ursula von der Leyenâ€™s Head of Cabinet Bjoern Seibert, both
sides agreed on the importance of the transatlantic partnership and
leadership to beat the pandemic, strengthen the supply chain, and
strengthen global health security in the long term.  
  
Following a briefing on the Omicron variant and recent developments by
CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony
Fauci, and Special Advisor to the President of the European Commission
Dr. Peter Piot, the two sides discussed a number of areas including:
ongoing efforts to donate and deliver more than a 1.9 billion vaccine
doses around the world; accelerating efforts to get shots into arms,
including assistance to countries in need; coordinating initiatives to
boost global production of COVID-19 vaccines and critical supplies; and
cooperating on joint health threat assessments and R&D, and more. The
two delegations reiterated their call for stronger actions and
commitments from nations around the world in this effort.  
  
The delegations also underscored that bold action is needed to prepare
for future health emergencies and pandemics. Both sides agreed on the
importance of establishing a Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) for
global health security and pandemic preparedness in early 2022 with
sustainable capitalization, and noted the United States and European
Union will work with the G7, the G20, low and lower-middle income
countries, the World Bank, the World Health Organization, and additional
organizations to accomplish this goal.
