title: Statement from President Joe Biden on Unemployment Insurance Claims
---
 
Today, we received further evidence that our jobs recovery is one of the
strongest ever. The average number of Americans filing for unemployment
over the last four weeks is now at its lowest level since 1969. When I
took office, over 18 million were receiving unemployment benefits, today
only 2 million are. We’ve added nearly six million jobs this year – the
most of any first year president in history. That’s good news for the
millions of families who are back to work and will have a happier
holiday season this year. 

Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, and our successful vaccination
program, Americans are back at work at a record-setting pace. And
families have more money in their pockets: Americans on average have
about $100 more in their pockets each month than they did last year,
after accounting for inflation.

Even as we’ve built a historic jobs and economic recovery, addressing
rising prices, supply chain challenges, and COVID-19 are my top
priorities. We need to continue to take concrete actions to address
elevated prices and to lower costs for American families – including by
lowering prescription drug costs, health care costs, childcare costs,
and housing costs with the Build Back Better plan. And, we need to do
everything we can to get as many Americans vaccinated and boosted as
possible.
