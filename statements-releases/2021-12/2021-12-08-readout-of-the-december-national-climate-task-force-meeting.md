*Following COP26 and the President’s signing of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the National Task Force launches new Federal
Sustainability Plan to lead by example across procurement and
operations*

Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the National
Climate Task Force with Cabinet members and senior leadership from
across the Biden-Harris Administration. This meeting followed on
President Biden’s signing today of an Executive Order on [Catalyzing
Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal
Sustainability](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-catalyzing-americas-clean-energy-economy-through-federal-sustainability/),
which directs the federal government to use its scale and procurement
power to achieve five new, ambitious goals on carbon pollution-free
electricity, zero-emission vehicle acquisitions, Buy Clean policies,
net-zero emissions buildings, and net-zero emissions from overall
federal operations. The Task Force discussed the accompanying Federal
Sustainability Plan, which agencies are implementing to achieve these
five goals, bolster climate resilience, and advance equity and
environmental justice across operations planning and decision making.

The Task Force was also joined by White House Senior Advisor and
Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu, who provided
an update on ensuring clean energy, resilience, and environmental
justice are woven throughout the implementation of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, including advancing priorities such as the Justice40
Initiative.

Task Force members then discussed ongoing work on implementation of the
U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan; development of a Justice40
Scorecard; and interagency collaboration on areas including fuel
efficiency and vehicle emissions standards, clean energy deployment, and
climate resilience.

The meeting also follows the COP26 U.N. Climate Change Conference,
attended by a U.S. delegation including President Biden, twelve Cabinet
members and senior Administration officials, members of Congress, and
leaders from across states, territories, Tribal Nations, and local
governments. Throughout COP26, this delegation strengthened global
partnerships and highlighted how the President’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and Build Back Better Act will enable us to meet our
commitment to reduce U.S. emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels in 2030.

As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 [Executive Order on Tackling
the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/),
