President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Vladimir Putin
of Russia. President Biden urged Russia to de-escalate tensions with
Ukraine. He made clear that the United States and its allies and
partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.
President Biden also expressed support for diplomacy, starting early
next year with the bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue, at NATO
through the NATO-Russia Council, and at the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. President Biden reiterated that substantive
progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of
de-escalation rather than escalation.
