title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on President Joe\_Biden\
  \ and Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019 Meeting with Republican\_Senators"
---
 
The President and the Vice President had a substantive and productive
discussion with Republican senators this evening at the White House. The
group shared a desire to get help to the American people, who are
suffering through the worst health and economic crisis in a generation. 

While there were areas of agreement, the President also reiterated his
view that Congress must respond boldly and urgently, and noted many
areas which the Republican senators’ proposal does not address. He
reiterated that while he is hopeful that the Rescue Plan can pass with
bipartisan support, a reconciliation package is a path to achieve that
end. The President also made clear that the American Rescue Plan was
carefully designed to meet the stakes of this moment, and any changes in
it cannot leave the nation short of its pressing needs. 

The President expressed his hope that the group could continue to
discuss ways to strengthen the American Rescue Plan as it moves forward,
and find areas of common ground ***—*** including work on small business
support and nutrition programs. He reiterated, however, that he will not
slow down work on this urgent crisis response, and will not settle for a
package that fails to meet the moment.
