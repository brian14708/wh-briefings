  \ Act of\_2021"

Immigration is an irrefutable source of our strength and is essential to
who we are as a nation. The last four years of misguided policies have
exacerbated the already broken immigration system and highlighted the
critical need for reform. I applaud the important work done by Senator
Bob Menendez and Representative Linda Sánchez to modernize our
immigration system and introduce The U.S. Citizenship Act. I look
forward to working with leaders in the House and Senate to address the
wrongdoings of the past administration and restore justice, humanity,
and order to our immigration system. This is an important first step in
pursuing immigration policies that unite families, grow and enhance our
economy, and safeguard our security.

The legislation I sent to Congress will bring about much needed change
to an immigration system where reform is long overdue. It will
responsibly manage the border with smart investments. It will address
the root causes of irregular migration from Central America. It will
modernize our legal immigration pathways and create an earned path to
citizenship for so many – including Dreamers, farmworkers and TPS
holders.

These are not Democratic or Republican priorities – but American ones. 
I’ve laid out my vision for what it’ll take to reform our immigration
system and I look forward to working with leaders in Congress to get
this done.
