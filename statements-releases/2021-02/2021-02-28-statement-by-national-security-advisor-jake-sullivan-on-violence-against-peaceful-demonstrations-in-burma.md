title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Violence Against Peaceful\
  \ Demonstrations in\_Burma"
---
 
The United States is alarmed by the Burmese security forces’ violence
against peaceful protestors. The killings today represent an escalation
of the ongoing crackdown on pro-democracy protestors since the February
1 coup. I offer my heartfelt condolences to the families of the
courageous protestors who have lost their lives while peacefully
demonstrating in support of democracy in Burma.

The United States stands in solidarity with the people of Burma, who
continue to bravely voice their aspirations for democracy, rule of law,
and respect for human rights. We will continue coordinating closely with
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world to
hold those responsible for violence to account, and to reinforce our
support for the people of Burma. To that end, we are preparing
additional actions to impose further costs on those responsible for this
latest outbreak of violence and the recent coup. We will have more to
share in the coming days.
