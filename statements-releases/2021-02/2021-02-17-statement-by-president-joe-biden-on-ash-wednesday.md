title: Statement by President Joe Biden on Ash Wednesday
---
 
Today, I join Christians across our country and around the world in
observing Ash Wednesday. As we enter into the season of Lent, we know
this moment of repentance, reflection, and renewal comes in the midst of
a painful winter for our nation and the world.

On this Ash Wednesday and every day, we hold every family with an empty
place at their table in our hearts. We pray for all those who have
fallen on hard times and are worried about what morning will bring. Let
us find strength in each other and faith that provides us purpose. And
let us look with hope and anticipation toward Easter and brighter days
ahead.
