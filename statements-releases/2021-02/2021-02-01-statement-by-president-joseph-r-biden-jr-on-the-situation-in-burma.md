The military’s seizure of power in Burma, the detention of Aung San Suu
Kyi and other civilian officials, and the declaration of a national
state of emergency are a direct assault on the country’s transition to
democracy and the rule of law. In a democracy, force should never seek
to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a
credible election. For almost a decade, the people of Burma have been
steadily working to establish elections, civilian governance, and the
peaceful transfer of power. That progress should be respected.

The international community should come together in one voice to press
the Burmese military to immediately relinquish the power they have
seized, release the activists and officials they have detained, lift all
telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence against
civilians. The United States is taking note of those who stand with the
people of Burma in this difficult hour. We will work with our partners
throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of
democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those
responsible for overturning Burma’s democratic transition.

The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based
on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will
necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities,
followed by appropriate action.

The United States will stand up for democracy wherever it is under
attack.
