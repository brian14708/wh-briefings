It was nearly two weeks ago that Jill and I paid our respects to Capitol
Police officer Brian Sicknick, who laid in honor in the Rotunda after
losing his life protecting the Capitol from a riotous, violent mob on
January 6, 2021.

Today, 57 Senators – including a record 7 Republicans – voted to find
former President Trump guilty for inciting that deadly insurrection on
our very democracy. The Senate vote followed the bipartisan vote to
impeach him by the House of Representatives. While the final vote did
not lead to a conviction, the substance of the charge is not in dispute.
Even those opposed to the conviction, like Senate Minority Leader
McConnell, believe Donald Trump was guilty of a “disgraceful dereliction
of duty” and “practically and morally responsible for provoking” the
violence unleashed on the Capitol.

Tonight, I am thinking about those who bravely stood guard that January
day. I’m thinking about all those who lost their lives, all those whose
lives were threatened, and all those who are still today living with
terror they lived through that day. And I’m thinking of those who
demonstrated the courage to protect the integrity of our democracy –
Democrats and Republicans, election officials and judges, elected
representatives and poll workers – before and after the election. 

This sad chapter in our history has reminded us that democracy is
fragile. That it must always be defended. That we must be ever vigilant.
That violence and extremism has no place in America. And that each of us
has a duty and responsibility as Americans, and especially as leaders,
to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.

That is how we end this uncivil war and heal the very soul of our
nation. That is the task ahead. And it’s a task we must undertake
together. As the <span style="text-decoration: underline">United</span>
States of America.
