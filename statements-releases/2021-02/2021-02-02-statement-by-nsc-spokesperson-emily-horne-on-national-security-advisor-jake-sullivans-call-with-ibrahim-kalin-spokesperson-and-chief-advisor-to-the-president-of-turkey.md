National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with
Ibrahim Kalin, Spokesperson and Chief Advisor to the President of
Turkey. Mr. Sullivan underscored the Biden Administration’s desire to
build constructive U.S.-Turkey ties, expanding areas of cooperation and
managing disagreements effectively. He conveyed the administration’s
intention to strengthen transatlantic security through NATO, expressing
concern that Turkey’s acquisition of the Russian S-400 surface-to-air
missile system undermines alliance cohesion and effectiveness. Mr.
Sullivan welcomed the resumption of exploratory talks between Turkey and
Greece, and he expressed support for plans by United Nations Secretary
General Guterres to resume talks on Cyprus.  He underscored the Biden
administration’s broad commitment to supporting democratic institutions
and the rule of law. They agreed to cooperate on global challenges, such
as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, and to consult closely on
regional issues of mutual concern.
