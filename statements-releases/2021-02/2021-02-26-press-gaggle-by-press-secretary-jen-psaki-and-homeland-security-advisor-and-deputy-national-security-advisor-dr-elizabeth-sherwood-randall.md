title: "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki and Homeland Security Advisor and\
  \ Deputy National Security Advisor Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall"

Aboard Air Force One  
en Route Houston, Texas

11:26 A.M. CST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi.  Thank you for your patience.  I’m sorry.  All right. 
So, welcome again to Air Force One.  We are thrilled to have Dr. Liz
Sherwood-Randall with us.  She’s going to give us an overview of the
first stop on the President’s trip to provide a bit of an update. 
She’ll be able to take a few of your questions, and then we’ll let her
go.  And I’ll do a full gaggle after that.  
   
So we’ll turn it over Dr. Sherwood-Randall.  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  Hello, everyone.  It’s a privilege to be here
with you, to join the President on this important trip to offer the full
support of the federal government to the people of Texas who have
suffered tremendously over the past three weeks.  
   
As someone who has worked for decades on strengthening our ability to
prepare for and respond to emergencies, I want to underscore something
the President has made very clear to us: In crises like this, it is our
duty to mobilize prompt and competent federal support to American
citizens, and we have to ensure that bureaucracy and politics do not
stand in the way.  
   
We look forward to meeting with Governor Abbott and other state and
local leaders to learn more about the recovery situation on the ground
and what more we can do to help.  
   
As you know, the President directed us to rapidly mobilize as many
federal resources as possible to assist Texas’s recovery efforts, along
with recovery efforts in the other states that were affected by the
severe winter storm.  He promptly approved an emergency declaration for
three states — Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana — and a major disaster
declaration for two states — Texas and Oklahoma.  
   
These declarations have allowed FEMA and others to surge more than 2
million meals and nearly 2 million gallons of water, over 60 generators,
and more than 100,000 gallons of fuel, and lots and lots of blankets to
Texans.  These numbers keep changing as we do more, but the bottom line
is: We’re very focused on meeting immediate needs, as well as providing
direct, individual financial assistance to uninsured families to help
them recover from the disastrous effects of extreme weather.  
   
As of yesterday afternoon, FEMA had already awarded over $9 million in
individual assistance grants to Texans.  More broadly, we’ve brought the
full range of federal resources to bear in a whole-of-government effort
involving the Department of Defense, the Agriculture Department, the
Health and Human Services Department, the Environmental Protection
Agency, and the Department of Energy.  
   
All of these agencies and others have been working hard to provide
Texans with the resources they need.  For example, on the Department of
Energy, they issued the most expansive emergency order in the history of
the agency, which permitted Texas electricity generators to exceed
emissions limitations on a temporary basis and thereby restore power as
quickly as possible to those who had lost it due to the challenges
presented to the energy supply chain and generation capabilities in
Texas.  
   
Meanwhile, the U.S. Rural Utility Service at the Agriculture Department
has been working to help mitigate the impact of spikes in energy costs
in rural areas.  
   
I have spoken several times with Governor Abbott over the last few weeks
to discuss what additional assistance the federal government can
provide.  We mobilized a whole-of-government effort to respond, and of
course, the President has spoken directly with Governor Abbott and other
governors in affected states to hear their concerns and give us guidance
on how to address them.  
   
Although we’re encouraged by the progress that has been made and we’re
seeing the numbers come down dramatically right now in terms of who
needs to still boil water in Texas, we’ll continue to look for ways to
help through this next phase of recovery.  
   
When it comes to natural disasters like those we’ve experienced here,
the President has made it clear that there is no such thing as a red
state or a blue county; there are just Americans in urgent need.  And
that’s why he has made it a priority to travel to Texas today to
understand how the recovery is going and to express his gratitude to the
dedicated first responders who he’ll meet with.  
   
As we continue to learn more in the coming days and weeks, one thing we
know for sure is we cannot treat what happened in Texas and in the whole
region, in the South, as an isolated event.  The impacts reflect our
shared vulnerabilities to extreme weather events and other threats, and
the need for collective action to modernize and harden our critical
infrastructure across the country so that we can meet the full spectrum
of challenges that we will face in the future.  
   
Going forward, we’ll need very close collaboration among the federal
government, states, communities, and importantly, the private sector to
incentivize the kinds of actions that need to be taken to build the kind
of resilient infrastructure that we can truly depend on in the future.  
   
I just want to add my deep thanks to everyone who stepped forward to
help and those who’ve made truly valiant efforts to deliver essential
aid to those in need under incredibly difficult circumstances.  Energy
and water plant staffs, linemen and women, road workers, and many others
have responded under extraordinarily challenging conditions to restore
energy and water systems.  Healthcare workers, already laboring under
COVID constraints, have continued to work tirelessly.  National
Guardsmen participated in distribution of water and other essential
supplies.  Drivers have braved hazardous roads to move FEMA supplies to
where they’re most needed.  And we know of lots and lots of citizen
volunteers who’ve just selflessly extended themselves to help others in
need.  
   
So, in closing, President Biden continues to pledge the full support of
the federal government to these efforts.  And we’re here, landing
shortly in Texas, to demonstrate our commitment to serving all Americans
in these challenging times.  
   
Thanks very much, and I’d be happy to take a few questions.  
   
Q    What incentives are you talking about to help Texas harden its
grid?  And how is that okay to allow Texas to be independent from the
national grids?  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  Well, as you know, we have a federal system in
which states set their own policies with respect to a number of things. 
And in the case of Texas, decades ago, Texas chose to function as
essentially an autonomous grid.  So it’s not really linked into the
system in the rest of the country, with the exception of El Paso, which
has some connectivity outside of the state.  
   
And importantly, Texas has chosen not to make the kinds of decisions
that would provide for the supplies that you would keep for an emergency
— that is to invest in the kind of resilience that other states, which
are regulated, are required to invest in.  And so that means that they
don’t have the kind of backup in terms of supply or generation
capability that they needed to have in this crisis.   
   
The question now going forward is whether the state of Texas decides
that it wants to move in the direction of creating more resilience on
its own systems, because it has the capacity to do that if it chooses
to.  
   
Q    Does the President support the idea of federal taxpayers
subsidizing that retrofit in Texas?  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  This would not be a decision that would be a
federal decision.  There are ways in which we can support Texas in
moving in that direction.  But fundamentally, the first decision has to
be made by the state of Texas about what kind of energy system it wants
to maintain, what kind of energy market it wants to maintain, and
whether the financial incentives are structured for the kind of
investment that needs to be made in resilience.  
   
Q    Is the President going to sign — is FEMA going to sign off on
Governor Abbott’s request for more disaster — major disaster
declarations?  He asked for at least 54 more counties for now, and he
wants the whole state.  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  So, my understanding is that we’ve already added
enough — not “we” — that FEMA has already added a number of additional
counties where individuals can apply for disaster assistance, going from
77 up to 126 today.   
   
So as states — or as the individual counties are assessed for need on
the ground, if that need is evident, then they’re added.  And that’s a
decision the FEMA Acting Administrator, who’s here on the plane with us
and visiting the state with us today, will be making.  I know that just
last night he added 17 counties, for example.

Q    In your view, what does Texas need most now from the federal
government, in your conversations with Governor Abbott?  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  The emergency assistance that we’re providing —
just the kind I described — helping individuals who don’t have
insurance, for example, to recover from these storms’ impacts — if they
have burst water tanks or other damage that has been done — that they
need access to that federal assistance to recover.  I’d say that’s the
most immediate need.  
   
The longer-term project, as we’ve discussed, is the need to ensure that,
in the future, Texas is able to contend with the kinds of extreme
weather events and other threats to the grid that it may face, and how
we can collaborate with Texas in providing technical advice and
encourage the kind of evolution of their system that will enable them to
be more capable.  
   
Q    In terms of the timing of the President’s trip, did you delay it
for, you know, to — not — obviously not immediately delayed.  But did
you push it to avoid the acute part of the disaster?  Or was there
thought to that?  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  From the very outset, when we discussed taking a
trip, the guidance he gave was we should only go when we won’t interfere
with the emergency response capabilities that are necessary to deliver
for the people of Texas.  
   
So we’re coming today at a point at which the judgment was made that it
was a time that we could come without disrupting what needed to
happen.  
   
Q    Did President Biden, in his conversation with Governor Abbott,
communicate a desire to sort of incentivize or to push Texas to consider
joining the two grids?  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  That wasn’t an element of the discussion, no. 
The discussion was really focused on immediate needs and on the
imperative of ensuring that we flowed all federal assistance that we
could from the full range of agencies into Texas and into the other
states in the region, of course, as quickly as possible.  
   
Q    Do you think that issue will be discussed today?  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  I think today is mostly going to be focused on
hearing from the emergency responders in the FEMA Operations Center
about what worked and take lessons away for future response.   
   
One of the things that I have been charged with in my role is thinking
about how, in a new administration, with eventually a new confirmed FEMA
Administrator, we may want to improve on the performance of our delivery
of services.  Because there’s always room for improvement, in my
experience, even with the best of efforts that we have been able to
implement thus far.  
   
Q    And is there anything the federal government can do to help Texans
who have sky-high electricity bills right now?  I mean, obviously, the
grid is separate, but is there anything that the federal government can
do to help those people?  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  We’ve looked into this.  It’s very important to
note that these bills have now — the prices have come way down.  They
spiked very high, and they came way down.  There isn’t a federal
authority to regulate that in Texas, but we are looking at, for people
who’ve needed it most — and it’s especially in rural areas — we have
some capacity to help on that score as a federal government.  
   
But, really, this is an area in which, again, Texas — Texas, considering
what kind of market it wants to maintain — that incentivizes the kind of
investments in resilience, both in supply chains and also in generation
capabilities — will be important to managing pricing over time in the
state when it faces emergencies.  
   
Q    Can you just weigh in real fast: Was wind — how much of a problem
was wind power in the crisis?  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  So as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas
has said, that was not a bulk of the problem in Texas.  The biggest
problem in Texas was that you had freezing in of natural gas wells and
freezing — and shutdowns of the natural gas plants under extreme weather
conditions.  So they couldn’t get the natural gas to the generation
plants, and they couldn’t generate electricity at those plants.  
   
In addition, they had a brief period of the nuclear power plant, which
also provides baseline power, it went offline briefly.  It was brought
right up — back up as quickly as possible.  That was not a significant
loss of generation capability.   
   
This does point up the importance of creating a context within which we
can ensure that we manage supply and generation under extreme
circumstances.  We need baseline generation power, and we need to be
able to incorporate our renewables in a way that allows us to store them
— because it’s not always windy or sunny.  And that’s one of the things
that technologically we’ll be working to do in the work we do on the
clean energy transition in this administration.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right, thank you.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  Thank you.  It was great to see you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you so much.  
   
Okay, just a couple more details.  
   
So, obviously, Dr. Sherwood-Randall talked about our first stop.  The
President will also tour the Harris County Emergency — well, yeah, she
talked about that — Emergency Operations Center.  He will thank
volunteers at the Houston Food Bank.  This is one of the largest food
banks in the country, serving approximately 1.1 million people — very
large; it serves the community.  
   
He will also deliver remarks at the NRG Stadium, which is also being
utilized as a mass vaccination center.  Up to 6,000 vaccinations are
distributed from that center on a daily basis, just for your
knowledge.  
   
I think we shared with all of you a number of people the President will
see today while he’s in Texas: Governor Greg Abbott, of course, who will
spend most of the day with him; Senator John Cornyn, who’s meeting us on
the ground; Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo; Houston Mayor Sylvester
Turner; Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia, who’s tentative — we’ll see — we’ll
confirm once we get to the ground; Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee;
Congressman Al Green; and Congresswoman Lizzie Pannill Fletcher.  
   
With that, we will venture to get you a week ahead, I promise you.  But
we didn’t have too many details.  It’s a little bit changing, so we’ll
try to do that by the end of the day.  
   
So what should we chat about?  
   
Q    On the conversation the President had with King Salman, can you say
if the issue of Jamal Khashoggi — whether the report from the DNI that’s
forthcoming or even just the issue of his killing — was a part of the
conversation yesterday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have more to read out from the call.  I can tell you
broadly that the President raises, as do every — as does every official
at every level, concerns we have about human rights abuses and steps
that we expect the government and officials in the country to take
moving forward, and certainly that was a part of the conversation.   
   
I can convey to you that we expect the report, separately, to be
released later today by DNI, and that’s where it would certainly come
from.  
   
Q    Jen, did the White House know about Senator Sanders’s and Senator
Wyden’s plan for the corporate changes for — on a tax?  Did they know
about — did you all know about that ahead of time?  Did President Biden
know about that ahead of time?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We have not yet even reviewed, as of the time when we took
off, their proposal.  Certainly we are well aware of Senator Sanders’s
commitment and steadfast commitment to raising the minimum wage.  The
President shares that commitment, but we have not reviewed that
proposal.  
   
Where we are now is we are looking for the best pathways to increase the
minimum wage moving forward.  As you know, the House Bill will — which
we hope and expect will pass later today — will include an increase in
the minimum wage.   
   
We obviously also know that the parliamentarian ruled in the Senate, so
there is a pa- — there is going to be work ahead.  The President himself
will be engaged in that, as will our team, but we have not yet reviewed
that proposal.   
   
Q    So they didn’t give you all a heads up?  And do you support the
measure?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, we haven’t reviewed the measure.  We are
certainly aware, and we have been in close touch with Senator Sanders. 
The President has himself been in touch with him over the course of the
last several weeks.  But we don’t have — we have not reviewed and we
don’t have a final conclusion on that proposal.  
   
I will tell you that we are committed to finding the best path forward
to increasing the minimum wage, and that will require a number of
conversations with leaders in Congress and members who are committed to
this issue moving forward.  
   
Q    What message did the U.S. want to send to Iran with the bombing in
Syria?  And then, how does that influence or change the negotiations to
get Iran on the nuclear deal?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say, in terms of what message we are
sending: We are sending — the President is sending an unambiguous
message that he’s going to act to protect Americans.  And when threats
are posed, he has the right to take an action at the time and in the
manner of his choosing.   
   
He also is going to take those actions in a manner that’s deliberative
and that has the objective of de-escalating activity in both Syria and
Iraq.  
   
In terms of our engagement — or you’re talking about Iran?  
   
Q    On the nuclear deal.  Yeah.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  On the nuclear deal?  So the status of that at this point in
time remains that the United States is open to having a diplomatic
conversation, to sitting at the table and having that discussion with
our P5+1 partners, as well as the Iranians.  We are not going to take
steps to ease sanctions.  We have not put that on the table.  So right
now the Europeans have issued an invitation, and we’re waiting to hear
back, the last I’ve heard, from the Iranians.  
   
Q    Do you have any update on the casualties?  I hadn’t seen anything —
numbers — before we left.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an update.  I would certainly refer you to DOD
on that.  I know they’ll be briefing later today.  
   
Q    Jen, what is the legal authority for these strikes, as you yourself
said in 2017, when the last administration was here, that “Assad is a
brutal dictator,” as you said at that time, “but Syria is a sovereign
country”?  So what’s the legal authority for this action?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first address the legal authority for this
specific action.   
   
As a matter of domestic law, the President took this action pursuant to
his Article 2 authority to defend U.S. personnel.  The targets were
chosen to correspond to the recent attacks on facilities and to deter
the risk of additional attacks over the coming weeks.  As a matter of
international law, the United States acted pursuant to its right of
self-defense, as reflected in Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.  The
strikes were both necessary to address the threat and proportionate to
the prior attacks.   
   
And I can assure you — and I spoke with the national security team —
that there was a thorough, legal process and review in advance.   
   
As it pertains to the attack in 2017, 2017 was an attack on Syrian
military installations in response to a chemical weapons attack.  Last
night was a strike on militant groups in defense of U.S. personnel under
attack in Iraq.  There’s a massive difference in both policy and law.   
   
Q    What is President Biden’s red line?  For the last administration,
Donald Trump communicated, “Basically, if an American was killed, there
would be action.”  Here, there’s no evidence an American was killed.  It
appears to be a non-American civilian contractor.  What is the Biden
administration’s red line?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ve been doing this long enough not to set new red lines on
behalf of a President of the United States and the Commander-in-Chief. 
But what I can reiterate for you is that this action was taken — it was
a proportionate military response.  It was conducted together with
diplomatic measures that were also underway.  It included consultation
with coalition partners.  And again, it sends an unambiguous message
about the President’s commitment to protect American and coalition
personnel.  
   
Q    Did the President communicate to King Salman that this strike was
coming in advance?  And which countries and which leaders were told in
advance of this happening?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to check with our national security team if
there’s more we can read out about which coalition partners were briefed
in advance.  But that was certainly part of our engagement in advance of
the strikes.  
   
Q    On Russia, the White House released a pretty forceful statement
today on the annexation of Crimea.  When will we know more about whether
we’re going to see additional sanctions on Russia?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Weeks, not months.  It’s an ongoing process, and as you
know, that process includes, of course, a review of not just their
engagement in the 2020 Election, but also the bounties that were
reportedly on troops, and also the SolarWinds attack.  There’s a number
of components.   
   
We want to give the team — the cyber team, the national security team,
the time to complete that process.  And, of course, as in any case, the
President resolve — has the option, I should say, of responding in a
manner and time of his choosing, seen and unseen.  But I would expect
weeks, not months, before we conclude that review.  
   
Q    And on Neera Tanden, do you know if she has spoken with Lisa
Murkowski or Kyrsten Sinema yet?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any updates on her specific engagements, and we
have not read out those specific engagements from our end.  We certainly
would leave it to members of the Senate to read out, if they would like
to, their private engagements with our nominees.  
   
Q    And on Khashoggi one more time: Are you saying that you are unaware
of whether — that he brought up that with King Salman, or that you’re
just not willing to give additional information at this time?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m saying I have no more from the call to read out for
you.  
   
Q    And should we expect to hear from Biden today on the — once the
House bill passes?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  We are — I’m just going to knock on wood here. 
(Knocks on a side panel.)  Hope that’s okay.  That’s not wood.  That’s
fine.  
   
I would expect, obviously, we are going to remain very involved behind
the scenes with Democrats, with Republicans, with many members and
officials at every level as we work toward House passage.  We take
nothing for granted.  If the bill passes, I certainly would expect you
to hear from the President.  
   
Q    Jen, what are you doing about this influx of migrants coming to the
border right now?  I know you’ve addressed this, sort of, broadly right
now, but is there any concern that the President and this
administration’s sort of messaging may unintentionally be inviting more
migrants to come to the country right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me be abundantly clear — and at every opportunity,
this is what we convey from the President to the Secretary of State, to
our officials in the region: This is not the time to come.  It’s a
dangerous trip.  We have limited processing at the border, but it is
very, very limited.  The vast majority of people who come to the border
will be turned away, back — to take the treacherous journey back.  This
is not the time to come.  We need time to put in place a humane
immigration system, working with members of Congress to do that.  
   
Q    Jen, this week, Justin Trudeau said that President Biden and the
administration have committed to taking an active role in getting his
citizens Spavor and Kovrig back.  Is the U.S. thinking about — or is the
administration thinking about withdrawing the request for Meng Wanzhou’s
extradition in order to help Justin Trudeau out?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I certainly know this is a priority to the Prime Minister. 
We all know that.  And it’s something he spoke about after the meeting. 
But I would refer you to the Department of Justice.  That’s a legal —
would be a legal decision and action.  
   
Q    And one more foreign policy question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Again, with MBS in Saudi Arabia, he’s alleged to have involvement
in Khashoggi’s murder.  I mean, are sanctions possible?  Cuts of arms
sales?  Could he be sanctioned personally?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that we’ve been clear at every level
that our intention is to recalibrate the relationship, and this would be
a different relationship with the Saudi government.   
   
At the same time, of course, we want to end the war in Yemen.  We want
to ensure the humanitarian crisis is addressed.  And the President and
every member of our team is not going to hold back in voicing concern
and taking action as needed about humanitari- — or about human rights
abuses.   
   
I will say again that we expect the report.  We are going to abide by
our legal obligation to have that report released through our
intelligence community.  Once that report is released, I would expect,
you know, any actions would be announced after that report.  So stay
tuned.  
   
Q    On the minimum wage, has the Senate parliamentarian’s decision
caused the President to rethink his views on the filibuster at all? 
There is certainly push coming from the left to just do away with it to
get some of these policies — Voting Rights Act, minimum wage.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Certainly we’ve seen that, and we’re well aware of the
push.  The President continues to believe that a package that will bring
necessary relief to the American people; that will get shots in the arms
of Americans; that will reopen schools; that will get direct checks to
people that is supported by 70 percent or more of the American public,
including the majority of Republicans, should garner Republican
support.  And we are still working toward that.  
   
Q    On Carrizo Springs, you have said that isn’t a detention facility. 
But can they leave of their — can they leave?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The facility in Texas?  
   
Q    Yeah.  Can the people being held there leave?  Or — or what is —
how would you describe it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would describe it as a shelter.  I would describe it as a
place where we keep kids, who are under the age of 18 and taking a
treacherous journey into this country, safe.  I would describe it as a
place where we ensure that kids who are here without their parents are
not — where they can live and be safe, and we can work to process and
find them a home, whether it’s with a family member or with a vetted,
approved family — I’m sorry about that — vetted, approved house to stay
in, where they can get access to education, mental health services,
health services.   
   
There are no good choices here.  The only other options are to send kids
back, which is what the prior administration did — we don’t think that’s
humane — or to send them to homes that have not been vetted.  There have
been a range of problems with that, including kids being sent into
trafficking.   
   
So this is the best choice we found.  We had to open the facility
because of the impact of COVID and the fact that other facilities are —
you know, we can’t use all of the beds that are available in order to
abide by COVID protocols.  
   
Q    The acting Capitol Police chief said there’s known threats to the
State of the Union address.  Is the White House aware of those threats? 
And is that factoring into any of the timing right now of when the
President plans to deliver?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would send you to the Secret Service for any comments on
those specific threats.  I can tell you, broadly speaking, that we are —
the President and the entire team has decided that he’s not going to
speak to his forward-looking agenda, much of what he talked about on the
campaign — his Build Back Better agenda — until after the American
Rescue Plan passes because that’s where our focus and our — our focus is
at this point in time.  
   
Q    Back on the airstrike: Can you peel back the curtain a little bit
and talk a little bit about the decision-making process, like over what
period of time was the President considering doing the strike?  Was it
something he decided on quickly, or did he need days to think about it? 
Any of that, sort of, behind-the-scenes?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, again, I know the Department of Defense is
briefing today, as is the State Department, and hopefully they will be
able to provide you additional color.  I will say that it was important
to the President to ensure there was a proper intel assessment and to
take the time to do that and ensure there was work done to identify the
right targets.  And that’s why it has been a couple of days since the
initial attacks.   
   
But in terms of additional color, I would send you to the Department of
Defense or the State Department.  
   
Q    And does he think that Assad should go — must go?  Does the
President think Assad must go?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I think that the President has long said — or
long before he was President — that, you know, he believes that there
needs to be a diplomatic solution, a political path forward.  You know,
I don’t think — I think, clearly, the circumstances in Syria remain as
dire, or more, today than they were just a couple of years ago.  
   
Q    Did the White House invite Ted Cruz to join the other congressional
members — the congressional delegation today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There was neither an invitation nor a request for him to
attend.  There are a number of members of both parties attending and
joining the President on the trip today.  
   
Q    I have a question from my colleagues at the Voice of America.  They
ask: More than 30 Democrats have sent President Biden a letter asking
him to give up sole nuclear launch authority.  Does the President have
any view on whether he should be the only person with the nuclear
codes?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would certainly have to look at the letter and talk to our
national security team.  And I have not seen the letter.  I can talk to
them and see if we can get you a response.  
   
Q    To the Voice of America.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Voice of America.  We have to do that.  
   
Q    Back to the strike yesterday — I mean, it does raise questions,
again, about returning the Article 1 power back to Congress.  Tim Kaine
is out with a statement this morning about it as well.  Secretary
Blinken, during his confirmation hearing, said that the administration
wanted to take a look at that.  Do you agree with Democrats?  Does
President Biden agree with Democrats that those should be reformed or
repealed, even — those authorizations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I think I outlined very clearly what the legal
authority was.  And certainly the President is always happy to have a
conversation with members of both parties about how we can work together
on a range of issues, including our national security approach, moving
forward.  
   
Q    For clarity — maybe I missed this: Have you said which members of
Congress were notified in advance of this strike?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I did not give a detail on that.  I’m happy to check and see
if there’s more — any specifics on that we can also offer.  
   
Q    Does the White House have any — given the Khashoggi part of the
conversation with King Salman yesterday, whether or not Khashoggi was a
topic or not — given what we know about his responsibility, MBS’s
responsibility here, does the White House have any reservations about
MBS’s position in the line of succession that he would be the future
leader of Saudi Arabia?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, this is for the government of Saudi Arabia to
determine the path forward on and their future leadership.   
   
I will say that the President has been clear, and we’ve been clear by
our actions, that we’re going to recalibrate the relationship, including
ensuring that engagement happens counterpart to counterpart, and hence
the President spoke with the King.  And that that’s the appropriate
counterpart — head of government, head of state.  And that’s what we
would anticipate moving forward.  
   
Q    Lastly, yesterday, you celebrated 50 million shots since President
Biden took — began his term.  That was only 36 days.  It gives you a lot
of time left to 100 days.  What is the goal?  What do you think we can
achieve in 100 days, in terms of vaccinations right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, clearly, we’re ahead of schedule and working to
expedite vaccines to the American people across the country.  And even
visiting the vaccination center that the President will be visiting
today is an example of the kind of facilities that we are investing in,
that we’re working with, directly through the federal government, to
expedite that.   
I’m not going to set a new goal for you here today, but I can confirm
for you and certainly reiterate for you that the President wants to meet
that goal and surpass it.  And, you know, maybe we’ll have more to say
soon.

Q    Can I ask — this kind of trip is a very traditional
consoler-in-chief kind of mission for a President to do.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    How does President Biden prepare for this?  How does he feel about
doing this sort of thing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, I traveled with him last Friday to Michigan.  I’m
just forgetting where we went.  And, you know, he was — he had a
conversation with the Acting FEMA Administrator on the call, and he was
already asking when he would go, when it would be appropriate for him to
go, because he likes to see the details and likes to see things in
person.  And he wants to see  
how the public is engaging and have those conversations.  And that’s
important to him as — in terms of his governing style.  It’s important
to him to hear directly from people on what their needs are.   
   
And I expect that what he will do during this trip today is ask every
single person he sees, “What do you need?  How can I help you more?  And
what can we get more for you — from you — for you, from the federal
government?”  And it’s important to him that he does that on the ground,
in person — he has that direct engagement.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks, everyone.
