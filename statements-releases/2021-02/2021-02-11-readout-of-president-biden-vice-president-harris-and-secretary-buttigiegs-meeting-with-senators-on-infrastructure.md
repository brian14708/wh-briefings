title: "Readout of President\_Biden, Vice President Harris, and Secretary Buttigieg\u2019\
  s Meeting with Senators on\_Infrastructure"
---
 
Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris met in the Oval Office
with a bipartisan group of Senators from the Environment and Public
Works (EPW) Committee, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg
joined virtually, to discuss the critical need for investing in modern
and sustainable American infrastructure. The meeting is one of several
the Administration plans to conduct on infrastructure with Members of
Congress and stakeholders.

The President, Vice President, Secretary, and Senators established the
mutual understanding that America needs to build new infrastructure
across urban and rural areas and create millions of good-paying jobs in
the process to support the country’s economic recovery in the months and
years ahead. They had a productive conversation and exchanged
constructive ideas to further inform President Biden’s economic recovery
plans to build back our country better for working families. They also
expressed a deep commitment to working across the aisle to deliver
infrastructure and jobs to American communities.

The President, Vice President, and Secretary also shared the
Administration’s vision for building sustainable infrastructure that
will withstand the impacts of climate change and fuel an American clean
energy revolution. They also reiterated their commitment to making sure
no workers are left behind, underscoring how the Administration will
bring construction, manufacturing, engineering, and skilled-trades jobs
— with the choice to join a union — directly to the communities that are
too often left behind.
