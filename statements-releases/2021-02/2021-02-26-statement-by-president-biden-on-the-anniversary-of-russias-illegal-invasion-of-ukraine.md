title: "Statement by President Biden on the Anniversary of Russia\u2019s Illegal Invasion\
  \ of Ukraine"
---
 
Seven years ago today, Russia violated international law, the norms by
which modern countries engage one another, and the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of its neighbor Ukraine when it invaded
Crimea.     
  
The United States continues to stand with Ukraine and its allies and
partners today, as it has from the beginning of this conflict.  On this
somber anniversary, we reaffirm a simple truth:  Crimea is Ukraine.   
  
The United States does not and will never recognize Russia’s purported
annexation of the peninsula, and we will stand with Ukraine against
Russia’s aggressive acts.  We will continue to work to hold Russia
accountable for its abuses and aggression in Ukraine. We will also
continue to honor the courage and hope of the Revolution of Dignity, in
which the Ukrainian people faced down sniper fire and enforcers in riot
gear on the Maidan and demanded a new beginning for their country.  The
United States still believes in the promise of Ukraine and we support
all those working towards a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous future
for their country.
