  Groups"

Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Public
Engagement Director and Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond hosted a virtual
discussion with leaders of gun violence prevention advocacy groups –
Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action, Giffords, and Brady. They
discussed the ongoing public health crisis of gun violence in America,
the historic increase in homicides across American cities last year, and
commonsense steps that can be taken to make our communities safer such
as closing background check loopholes, stopping the proliferation of
unregulated and untraceable “ghost” guns, and expanding community-based
violence intervention programs.

Ambassador Rice and Congressman Richmond expressed gratitude for the
leaders’ ideas, persistent advocacy efforts over the years, and
commitment to working together to tackle the gun violence epidemic.
Ambassador Rice and Congressman Richmond also underscored President
Biden’s longstanding record of fighting for families impacted by gun
violence, his full support for taking commonsense actions to reduce gun
violence, and his unwavering commitment to pushing ahead further steps
to make our communities safer.
