President Biden is disappointed in this outcome, as he proposed having
the $15 minimum wage as part of the American Rescue Plan. He respects
the parliamentarian’s decision and the Senate’s process. He will work
with leaders in Congress to determine the best path forward because no
one in this country should work full time and live in poverty. He urges
Congress to move quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan, which
includes $1400 rescue checks for most Americans, funding to get this
virus under control, aid to get our schools reopened and desperately
needed help for the people who have been hardest hit by this crisis.
