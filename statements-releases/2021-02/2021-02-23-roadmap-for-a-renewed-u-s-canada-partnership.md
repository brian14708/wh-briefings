**Combating COVID-19**

The top priority of the President and the Prime Minister is to end the
COVID-19 pandemic. They agreed to strengthen comprehensive and
cross-sectoral efforts to control the pandemic, collaborate on public
health responses, and build resilience against future outbreaks. 

-   The Prime Minister and the President committed to working closely
    together to defeat the virus, including by surging the health and
    humanitarian response to the global pandemic, responding to new
    variants, following expert advice, and supporting global affordable
    access to and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, including through the
    COVAX Facility.
-   The leaders emphasized their strong support for the multilateral
    institutions that are on the front lines of COVID-19 response,
    including the World Health Organization (WHO) and UN development
    agencies, and committed to rapidly fulfilling national pledges to
    COVAX.   
-   They agreed on the importance of a transparent and independent
    evaluation and analysis, free from interference, of the origins of
    the COVID-19 outbreak, and to work together toward the development
    and use of swift, effective, transparent, and independent means for
    investigating such outbreaks in the future.
-   They also recognized the importance of urgent global action to
    advance health security, counter biological threats, and prevent the
    next pandemic, and agreed to leverage existing pandemic preparedness
    arrangements and platforms, such as the North American Plan for
    Animal and Pandemic Influenza, the Global Health Security Agenda and
    the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials
    of Mass Destruction.
-   They further agreed on the need to improve international
    institutions for global capacity for pandemic preparedness and
    response, including by working to strengthen and reform the WHO, and
    the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and exploring the
    establishment of a permanent facilitator for high consequence
    biological threats within the office of the UN Secretary-General and
    a sustainable health security financing mechanism.

and inclusive economic recovery that strengthens the middle class,
creates more opportunities for hard working people to join it, and
ensures people have good jobs and careers on both sides of the border.
They also recognized the opportunity for clean growth driven by workers,
communities, businesses, and innovation. 

-   The leaders agreed on the need to build back better together in a
    way that addresses the disproportionate impacts on women, youth,
    underrepresented groups, and Indigenous peoples.
-   As COVID-19 has rolled back many of the hard-won gains women have
    achieved over past decades, the President and Prime Minister

    participation in the workforce, including with respect to early
    learning and childcare.
-   The President and the Prime Minister also considered the impact of
    the pandemic on small businesses. The United States and Canada
    announced joint initiatives to accelerate economic recovery of small
    and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with a focus on supporting

    Action Plan to target a net-zero industrial transformation,
    batteries for zero-emissions vehicles, and renewable energy storage.
     
-   The leaders recognized the important economic and energy security
    benefits of the bilateral energy relationship and its highly
    integrated infrastructure. To further advance climate priorities,
    they agreed to renew and update the existing Memorandum of
    Understanding (MOU) on the reliability and security of the North
    American energy infrastructure between the U.S. Department of Energy
    and the Department of Natural Resources Canada to enhance
    cooperation on sustainable and equitable energy transitions, clean
    energy innovation, connectivity and low-carbon transportation.

The Prime Minister and the President discussed their shared commitment
to addressing systemic racism, unconscious bias, gender-based
discrimination, barriers for persons with disabilities, and all other
forms of discrimination and exclusion.  

-   The two leaders expressed their shared determination to implement
    more effective, equitable, and inclusive approaches to community
    safety, criminal justice, and law enforcement. They will direct
    their agencies to focus on modernizing approaches to community
    safety and addressing issues of systemic racism and discrimination,
    including through meaningful engagement with civil society and
    community leaders.  This work will also consider innovative
    approaches to implementing institutional and community-based
    prevention, intervention, and diversion initiatives, including
    prioritizing the provision of adequate support and services to
    individuals facing mental health challenges or addiction.
-   The leaders agreed that promoting gender equality and empowering
    women and girls is the most effective approach to eradicating
    poverty and building a more peaceful, more inclusive, and more
    prosperous world. They also committed to ensuring that women are not
    left behind due to COVID-19, including by addressing the she-cession
    caused by the pandemic through investments and policies to support
    women’s full participation in the workforce. They agreed to exchange
    best practices in feminist public policy and the advancement of
    gender equity. They will do so by engaging policy actors from Canada
    and the United States, within and outside of government, to consider
    child benefits, early learning and childcare, pay equity, and
    women’s entrepreneurship, among other issues.  
-   The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to combat systemic racism
    and discrimination, and agreed to work together to share best
