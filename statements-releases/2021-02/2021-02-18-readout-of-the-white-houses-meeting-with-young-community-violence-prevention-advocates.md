  Advocates"

Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Public
Engagement Director and Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond hosted a virtual
discussion with a wide cross-section of youth advocates for community
violence prevention. Participants shared their perspectives around the
intersectionality of gun violence, how to craft successful
community-based violence interventions, and the importance of
survivor-led and victim-centered policymaking in the community violence
prevention space.

Ambassador Rice and Senior Advisor Richmond expressed gratitude for the
participants’ central role in elevating the issue of gun violence as a
public health crisis and ensuring that youth, in particular Black and
Brown young people, are at the tables where the violence prevention
policies impacting their communities are created. They underscored
President Biden’s commitment to taking action to make our communities
safer and to ensure that equity drives our policymaking across the
federal government.
