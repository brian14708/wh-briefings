Seventy-nine years ago today, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order
9066, which stripped Japanese Americans of their civil rights and led to
the wrongful internment of some 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent.
In one of the most shameful periods in American history, Japanese
Americans were targeted and imprisoned simply because of their heritage.
Families were forced to abandon their homes, communities, and businesses
to live for years in inhumane concentration camps throughout the United
States. These actions by the Federal government were immoral and
unconstitutional — yet they were upheld by the Supreme Court in one of
the gravest miscarriages of justice in the Court’s history.

America failed to live up to our founding ideals of liberty and justice
for all, and today we reaffirm the Federal government’s formal apology
to Japanese Americans for the suffering inflicted by these policies. The
internment of Japanese Americans also serves as a stark reminder of the
tragic human consequences of systemic racism, xenophobia, and nativism.
I reflect on the bravery of so many Japanese Americans who stood up
against this hateful policy, including civil rights leaders like Fred
Korematsu who fought against Japanese internment and were a symbol of
hope. Their legacies remind us all that civil liberties must be
vigorously defended and protected.
