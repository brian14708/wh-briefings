title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Increases Lending to Small Businesses\
  \ in Need, Announces Changes to PPP to Further Promote Equitable Access to\_Relief"
---
 
Small businesses account for [44
percent](https://advocacy.sba.gov/2019/01/30/small-businesses-generate-44-percent-of-u-s-economic-activity/)
of U.S. GDP, create two-thirds of net new jobs, and employ nearly half
of America’s workers. Now, millions of main street small businesses –
especially Black- and Brown-owned small businesses – are struggling to
make ends meet in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting
economic crisis.

The Biden-Harris administration has made delivering equitable relief to
hard-hit small businesses a top priority. The latest round of Paycheck
Protection Program (PPP) funding opened just one month ago and it
represents a [marked
improvement](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-data)
on the prior round of the Program last year. Compared to the same point
in the Program last year:

-   The share of funding going to small businesses with fewer than ten
    employees is **up nearly 60 percent**
-   The share of funding going to small businesses in rural areas is
    **up nearly 30 percent**
-   The share of funding distributed through Community Development
    Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions is **up
    more than 40 percent**

The Biden-Harris administration is announcing several reforms to build
on this success by further targeting the PPP to the smallest businesses
and those that have been left behind in previous relief efforts. While
these efforts are no substitute for passage of the American Rescue Plan,
they will extend much-needed resources to help small businesses survive,
reopen, and rebuild. Specifically, the Biden-Harris administration will:

-   **Institute a 14-day period, starting Wednesday, during which only
    businesses with fewer than 20 employees can apply for relief through
    the Program.** 98 percent of small businesses have fewer than 20
    employees. They are Main Street businesses that anchor our
    neighborhoods and help families build wealth. And while the
    Biden-Harris administration has directed significantly more relief
    to these smallest businesses in this round of PPP than in the prior
    round, these businesses often struggle more than larger businesses
    to collect the necessary paperwork and secure relief from a lender.
    The 14-day exclusive application period will allow lenders to focus
    on serving these smallest businesses. The Biden-Harris
    administration will also make a sustained effort to work with
    lenders and small business owners to ensure small businesses take
    maximum advantage of this two-week window.
-   **Help sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed
    individuals receive more financial support.** These types of
    businesses, which include home repair contractors, beauticians, and
    small independent retailers, make up a significant majority of all
    businesses. Of these businesses, those without employees are [70
    percent](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Nonemployer-Fact-Sheet.pdf)
    owned by women and people of color. Yet many are structurally
    excluded from the PPP or were approved for as little as $1 because
    of how PPP loans are calculated. To address this problem, the
    Biden-Harris administration will revise the loan calculation formula
    for these applicants so that it offers more relief, and establish a
    $1 billion set aside for businesses in this category without
    employees located in low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas.
-   **Consistent with a bipartisan bill, eliminate an exclusionary
    restriction that prevents small business owners with prior non-fraud
    felony convictions from obtaining relief through the Paycheck
    Protection Program.**  Currently, a business is ineligible for PPP
    if it is at least 20 percent owned by an individual who has
    either: (1) an arrest or conviction for a felony related to
    financial assistance fraud within the previous five years; or (2)
    any other felony within the previous year. To expand access to PPP,
    the Biden-Harris administration will adopt bipartisan reforms
    included in the PPP Second Chance Act, co-sponsored by Senators Ben
    Cardin (D-MD), Rob Portman (R-OH), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and James
    Lankford (R-OK), which would eliminate the second restriction (the
    one-year look-back) unless the applicant or owner is incarcerated at
    the time of the application.
-   **Eliminate an exclusionary restriction that prevents small business
    owners who are delinquent on their federal student loans from
    obtaining relief through the Paycheck Protection Program.**
    Currently, the PPP is not available to any business with at least 20
    percent ownership by an individual who is currently delinquent or
    has defaulted within the last seven years on a federal debt,
    including a student loan. Millions of Americans are delinquent on
    student loans, including a disproportionate number of Black
    borrowers. Working with the Departments of the Treasury and
    Education, the SBA will remove the student loan delinquency
    restriction to broaden access to the PPP.
-   **Ensure access for non-citizen small business owners who are lawful
    U.S. residents by clarifying that they may use Individual Taxpayer
    Identification Numbers (ITINs) to apply for relief**. The PPP
    statute is clear that all lawful U.S. residents may access the
    program, but a lack of guidance from the SBA has created
    inconsistency in access for ITIN holders like Green Card holders or
    those here on a visa. The SBA will address this unfair inconsistency
    by issuing clear guidance in the coming days that otherwise eligible
    applicants cannot be denied access to the PPP because they use ITINs
    to pay their taxes.

In addition to these five changes, the Biden-Harris administration has
taken – and will continue to take – steps to ensure equitable
distribution of relief that values each and every taxpayer dollar. These
steps include:

-   **Addressing waste, fraud, and abuse across all federal programs.**
    Unlike the previous round of the PPP, loan guaranty approval is now
    contingent on passing SBA fraud checks, Treasury’s Do Not Pay
    database, and public records. The SBA now also conducts manual loan
    reviews for the largest loans in the PPP portfolio and a random
    sampling of other loans. The SBA has worked, and will continue to
    work, with its lender partners to create streamlined processes to
    resolve issues as quickly as possible, while still ensuring taxpayer
    dollars are spent wisely.

-   **Promoting transparency and accountability by improving the PPP
    loan application.** To encourage self-reporting of demographic data
    and better illustrate the impact the PPP is having across various
    population segments, the Biden-Harris administration has revamped
    the PPP application.
-   **Improving the Emergency Relief Digital Front Door**. The
    Biden-Harris administration is working to update key areas of SBA
    websites to help more applicants find resources for understanding
    relief options and completing applications.
-   **Continuing to conduct extensive stakeholder outreach to learn more
    about challenges and opportunities in the implementation of current
    emergency relief programs.** The President has spoken with several
    small businesses owners in recent weeks to understand their concerns
    about relief program. And as part of the Administration’s efforts to
    support America’s small businesses, especially those in LMI
    communities, the Vice President spoke last week with the CEOs of
    major banks, to highlight the critical period ahead, the vital role
    that lenders have to play during this time, and the Administration’s
    focus on PPP lending to underserved small businesses. In recent
    weeks, the Vice President has also met virtually with small business
    owners and Black Chambers of Commerce to discuss the challenges that
    small businesses face right now, and how passing the American Rescue
    Plan will provide critical relief during a difficult period. At all
    levels and across agencies, the administration will continue to
    engage with communities to inform the design and delivery of vital
    programs that meet their needs.

<!-- -->

-   **Enhancing the current lender engagement model.** As part of the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to further improve access
    to capital for small businesses, the SBA is launching a new
    initiative to deepen its relationships with lenders. This model will
    increase opportunity for lenders to provide recommendations and ask
    questions about the PPP and drive resolution of open questions and
    concerns in a more streamlined way.
