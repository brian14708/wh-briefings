Infectious diseases are transnational health and national security
threats. While the world is reeling from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,
Ebola has again emerged, simultaneously, in both Central and West
Africa.  The world cannot afford to turn the other way.  We must do
everything in our power to respond quickly, effectively, and with
commensurate resources to stop these outbreaks before they become
largescale epidemics. 

President Biden has been briefed on the situation in both Central and
West Africa, and his prayers are with the families of those who have
died and those who are impacted by Ebola, COVID-19, and other ongoing
global health challenges. The Biden Administration will do everything in
its power to provide U.S. leadership to stop these outbreaks, working
with the affected governments, the World Health Organization, the
African Union and the African Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention, and neighboring states. 

On February 16, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with the
Ambassadors of Guinea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, and
Liberia to the United States to convey the United States willingness to
work closely with the governments of affected countries, and neighboring
countries whose citizens would be at risk of the current outbreak
spread.  Mr. Sullivan emphasized President Biden’s commitment to provide
U.S. leadership to strengthen health security and create better systems
for preventing, detecting, and responding to health emergencies.

Outbreaks require swift and overwhelming response in order to avoid
catastrophic consequences.  Since the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West
Africa, the United States has endeavored to elevate and prioritize
health security assistance with partners through the Global Health
Security Agenda and with strong support from Congress. We cannot afford
to take our foot off the gas – even as we battle COVID, we must ensure
capacity and financing for health security worldwide.  President Biden’s
first National Security Memorandum directed that U.S. leadership in
health security and global health be elevated, prioritized, and
strengthened. The United States stands ready to do everything in its
power to ensure a robust global response and to stop these outbreaks.
