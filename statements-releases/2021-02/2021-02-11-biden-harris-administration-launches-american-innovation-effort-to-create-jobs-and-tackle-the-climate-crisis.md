*White House Forms Climate Innovation Working Group, Outlines Innovation
Agenda*

*U.S. Department of Energy Announces $100 Million Climate Innovation
Research Opportunity*

  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is initiating an ambitious
innovation effort to create American jobs while tackling the climate
crisis, which includes the launch of a new research working group, an
outline of the Administration’s innovation agenda, and a new $100
million funding opportunity from the U.S. Department of Energy to
support transformational low-carbon energy technologies. The
announcements kickstart the Administration’s undertaking to spur the
creation of new jobs, technology, and tools that empower the United
States to innovate and lead the world in addressing the climate
crisis.  
  
President Biden is fulfilling his promise to accelerate R&D investments,
creating a new Climate Innovation Working Group as part of the National
Climate Task Force to advance his commitment to launching an Advanced
Research Projects Agency-Climate (ARPA-C). The working group will help
coordinate and strengthen federal government-wide efforts to foster
affordable, game-changing technologies that can help America achieve the
President’s goal of net zero economy-wide emissions by 2050 and can
protect the American people from the impacts of droughts and flooding,
bigger wildfires, and stronger hurricanes. The working group will be
co-chaired by the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, Office
of Science of Technology and Policy, and Office of Management and
Budget.  
  
“We are tapping into the imagination, talent, and grit of America’s
innovators, scientists, and workers to spearhead a national effort that
empowers the United States to lead the world in tackling the climate
crisis,” **said Gina McCarthy, President Biden’s National Climate
Advisor**. “At the same time, we are positioning America to create
good-paying, union jobs in a just and equitable way in communities
across the nation that will be at the forefront of new manufacturing for
clean energy and new technology, tools, and infrastructure that will
help us adapt to a changing climate.”  
  
As the opportunity for American leadership in climate innovation is
vast, the Administration is outlining key planks of an agenda the
Climate Innovation Working Group will help advance:

-   zero net carbon buildings at zero net cost, including carbon-neutral
    construction materials;
-   energy storage at one-tenth the cost of today’s alternatives;
-   advanced energy system management tools to plan for and operate a
    grid powered by zero carbon power plants;
-   very low-cost zero carbon on-road vehicles and transit systems;
-   new, sustainable fuels for aircraft and ships, as well as
    improvements in broader aircraft and ship efficiency and
    transportation management;
-   affordable refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pumps made
    without refrigerants that warm the planet;
-   carbon-free heat and industrial processes that capture emissions for
    making steel, concrete, chemicals, and other important industrial
    products;
-   carbon-free hydrogen at a lower cost than hydrogen made from
    polluting alternatives;
-   innovative soil management, plant biologies, and agricultural
    techniques to remove carbon dioxide from the air and store it in the
    ground;
-   direct air capture systems and retrofits to existing industrial and
    power plant exhausts to capture carbon dioxide and use it to make
    alternative products or permanently sequester it deep underground.

As a first example of the widespread innovation effort, the U.S.
Department of Energy is announcing $100 million in funding via the
Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support
transformational low-carbon energy technologies. The ARPA-E announcement
invites experts across the country to submit proposals for funding to
support early-stage research into potentially disruptive energy
technologies, specifically encouraging inter-disciplinary approaches and
collaboration across sectors.   
  
“Today we are inviting scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs and creative
thinkers across America to join us in developing the clean energy
technologies we need to tackle the climate crisis and build a new more
equitable clean energy economy,” **said DOE Chief of Staff Tarak
Shah.** “The Department of Energy is committed to empowering innovators
to think boldly and create the cutting-edge technologies that will usher
in our clean energy future and create millions of good-paying jobs.”  
  
In addition to supporting technologies that are near commercialization,
the Climate Innovation Working Group will also emphasize research to
bolster and build critical clean energy supply chains in the United
States and strengthen American manufacturing. As it coordinates climate
innovation across the federal government, it will focus on programs at
land-grant universities, Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
and other minority-serving institutions.  
  
“Today is an important day for tackling the climate crisis through
cutting-edge science, technology, and innovation. The Office of Science
and Technology Policy is ready to help turbocharge climate-related
innovation, and we look forward to engaging with scientists, engineers,
students, and innovators all across America to build a future in which
not only jobs and economic benefits but also opportunities to
participate in climate innovation are shared equitably by all
Americans,” **said Kei Koizumi, Acting Director of the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy**.
