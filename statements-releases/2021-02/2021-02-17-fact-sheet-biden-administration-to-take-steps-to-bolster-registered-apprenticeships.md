*Registered apprenticeship programs train Americans and put them to work
in good-paying jobs*

Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris will meet with a group
of labor leaders to discuss the American Rescue Plan and to get input on
the President’s infrastructure plan.  They will discuss how to put
millions of Americans to work in good-paying union jobs building roads,
bridges, transit, electric vehicle charging stations, broadband, schools
and child care centers, water infrastructure, and more. Major
infrastructure investments will provide reliable, steady demand for
products made by U.S. workers and supply chains of U.S. small
businesses. These investments will provide opportunities to Americans
who have been too often left behind. And, they will make America more
competitive.

President Biden has called for the jobs created by rebuilding America’s
infrastructure to be filled by diverse, local, well-trained workers who
have a choice to join a union. This starts by expanding registered
apprenticeship programs and investing in pipelines into these programs.

Due in large part to the hard work of North America’s Building Trades
Unions and other unions, registered apprenticeships have been a reliable
pathway to the middle class for decades – including for workers who
don’t go to college – by training workers for good jobs and allowing
them to earn while they learn. A [Mathematica
study](https://www.mathematica.org/our-publications-and-findings/publications/an-effectiveness-assessment-and-costbenefit-analysis-of-registered-apprenticeship-in-10-states)
shows workers can earn $240,000 more over the course of their lifetime –
$300,000 when including benefits – by participating in these programs.
Registered apprenticeships are especially important as we recover from
the pandemic, allowing workers who have lost their jobs or young people
who are entering a weak job market to train for the jobs of the future
while earning a decent income.

Today, President Biden is:

-   ***Reaffirming his commitment to expanding registered
    apprenticeships to reward work, rebuild the middle-class, and
    connect a diverse workforce to family-supporting, living wage
    jobs.*** President Biden endorses Congressman Bobby Scott’s
    bipartisan National Apprenticeship Act of 2021, which will create
    and expand registered apprenticeships, youth apprenticeships and
    pre-apprenticeship programs. The House Education and Labor Committee
    estimates that the bill will create [nearly 1
    million](https://edlabor.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2021-01-25%20National%20Apprenticeship%20Reauthorization%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf)
    new apprenticeship opportunities and generate billions of dollars in
    benefits for taxpayers. Importantly, this bill will ensure these
    programs draw in a diverse workforce, by supporting industry and
    equity intermediaries who can help recruit women and people of
    color. And, it’ll bolster successful partnerships between
    apprenticeship programs and community colleges. This type of
    legislation is an urgently needed start, but even more investment is
    required to train Americans for good-paying jobs across industries
    ranging from construction to energy to manufacturing to technology
    to caregiving.

-   ***Reinstating the National Advisory Committee on
    Apprenticeships***. President Biden believes that the voice of
    workers must be central to the development of strategies to rebuild
    the economy of the future. To that end, President Biden is asking
    the Department of Labor (DOL) to reinstate the longstanding National
    Advisory Committee on Apprenticeships. This Advisory Committee will
    appoint a diverse set of stakeholders from across the country –
    including unions, employers, apprentices, community colleges and
    other institutions – to build a registered apprenticeship program
    that works in all communities. As we rebuild our economy from this
    crisis, the Advisory Committee will have the opportunity to focus on
    expanding apprenticeships into new employment industries and sectors
    like clean energy, technology, and healthcare to create more
    high-quality training and employment opportunities. The Advisory
    Committee must also focus on making sure that Black and brown
    Americans, immigrants, and women can access the training and jobs of
    the future.

<!-- -->

-   ***Reversing industry recognized apprenticeship programs (IRAPs),
    which threaten to undermine registered apprenticeship programs***.
    Industry-recognized apprenticeship programs have fewer quality
    standards than registered apprenticeship programs – for example,
    they fail to require the wage progression that reflects increasing
    apprentice skills and they lack the standardized training rigor that
    ensures employers know they are hiring a worker with high-quality
    training. Today, President Biden is rescinding Executive Order
    13801, which spurred the creation of these programs. He is also
    asking DOL to consider new rulemaking to reverse these programs and
    to immediately slow support for industry recognized apprenticeship
    programs by pausing approval of new Standards Recognition Entities
    and ending new funding for existing Standards Recognition Entities.
