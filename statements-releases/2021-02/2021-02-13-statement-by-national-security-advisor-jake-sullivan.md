The mission of the World Health Organization (WHO) has never been more
important, and we have deep respect for its experts and the work they
are doing every day to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and advance global
health and health security. That is why President Biden rejected and
reversed the Trump Administration’s decision to disengage from the WHO.
But re-engaging the WHO also means holding it to the highest standards.
 And at this critical moment, protecting the WHO’s credibility is a
paramount priority. We have deep concerns about the way in which the
early findings of the COVID-19 investigation were communicated and
questions about the process used to reach them. It is imperative that
this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention
or alteration by the Chinese government. To better understand this
pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its
data from the earliest days of the outbreak. Going forward, all
countries, including China, should participate in a transparent and
robust process for preventing and responding to health emergencies — so
that the world learns as much as possible as soon as possible.
