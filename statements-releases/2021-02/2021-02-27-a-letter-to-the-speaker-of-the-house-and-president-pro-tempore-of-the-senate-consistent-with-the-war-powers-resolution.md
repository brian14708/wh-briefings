  \ Consistent with the War Powers\_Resolution"

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)

At my direction, on February 25, 2021, United States forces conducted a
targeted military strike against infrastructure in eastern Syria used by
Iran-supported non-state militia groups. 

Those non-state militia groups were involved in recent attacks against
United States and Coalition personnel in Iraq, including the February
15, 2021, attack in Erbil, Iraq, which wounded one United States service
member, wounded four United States contractors, including one
critically, and killed one Filipino contractor.  These groups are also
engaged in ongoing planning for future such attacks.

In response, I directed this military action to protect and defend our
personnel and our partners against these attacks and future such
attacks.  The United States always stands ready to take necessary and
proportionate action in self-defense, including when, as is the case
here, the government of the state where the threat is located is
unwilling or unable to prevent the use of its territory by non-state
militia groups responsible for such attacks. 

I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to
protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in
furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct United
States foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. 
The United States took this action pursuant to the United States’
inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter. 

I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.

Sincerely,

                                  JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
