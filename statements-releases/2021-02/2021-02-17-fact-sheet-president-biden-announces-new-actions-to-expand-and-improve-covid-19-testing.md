title: "Fact Sheet: President Biden Announces New Actions to Expand and Improve COVID-\
  \ \u2060 19 Testing"
---
 
As part of his National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic
Preparedness, President Biden announced today a series of new actions to
expand COVID-19 testing, improve the availability of tests, and better
prepare for the threat of variants. As the Administration is working
around the clock to vaccinate the population, we need to continue to do
what we know works to protect public health: universal masking, physical
distancing, and robust testing. These down payments will serve as a
bridge to comprehensive testing investments in the American Rescue Plan.

Today, President Biden announced that the Biden-Harris administration
will:

**Expand COVID-19 Testing for Schools and Underserved Populations.** The
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in partnership with the
Department of Defense (DOD), will <span

to expand testing opportunities for K-8 schools and underserved
congregate settings, such as homeless shelters. HHS will establish
regional coordinating centers to organize the distribution of COVID-19
testing supplies and partner with laboratories across the country,
including universities and commercial labs, to collect specimens,
perform tests, and report results to the relevant public health
agencies. Too often, testing can be hard to implement in non-medical
settings or it can be hard for schools or other congregate settings to
find the right partner to make testing work. These coordinating centers
will identify existing testing capacity, match it up to an area of need,
and fund that testing. 

**Increase Domestic Manufacturing of Testing Supplies.** HHS and DOD
will <span style="text-decoration: underline">invest $815 million</span>
to increase domestic manufacturing of testing supplies and raw materials
that have created shortage issues, including filter pipette tips,
nitrocellulose used in antigen point-of-care tests, and specific
injected molded plastics needed to house testing reagents.

**Rapidly Increase Virus Genome Sequencing.** The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) will <span
style="text-decoration: underline">invest nearly $200 million</span> to
identify, track, and mitigate emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 through
genome sequencing. This down payment will increase CDC’s sequencing more
than threefold <span style="text-decoration: underline">from about 7,000
samples per week to approximately 25,000</span>. Increasing samples will
improve our ability to detect emerging variants and understand their
spread with greater precision. Expanded testing is critical to support
more genomic sequencing, because sequencing only occurs after a COVID-19
test comes up positive.

These investments are only the beginning of what is needed to expand
testing nationwide and get the pandemic under control. The American
Rescue Plan will invest $50 billion to expand and support testing,
including in priority settings like schools and shelters, and invest in
U.S. testing capacity so that public health officials can track the
virus in real time and Americans can efficiently get results.
