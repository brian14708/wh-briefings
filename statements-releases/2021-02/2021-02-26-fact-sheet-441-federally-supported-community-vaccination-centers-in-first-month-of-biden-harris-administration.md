title: "FACT SHEET: 441 Federally-Supported Community Vaccination Centers in First\
  \ Month of Biden-\u2060Harris\_Administration"
---
 
*Since January 20, the Biden-Harris Administration has supported the
establishment or expansion of 441 community vaccination centers across
37 states, territories, and the District of Columbia.*

The Biden-Harris Administration has launched a comprehensive,
whole-of-government effort to get more people vaccinated—by increasing
vaccine supply, increasing vaccinators, and increasing the number of
places to get vaccinated. As part of this strategy, the Administration
is supporting and launching federally-supported community vaccination
centers nationwide in places people know and trust: community centers,
schools, and stadiums. These community vaccination centers help achieve
the President’s goal of administering 100 million shots in 100 days and
getting vaccines to Americans more rapidly and more equitably.

On his first day in office, the President set a goal of launching or
supporting 100 community vaccination centers in his first month. Today,
President Biden announced that since January 20, the federal government
has provided critical support in the form of personnel, funding, and/or
equipment to help establish or expand 441 community vaccination centers
nationwide. As of this week:

-   **171 sites are being supported by federal personnel:** The
    Biden-Harris Administration has deployed 2,225 personnel nationwide
    to support vaccination operations, including expert logisticians,
    vaccinators and non-medical operational staff serving as greeters,
    clerks and other critical support roles. Personnel are assigned from
    agencies across the federal government, including the Federal
    Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC); U.S. Department of the Interior (DoI); U.S.
    Department of Defense (DoD); U.S. Coast Guard (USCG); U.S. Forest
    Service (USFS); Veterans Affairs (VA); U.S. Department of Health and
    Human Services (HHS); and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
-   **312 sites are being supported by federally-funded National Guard
    members under Title 32 orders:** This means more people to deliver
    vaccinations, handle logistics, and coordinate the pandemic
    response. In total, the Administration is supporting 1,200 National
    Guard vaccinators across 43 states and territories.

<!-- -->

-   **177 sites have received federal funding:** At the President’s
    direction, FEMA is reimbursing 100% of costs for vaccination
    operations. This funding covers critical supplies, staffing,
    training, and transportation needs that support increased
    vaccination distribution and administration. The funding flows to
    states, localities, Tribes, territories, and eligible non-profits.  
-   **62 sites have received federal equipment:** From folding chairs to
    sharps containers to dry ice, the federal government has provided a
    range of equipment to meet state, local, Tribal, and territorial
    needs and help establish or expand sites.

**<u>Federal Pilot Community Vaccination Centers</u>**

Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration has announced 18
federally-established community vaccination centers, with the ability to
administer a total of 61,000 shots per day at full capacity. For these
sites, the federal government is directly working with state and local
partners from start to finish, to help select the location for, staff,
and operate these sites.

The Biden-Harris Administration is placing equity at the core of the
federal government’s strategy to defeat the pandemic. FEMA has partnered
with CDC and state and local partners to locate vaccination centers in
places that aim to reach hard-hit, high-risk communities, deploying
CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index and similar state and local measures.
Ensuring access is a priority in the design of the Federal Pilot
community vaccination centers, with some featuring weekend and extended
daytime hours, reserved slots for registration through faith-based and
community-based organizations, and deployment alongside mobile
vaccination units to help vaccinate surrounding communities.

Two sites opened in California on February 16, administering over 90,000
shots since opening, with additional vaccinations from the four mobile
clinics based out of these locations and bringing vaccines directly to
surrounding communities. Five other Federal Pilot sites opened this
week, with three in Texas and two in New York. Additional sites
announced in Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and North Carolina are
launching in the coming weeks, with more to be announced.
