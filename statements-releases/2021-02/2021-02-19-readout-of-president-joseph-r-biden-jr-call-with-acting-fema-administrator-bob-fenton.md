President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke this afternoon with Acting FEMA
Administrator Bob Fenton about the severe winter weather situation
facing central and southern parts of the United States. The President
expressed his support to Acting Administrator Fenton for what FEMA has
done to provide generators, water, blankets, and on-going support to the
people of Texas, and all across the South. He also thanked him for
FEMA’s role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and the role it has
played in assisting with vaccination deployment.

President Biden also let Acting Administrator Fenton know that he was
ready to mobilize other federal agencies to bring additional support to
the people of Texas and ensure that any critical needs are met. He also
told the Acting Administrator that he intends to sign Texas’s request
for a Major Disaster Declaration as soon as FEMA sends over the formal
request from Governor Abbott later today.

The President let Acting Administrator Fenton know that through senior
administration officials the White House would continue to stay in close
touch with FEMA, local officials, and organizations providing direct
relief to monitor the impacts of the storms as they move across the
United States.
