title: Statement by the President Three Years After the Parkland Shooting
---
 
Three years ago today, a lone gunman took the lives of 14 students and
three educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland,
Florida. In seconds, the lives of dozens of families, and the life of an
American community, were changed forever.  
  
For three years now, the Parkland families have spent birthdays and
holidays without their loved ones. They’ve missed out on the experience
of sending their children off to college or seeing them on their first
job after high school. Like far too many families, they’ve had to bury
pieces of their soul deep within the Earth. Like far too many families —
and, indeed, like our nation — they’ve been left to wonder whether
things would ever be okay.  
  
These families are not alone. In big cities and small towns. In schools
and shopping malls. In churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples. In
movie theaters and concert halls. On city street corners that will never
get a mention on the evening news. All across our nation, parents,
spouses, children, siblings, and friends have known the pain of losing a
loved one to gun violence. And in this season of so much loss, last
year’s historic increase in homicides across America, including the gun
violence disproportionately devastating Black and Brown individuals in
our cities, has added to the number of empty seats at our kitchen
tables. Today, as we mourn with the Parkland community, we mourn for all
who have lost loved ones to gun violence.  
  
Over these three years, the Parkland families have taught all of us
something profound. Time and again, they have showed us how we can turn
our grief into purpose – to march, organize, and build a strong,
inclusive, and durable movement for change.  
  
The Parkland students and so many other young people across the country
who have experienced gun violence are carrying forward the history of
the American journey. It is a history written by young people in each
generation who challenged prevailing dogma to demand a simple truth: we
can do better. And we will.  
  
This Administration will not wait for the next mass shooting to heed
that call. We will take action to end our epidemic of gun violence and
make our schools and communities safer. Today, I am calling on Congress
to enact commonsense gun law reforms, including requiring background
checks on all gun sales, banning assault weapons and high-capacity
magazines, and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers who knowingly
put weapons of war on our streets. We owe it to all those we’ve lost and
to all those left behind to grieve to make a change. The time to act is
now.
