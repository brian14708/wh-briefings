Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the first-ever
National Climate Task Force meeting as outlined by President Biden’s
January 27 executive order on tackling the climate crisis. The Task
Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor and includes
Cabinet-level leaders from 21 federal agencies and senior White House
officials to kickstart the Biden-Harris Administration’s implementation
of a whole-of-government approach to tackling climate change, creating
good-paying, union jobs, and achieving environmental justice.

During the virtual inaugural convening of the Task Force,
representatives from more than 20 federal agencies and offices
underscored the shared commitment of every agency in collaborating and
coordinating across the federal government to ensure the United States
leads the world in a clean energy revolution that creates American jobs
with the chance to join a union and builds back an inclusive, equitable
economy.

Additionally, Vice President Harris dropped by the Task Force meeting to
greet participants and underscore her and President Biden’s commitment
to overseeing an unprecedented approach to tackling climate change at
home and abroad, making sure that every agency plays a role and has the
White House’s support in working together. A longtime fighter for
environmental justice, the Vice President discussed the need to focus on
those communities that are most vulnerable to climate change.

Agency leadership and senior White House officials also discussed the
National Climate Task Force Charter, early actions, near-term priorities
and key milestones, and the role of the White House Office of Domestic
Climate Policy. Additionally, participants were invited to highlight the
ways their agencies and staff are prioritizing climate throughout all of
their decision making and how they plan to collaborate with additional
