February 10, 2021

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Consistent with section 202(a) of the National Emergencies Act, 50
U.S.C. 1622, I hereby report that I have issued a proclamation that
terminates the national emergency first declared in Proclamation 9844 of
February 15, 2019 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the
Southern Border of the United States).

I have determined that the declaration of a national emergency at our
southern border was unwarranted. I have also announced that it shall be
the policy of my Administration that no more American taxpayer dollars
be diverted to construct a border wall, and that I am directing a
careful review of all resources appropriated or redirected to that end.

I hereby report to the Congress that the national emergency declared by
Proclamation 9844, and continued on February 13, 2020, and January 15,
2021, is terminated and that the authorities invoked in that
proclamation will no longer be used to construct a wall at the southern
border.

I am enclosing a copy of the proclamation I have issued.

Sincerely,

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
