Today, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, National Economic
Council (NEC) Director Brian Deese, and National Climate Advisor Gina
McCarthy held a virtual meeting with more than a dozen passenger and
freight airline leaders to discuss shared priorities around supporting
the economic recovery, tackling the climate crisis, stopping the spread
of COVID-19, and ensuring strong safety protocols.

Administration leadership expressed the urgent priority of passing
President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which will change the course of
the pandemic and build a bridge towards economic recovery for airlines
and airline workers, and they thanked the industry for their leadership
and support for this critical legislation. Secretary Buttigieg, NEC
Director Deese, and National Climate Advisor McCarthy also highlighted
President Biden’s commitment to modernizing the transportation sector
while taking bold and aggressive action to combat climate change, as
well as the Administration’s plans to invest in American manufacturing,
strengthen domestic supply chains, and create good-paying, union jobs
across the transportation sector.

Secretary Buttigieg, NEC Director Deese, and National Climate Advisor
McCarthy listened to airline leaders share their perspectives, insights,
and priorities on the economic recovery and expressed the
Administration’s commitment to building back the economy better while
tackling the climate crisis. They were also grateful and optimistic to
hear airline leaders share information about the industry’s ongoing and
future efforts to address climate change, and they offered the
Administration’s support to strengthen and advance the airlines’ climate
goals.
