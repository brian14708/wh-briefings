Health care is a right, not a privilege. No one should have to lay awake
at night staring at the ceiling wondering what they are going to do to
get the care they need or to pay the bills if a family member gets
sick. That is why I will do everything in my power to ensure that all
Americans have access to the quality, affordable health care they
deserve – and the peace of mind it brings. 

That is especially critical in the midst of a deadly pandemic that
has already taken the lives of more than 470,000 of our fellow Americans
and infected more than one out of every 12 additional Americans, often
with devastating consequences to their health.

Starting today and running [through May 15, 2021](//3), we
are opening [Health](http://healthcare.gov/)[C](http://healthcare.gov/)[are.gov](http://healthcare.gov/) for all
Americans to have the opportunity to sign up for health insurance. Now,
everyone will be able to use a special enrollment period to
help secure some peace of mind as we work to beat the pandemic
and strengthen and build on the Affordable Care Act.

As more Americans get covered, it is encouraging to see Congress moving
quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan, which will ramp up testing,
tracing, and our national vaccination program to get shots into as many
arms as possible as quickly as we can. The American Rescue Plan
will also take big steps to lower health costs and expand access to
care for all Americans, including those who have lost their
jobs. It will increase federal subsidies and decrease premiums in order
to ensure that no one pays more than 8.5 percent of their income to
purchase meaningful and comprehensive health coverage. And it
incentivizes states to expand coverage to an additional four million
people with low incomes, and provides states the opportunity to extend
coverage for a year to low-income women who have recently given birth.

I encourage everyone who needs health insurance to go
to [HealthCare.gov](http://healthcare.gov/) [from today through May
15.](//6) If you already have coverage, then help your family and
friends sign up and enroll. 

We will get through this crisis if we look out for one another and
work together to expand coverage, lower costs, and ensure that health
care truly is a right for all Americans.
