Today, after a rigorous, open, and objective scientific review process,
the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization
for a third safe and effective vaccine to help us defeat the COVID-19
pandemic — the Janssen COVID-19 (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine. This is
exciting news for all Americans, and an encouraging development in our
efforts to bring an end to the crisis.

We know that the more people get vaccinated, the faster we will overcome
the virus, get back to our friends and loved ones, and get our economy
back on track. Thanks to the brilliance of our scientists, the
resilience of our people, and the eagerness of Americans in every
community to protect themselves and their loved ones by getting
vaccinated, we are moving in the right direction. I look forward to
speaking more about today’s news and updating the American people on our
progress this coming week.

But I want to be clear: this fight is far from over. Though we celebrate
today’s news, I urge all Americans — keep washing your hands, stay
socially distanced, and keep wearing masks. As I have said many times,
things are still likely to get worse again as new variants spread, and
the current improvement could reverse. My Administration will not make
the mistake of taking this threat lightly, or just assuming the best:
that’s why we need the American Rescue Plan to keep this fight going in
the months ahead.

There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard
down now or assume that victory is inevitable. We must continue to
remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another
— that is how we are going to reach that light together.
