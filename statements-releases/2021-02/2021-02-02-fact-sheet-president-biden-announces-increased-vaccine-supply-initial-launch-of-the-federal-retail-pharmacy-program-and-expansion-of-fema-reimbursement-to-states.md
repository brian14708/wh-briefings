  \ of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, and Expansion of FEMA Reimbursement to\_\
  States"

*States, Tribes, and territories will receive a 5 percent supply
increase this week, and Americans will soon have easier access to
vaccinations through local pharmacies*

As the U.S. surpasses 26 million COVID-19 infections, President Biden
took additional steps today to implement his comprehensive National
Strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. These steps include increasing
the vaccine supply to states, Tribes, and territories and increasing
funding to jurisdictions to help turn vaccines into vaccinations. And,
the President announced that starting next week, the first phase of the
federal pharmacy program will launch and select pharmacies nationwide
will start offering vaccinations for their communities.

These new steps will help meet the President’s goal of administering 100
million shots in 100 days and expand access to vaccines to more
Americans in the coming weeks.

The President is taking the following actions today:

**Expanding Vaccine Supply:** Building on last week’s announcement, the
Biden-Harris Administration will increase overall, weekly vaccine supply
to states, Tribes, and territories to 10.5 million doses nationwide
beginning this week. This is a 22% increase since taking office on
January 20. The Administration is committing to maintaining this as the
minimum supply level for the next three weeks, and we will continue to
work with manufacturers in their efforts to ramp up supply.

  
**Launching First Phase of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for
COVID-19 Vaccination:** As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
efforts to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines, starting on February
11, those eligible for the vaccine will have the opportunity to be
vaccinated at select pharmacies across the country through the Federal
Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. This program is a
public-private partnership with 21 national pharmacy partners and
networks of independent pharmacies representing over 40,000 pharmacy
locations nationwide (listed below). It is a key component of the
Administration’s National Strategy to expand equitable access to
vaccines for the American public.

  
As the first phase of this program launches, select retail pharmacies
nationwide will receive limited vaccine supply to vaccinate priority
groups at no cost. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
worked with states to select initial pharmacy partners based on a number
of factors including their ability to reach some of the populations most
at risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Americans should check their
pharmacy’s website to find out if vaccine is available as supply will be
limited in the initial phase. More information is available at
cdc.gov/covid19.

  
**Increasing Reimbursements to States:** Central to the Biden-Harris
Administration’s COVID-19 National Strategy is ensuring states, Tribes,
territories, and jurisdictions have the resources they need to defeat
the virus. That’s why, in his second day in office, President Biden
directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fully
reimburse states for the cost of National Guard Personnel and emergency
costs. Today, President Biden is announcing that the administration will
go even further, retroactively reimbursing states fully for
FEMA-eligible services – including masks, gloves, emergency feeding
actions, sheltering at risk populations, and mobilization of the
National Guard – back dated to the beginning of the pandemic in January
2020. This reimbursement is estimated to total $3-5 billion and is only
a small share of the resources that states need to fight this pandemic —
including for testing, genomic sequencing, and mass vaccination centers.
To fully support states, Tribes, and territories’ needs to contain the
pandemic and vaccinate their populations, President Biden is requesting
$350 billion from Congress in American Rescue Plan.
