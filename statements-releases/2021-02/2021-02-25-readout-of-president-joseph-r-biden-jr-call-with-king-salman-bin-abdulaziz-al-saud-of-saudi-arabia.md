President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with King Salman bin
Abdulaziz al-Saud of Saudi Arabia to address the longstanding
partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Together they
discussed regional security, including the renewed diplomatic efforts
led by the United Nations and the United States to end the war in Yemen,
and the U.S. commitment to help Saudi Arabia defend its territory as it
faces attacks from Iranian-aligned groups. The President noted
positively the recent release of several Saudi-American activists and
Ms. Loujain al-Hathloul from custody, and affirmed the importance the
United States places on universal human rights and the rule of law. The
President told King Salman he would work to make the bilateral
relationship as strong and transparent as possible. The two leaders
affirmed the historic nature of the relationship and agreed to work
together on mutual issues of concern and interest.
