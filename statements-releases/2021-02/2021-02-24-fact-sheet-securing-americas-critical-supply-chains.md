title: "FACT SHEET:  Securing America\u2019s Critical Supply\_Chains"
---
 
Today President Biden will sign an Executive Order to help create more
resilient and secure supply chains for critical and essential goods.

In recent years, American households, workers, and companies have
increasingly felt the strain of shortages of essential products—from
medicine to food to computer chips. Last year’s shortages of personal
protective equipment (PPE) for front-line healthcare workers at the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic were unacceptable. Recent shortages
of automotive semiconductor chips have forced slowdowns at car
manufacturing plants, highlighting how shortages can hurt U.S. workers.

While we cannot predict what crisis will hit us, we should have the
capacity to respond quickly in the face of challenges. The United States
must ensure that production shortages, trade disruptions, natural
disasters and potential actions by foreign competitors and adversaries
never leave the United States vulnerable again. Today’s action delivers
on the President’s campaign commitment to direct his Administration to
comprehensively address supply chain risks. The task of making our
supply chains more secure can also be a source of well paid jobs for
communities across our country, including in communities of color, and
steps will be taken to ensure that the benefits of this work flow to all
Americans.

The Executive Order launches a comprehensive review of U.S. supply
chains and directs federal Departments and Agencies to identify ways to
secure U.S. supply chains against a wide range of risks and
vulnerabilities. Building resilient supply chains will protect the
United States from facing shortages of critical products.  It will also
facilitate needed investments to maintain America’s competitive edge,
and strengthen U.S. national security.

**First, the order directs an immediate 100-day review across federal
agencies to address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of four key
products.  **

1.  APIs are the part of a pharmaceutical product that contains the
    active drug. In recent decades, more than 70 percent of API
    production facilitators supplying the U.S. have moved offshore.
     This work will complement the ongoing work to secure supply chains
    needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
2.  Critical minerals are an essential part of defense, high-tech, and
    other products. From rare earths in our electric motors and
    generators to the carbon fiber used for airplanes—the United States
    needs to ensure we are not dependent upon foreign sources or single
    points of failure in times of national emergency. 

-   **Semiconductors and Advanced Packaging.** The United States is the
    birthplace of this technology, and has always been a leader in
    semiconductor development. However, over the years we have
    underinvested in production—hurting our innovative edge—while other
    countries have learned from our example and increased their
    investments in the industry.  
-   **Large capacity batteries, such as those used in electric
    vehicles:** As we take action to tackle the climate crisis, we know
    that will lead to large demand for new energy technologies like
    electric vehicle batteries. By identifying supply chain risks, we
    can meet the President’s commitment to accelerate U.S. leadership of
    clean energy technologies. For example, while the U.S. is a net
    exporter of electric vehicles, we are not a leader in the supply
    chain associated with electric battery production. The U.S. could
    better leverage our sizeable lithium reserves and manufacturing
    know-how to expand domestic battery production.

The 100-day review will identify near term steps the administration can
take, including with Congress, to address vulnerabilities in the supply
chains for these critical goods.

**Second, the order calls for a more in-depth one-year review of a
broader set of U.S. supply chains. The one-year review will include:**

-   **A focus on six key sectors:** the defense industrial base; the
    public health and biological preparedness industrial base; the
    information and communications technology (ICT) industrial base; the
    energy sector industrial base; the transportation industrial base;
    and supply chains for agricultural commodities and food production.
-   **A set of risks for agencies to consider in their assessment of
    supply chain vulnerabilities:** Agencies and Departments are
    directed to review a variety of risks to supply chains and
    industrial bases.  For example, these reviews must identify critical
    goods and materials within supply chains, the manufacturing or other
    capabilities needed to produce those materials, as well as a variety
    of vulnerabilities created by failure to develop domestic
    capabilities.  Agencies and Departments are also directed to
    identify locations of key manufacturing and production assets, the
    availability of substitutes or alternative sources for critical
    goods, the state of workforce skills and identified gaps for all
    sectors, and the role of transportation systems in supporting supply
    chains and industrial bases. 
-   **Recommendations on actions that should be taken to improve
    resiliency:** Agencies are directed to make specific policy
    recommendations to address risks, as well as proposals for new
    research and development activities.
-   **A sustained commitment to supply chain resiliency:** The
    government will commit to a regular, ongoing process of reviewing
    supply chain resilience, including a quadrennial review process.
-   **Consultation with external stakeholders:** The government cannot
    secure supply chains on its own. It requires partnership and
    consultation with the American people. The E.O. directs the
    Administration to consult widely with outside stakeholders, such as
    those in industry, academia, non-governmental organizations,
    communities, labor unions, and State, local, territorial, and Tribal
    governments.

The E.O will build on bipartisan Congressional action and leadership on
this issue, and the Administration will remain in close touch with
Congress to solicit recommendations during the review.  President Biden
has also directed his Administration to work with U.S. partners and
allies to ensure that they too have strong and resilient supply chains.

President Biden has directed his Administration to ensure that the task
of building resilient supply chains draws on the talent and work ethic
of communities across America, including communities of color and cities
and towns that have for too long suffered from job losses and industrial
decline. As the Administration implements the Executive Order, it will
identify opportunities to implement policies to secure supply chains
that grow the American economy, increase wages, benefit small businesses
and historically disadvantaged communities, strengthen pandemic and
biopreparedness, support the fight against global climate change, and
maintain America’s technological leadership in key sectors.
