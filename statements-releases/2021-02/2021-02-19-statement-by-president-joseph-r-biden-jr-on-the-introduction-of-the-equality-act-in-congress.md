title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on the Introduction of the Equality\
  \ Act in\_Congress"
---
 
I applaud Congressman David Cicilline and the entire Congressional
Equality Caucus for introducing the Equality Act in the House of
Representatives yesterday, and I urge Congress to swiftly pass this
historic legislation. Every person should be treated with dignity and
respect, and this bill represents a critical step toward ensuring that
America lives up to our foundational values of equality and freedom for
all.

Full equality has been denied to LGBTQ+ Americans and their families for
far too long. Despite the extraordinary progress the LGBTQ+ community
has made to secure their basic civil rights, discrimination is still
rampant in many areas of our society. The Equality Act provides long
overdue federal civil rights protections on the basis of sexual
orientation and gender identity, locking in critical safeguards in our
housing, education, public services, and lending systems — and codifying
the courage and resilience of the LGBTQ+ movement into enduring law.

On my first day in office, I was proud to sign an [Executive Order on
Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity
or Sexual
Orientation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/).
I directed agencies to implement the Supreme Court’s *Bostock* ruling,
and fully enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other
laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or
sexual orientation. Now, it’s time for Congress to secure these
protections once and for all by passing the Equality Act — because no
one should ever face discrimination or live in fear because of who they
are or whom they love.
