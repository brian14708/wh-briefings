Chinese people on the occasion of Lunar New Year. President Biden
affirmed his priorities of protecting the American people’s security,
prosperity, health, and way of life, and preserving a free and open
Indo-Pacific. President Biden underscored his fundamental concerns about
Beijing’s coercive and unfair economic practices, crackdown in Hong
Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive
actions in the region, including toward Taiwan. The two leaders also
exchanged views on countering the COVID-19 pandemic, and the shared
challenges of global health security, climate change, and preventing
weapons proliferation. President Biden committed to pursuing practical,
results-oriented engagements when it advances the interests of the
American people and those of our allies.
