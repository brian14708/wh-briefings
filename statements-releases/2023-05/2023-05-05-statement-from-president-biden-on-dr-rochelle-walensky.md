title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Dr. Rochelle\_Walensky"
---
 
Dr. Walensky has saved lives with her steadfast and unwavering focus on
the health of every American. As Director of the CDC, she led a complex
organization on the frontlines of a once-in-a-generation pandemic with
honesty and integrity. She marshalled our finest scientists and public
health experts to turn the tide on the urgent crises we’ve faced.  
   
Dr. Walensky leaves CDC a stronger institution, better positioned to
confront health threats and protect Americans.  We have all benefited
from her service and dedication to public health, and I wish her the
best in her next chapter.
