title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Announcement of a Ceasefire\
  \ Between Israel and Gaza-based\_Militants"

The United States welcomes tonight’s announcement of a ceasefire between
Israel and Gaza-based militants brokered by the Egyptian Government
after nearly five days of fighting.  U.S. officials worked closely with
regional partners to achieve this resolution to the hostilities to
prevent further loss of life and restore calm for both Israelis and
Palestinians.  We are grateful for the critical diplomatic efforts of
President Abdel Fattah El Sisi and senior Egyptian officials, as well as
Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar.
