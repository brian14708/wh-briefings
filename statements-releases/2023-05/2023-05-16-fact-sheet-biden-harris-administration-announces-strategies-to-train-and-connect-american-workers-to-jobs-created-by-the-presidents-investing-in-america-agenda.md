title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Strategies to Train\
  \ and Connect American Workers to Jobs Created by the President\u2019s Investing\
  \ in America\_Agenda"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new efforts to
ensure all Americans can access the good jobs created by the President’s
Investing in America agenda, including the American Rescue Plan, the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the
Inflation Reduction Act. These strategies build off the Administration’s
[Roadmap](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/biden-harris-administration-roadmap-to-support-good-jobs/)
to Support Good Jobs, a collaborative agency effort to align on
guideposts to build our workforce by ensuring every American—whether
they go to college or not—will have equitable access to high-quality
training, education, and services that provide a path to a good career
without leaving their community.  
  
Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, private
companies have announced $470 billion in manufacturing and clean energy
investments, which is in addition to the $220 billion already announced
by the Administration for infrastructure projects funded by the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These projects and investments are
creating good job opportunities for hardworking Americans, many of which
don’t require a four-year degree. Today’s announcements highlight how
the Administration will ensure American workers and families have access
to those job opportunities and the training and skills needed to fill
those jobs. First Lady Jill Biden will highlight the announcements today
during her remarks at the Department of Labor’s Vision 2030 National
Workforce Convening.

The Investing in America Workforce Initiatives include:

-   **Workforce Hubs.** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and
    Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act are catalyzing public- and
    private-sector investments across the nation—including significant
    concentrations in key cities and regions. The Administration will
    partner with state and local officials, employers, unions, community
    colleges, high schools, and other stakeholders to ensure a diverse
    and skilled workforce can meet the demand for labor driven by these
    investments, starting with five focus regions beginning this summer:
    Phoenix, Columbus, Baltimore, Augusta, and Pittsburgh. These efforts
    will not only strengthen the five cities—they will create models the
    Administration will work to replicate with partners across the
    country.  
-   **Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint.** The Investing in
    America agenda is creating demand for workers critical to building
    clean energy technologies, producing semiconductor chips, and
    driving a manufacturing boom all across the country. To help meet
    that rapidly growing demand, the Administration is launching a new
    workforce sprint to expand and diversify pathways into good jobs and
    careers in advanced manufacturing that don’t require a four-year
    college degree. This national sprint will bring together employers,
    labor unions, workforce development organizations, and others to
    develop high-quality education and training standards, portable
    credentials, and labor-management partnerships to ensure a diverse
    and robust manufacturing workforce ready to lead America’s
    manufacturing renaissance.  
-   **Good Jobs, Great Cities Academy.** The Department of Labor is
    announcing 16 cities as part of its Good Jobs, Great Cities Academy
    with the National League of Cities. The Good Jobs, Great Cities
    Academy will complement the Administration’s Workforce Hubs by
    providing technical assistance and support to a wide range of cities
    to launch or scale existing workforce initiatives within their city.
    These initiatives will build pathways to good jobs aligned with the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda.

In addition to these efforts, the Department of Labor will support local
leaders and communities in driving workforce development efforts that
build pathways for diverse workers into good jobs created by Investing
in America investments. The Department will provide tools and resources
for facilitating labor-management partnerships that bring together
employers, labor unions, community colleges, high-road training
providers, and community organizations to jointly develop and implement
training programs that advance job quality, equity, and worker voice.

**Workforce Hubs  
**  
The President’s Investing in America agenda presents an unprecedented
opportunity to help more students and workers—including women, people of
color, youth, and others underrepresented in growing fields—advance in
good jobs and careers in industries mobilized by the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation
Reduction Act. Already, President Biden has unleashed $470 billion in
private sector investments in clean energy, semiconductors, and
manufacturing—and that’s in addition to the $220 billion in
infrastructure projects that have been announced since the President
signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. As a result of many of these
investments, centers of opportunity have emerged around specific sectors
in particular regions of the country.

To unleash the full economic and job-creation potential of these public-
and private-sector investments, the Administration has identified an
initial set of five Workforce Hubs, each centered on key industries. In
each Hub, the Administration will partner with state and local elected
officials and community leaders to drive effective place-based workforce
development efforts that are essential to building an economy from the
bottom up and the middle out. Each Workforce Hub, consistent with the
needs of the specific city or region, will work to secure private-sector
and state and local commitments to expand pre-apprenticeship and
Registered Apprenticeship programs, develop or expand career and
technical education programs aligned to Investing in America jobs and
careers, and provide supportive services that are particularly critical
to helping underrepresented students and workers succeed.

The first five Workforce Hubs are:  

-   **Phoenix, AZ.** Phoenix and the surrounding region are a growing
    hub for semiconductor manufacturing, optical cable, and critical
    mineral and battery manufacturing efforts. Investments in these
    sectors—along with transportation and other infrastructure
    projects—provide an opportunity to ensure equitable pathways to good
    jobs, including for workers in the local Tribal and Hispanic
    populations. The neighboring Four Corners region is a high-priority
    [Energy
    Community](https://energycommunities.gov/priority-energy-communities/)
    where renewable energy programs, including those supporting Tribal
    communities, will be based. Phoenix is also using American Rescue
    Plan funds for innovative workforce investment, including providing
    child care for airport workers, redeveloping an abandoned big box
    store into a workforce training center, and investing in training
    for in-demand jobs.  
-   **Columbus, OH.** Columbus has emerged as a center of investment
    across a variety of industries—including in semiconductor
    manufacturing, clean energy, and transportation. In partnership with
    Intel, the Ohio Semiconductor Collaboration Network is developing
    curriculum for two-year pathways—including dual enrollment models—to
    semiconductor technician roles, to be shared across the nearly two
    dozen community colleges in the state. The city of Columbus
    pioneered a model to diversify construction Registered
    Apprenticeships, which is now being replicated elsewhere in the
    nation through a Department of Labor -funded partnership between
    TradesFutures and the National Urban League.  
-   **Pittsburgh, PA.** Pittsburgh is a hub for innovation across
    critical sectors, with strong growth in advanced manufacturing,
    including robotics and biomanufacturing, as well as clean energy,
    including batteries. The surrounding region of Southwestern
    Pennsylvania—a priority [Energy
    Community](https://energycommunities.gov/priority-energy-communities/)
    that includes Pittsburgh—was awarded a Build Back Better Regional
    Challenge grant to expand the region’s growing robotics cluster and
    ensure the benefits extend to rural coal-impacted communities in the
    region. The growth of these industries—along with significant
    investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in
    transportation, water infrastructure, and more—will continue to
    drive significant demand for talent. Additionally, Pittsburgh is
    home to world-class universities.  
-   **Baltimore, MD.** Baltimore’s position in the Northeast Corridor
    makes it essential to the Administration’s efforts to upgrade and
    improve the nation’s rail service through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. In January, President Biden visited Baltimore
    for the kickoff to replace the 150-year-old Frederick Douglass
    Tunnel—a project estimated to create 30,000 jobs that will be built
    with a project-labor agreement between Amtrak and the local building
    trades unions. The Baltimore region also has a burgeoning offshore
    wind industry, and the Maryland Department of Labor won a Good Jobs
    Challenge award to support the industry’s growth by implementing a
    new apprenticeship model in partnership with multiple employers and
    seven unions. The city is also using $30 million in American Rescue
    Plan funds to expand many workforce efforts, including credential
    programs to help workers get jobs in in-demand fields.  
-   **Augusta, GA.** Augusta and the surrounding region form a diverse
    community that is home to Fort Gordon, the Medical College of
    Georgia, and the Savannah River Nuclear Power Plant. The Augusta
    area is on the forefront of the Administration’s sustainable
    domestic production agenda, with $1.4 billion in recently announced
    private-sector investments, including in batteries. The
    Administration’s efforts will focus on preparing and creating
    pathways for people in Augusta and the surrounding areas to access
    the good-paying jobs created in the clean energy industry, among
    others.

**Workforce Sprint  
**  
Through prior workforce sprints, the Administration has driven
commitments to equitable workforce development and job quality
improvement to address critical needs. These include efforts to expand
Registered Apprenticeships in

and to build pathways into good jobs and careers in broadband,
electrification, and construction through the [Talent Pipeline
Challenge](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-celebrates-new-commitments-toward-equitable-workforce-development-for-infrastructure-jobs/).

**Today, the Administration is announcing a new sprint in advanced
manufacturing**. Advanced manufacturing spans critical technologies of
the future supported through the Investing in America agenda—from
electric vehicles and semiconductors to high-tech heat pumps
(super-efficient HVAC technology), as well as biobased products like
medicines, vaccines, and biofuels. Many of the skills and occupations
across advanced manufacturing do not require a bachelor’s degree,
including advanced manufacturing technicians, biomedical technicians,
and machinists. Through this sprint, the Administration will work with
employers, unions, and other stakeholders—such as the Manufacturing USA
Institutes—to expand pre-apprenticeships, Registered Apprenticeships,
and career and technical education (CTE) programs at the secondary and
postsecondary level for advanced manufacturing occupations. The
Administration will call on employers and others to partner to ensure
these jobs are good jobs, and to expand access to underrepresented
communities, such as by providing supportive services.

**Good Jobs, Great Cities Academy  
**  
To complement the White House’s Workforce Hubs, the Department of Labor
is announcing the 16 cities that have been selected to join the Good
Jobs, Great Cities Academy. Through partnership with the National League
of Cities, the Academy will spur innovative and scalable city-led
solutions that upskill and reskill all workers—including those who have
too often been left behind—into quality, high-demand jobs in
infrastructure, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing, made possible
by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda.

The Academy will provide its 16-member cohort with in-depth technical
assistance to accelerate each city’s efforts to design, develop, and
launch a new workforce initiative. The initiative will leverage
partnerships with local government, workforce boards, education and
training providers, industry, labor unions, labor-management
partnerships, and community-based organizations. City participation will
culminate in the launch of new or expanded training programs that place
workers in quality jobs.
