title: "President\_Biden Names Thirty-Third Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate four federal judicial
nominees—all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and
devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.  
  
If confirmed, this slate would include:

-   The first South Asian woman to serve on United States District Court
    for the District of Columbia and the only active AAPI woman judge on
    that court.
-   A woman who would be the first federal judge of East Asian descent
    in Michigan.

This will be President Biden’s thirty-third round of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 167.
