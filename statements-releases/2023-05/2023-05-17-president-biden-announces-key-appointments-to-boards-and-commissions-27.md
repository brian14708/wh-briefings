The United States Holocaust Memorial Council was established by Congress
in 1980 to lead the nation in commemorating the Holocaust and to raise
private funds for and build the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

States government operating as a public-private partnership that
receives some federal funding to support operations of the Museum
building.
