title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Outlines Priorities for Building\
  \ America\u2019s Energy Infrastructure Faster, Safer, and\_Cleaner"
---
 
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is making a
once-in-a-generation investment in America’s infrastructure and our
clean energy future that is creating good-paying union jobs, growing our
economy, building energy security, combating climate change, advancing
environmental justice, and helping lower costs for families. To continue
to drive these efforts, the Biden-Harris Administration today announced
a set of priorities it urges Congress to pass as part of bipartisan
permitting reform legislation.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration has already unleashed over $470 billion
in manufacturing and clean energy investments since President Biden took
office, providing predictable funding for new projects that would not
have been contemplated a few years ago, and secured $1 billion to help
expedite federal agency permitting. As a result of the Inflation
Reduction Act, near-term clean energy deployment is expected to increase
by 25%.  
  
Building clean energy projects in the U.S. at the speed and scale needed
to adequately address the climate crisis requires strategic reforms that
improve the way such projects are sited and permitted at the federal,
state and local levels. The Administration is acting to move projects
forward, using its existing authority to accelerate the federal
permitting process. These actions include establishing a new interagency
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to facilitate the timely, responsible,
and equitable permitting of electric transmission infrastructure.  
  
But more reforms are needed to build out modern American energy
infrastructure and supply chains with the speed and safety that the
moment demands. To take just one example, the law governing mineral
claims – commodities that are critical components of modern energy
technologies – is more than 150 years old. To ensure that we protect the
environment and communities and keep our economy globally competitive,
Congress should act on thoughtful permitting reform that puts science
and people first.

**<u>Administration Objectives for Permitting Reform</u>**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration supports the important reforms contained
in the Building American Energy Security Act of 2023 as the kind of
bipartisan compromise needed to tackle this challenge. The
Administration encourages the inclusion of the following priorities in
any bipartisan permitting reform package:

-   **Accelerate Deployment of Critical Electric Transmission**. In
    order to support the deployment of new clean energy generation, the
    country needs to expand transmission capacity to move electric
    power, both onshore and offshore. Congress should:
    -   Expedite the connection of interstate and offshore electric
        transmission lines by providing for electric transmission siting
        and cost allocation**.**
    -   Reform the transmission interconnection queue so that new
        generation projects are not stuck in line waiting for approval
        for over four years.
    -   Develop regional electricity transfer requirements that would
        set a minimum level of transfer capabilities between regions to
        avoid events like the 2021 Texas freeze, which was a
        humanitarian and economic crisis.
    -   Require the consideration of multiple benefits and burdens
        during interregional transmission planning, including economic,
        reliability, operational, environmental, and climate impacts.
    -   Direct the use of existing authorities to accelerate deployment
        of grid enhancing technologies and transmission line upgrades
        that could enable more than double the amount of new renewables
        that are able to be integrated into the existing grid
        infrastructure.
    -   Improve transmission financing by clarifying the Secretary of
        Energy is able to to make loans for transmission outside of
        designated transmission corridors, if it is deemed to be in the
        national interest.
-   **Accelerate Energy Project Permitting on Federal Lands**. The
    Energy Act of 2020 directed the Department of the Interior to permit
    25 gigawatts of renewable energy on departmentally managed lands by
    2025; the Biden-Harris Administration is already on track to surpass
    this goal. Congress should update these provisions with goals for
    2030 and 2035, to facilitate ongoing identification of zones for the
    development of renewable energy and for the siting of necessary
    transmission to attach that generation to the grid. Additionally,
    Congress should authorize the development of programmatic
    environmental reviews and direct agencies to develop categorical
    exclusions under them to facilitate speedier project development
    within identified zones.
-   **Modernize America’s 150-Year-Old Mining Laws and Responsibly
    Develop Domestic Critical Minerals. **To meet the nation’s climate,
    infrastructure, and global competitiveness goals, the U.S. must
    expand and accelerate responsible domestic production of critical
    minerals in a manner that upholds strong environmental, labor,
    safety, Tribal consultation, and community engagement standards. The
    nation’s mining laws, however, are outdated, with core legal
    structures largely unchanged since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.
    These outdated laws contribute to slower permitting timelines,
    inhibit sound siting and planning, create conflicts, and are
    barriers to the responsible expansion of domestic critical mineral
    production. By responsibly permitting, managing operations, and
    remediating mines, the U.S. can set a global standard for
    responsible mineral development and create good paying jobs in
    communities across the country. Additionally, we must increase
    coordination, transparency, and communication between federal
    agencies, and provide greater certainty for project sponsors for
    responsible domestic mining and extraction. Supporting a strong
    critical minerals sector, from mining to recycling, will create
    good-paying, union jobs in communities across the country.
-   **Deploy Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide Infrastructure.** Congress
    should address the siting of hydrogen and carbon dioxide pipelines
    and storage infrastructure and provide federal siting authority for
    such infrastructure. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 governs the
    designation of energy corridors on federal lands and covers oil, gas
    and hydrogen pipelines, and electric transmission lines. Such
    corridors are also suitable for carbon dioxide pipelines and need to
    be expanded in legislation to cover both prospectively designated
    and previously designated corridors.
-   **Incentivize Redevelopment for Clean Energy Deployment. **Siting
    clean energy facilities on formerly contaminated sites, old mining
    sites, and closed landfills, and reducing threats presented at those
    sites, can meaningfully contribute to clean energy production, while
    also creating jobs and improving environmental conditions for nearby
    communities. The Environmental Protection Agency has pre-screened
    nearly 200,000 brownfield sites across the country that have clean
    energy potential. However, the potential that a developer could
    become liable for existing contamination can significantly curtail
    the use of brownfields. Congress should protect clean energy
    developers who build projects on sites pre-screened by EPA from
    liability for existing contamination when the developers make
    reasonable investments to address contamination and ensure their
    activities do not disturb contamination in a manner that increases
    the risks posed to human health and the environment.

**<u>Recommendations to Streamline the Permitting Process</u>**

-   **Improve Permitting Efficiency and Predictability.** To build
    infrastructure expediently and responsibly, the necessary reviews,
    permits and approvals need to be robust, be completed within a
    predictable timeframe, and result in prompt and legally defensible
    decisions. To facilitate this process, Congress should act to
    further improve coordination of federal data sharing and reviews,
    expand the use of programmatic and tiered reviews, reduce the length
    of federal decision documents, and set reasonable decision time
    frames for projects. In making these reforms, Congress should:   
    -   Create a programmatic review fund to provide the resources to
        execute more programmatic reviews – which can allow
        environmental review work to be re-used for multiple projects –
        by authorizing agencies to impose a fee on project sponsors to
        cover costs associated with a programmatic review upon which
        their project relies.
    -   Support long term programmatic review use to clarify that the
        analysis may be relied upon for five years, unless there are new
        circumstances and, that a programmatic review’s analysis should
        be able to be relied upon after five years so long as the agency
        reevaluates the analysis and finds that it continues to
        sufficiently analyze the project’s effects.
    -   Expand responsible use of administrative categorical exclusions.
        Congress should require Federal agencies to examine and propose
        the use of categorical exclusions for clean energy projects
        where feasible. More than 95% of Federal actions are already
        approved under the most expedited form of environmental reviews,
        which enables speedier reviews for projects that have minimal
        impact on the environment and public health.
-   **Enhance Data Collection Needed for Effective Permitting.** 
    Coordinated review and permitting among federal agencies requires
    not only a collaborative approach but also data collection and
    sharing between agencies. Today, many agencies are using antiquated
    IT systems, and some even continue to rely on paper systems.
    Congress should provide resources to:
    -   Develop an automated, joint electronic permit application for
        federal agencies.
    -   Create updated maps to help identify locations for project
        development, including: (1) documentation of sites listed on the
        National Registry of Historic Places; (2) in consultation with
        Tribes, maps of important cultural resources, (3) identification
        of projects for which environmental reviews have been conducted
        previously; (4) location of critical wildlife corridors; and (5)
        identification of impaired waterways.
    -   Establish clear information submission deadlines for all project
        developers to submit data required for federal agency reviews
        and decision-making.
    -   Develop automated workflow tools that are compatible with
        existing agency dashboards to transcend organizational
        boundaries and track project progress from start to finish. For
        example, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) still operates a
        number of analog systems and could benefit from flexible
        investments in information technology (IT) modernization that
        helps district offices to digitize records that are essential to
        permitting projects the USACE will either deliver directly
        and/or permit.
    -   Create a permitting technology steering group to develop digital
        tools to facilitate environmental review and permitting
        processes across the Federal government, reducing duplication
        and increasing transparency, efficiency, and positive
        environmental, cultural, and community outcomes.
-   **Cut Duplicative and Burdensome Analysis and Reviews.  **Often
    environmental reviews and permitting processes need to be conducted
    sequentially, which can result in unnecessary delay and revisiting
    of decisions. Congress should address several areas where overlap
    occurs, including:  
    -   Expediting transmission projects in designated transmission
        corridors by allowing projects to rely on the analysis included
        in corridor-wide programmatic environmental reviews without the
        need to re-analyze resources and impacts that have already been
        examined.
    -   Reforming the hydropower licensing process, including by
        recognizing Tribal authority over facilities on Tribal land,
        improving engagement with States, Tribes, and stakeholders, and
        shortening timelines for licensing decisions to allow
        well-operated hydropower facilities including pumped storage to
        function and, where appropriate, removing non-operational
        facilities.
-   **Improve Community Engagement.** Agencies must facilitate
    meaningful engagement with local communities in environmental review
    and permitting processes. Early community engagement helps to
    identify and avoid conflicts, enhance public buy-in, and avoid
    surprises late in permitting processes that can disrupt timelines.
    Congress should:
    -   Require agencies to identify a Chief Community Engagement
        Officer to oversee community engagement in permitting processes
        across the agency.
    -   Establish a community engagement fund at each agency that
        agencies can draw from to provide community capacity grants to
        local governments, Tribes, or community groups to enhance
        capacity to engage on specific Federal actions that may affect
        them. Congress should authorize agencies to impose a fee on
        project sponsors where an environmental impact statement is
        being prepared to contribute to the community engagement fund.
    -   Direct the creation of a national map that would identify the
        location of each proposed Federal action that is being analyzed
        through an Environmental Impact Statement, to enable the public
        to more easily identify actions that may affect them.
    -   Allow agencies to transfer funds to Tribal Nations to enhance
        capacity to engage in National Historic Preservation Act
        consultations and to conduct cultural resource inventories.

-   **Address Gaps in the Permitting Workforce. **While recent
    legislation has provided financial resources to federal agencies for
    permitting activities, Congress should continue efforts to ensure
    that the federal government has a sufficient workforce and
    sufficient resources to conduct needed project reviews and evaluate
    permits. This includes:  
    -   Authorizing development, recruitment and retention of workers to
        conduct technical and scientific assessments, digital mapping
        and data management, and the review and processing of permits.  
         
    -   Provide federal agencies with flexible hiring authorities for
        permitting and environmental review.  
         
    -   Standardize the collection of fees to sufficiently fund permit
        program administration costs to provide agencies with resources
        to hire more permit writers, develop tools to oversee and track
        the timely and synchronized permit issuance within the
        environmental review process, engage more effectively with
        communities and pay for the operation and maintenance of
        electronic permitting platforms. 
-   **Establish Clearer Requirements for Mitigating Environmental
    Harms.** Congress should direct agencies to use their authority to
    require mitigation efforts, and make clear those efforts are able to
    satisfy environmental review requirements. This will enhance
    efficiency and improve certainty for project sponsors while
    producing better environmental outcomes, protecting public health,
    and advancing environmental justice.
-   **Incentivize State and Local Permitting Reform and
    Standardization**. State and local governments across the country
    employ an inconsistent patchwork of processes and requirements to
    implement Federally-funded projects. States like Georgia and New
    York have successfully piloted models like the co-location of
    Federal and state permitting officials or the development of a
    one-stop shop for all necessary state permits and environmental
    reviews. Legislation that either standardizes state-level permitting
    processes or provides financial incentives for states that adopt
    best practices would significantly accelerate the delivery of both
    public and privately funded projects.  
      
    **<u>Accelerating Administration Permitting Actions to Deliver
    Results</u>**  
    The Biden-Harris Administration is not waiting on Congressional
    action to accelerate permitting. Last year the Administration
    released a [Permitting Action
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-permitting-action-plan-to-accelerate-and-deliver-infrastructure-projects-on-time-on-task-and-on-budget/) and
    is using its existing authorities, where additional Congressional
    action is not required, to accelerate project approvals to meet our
    infrastructure and clean energy goals while ensuring strong
    environmental protections and robust community engagement.  Some
    examples include:
-   *Transmission: *Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing
    the completion of a new interagency Memorandum of Understanding
    (MOU) to facilitate the timely, responsible, and equitable
    permitting of electric transmission infrastructure.  This will
    accelerate the permitting of transmission lines by directing the
    Department of Energy to use existing authority under the Federal
    Power Act to coordinate onshore transmission planning and permitting
    activities across the federal government. Moreover, it will direct
    Federal agencies to conduct federal permit decisions and
    environmental reviews for transmission lines within two years and
    allow applicants to petition the President directly to issue any
    permit, certification, or opinion if a permitting schedule milestone
    is missed or if an authorization is denied.  This action will
    accelerate the development of transmission lines, building
    on [robust efforts underway across the
    Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/18/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-advances-transmission-buildout-to-deliver-affordable-clean-electricity/) –
    for example, the Department of Energy is advancing tools to
    designate electric transmission corridors.
-   *Renewable Energy on Public Land:* The Administration is on track to
    achieve the goal of permitting at least 25 gigawatts (GW) of
    renewable energy on public lands by 2025, with a [five-agency
    collaboration](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-accelerate-reviews-clean-energy-proposals-public-lands) to
    expedite these reviews.  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has
    permitted more than 130 wind, solar and geothermal projects with a
    combined capacity of 14 GW of power which has the ability to serve
    approximately 4.2 million homes.  BLM has 70 more projects under
    review, which have the potential to result in 32 GW more of clean
    power.
-   *Modernizing and Accelerating Environmental Reviews: *The
    Biden-Harris Administration has clarified and restored [basic
    safeguards](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2022/04/19/ceq-restores-three-key-community-safeguards-during-federal-environmental-reviews/) for
    environmental reviews and
    issued [guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/01/06/biden-harris-administration-releases-new-guidance-to-disclose-climate-impacts-in-environmental-reviews/) to
    agencies on how to account for climate change and greenhouse gas
    emissions, so fewer projects get tangled up in litigation and more
    projects get built right the first time. In fact, environmental
    impact statements under the Biden-Harris Administration are getting
    completed more quickly than they ever did under the previous
    Administration. To further improve the efficiency and effectiveness
    of environmental reviews, the White House Council on Environmental
    Quality will propose additional reforms to accelerate and improve
    environmental reviews, encourage early community engagement, advance
    environmental justice, and improve certainty and transparency for
    all stakeholders.
-   *Offshore Wind: *The Administration has also developed an ambitious
    target for [offshore
    wind](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-to-advance-american-offshore-wind-opportunities/),
    with a goal to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030. The Department of the
    Interior (DOI) approved the nation’s first large-scale offshore wind
    projects, [Vineyard
    Wind](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-first-major-offshore-wind-project-us-waters) and [South
    Fork
    Wind](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-approves-second-major-offshore-wind-project-us-federal-waters),
    both now under construction and being built by union labor. DOI’s
    Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is on track to complete reviews of
    at least 16 project plans by 2025, representing more than 27 GW of
    clean energy, and has proposed reforms
    to [modernize](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-takes-steps-strengthen-offshore-clean-energy-development) this
    process and save $1 billion over 20 years. The National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration
    has [advanced](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/offshore-wind-energy) a
    range of environmental reviews, regulatory authorizations, and
    consultations to ensure protection of coastal and marine resources.
