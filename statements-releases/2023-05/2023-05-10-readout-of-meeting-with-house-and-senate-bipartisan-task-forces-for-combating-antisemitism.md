This morning, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, Domestic Policy Advisor
Ambassador Susan Rice, and Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Liz
Sherwood-Randall met at the Capitol with the Co-Chairs of the House and
Senate Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to countering the rise of
antisemitism in the United States, as part of broader efforts to fight
hate and strengthen our democracy. President Biden established the
Interagency Policy Committee to Counter Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and
Related Forms of Discrimination and Bias, which the Domestic Policy
Council and National Security Council lead. President Biden directed
this group, as its first order of business, to develop a national
strategy to counter antisemitism.  
  
At todayâ€™s meeting, Second Gentleman Emhoff spoke about the urgent need
for such a strategy in light of rising antisemitism in the United
States. Ambassador Rice and Dr. Sherwood-Randall described the ongoing
process of developing the strategy, informed by robust consultation with
a diverse array of stakeholders, and future plans to implement the
strategy. They also discussed the need for a whole-of-society response
to antisemitism focused on increasing awareness and understanding of
antisemitism, protecting Jewish individuals and institutions, reversing
the normalization of antisemitism and violence against Jews, and
building allyship across communities to counter antisemitism and other
forms of hate. Members of Congress provided feedback and insights for
the strategy based on their own efforts to counter antisemitism.
