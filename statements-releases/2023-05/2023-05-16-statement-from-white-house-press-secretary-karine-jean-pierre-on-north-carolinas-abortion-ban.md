title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on North Carolina\u2019\
  s Abortion\_Ban"
---
 
Today, Republican state legislators in North Carolina overturned
Governor Roy Cooper’s veto of a dangerous bill that is out of touch with
the majority of North Carolinians and will make it even more difficult
for women to get the reproductive health care they need.    
  
We’ve already seen the devastating impacts that state abortion bans have
had on the health and lives of Americans living under these draconian
laws. In the more than a dozen states with bans, women have been turned
away from emergency rooms, left with no choice but to travel hundreds of
miles for the care they need, and faced complications that put their
lives and health at risk. Like those laws, the North Carolina ban will
harm patients and threaten doctors for providing essential care.  
  
President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to work
alongside Governor Cooper, state legislators, and Americans who are
fighting to protect access to reproductive health care in the face of
relentless attacks, and will continue to call on Congress to restore the
protections of *Roe* for all people in every state.
