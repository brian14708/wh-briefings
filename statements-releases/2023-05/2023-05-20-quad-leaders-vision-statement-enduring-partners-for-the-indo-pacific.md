***Hiroshima, 20 May 2023***

***Hosted by the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Anthony Albanese
MP***

We – the Leaders of Australia, India, Japan and the United States –
convened to reaffirm our steadfast commitment to work through the Quad
to support a free and open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and
resilient.  
  
Our vision is for a region that is peaceful and prosperous, stable and
secure, and respectful of sovereignty – free from intimidation and
coercion, and where disputes are settled in accordance with
international law. We seek a region in which all countries and peoples
can exercise free choice on how they cooperate and trade based on
partnership, equality and mutual respect. We share the belief that
engaging openly, transparently and constructively creates more
opportunity, greater economic vitality and better understanding of
shared challenges, to the benefit of all.  
  
At a time of fundamental change, challenge, and opportunity in our
region, we are determined to make a positive and lasting contribution to
the resilience and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific by leveraging our
resources and sharing our expertise. Working with countries across the
region and guided by their priorities, we strive to ensure that the
principles that have underpinned peace and stability and stimulated
decades of growth and prosperity continue to apply for decades to come,
including the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.  
  
We will act together as a force for good to find common solutions for
region-wide benefit. Recently, in our response to the devastation caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic, we joined together to expand safe, affordable
and effective vaccine production and equitable access. The
Indo-Pacific’s key challenges of health security, rapidly changing
technology, the grave threat of climate change, and the strategic
challenges facing the region, summon us to act with renewed purpose.  
  
Today, we look to the future and commit to the following principles as
we respond to the challenges ahead:

1.  We are deeply invested in the future prosperity and stability of the
    Indo-Pacific, and are committed to bringing enduring benefit to the
    region by providing options that build resilience, open
    communication and economic growth.
2.  We seek to maintain and strengthen stability in the Indo-Pacific
    where competition is managed responsibly, in accordance with
    international law, including the United Nations Charter, and we will
    work to strengthen and reform the multilateral system to ensure all
    nations, large and small, continue to have a voice. We seek to
    uphold the international order based on the rule of law.
3.  We acknowledge and respect the centrality, agency, and leadership of
    regional institutions, including ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum,
    and the Indian Ocean Rim Association, and will work in and alongside
    them to complement their efforts and advance our shared interests.
4.  We will work transparently and in open dialogue to implement a
    practical agenda that delivers sustained economic and social value,
    is responsive to regional partners, and contributes to global
    priorities by advancing the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for
    Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals,
    noting the transformational power of technology to help meet these
    goals.
