  \ of Papua New\_Guinea"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., spoke today with Prime Minister James
Marape of Papua New Guinea. President Biden, calling from Air Force One,
personally conveyed that he would be unable to travel to Papua New
Guinea to meet with Prime Minister Marape and other Pacific Island Forum
leaders due to the need to return to Washington for meetings with
Congressional leaders to ensure that Congress takes action by the
deadline to avert default.  The President emphasized continued U.S.
commitment to the renewed partnership with the Pacific Islands and
conveyed that Secretary Blinken would represent him at the U.S. –
Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Port Moresby. President Biden also
invited the Prime Minister and other Pacific leaders to Washington, DC
later this year for the second U.S. summit with the Pacific Islands
Forum, where leaders can continue discussions around enhancing
U.S.-Pacific cooperation on shared priorities including combatting the
climate crisis, increasing trade and economic ties, promoting maritime
security, advancing sustainable and inclusive development, and
increasing people-to-people engagement.
