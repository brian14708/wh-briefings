title: "STATE FACT SHEETS: MAGA House Republicans\u2019 Default on America Act Would\
  \ Have Devastating Impacts Across\_America"
---
 
*Extreme bill would cut veterans’ health care, jeopardize public safety,
and raise costs for families—even as House Republicans separately push
for trillions in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations*

Congressional Republicans are holding the nation’s full faith and credit
hostage in an effort to impose devastating cuts that would hurt
veterans, raise costs for hardworking families, and hinder economic
growth. The Default on America Act would cut veterans’ health care,
education, Meals on Wheels, and public safety, take away health care
from millions of Americans, and send manufacturing jobs
overseas. [Outside economists
say](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2023/debt-limit-drama.pdf)
that if enacted, the Default on America Act would “increase the
likelihood” of a recession and result in 780,000 fewer jobs by the end
of 2024. And House Republicans are demanding these cuts while separately
advancing proposals to add over $3 trillion to deficits through tax cuts
and giveaways skewed to the wealthy and big corporations.  
  
The Default on America Act stands in sharp contrast with [President
Biden’s
Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/09/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-reduces-deficits-by-nearly-3-trillion-over-10-years/),
which invests in America, [lowers costs for
families](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/03/09/fact-sheet-president-bidens-budget-lowers-costs-for-families-and-gives-the-american-people-more-breathing-room/),
protects and strengthens Medicare and Social Security, and [reduces the
deficit by nearly $3
trillion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/03/09/fact-sheet-strongthe-presidents-budget-cuts-the-deficit-by-nearly-3-trillion-over-10-years-strong/)
over 10 years, while ensuring no one making less than $400,000 per year
pays a penny more in new taxes.  
  
Today, the White House released 51 fact sheets highlighting the
devastating impacts of the Default on America Act on states and the
District of Columbia. **<u>Nationally, the Default on America Act would
have devastating impacts on the American people. It would:</u>**  
***  
Jeopardize Transportation Safety and Infrastructure***

-   **Cut Nearly 7,500 Rail Safety Inspections.** At a time when train
    derailments are wreaking havoc on community safety, The Default on
    America Act would lead to **nearly 7,500 fewer rail safety
    inspection days** and **over 30,000** fewer miles of track inspected
    annually—enough track to cross the United States nearly 10 times.
    Since the Norfolk Southern train derailment, bipartisan Senators
    have called for more rail inspections, not fewer.  
-   **Jeopardize Air Safety by Shutting Down at Least 375 Air Traffic
    Control Towers.** The Default on America Act would shut down
    services at **375** federally-staffed and contract Air Traffic
    Control Towers across the country—undermining safety at two thirds
    of all U.S. airports—and **increase wait times** at TSA security
    check points by **over 2** hours at large airports across the
    country.    
-   **Withhold Vital Transportation Infrastructure Funding.** Under the
    Default on America Act, the United States would stand to lose nearly
    **$5.2 billion** in funding for transit and highway infrastructure
    projects all across the country.

***Raise Costs for Families***

-   **Eliminate Preschool and Child Care Slots**. The Default on America
    Act would mean 200,000 children lose access to Head Start slots and
    180,000 children lose access to child care—undermining our
    children’s education and making it more difficult for parents to
    join the workforce and contribute to our economy.  
-   **Strip Nutrition Assistance from Women and Children.** The Default
    on America Act would also mean **1.7 million** women, infants, and
    children would lose vital nutrition assistance through the Special
    Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
    (WIC), increasing child poverty and hunger.  
-   **Raise Housing Costs for Americans.** Under the Default on America
    Act, **more than 600,000** families would lose access to rental
    assistance, including older adults, persons with disabilities, and
    families with children, who without rental assistance would be at
    risk of homelessness.

***Harm Seniors, Older People, and Veterans***

-   **Threaten Medical Care for Veterans.** The House Republicans’
    Default on America Act would mean **30 million fewer veteran
    outpatient visits**, and **81,000 jobs lost** across the Veterans
    Health Administration, leaving veterans unable to get appointments
    for care including wellness visits, cancer screenings, mental health
    services, and substance use disorder treatment.  
-   **Worsen Social Security and Medicare Assistance Wait Times for
    Seniors.** Under the House Republicans’ Default on America Act,
    people applying for disability benefits would have to wait **at
    least two months longer** for a decision. With fewer staff
    available, seniors would also be forced to endure longer wait times
    when they call for assistance for both Social Security and Medicare,
    and as many as **240** Social Security field offices could be forced
    to close or shorten the hours they are open to the public.  
-   **Jeopardize Food Assistance for Older Adults.** House Republicans
    are
    [threatening](https://www.cbpp.org/blog/speaker-mccarthys-snap-proposal-would-take-food-away-from-older-adults-for-not-meeting-work)
    food assistance for up to **900,000** older adults with the Default
    on America Act’s harsh new eligibility restrictions in the
    Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  
      
    ***Jeopardize Health Coverage and Access to Car***e

<!-- -->

-   **Jeopardize Health Coverage and Access to Care for Americans.** The
    Default on America Act would put health insurance coverage—and
    health—at risk for 21 million Americans. Only one state has ever
    fully implemented similar policies, and nearly 1 in 4 adults subject
    to the policy lost their health coverage—including working people
    and people with serious health conditions—with no evidence of
    increased employment.  
-   **Deny Americans Access to Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.** The
    Default on America Act would deny access to opioid use disorder
    treatment for more than **28,000** people through the State Opioid
    Response grant program—denying them a potentially life-saving path
    to recovery. 

***Hurt Children and Students and Undermine Education and Job
Training***

-   **Gut Funding for Low-Income Students.** The Default on America Act
    would cut approximately $4 billion in funding for schools serving
    low-income children—equivalent to removing more than **60,000**
    teachers and specialized instructional support personnel from
    classrooms, impacting an estimated **26 million students**.  
-   **Reduce Support for Students with Disabilities.** Under the Default
    on America Act, as many as **7.5 million children** with
    disabilities would face reduced supports—a cut equivalent to
    removing more than **48,000** teachers and related services
    providers from the classroom.  
-   **Slash Mental Health Support for Students.** The Default on America
    Act would limit educators’ abilities to address student mental
    health issues and prevent suicide and drug use by cutting funding
    dedicated to creating healthy learning environments in schools by
    about **$300 million.**  
-   **Eliminate Student Debt Relief.** The Default on America Act would
    eliminate the President’s one-time student debt relief plan, denying
    much needed emergency student loan relief of up to $20,000 for more
    than **40 million Americans** recovering from the effects of the
    pandemic. It would also block the creation of new, more affordable
    student loan repayment plans such as the President’s proposal to cut
    undergraduate loans payments in half.  
-   **Make College More Expensive.** The Default on America Act would
    reduce the maximum award for Pell Grants by nearly $1,000, likely
    eliminating it altogether for **80,000 students** while making it
    harder for the remaining **6.6 million recipients** to attend and
    afford college.  
-   **Cut Off Access to Workforce Development Services.** The Default on
    America Act would result in nearly **700,000 fewer workers**
    receiving job training and employment services provided through the
    Department of Labor’s workforce development funding. These harmful
    cuts would deprive businesses of the skilled workforce they need to
    thrive, and would cut off worker pathways to good jobs.

*This analysis assumes an across-the-board reduction of roughly 22%
compared to currently enacted FY 2023 levels for non-defense
discretionary accounts. That aligns with Congressional Republicans’
Default on America Act, which would return discretionary spending to FY
2022 levels on an ongoing basis while exempting defense spending.*
