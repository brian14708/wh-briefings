with state legislators held in September 2022.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration has made mental health a top priority by
investing unprecedented resources in tackling the mental health crisis,
particularly among our youth. In March 2022, the White House released a
comprehensive [mental health

designed to strengthen system capacity, connect more Americans to care,
and create healthy environments to transform how we address mental
health.  
  
Throughout this Mental Health Awareness Month, the Administration has
announced a series of actions and investments, including more than $95
million in awards across 35 states to increase access to school-based
mental health services and more than $200 million for states,
territories, and tribal organizations to support “988” services and help
respond to crises. These investments are part of billions of dollars the
Administration has committed to expanding access to mental health
services through President Biden’s American Rescue Plan and the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.  
  
During the convening, legislators discussed steps they are taking at the
state level to address the mental health crisis, including improving
access to mental health care in schools and universities, funding and
expanding “988” services, and boosting the mental health workforce.
Senior White House officials thanked the leaders for their efforts and
ongoing partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration to improve
mental health care for all Americans.
