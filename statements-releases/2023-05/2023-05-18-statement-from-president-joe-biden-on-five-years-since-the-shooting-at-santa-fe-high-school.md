title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Five Years Since the Shooting at Santa\
  \ Fe High\_School"
---
 
Five years ago today, the lives of eight young people and two of their
teachers were stolen in one of the deadliest school shootings in
American history. Their families, classmates, and colleagues continue to
live with the trauma and anguish from this devastating attack, and Jill
and I are keeping them especially close in our hearts today.  
  
One of the lasting tragedies of the shooting at Santa Fe High School –
and too many other devastating school shootings – is the refusal by
Congressional Republicans to enact meaningful legislation to stop gun
violence. Guns are the number one killer of kids in America, and it’s
within our power to stop this epidemic. Yet, from Columbine to Newtown
to Parkland to Uvalde to Nashville and so many other shootings in
between, our schools are routinely scenes of gun violence instead of the
safe spaces they should be.  
  
Our kids should be focused on leading the world in math and science –
not learning how to duck and cover.  
  
I am doing everything in my power to maximize the impact of the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and my Administration is taking dozens
of executive actions to reduce gun violence. But there is no substitute
for federal legislation. Congress must act to require safe storage, to
ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to enact universal
background checks, and end immunity from liability for gun
manufacturers. Our kids, educators, school officials – and all Americans
– deserve nothing less.
