title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces 13 New Actions to Reduce Gun Violence\
  \ by Maximizing the Benefits of the Bipartisan Safer Communities\_Act"
---
 
Today, President Biden published an op-ed announcing new actions the
Biden-Harris Administration is taking to implement the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act (BSCA) and maximize the benefits of the law, reducing
gun violence and saving lives. The op-ed also honors the lives of those
killed in Buffalo, New York, one year ago today, and Uvalde, Texas, less
than two weeks later. Because of these tragedies and the courageous
advocacy of the victims’ families and survivors of these shootings and
so many other acts of gun violence, President Biden worked with Congress
to break a 30-year congressional logjam and enact BSCA.  
  
On March 14, 2023, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/14/executive-order-on-reducing-gun-violence-and-making-our-communities-safer/)
directing key members of his Cabinet to each submit to him, within 60
days, a report summarizing their progress toward full implementation of
BSCA. The President also directed his Cabinet to outline steps they are
taking to maximize the benefits of this historic law**.**  
  
These reports make clear that BSCA is saving lives. For example, the
Department of Justice (DOJ) has denied more than 160 firearms
transactions solely because of BSCA’s enhanced background checks for
individuals under age 21. In part due to BSCA’s revised definition of
when an individual is “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms,
DOJ’s prosecutions for unlicensed dealing increased 52% from Fiscal Year
(FY) 2021 to FY 2022. The Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS)
and Education (ED), combined, have already delivered more than $1.5
billion to states and communities to make our schools safer, improve
access to mental health services, and help young people deal with the
trauma and grief resulting from gun violence. With this funding, schools
are projected to hire an additional 14,000 mental health professionals
over the next five years.  
  
Today, the President is detailing 13 actions his Cabinet has taken or
will take to maximize the benefits of the legislation, including new
steps to keep guns out of dangerous hands, ensure BSCA’s mental health
funding helps those dealing with the grief and trauma resulting from gun
violence, make our schools safer, and expand community violence
interventions.  
  
Highlights of these reports are described below.  
  
**New Actions to Reduce Gun Violence by Maximizing the Benefits of
BSCA**  
  
President Biden is announcing the following 13 actions his
Administration has taken or will soon take to maximize the benefits of
the law:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Keeping guns out of dangerous
hands</span>

-   The White House, in partnership with DOJ, will convene state and
    local law enforcement leaders to solicit their collaboration on BSCA
    implementation priorities, such as: 1) increasing state and local
    law enforcement agencies’ response rates to enhanced background
    check inquiries when someone under age 21 tries to purchase a gun;
    and 2) ensuring that arrest and adjudication records include
    additional documentation of dating relationships to keep more guns
    out of the hands of domestic abusers.
-   The White House, in partnership with DOJ, will convene state
    legislators and governors’ offices, urging them to enact laws
    allowing the federal background check system to access all records
    that could prohibit someone under age 21 from purchasing a firearm.
-   DOJ is working with state and territory governments and local law
    enforcement agencies to increase their response rates to the federal
    background check system inquiries when someone under age 21 tries to
    purchase a gun. DOJ has held 18 webinars to date, attended by more
    than 500 law enforcement agencies, and has nine more planned.
-   DOJ is training federal law enforcement and educating state and
    local law enforcement and prosecutors on the need for additional
    documentation of dating relationships in domestic abuse cases in
    order to implement BSCA’s provision that narrowed the “boyfriend
    loophole,” helping to keep guns out of the hands of domestic
    abusers.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensuring BSCA’s mental health
funding helps those dealing with the grief and trauma resulting from gun
violence</span>

-   The Secretaries of HHS and ED will urge governors to use BSCA and
    Medicaid’s funding to help schools address the trauma and mental
    health challenges resulting from gun violence.
-   HHS will educate health and social service providers, community
    leaders, and other individuals on the effects that gun violence
    trauma can have on communities.
-   HHS will clarify how early childhood providers can use BSCA funding
    to address mental health and gun violence trauma.
-   HHS will highlight stories of how communities are effectively using
    BSCA’s mental health funding to help those impacted by gun violence,
    in order to encourage other communities to adopt those strategies
    and effectively use BSCA’s resources.
-   HHS will meet with trauma program grantees and select community
    members and providers to gather community-level data pertaining to
    the link between exposure to gun violence and trauma. Lessons
    learned will inform HHS’ future program development, and a report
    HHS will make available to other communities.
-   As part of the school-based services Technical Assistance Center
    established under BSCA, HHS and ED will jointly develop resources
    for states and schools regarding how schools can use Medicaid to
    fund school-based health services to help students dealing with the
    physical and emotional impacts of gun violence.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Making schools safer</span>

-   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will launch a dedicated
    public campaign to bring greater awareness to SchoolSafety.gov and
    its available resources and evidence-based practices. The campaign
    will be geared towards K-12 leaders, school administrators,
    teachers, school personnel, and parents and legal guardians.
-   ED has taken several steps to help states and school districts make
    effective use of BSCA’s $1 billion Stronger Connections Grant
    Program to improve school safety. For example, ED hosted a
    [four-part webinar
    series](https://oese.ed.gov/bipartisan-safer-communities-act/) that
    highlighted evidence-based practices for supporting student safety
    and well-being and published extensive [Frequently Asked
    Questions](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2023/04/23-0083.BSCA-FAQs.pdf)
    to help states and school districts understand how they can
    effectively use this funding to ensure all schools are safe and
    welcoming to all students.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Expanding community violence
interventions</span>

-   To help communities maximize the benefits of BSCA’s community
    violence intervention funding, DOJ hosted a five-part [webinar
    series](https://www.ojp.gov/program/cvipi#webinar-series) to help
    local leaders use evidence-informed strategies to reduce violence.

**Highlights of Progress Made to Implement BSCA**  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Keeping guns out of dangerous
hands</span>

-   DOJ has invested resources to investigate and prosecute violations
    of BSCA’s new provisions related to firearms trafficking and straw
    purchasing (purchasing a firearm for another person who is
    prohibited from buying the gun). DOJ is coordinating with non-DOJ
    federal law enforcement agencies to identify criminal investigations
    eligible for application of these criminal authorities. As a result,
    DOJ has already charged more than 60 defendants for violating these
    provisions and seized hundreds of firearms in connection with those
    cases. For example:

        ](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdok/pr/federal-prosecutors-aggressively-pursuing-those-who-lie-connection-firearm-transactions)
-   In part due to BSCA’s revised definition of who is “engaged in the
    business” of dealing in firearms, DOJ’s prosecutions for unlicensed
    dealing increased 52% from FY 2021 to FY 2022. DOJ is on track to
    maintain this elevated level in FY 2023.
-   DOJ has implemented BSCA’s enhanced firearms background checks for
    individuals under the age of 21 in all 43 jurisdictions where the
    federal government processes background checks. Since November 2022,
    DOJ has conducted more than 89,000 of these checks and denied more
    than 160 firearms transactions solely because of BSCA. Out of the 13
    states that process their own background checks, 10 states have
    fully implemented the enhanced background checks. DOJ is providing
    technical assistance in the remaining three states.
-   DOJ
    [awarded](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-over-200-million-investments-state-crisis-intervention)
    over $230 million for state crisis intervention programs, including
    extreme risk protection orders (also known as red flag laws), to
    temporarily keep guns out of the hands of those who are a danger to
    themselves or others. This funding is supporting communities in 49
    states, territories, and the District of Columbia.
-   The federal gun background check system (the National Instant
    Criminal Background Check System) implemented BSCA’s updated
    definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, which now
    includes qualifying dating relationships to keep more guns out of
    the hands of domestic abusers.
-   DOJ has provided multiple trainings for federal prosecutors and
    federal law-enforcement agents on a number of BSCA’s provisions,
    including the updated definition of “engaged in the business,” the
    new straw purchasing and firearms trafficking provisions, and the
    expanded definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to
    include abusive dating partners.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Improving school safety</span>

-   DOJ
    [awarded](https://www.ojp.gov/news/news-release/doj-awards-almost-190-million-grants-support-school-safety)
    almost $60 million in BSCA grants to support school safety. This
    funding will help institute safety measures in and around schools,
    support school violence prevention efforts, provide training to
    school personnel and students, implement evidence-based threat
    assessments, and fund research and evaluation on the causes and
    consequences of school violence.
-   ED awarded states nearly $1 billion from BSCA’s Stronger Connections
    grant program to support schools in providing students with safer
    and healthier learning environments and support students’ social,
    emotional, physical, and mental well-being. Per BSCA, states are
    tasked with developing competitions for high-need school districts
    to apply for funding, which they may use for purposes such as
    expanding school-based mental health services, addressing the
    physical security of schools, providing safety and violence
    prevention programs, and creating and implementing emergency
    operating plans. States are in the process of awarding these grants
    now.
-   ED
    [awarded](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2022/10/21st-CCLC-BSCA-Memo.pdf)
    BSCA’s $50 million in funding for out-of-school time programs to use
    to increase attendance and engagement of students in the middle and
    high school grades.
