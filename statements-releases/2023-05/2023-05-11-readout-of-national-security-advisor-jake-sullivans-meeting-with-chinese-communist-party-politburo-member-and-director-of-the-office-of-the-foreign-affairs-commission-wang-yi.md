National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met from May 10-11 with Chinese
Communist Party Politburo Member and Director of the Office of the
Foreign Affairs Commission Wang Yi in Vienna.  The two sides had candid,
substantive, and constructive discussions on key issues in the
U.S.-China bilateral relationship, global and regional security issues,
Russia’s war against Ukraine, and cross-Strait issues, among other
topics.  This meeting was part of ongoing efforts to maintain open lines
of communication and responsibly manage competition.  The two sides
agreed to maintain this important strategic channel of communication to
advance these objectives, building on the engagement between President
Biden and President Xi in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022.
