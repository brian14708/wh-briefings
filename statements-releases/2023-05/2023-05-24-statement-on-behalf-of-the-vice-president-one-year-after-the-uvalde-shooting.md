Nevaeh. Jacklyn. Makenna. Jose. Eliahna. Uziyah. Amerie Jo. Xavier.
Jayce. Tess. Maranda. Alithia. Annabell. Maite. Alexandria. Layla.
Jailah. Eliahna. Rojelio. And their teachers, Irma Garcia and Eva
Mireles.  
   
Nineteen children and two educators who should be here with us today.
They should still have birthdays to celebrate, graduations to plan,
careers and lives to look forward to. Instead, one year ago today, they
were killed in their elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, in a mass
shooting carried out with a weapon of war.  
   
Today, our nation continues to mourn for those lost, to pray for their
families who must bear the unbearable, and to grieve for a country in
which violence like this – even in elementary school classrooms – is
sickeningly common. One year after Uvalde, gun violence remains the
leading cause of death for children in our nation. One in five Americans
has lost a family member to gun violence.  
   
Over the past year, so many Uvalde families have channeled their anguish
into advocacy. Together, they demand that we act to save lives. With
their help, President Biden signed the most significant gun safety
legislation in 30 years and implemented important executive actions in
the months since. But more must be done.  
   
Today, Doug and I pray for the people of Uvalde. And we urge leaders in
Congress and in state legislatures to meet this heartbreaking moment not
just with words, but with action.
