President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., met today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to supporting the
people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and democracy against
Russia’s invasion. President Biden underscored U.S. readiness to
continue delivering security assistance to meet Ukraine’s immediate
battlefield needs, including today’s announcement of an additional $375
million in ammunition and equipment, as well as to build Ukraine’s long
term capacity to defend against and deter Russian aggression. To that
end, the leaders discussed U.S. support for a joint effort, with our
allies and partners, to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth-generation
fighter aircraft, like the F-16. They also discussed ongoing efforts to
further strengthen Ukraine’s air defenses as Russia continues its
missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities. In addition, President
Biden underscored the support of the United States and other G7 nations
for Ukraine’s reconstruction, including efforts to rebuild its energy
infrastructure, and Ukraine’s implementation of reforms needed to fulfil
its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. President Biden also welcomed President
Zelenskyy’s commitment to a just peace based on fundamental principles
enshrined in the United Nations Charter.
