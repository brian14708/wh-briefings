Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Nassau, The Bahamas on June
8 to meet with Caribbean leaders. The U.S.-Caribbean Leaders Meeting
will be co-hosted by the Vice President and Prime Minister Philip Davis
of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas, current chair of the Caribbean
Community. This meeting builds on the Vice President’s previous meetings
with Caribbean leaders in April 2022, at the June 2022 Summit of the
Americas in Los Angeles, and in September 2022. The Vice President’s
trip delivers on the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to advance
cooperation with the Caribbean in pursuit of shared prosperity and
security, and in recognition of the common bonds and interests between
our nations. The U.S.-Caribbean Leaders Meeting will address a range of
regional issues. In particular, the Vice President and Caribbean leaders
will continue discussions on shared efforts to address the climate
crisis, including by promoting climate resilience and adaptation in the
Caribbean region and by increasing energy security through clean energy.
This builds on the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate
Crisis 2030, launched by the Vice President and Caribbean leaders in Los
Angeles at the Summit of the Americas. The Vice President is traveling
to The Bahamas during Caribbean-American Heritage Month and will
celebrate the longstanding people-to-people ties between the Caribbean
and the United States.
