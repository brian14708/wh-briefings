title: "President\_Biden Announces Nominees to the Federal Reserve Board of\_Governors"
---
 
Today, President Biden announced his nomination of Dr. Philip Jefferson
for Vice Chair and Dr. Adriana Kugler to serve as a Member on the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. President Biden also
announced that he will renominate Dr. Lisa Cook for an additional full
term as a Member.  
  
*Statement from President Biden:*  
  
Since I took office, the economy has created nearly 13 million jobs,
giving millions more families the dignity that a paycheck provides.
Annual inflation has come down 45 percent since last summer, and is down
10 months in a row while our job market remains strong. The unemployment
rate is 3.4%, the lowest in 50 years. Jobs are up, wages are up, and
inflation is coming down.  
  
Today, I am proud to nominate Dr. Jefferson to serve as Vice Chair of
the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Last year, the Senate confirmed
Dr. Jefferson as a Member of the Board of Governors in a strong,
bipartisan vote of 91-7 and I look forward to his swift confirmation as
Vice Chair of the Board. In addition, I am nominating Dr. Lisa Cook, who
the Senate just confirmed last year, to an additional, full term as
Member of the Board of Governors.  
  
Dr. Jefferson and Dr. Cook will continue to bring valuable insight,
expertise, and continuity to the Fed at a critical time for our economy
and families across the country.   
  
I am also proud to nominate Dr. Adriana Kugler to serve as a member of
the Board of Governors. Dr. Kugler is a highly qualified and respected
economist with deep expertise in labor markets, worker mobility, and
youth employment. She started her career at the Federal Reserve Bank of
San Francisco, served as Chief Economist of the Labor Department, and
was confirmed last year with bipartisan support to serve as U.S.
Executive Director to the World Bank.  
  
These nominees understand that this job is not a partisan one, but one
that plays a critical role in pursuing maximum employment, maintaining
price stability, and supervising many of our nation’s financial
institutions. I am confident these nominees will help build upon the
historically strong economic recovery we have had under my
Administration.  
  
I am grateful to Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown for his
leadership and support in moving these nominations forward quickly.
