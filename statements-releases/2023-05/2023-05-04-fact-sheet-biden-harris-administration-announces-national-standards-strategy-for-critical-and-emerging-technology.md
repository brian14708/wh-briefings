title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces National Standards\
  \ Strategy for Critical and Emerging\_Technology"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration released the United States
Government’s [National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging
Technology
(Strategy)](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/US-Gov-National-Standards-Strategy-2023.pdf),
which will strengthen both the United States’ foundation to safeguard
American consumers’ technology and U.S. leadership and competitiveness
in international standards development.

Standards are the guidelines used to ensure the technology Americans
routinely rely on is universally safe and interoperable. This Strategy
will renew the United States’ rules-based approach to standards
development. It also will emphasize the Federal Government’s support for
international standards for critical and emerging technologies (CETs),
which will help accelerate standards efforts led by the private sector
to facilitate global markets, contribute to interoperability, and
promote U.S. competitiveness and innovation.

The Strategy focuses on four key objectives that will prioritize CET
standards development:

-   **Investment:** Technological contributions that flow from research
    and development are the driving force behind new standards. The
    Strategy will bolster investment in pre-standardization research to
    promote innovation, cutting-edge science, and translational research
    to drive U.S. leadership in international standards development. The
    Administration is also calling on the private sector, universities,
    and research institutions to make long-term investments in standards
    development.
-   **Participation:** Private sector and academic innovation fuels
    effective standards development, which is why it’s imperative that
    the United States to work closely with industry and the research
    community to remain ahead of the curve. The U.S. Government will
    engage with a broad range of private sector, academic, and other key
    stakeholders, including foreign partners, to address gaps and
    bolster U.S. participation in CET standards development activities.
-   **Workforce: **The number of standards organizations has grown
    rapidly over the past decade, particularly with respect to CETs, but
    the U.S. standards workforce has not kept pace. The U.S. Government
    will invest in educating and training stakeholders — including
    academia, industry, small- and medium-sized companies, and members
    of civil society — to more effectively contribute to technical
    standards development.
-   **Integrity and Inclusivity:** It is essential for the United States
    to ensure the standards development process is technically sound,
    independent, and responsive to broadly shared market and societal
    needs. The U.S. Government will harness the support of like-minded
    allies and partners around the world to promote the integrity of the
    international standards system to ensure that international
    standards are established on the basis of technical merit through
    fair processes that will promote broad participation from countries
    across the world and build inclusive growth for all.

***Putting the Strategy into Practice***

The U.S. private sector leads standards activities globally, through
standard development organizations (SDOs), to respond to market demand,
with substantial contributions from the U.S. Government, academia, and
civil society groups. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
coordinates the U.S. private sector standards activities, while the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) coordinates
Federal Government engagement in standards activities. Industry
associations, consortia, and other private sector groups work together
within this system to develop standards to solve specific challenges. To
date, this approach has fostered an effective and innovative standards
system that has supercharged economic growth and worked for people of
all nations.

The[ CHIPS and Science Act of
2022](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/) (Pub.
L. 117–167) provided $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research,
development, manufacturing, and workforce development. The legislation
also codifies NIST’s role in leading information exchange and
coordination among Federal agencies and communication from the Federal
Government to the U.S. private sector. This engagement, coupled with the
CHIPS and Science Act’s investments in pre-standardization research,
will drive U.S. influence and leadership in international standards
development. [NIST provides a portal with resources and standards
information to government](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/usg-nss),
academia, and the public; updates on the U.S. Government’s
implementation efforts for the Strategy will also be posted to that
portal.

The United States Government has already made significant commitments to
leading and coordinating international efforts outlined in the Strategy.
 The United States has joined like-minded partners in the International
Standards Cooperation Network, which serves as a mechanism to connect
government stakeholders with international counterparts for
inter-governmental cooperation.  Additionally, the U.S.-EU Trade and
Technology Council launched a Strategic Standardization Information
mechanism to enable transatlantic information sharing.   
  
Many U.S. Government agencies have already demonstrated their commitment
to the Strategy through their actions and partnerships. Examples
include: 

-   The National Science Foundation has updated its proposal and award
    policies and procedures to incentivize participation in standards
    development activities. 
-   The Department of State, NIST, the Department of Commerce, the
    Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National Security
    Agency (NSA), the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, USAID and
    other agencies engage in multilateral fora, such as the
    International Telecommunication Union, the Quad, the U.S.-EU Trade
    and Technology Council, the G7, and the Asia-Pacific Economic
    Cooperation, to share information on standards and CETs.
-   The National Telecommunications and Information Administration
    (NTIA) administers the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund,
    a $1.5 billion grant program funded by the CHIPS and Science Act of
    2022 that aims to catalyze the research, development, and adoption
    of open, interoperable, and standards-based networks. 
-   The Department of Defense engages with ANSI and the private sector
    in collaborative standards activities such as Global Supply Chain
    Security for Microelectronics and the Additive Manufacturing
    Standards Roadmap, as well as with the Alliance for
    Telecommunications Industry Solutions and the 3rd Generation
    Partnership Project (3GPP).
-   The United States Agency for International Development and ANSI work
    together through a public-private partnership to support the
    capacity of developing countries in areas of standards development,
    conformity assessment, and private sector engagement.
-   The Environmental Protection Agency [SmartWay
    program](https://www.epa.gov/vcs/using-international-standards-assess-greenhouse-gases-transportation) works
    closely with the International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO) to standardize greenhouse gas accounting for freight and
    passenger transportation, providing a global framework for credible,
    accurate calculation and evaluation of transportation-related
    climate pollutants.
-   NTIA, NIST, and the FCC coordinate U.S. Government participation in
    3GPP and work with the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry
    Solutions to ensure participation by international standards
    delegates at North American-hosted 3GPP meetings.
-   The FCC’s newly established Office of International Affairs is
    managing efforts across the FCC to ensure expert participation in
    international standards activities, such as 3GPP and the Internet
    Engineering Task Force, in order to promote U.S. leadership in 5G
    and other next-generation technologies.
-   The Department of Transportation supports development of voluntary
    consensus technical standards via multiple cooperative efforts with
    U.S.-domiciled and international SDOs.
-   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), though partnerships with the
    private sector and the contributions of technical experts at DOE and
    its 17 National Laboratories, contributes to standards efforts in
    multiple areas ranging from hydrogen and energy storage to
    biotechnology and high-performance computing.
-   The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Financial Research leads
    and contributes to financial data standards development work for
    digital identity, digital assets, and distributed ledger technology
    in ISO and ANSI.

The actions laid out in the Strategy align with principles set forth in
the [National Security
Strategy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf), [the
National Cybersecurity
Strategy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf),
and ANSI’s [United States Standards
Strategy](https://share.ansi.org/Shared%20Documents/Standards%20Activities/NSSC/USSS-2020/USSS-2020-Edition.pdf),
and will not only protect the integrity of standards development, but
will ensure the long-term success of the United States’ innovation.
