title: "Statement from Vice President Harris After Meeting with CEOs on Advancing\
  \ Responsible Artificial Intelligence\_Innovation"
---
 
Advances in technology have always presented opportunities and risks,
and generative AI is no different. AI is one of today’s most powerful
technologies, with the potential to improve people’s lives and tackle
some of society’s biggest challenges. At the same time, AI has the
potential to dramatically increase threats to safety and security,
infringe civil rights and privacy, and erode public trust and faith in
democracy.  
   
Throughout my career I have focused on protecting consumers from the
risks associated with technology. As Attorney General for the State of
California, I worked to protect seniors from online scammers, women and
girls from online harassment, and consumers from privacy breaches,
including by establishing a Privacy Enforcement and Protection Unit
within the California Department of Justice.  
   
As a United States Senator and member of the Intelligence and Judiciary
Committees, we investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election
and produced empirical evidence that state actors will use technology to
undermine democracy.  
   
Through this work, it was evident that advances in technology, including
the challenges posed by AI are complex. Government, private companies,
and others in society must tackle these challenges together. President
Biden and I are committed to doing our part – including by advancing
potential new regulations and supporting new legislation – so that
everyone can safely benefit from technological innovations.  
   
As I shared today with CEOs of companies at the forefront of American AI
innovation, the private sector has an ethical, moral, and legal
responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their products. And
every company must comply with existing laws to protect the American
people. I look forward to the follow through and follow up in the weeks
to come.
