*President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda is Lowering Energy Costs,
Improving Housing Quality for Hard-Working Families, and Reducing
Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Americans*

President Biden is focused on building a clean energy economy from the
bottom up and middle out that helps hard-working families save money,
protects public health, creates good-paying jobs and tackles the climate
crisis. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions
from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as part of
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to incorporate climate
risk and mitigation into federally-supported housing. These steps will
help American families save money on energy costs and keep their homes
warm in the winter and cool in the summer, especially as communities
across the country cope with climate-fueled extreme temperatures and
volatile weather. These actions will also help tackle the climate crisis
by lowering pollution from buildings. These steps will provide
additional support for low- and moderate-income families, and complement
tax credits that families and building owners can use under the
Inflation Reduction Act to install energy-saving equipment and to make
building upgrades. Today’s announcements make progress toward President
Biden’s goal to retrofit four million buildings and two million homes
during his first term.

**<u>PROTECTING FAMILIES, LOWERING ENERGY COSTS</u>**

-   President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act is bringing cost savings
    and health benefits of clean energy to hard-working families. Today,
    the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is releasing a
    more than [$830 million funding notice for the Inflation Reduction
    Act’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) and $4 billion in
    loan commitment authority for this new
    program.](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_093)
    The bill also included $42.5 million for a new HUD initiative
    launching later this summer to collect and assess energy and water
    usage data from assisted multifamily housing properties. The GRRP is
    the largest HUD program to date that directly invests in energy
    efficiency and emissions reductions, clean energy, and climate
    resilience strategies across HUD-assisted multifamily housing. The
    GRRP is an important program for preserving quality housing in our
    communities, increasing resiliency to climate impacts, cutting
    energy waste, tackling the climate crisis, and lowering costs for
    families.

**<u>MAKING HOMES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT, SAVING FAMILIES MONEY</u>**

-   [HUD, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the United
    States Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposes to adopt the latest
    energy codes to improve the performance and efficiency of new homes,
    and help homeowners and renters save
    money.](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/environment_energy/mes_notice)
    HUD estimates that hard-working families will save over 35% on
    energy costs by building homes using the latest energy codes.
    Through these actions, the Biden-Harris Administration will give
    communities the tools to build and retrofit safe, resilient,
    healthy, and efficient buildings that are powered by clean energy
    and constructed with low-carbon materials.  Energy efficiency,
    electrification, and clean energy will make energy costs a smaller
    fraction of household expenses, insulating hard-working families and
    underserved communities’ volatile energy prices. This builds
    on [President Biden’s National Initiative to Advance Building
    Codes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-initiative-to-modernize-building-codes-improve-climate-resilience-and-reduce-energy-costs/),
    which supports modern building codes and standards that save lives,
    reduce property damage, and cut utility bills.
-   **Reducing the embodied carbon in building materials.** In support
    of the [Federal Buy Clean
    Initiative](https://www.sustainability.gov/buyclean/), HUD will now
    prioritize the use of building materials with lower embodied carbon
    for retrofits and new construction. These efforts will help scale up
    demand for American-made building materials that have less climate
    impact associated with mining, manufacturing, and transportation.

**<u>MAKING SOLAR MORE AFFORDABLE</u>**

-   **Connecting families to low-cost solar power**.  Building upon the
    national guidance last summer, HUD is helping families to subscribe
    to local community solar where available. With [new
    guidance](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Housing/documents/MF_Memo_re_Community_Solar_Credits_in_MM_Buildings.pdf)
    for how residents of master-metered HUD-assisted housing can benefit
    from solar, HUD will continue to set the stage for 4.5 million
    families to reap the benefits of community solar which, on average,
    can save families 10% per year on their electric bills. This
    announcement builds on Vice President’s recent trip to Dalton,
    Georgia, where she [unveiled the largest community solar project in
    history](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/06/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-investing-in-america/).

**<u>SAVING FAMILIES MONEY ON ENERGY COSTS AND EXPANDING HOUSING FOR
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS</u>**

-   **Tracking multi-family housing energy usage to save families
    money. ** Under this effort, HUD is now using benchmarking to track
    energy and water performance in multifamily buildings in an effort
    to help reduce the overall energy and emissions use of buildings.
    These efforts will help save multi-family housing residents money,
    by identifying and mitigating energy and water waste.  
     
-   **Lowering lending costs for senior housing. **FHA’s Green Mortgage
    Insurance Premium (MIP) program, which has supported the
    construction of nearly 14,000 homes, is expanding to residential
    care facilities, cutting energy costs and providing more funding for
    new and renovated assisted living and memory care facilities.

**<u>PROTECTING FAMILIES AGAINST FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS</u>**

-   **Supporting underserved communities and protecting them against
    climate and disaster risks.** HUD’s Office of Field and Policy
    Management (FPM) is using a new risk and equity assessment tool to
    assist communities in developing plans to mitigate climate and
    disaster risk while supporting underserved communities through a
    series of stakeholder convenings of FY 2023 Climate Communities
    cohorts. This announcement builds on the announcement of HUD’s new
    Office of Disaster Management (ODM) and Office of Disaster Recovery
    (ODR) and the allocation of $3.3 billion in Community Development
    Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds and Community
    Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) and Mitigation
    (CDBG-MIT). 
-   **Predicting climate impacts for residents and building owners.** To
    protect owners in the face of a rapidly changing climate, FHA has
    updated its Environmental Assessment to include reasonably
    foreseeable climate impacts over the life of the mortgage and
    suggested mitigation measures that would be prudent to implement at
    the construction stage. This effort builds on HUD’s recent Policy
    Development and Research Disaster Recovery Tool Kit “Designing for
    Natural Hazards: A Resilience guide for Builders and Developers,”
    which was provided to building and developers seeking to incorporate
    climate resilience in housing.

**<u>ACCELERATING NET ZERO RETROFITS</u>**

-   [Yesterday, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) issued
    its biggest funding announcement to date to support net zero
    retrofits of federal buildings, saving taxpayers’
    dollars.](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsas-energy-retrofit-program-issues-largest-ever-call-to-accelerate-progress-toward-net-zero-buildings-through-president-bidens-investing-in-america-agenda-05102023)
    These retrofits advance the GSA’s efforts to achieve President
    Biden’s [goal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/08/executive-order-on-catalyzing-clean-energy-industries-and-jobs-through-federal-sustainability/) of
    net-zero emissions in the federal buildings portfolio by 2045 and
    his campaign commitment to building retrofits. IRA funding will
    enable hundreds of millions in energy savings and cost-saving
    retrofits at 42 federally-owned facilities through the GSA’s
    National Deep Energy Retrofit Program.  
     
-   Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released
    new details about the design of the [$27 billion Greenhouse Gas
    Reduction Fund
    (GGRF)](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-framework-implementation-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-part-president),
    a first-of-its-kind, national-scale competitive grant program
    created by the President’s Inflation Reduction Act. The GGRF will
    catalyze investment in thousands of clean energy projects, including
    building retrofits, expand the capacity of community lenders to
    drive local economic growth, and deploy cost-saving solar energy on
    rooftops and in communities across the country, especially in
    low-income and disadvantaged communities and places that have
    historically shouldered the burden of harmful pollution.

These actions further the [President’s Executive Order, *Revitalizing
Our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for
All*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/21/executive-order-on-revitalizing-our-nations-commitment-to-environmental-justice-for-all/). 
Reducing energy burden, cutting emissions, and improving climate
resilience is crucial to communities that face disproportionate climate
risks, such as flooding, fire and extreme temperature. The national
average energy burden for low-income households is three times higher
than for non-low-income households.

Today’s announcements were made following last week’s [convening at the
White House with 24 states to highlight their efforts on commercial and
residential building decarbonization policies and
programs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/05/readout-of-white-house-convening-on-advancing-clean-buildings/) that
lower utility bills, improve climate resilience, and reduce emissions.
