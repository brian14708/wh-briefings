---
 
Eight Americans — including children — were killed yesterday in the
latest act of gun violence to devastate our nation. Jill and I are
praying for their families and for others critically injured, and we are
grateful to the first responders who acted quickly and courageously to
save lives.   
  
Federal, state, and local law enforcement are working closely together
to investigate this attack and I have directed federal agencies to
provide all needed support.  
  
Yesterday, an assailant in tactical gear armed with an AR-15 style
assault weapon gunned down innocent people in a shopping mall, and not
for the first time. Such an attack is too shocking to be so familiar.
And yet, American communities have suffered roughly 200 mass shootings
already this year, according to leading counts. More than 14,000 of our
fellow citizens have lost their lives, credible estimates show. The
leading cause of death for American kids is gun violence.  
  
Since I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law and took
two dozen executive actions to stem the tide of gun violence, we have
made some progress. States are banning assault weapons, expanding red
flag laws and more — but it’s not enough. We need more action, faster to
save lives.  
  
Too many families have empty chairs at their dinner tables. Republican
Members of Congress cannot continue to meet this epidemic with a shrug.
Tweeted thoughts and prayers are not enough.  
  
Once again I ask Congress to send me a bill banning assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines. Enacting universal background checks. Requiring
safe storage. Ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it
immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe.
