  \ Continued COVID-\u206019 Protections and Surge Preparedness After Public Health\
  \ Emergency\_Transition"
---
 
Over the last two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has made
tremendous progress in our ability to manage COVID-19 so that it no
longer meaningfully disrupts the way we live our lives. As the COVID-19
Public Health Emergency (PHE) ends on May 11, 2023, the Administration
has taken significant steps to ensure all individuals have continued
access to lifesaving protections such as vaccines, treatments and tests,
and that the nation is well prepared to manage the risks of COVID-19
going forward.

The Administration’s COVID-19 strategy during the PHE relied on
effectively and equitably implementing the largest adult vaccination
program in U.S. history. Beyond vaccines, the Administration has
facilitated the availability of and access to widespread testing and
treatments, which enabled families to protect themselves, slow the
spread of the virus, and ensure that infections, when they occur, are
relatively mild. After the COVID-19 PHE ends, access to COVID-19
vaccinations and certain treatments, such as Paxlovid and Lagevrio, will
generally not be affected.

Our efforts have not been limited to the United States alone. The U. S.
government (USG) has been the largest single donor of vaccines, having
shared nearly 700 million doses with 117 countries as of March 2023. The
wide availability of vaccinations, tests and treatments – and programs
that provide equitable access to these countermeasures – has put the
nation and the world in a strong position as we transition out of the
emergency phase of our COVID-19 response.

Building on the key investments and infrastructure created over the past
two years, the Administration has put various policies and programs in
place that will remain after the end of the PHE:

-   ***Access to COVID-19 vaccines provided by the Federal government
    will not be affected in the months to come. After the transition to
    the traditional health care market, the*** ***HHS*** [***Bridge
    Access Program for COVID-19 Vaccines and
    Treatments***](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/04/18/fact-sheet-hhs-announces-hhs-bridge-access-program-covid-19-vaccines-treatments-maintain-access-covid-19-care-uninsured.html)
    ***will provide broad access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments for
    uninsured Americans, which has been a critical component of the
    COVID-19 response.*** Since January 2021, the Biden-Harris
    Administration has effectively implemented the largest adult
    vaccination program in U.S. history, with nearly700 million doses of
    COVID-19 vaccines given to over 270 million Americans. The
    Administration’s therapeutics program has also administered over 15
    million courses of COVID-19 treatments, including over 10 million
    courses of free oral antivirals, at over 40,000 locations across the
    nation, providing more of the oral antiviral Paxlovid than all other
    nations combined. The HHS Bridge Access Program for COVID-19
    Vaccines and Treatments will continue to provide access to these
    critical countermeasures for the uninsured through 2024.

-   ***COVID-19 tests remain accessible and available for all Americans
    at COVIDTests.gov until the end of May 2023, and USG will continue
    to provide access for the uninsured through the*** [***Increasing
    Community Access To Testing
    Program***](https://www.cdc.gov/icatt/index.html) ***(ICATT)**.***
    Over the past two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has
    distributed over 1.2 billion free COVID-19 tests, including over 140
    million tests provided to K-12 schools and historically black
    colleges and universities (HBCUs), and over 250 million tests sent
    directly to nursing homes to keep seniors safe. The COVIDtests.gov
    program has distributed over 750 million tests directly to over
    two-thirds of American households, 310 million of which went to
    households in high social vulnerability zip codes, further expanding
    other COVID-19 test distribution partnerships with Feeding America
    food banks, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development S202
    Low-income senior housing sites, Health Resources and Services
    Administration community health clinics, and United Way. Thanks to
    strategic investments in the continued procurement of tests and the
    strategic national stockpile (SNS), over 600 million rapid COVID-19
    antigen tests are available to meet demand in the event of future
    surges. Until the end of May 2023, individuals can continue to order
    tests for free from [COVIDTests.gov](https://www.covid.gov/tests).

<!-- -->

-   ***Protections that provide patients with greater access to
    healthcare remain in place.*** The Public Readiness and Emergency
    Preparedness (PREP) Act declaration for medical countermeasures
    against COVID-19 has enabled broad access to medical countermeasures
    by providing flexibilities and protections, including for
    pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to administer vaccines, tests
    and treatments. By [extending certain flexibilities through
    2024](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/04/14/factsheet-hhs-announces-amend-declaration-prep-act-medical-countermeasures-against-covid19.html),
    the Biden-Harris Administration is providing Americans with more
    options for when and where to access COVID-19 vaccines and tests,
    and continuing the Test to Treat programs, which have dramatically
    improved timely access to life-saving treatments by enabling
    patients to get tested, evaluated, and receive treatment in one
    stop.

-   ***Many major*** **** [*telehealth
    flexibilities*](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/what-do-i-need-know-cms-waivers-flexibilities-and-transition-forward-covid-19-public-health.pdf)
    ***will remain in place particularly for those who struggle to find
    access to care and in rural areas.*** The vast majority of current
    Medicare telehealth flexibilities that Americans have come to rely
    upon over the past two years, will remain in place through
    December 2024. And states already have significant flexibility with
    respect to covering and paying for Medicaid services delivered via
    telehealth.

<!-- -->

-   ***The USG will continue to provide Americans with accessible
    information on local COVID-19 risks and will continue to track
    emerging variants and their impact in the U.S. and around the
    world.*** As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
    integrates COVID-19 data collection and reporting into its existing
    structure and programs, data reporting will focus on
    hospitalizations, deaths, and emergency room visits, which provide
    the most reliable data in the next phase of the COVID-19 response.
    CDC will also continue to collect and report wastewater data, and
    will continue to conduct genomic surveillance and report new
    variants in the U. S. The Biden-Harris Administration is also
    continuing its strong support of efforts to enhance global genomic
    surveillance and associated surveillance networks, to rapidly
    identify emerging variants, their spread and impact around the
    world.

<!-- -->

-   ***Project Next Gen will accelerate and streamline the rapid
    development of the next generation of COVID-19 vaccines and
    treatments through public-private collaborations.*** As SARS-CoV-2
    continuously evolves, the Biden-Harris Administration is investing
    $5 billion for the development of new COVID-19 vaccines and
    treatments. The program includes a focus on effective mucosal
    vaccines, such as those delivered through the nose, which could have
    the potential to dramatically reduce infection and transmission (in
    addition to preventing serious illness and death); as well as
    “broader” vaccines which can protect against several different
    coronaviruses; and more durable monoclonal antibodies that are
    resistant to new variants.

<!-- -->

-   ***The USG will continue to invest in efforts to better understand
    and address Long COVID, and support Americans affected by it.*** The
    Biden-Harris Administration has developed a first-ever interagency
    [National Research Action Plan on Long
    COVID](https://www.covid.gov/assets/files/National-Research-Action-Plan-on-Long-COVID-08012022.pdf),
    organizing the federal government’s over 70 research activities on
    Long COVID around a common agenda and accelerating efforts to better
    understand, diagnose, and treat Long COVID. The Administration has
    [invested over $1.1
    billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/05/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-accelerates-whole-of-government-effort-to-prevent-detect-and-treat-long-covid/)
    in Long COVID research, surveillance, and to promote evidence-based
    care models through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
    (AHRQ). The Administration continues its support of Americans
    affected by lingering symptoms from a COVID-19 infection through
    these efforts and by working to make Long COVID services, supports
    and care [as accessible as
    possible](https://www.covid.gov/longcovid).

-   ***Investments on improving indoor air quality (IAQ) will drive
    innovation in ventilation and filtration, building better protection
    against respiratory illness.*** The Biden-Harris Administration has
    secured historic investments in indoor air quality improvements,
    including $350 billion for state and local governments as well as
    $122 billion for schools in American Rescue Plan funding, and
    established the federal buildings portfolio as an exemplar of
    innovation. The Administration will continue to [lead by
    example](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/12/08/fact-sheet-departments-and-agencies-commit-to-cleaner-indoor-air-across-the-nation/),
    working with industry partners on science-based guidance on how to
    improve indoor air quality in schools, workplaces, residential
    buildings, and healthcare facilities, and implementing a long-term
    research roadmap that coordinates Federal airborne infection
    research.
