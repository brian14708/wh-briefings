President Biden looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Mette
Frederiksen of Denmark to the White House on Monday, June 5 to further
strengthen the deep and enduring ties between the United States and
Denmark.  The two leaders will review our efforts as NATO Allies and
close partners to strengthen transatlantic security and bolster economic
prosperity.  They will discuss our unwavering support for Ukraine in the
face of Russia’s brutal war of aggression.  The leaders will coordinate
on a range of issues, including energy security, climate change, and
other global issues.
