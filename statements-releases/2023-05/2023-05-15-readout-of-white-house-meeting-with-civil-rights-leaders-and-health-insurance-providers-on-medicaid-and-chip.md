Last week, White House Director of the Office of Public Engagement and
Senior Advisor to the President Steve Benjamin, Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, and Deputy
Assistant to the President for Health and Veterans Affairs Christen
Linke Young convened a meeting with civil rights leaders and health
insurance providers to discuss the Biden-Harris administration’s ongoing
efforts to lower health care costs and protect access to affordable
health care for all Americans.  
   
During the meeting, Biden-Harris administration officials and key
stakeholders discussed how CMS, states, insurers, and community
stakeholders are working together to ensure people remain connected to
coverage as Medicaid redeterminations resume. They also discussed the
catastrophic impact to Medicaid of adding additional bureaucratic red
tape by imposing work reporting requirements, noting that states that
have tried similar policies have seen nearly 1 in 4 people lose
coverage.   
   
Biden-Harris Administration officials concluded the meeting by with a
commitment to continue working with civil rights leaders and key
stakeholders to protect comprehensive health care coverage for all
Americans.
