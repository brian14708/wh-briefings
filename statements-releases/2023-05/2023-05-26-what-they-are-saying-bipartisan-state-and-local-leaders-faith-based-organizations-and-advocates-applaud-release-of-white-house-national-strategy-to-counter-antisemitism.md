  \ Faith-Based Organizations, and Advocates Applaud Release of White\_House National\
  \ Strategy to Counter\_Antisemitism"
---
 
Yesterday, President Biden announced the first ever [U.S. National
Strategy to Counter
Antisemitism](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=7ef389ed4d&e=ce8fea7c33)
– the most ambitious, comprehensive effort in U.S. history to counter
antisemitism.  
  
The National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism outlines a
whole-of-society approach, organized in four pillars of action that
address key themes and threats raised by over 1,000 diverse stakeholders
across the Jewish community and beyond. The strategy includes over 100
meaningful actions government agencies will take to increase
understanding of antisemitism and its threat to American democracy,
protect Jewish institutions and communities, reverse the normalization
of antisemitism, and build cross-community solidarity. The strategy also
includes over 100 calls-to-action for Congress, state and local
governments, tech companies, and others to counter antisemitism.  
  
In a letter accompanying the strategy, President Biden wrote that,
“Protecting the Jewish community from antisemitism is essential to our
broader fight against all forms of hate, bigotry, and bias—and to our
broader vision of a thriving, inclusive, and diverse democracy.”

*Leaders from across the country are praising the President’s U.S.
National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. Here’s what they are
saying:*  
  
***Members of Congress and State Leaders***  
  
**Co-chair, Senate and House Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating
Antisemitism, Nevada Congresswoman, Jacky Rosen:** “Jewish communities
across our country are experiencing an alarming increase of antisemitic
attacks and incidents. We need a coordinated, whole-of-government
approach to addressing anti-Jewish bigotry, and that’s why I pushed the
Administration to put together a national strategy to counter
antisemitism in all its forms. With this unified strategy, which
includes specific actions for the federal government to undertake, we
are going to effectively utilize the full force of the United States
government to root out antisemitic hate across our nation.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=d0112fb8a4&e=ce8fea7c33),
5/25/23\]  
  
**Co-chair, Senate and House Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating
Antisemitism, Oklahoma Congressman James Lankford:** “I’m glad the Biden
Administration responded to the urging of members of the Senate and
House Bipartisan Taskforces for Combatting Antisemitism and released an
unfortunately, necessary national strategy to counter antisemitism. Any
practical effort by any administration to curb the rising tide of
antisemitism here and abroad can be helpful to address the increase in
antisemitism and ensure we protect the right of all people to freely
live their faith without fear. I am grateful for the partnership of
Senator Rosen, Representative Manning, Representative Smith, and the
officials in the Administration who worked on this strategy. We must
stand united against anti-Jewish statements and violent acts wherever we
see them.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=8a63282cda&e=ce8fea7c33),
5/25/23\]  
  
**Co-chair, Senate and House Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating
Antisemitism, North Carolina Congresswoman Kathy Manning:** “The
alarming rise of antisemitism poses a threat to Jewish communities and
to American values. I welcome the release of the National Strategy to
Counter Antisemitism; it is an important first step in coordinating our
government’s effort to eradicate this particularly pernicious form of
discrimination, I applaud President Biden for his leadership in
developing this whole-of-government approach and I look forward to
continuing to work with the administration and both parties in Congress
to combat antisemitism and protect the Jewish community.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=052b5fcd04&e=ce8fea7c33),
5/25/23\]  
  
**Co-chair, Senate and House Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating
Antisemitism, New Jersey Congressman Chris Smith:** “There are many good
things about the plan—above all I welcome the attention it pays to
community/physical security, to the problems of getting better reporting
and law enforcement responses to antisemitic violence and harassment,
and to Holocaust education. Some of the most vicious and harmful
antisemitism is incitement to violence and hatred of Israel. In 2004,
Natan Sharansky testified at a hearing I chaired that while Israel
should not be above criticism, that antisemitism tries to ‘hide behind
the veneer of legitimate criticism of Israel.’ Sharansky said that
employing the 3D test—demonization, double standards and
delegitimization—is useful in exposing antisemitism. When antisemites
spew their hatred, one of the principal duties of an elected official is
to stand publicly and emphatically with the intended victim.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=896286c0fe&e=ce8fea7c33),
5/25/23\]  
  
**Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer:** “Thank you,
[@POTUS](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=03f6c2a224&e=ce8fea7c33).
Antisemitism, bigotry, and hatred have no place in this country.”

5/25/23\]  
  
**Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, New York Congressman Jerry
Nadler**: “I applaud the White House for developing the first-ever
national strategy to counter antisemitism.  The strategy’s release today
marks a historic milestone in the Biden-Harris administration’s
extraordinary emphasis on combating antisemitism amidst a harrowing
uptick in antisemitic attacks across the country. Of course, the work is
far from over. As Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee and
the most senior Jewish Member of Congress who proudly represents a
district with one of the largest Jewish populations, I look forward to
working alongside the White House to bring to life the priorities
brought forth by this strategy. Antisemitism is not a new presence in
our society, it is a scourge that has plagued Jewish communities around
the world for millennia. Today and every day, I am proud to call
President Biden a partner and friend of the Jewish people in
safeguarding America’s commitment to religious freedom.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=6ef60e9925&e=ce8fea7c33),
5/25/23\]  
  
**New York Congresswoman, Grace Meng**: “I am proud to have actively
contributed to the development of the White House strategy. I not only
submitted several policy recommendations directly to the Domestic Policy
Council, including fully funding my COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and making
hate crimes reporting mandatory, but also engaged the drafting process
through several meetings with the White House in my position as Co-Chair
of the House Bipartisan Taskforce for Combatting Antisemitism.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=1f99035d6b&e=ce8fea7c33),
5/25/23\]  
  
**Florida Congresswoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz:** “As the first
Jewish Congresswoman from Florida, I welcome the Biden Administration’s
release of the first-ever comprehensive U.S. National Strategy to
Counter Antisemitism. To effectively counter the scourge of
antisemitism, which has increased dramatically in recent years, it will
take a whole of society effort, and this strategy lays out the roadmap
to make that a reality. As Co-Chair of the Interparliamentary Task Force
to Combat Online Antisemitism, I am deeply grateful for the
Administration’s focus on combating the spread of hateful content online
and holding social media companies accountable for algorithms that
amplify antisemitism on their platforms. It is fitting that the strategy
is announced during Jewish American Heritage Month, as one of the most
effective tools for countering antisemitism is uplifting Jewish voices
and raising awareness of the contributions of Jewish Americans
throughout our nation’s history. There is more work to do, and I look
forward to working with the Administration, my colleagues in Congress,
and community leaders of all faiths and backgrounds to implement this
strategy and leverage it to counter all forms of hate. \[[Twitter

**Governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro:** “I was sworn in on a Bible

antisemitism in US history. That moment shows that progress is possible
in this country. Grateful for @POTUS’ historic plan to combat
antisemitism and @SecondGentleman’s leadership.”

experiencing antisemitism at levels not seen in generations, we deeply
appreciate that the White House has stepped up and delivered this
significant, comprehensive strategy,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO.

antisemitism on campus, online, and from extremists on both the
far-right and the far-left.”

endorsing the IHRA definition of antisemitism and we are heartened that
the administration continues its support of the IHRA definition.  As the
convening body of Zionist organizations in the United States, we have
increasingly seen that Anti-Zionism is currently one of the most

Biden-Harris Administration’s historic launch of a national strategy to
combat antisemitism and released a new toolkit that was featured in the
Administration’s strategy. The Administration’s announcement of a
whole-of-government approach to curb the rise of antisemitism marks a
turning point in the federal government’s commitment to addressing this
urgent issue. Cross-community efforts, like those critical to Interfaith
Alliance’s mission, were featured as a key pillar of the Administration
strategy.”

**Julia Jassey, CEO and Co-Founder of Jewish on Campus:** “Today’s
release of the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism is historic in
more ways than one. Not only is this the first time that any
administration has created such a plan, but it is also the result of
unprecedented Jewish student engagement. Jewish on Campus’ advocacy led
directly to results that will impact the lives of Jewish students facing
antisemitism across the country. From the first days of this
administration, the door has been open to Jewish on Campus. Key leaders,
from the Second Gentleman to Amb. Deborah Lipstadt, Domestic Policy
Advisor Susan Rice and White House Jewish Liaison Shelley Greenspan,
have repeatedly heard our voices and responded with the actionable steps
that the administration laid out today, including those directly
relating to campus antisemitism. Antisemitism takes on many different
forms…Perhaps above all, today’s announcement is an important validation
of our belief that when Jewish students are heard and their stories
uplifted, positive change happens.”

effort and pray that the National Strategy will help curtail further

President Biden for initiating this important effort and for the
dedication and seriousness that Second Gentleman Emhoff, Amb. Rice, Dr.
Sherwood-Randal, and Administration staffers across the Executive Branch
brought to bear. The resulting ‘whole of government’ approach is,

even more closely in the coming days and working with the Administration

**Rabbi Jill Jacobs, CEO, T’ruah**: “We are also glad to see the
administration recognizes there are multiple definitions of antisemitism
and focuses primarily on actions to counter antisemitism, rather than
focusing on definitions. Definitions alone do not solve the problem of
antisemitism. Codifying the International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance’s definition of antisemitism – or any group’s definition –
would have been a hindrance to protecting free speech and actual efforts
to respond to antisemitic attacks. We are glad the Biden Administration
heard this concern.”

Biden and the Administration for their thorough, all-encompassing effort
to produce a strategy that is inclusive and recognizes the diversity and
plurality of our Jewish communities and the threats they face online, in
their day-to-day lives, and their communal life. The balance between
responses that recognize the distinctive history, characteristics, and
impacts of antisemitism and those that recognize the intersectional
impacts of broader issues of discrimination, hate speech and hate crimes
is particularly encouraging.”

the White House National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism – a strong and
helpful resource in the fight against a growing threat not only to our
Jewish community but to our nation’s democracy overall. White
nationalism, fascism, and other extremist ideologies hold anti-semitic
hatred at their core and this hatred fuels anti-democratic actions and
violence. The White House strategy recognizes this reality…We are
further gratified that although the White House references the IHRA
definition of antisemitism–a definition rejected by Workers Circle – it
is viewed as only one definition among several. As an organization
focused on demanding democracy and fighting fascism, we deeply
appreciate the strong and outspoken Biden-Harris Administration
commitment to fighting antisemitism, bigotry, and other threats to
democracy and look forward to being part of this much-needed effort…”

society…Finally, Agudath Israel expresses its deep personal appreciation

so many, for their vision, commitment, and extraordinarily hard work in
