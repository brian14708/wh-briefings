title: "Readout of the White\_House Council on Native American Affairs Engagement\
  \ Session on the Inflation Reduction\_Act"
---
 
Yesterday, the White House and White House Council on Native American
Affairs (WHCNAA) co-chair and Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland
convened the Council to hear directly from Tribal leaders on the
implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the most
significant piece of clean energy and climate legislation in history
with hundreds of millions of dollars exclusively for Tribal Nations and
Native communities.  
  
Cabinet officials, including Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, discussed
Inflation Reduction Act programs that ensure more Tribal households have
access to affordable and clean electricity; make Native communities more
resilient to the growing threats posed by climate change, including
drought and sea level rise; and support Tribal efforts to transition to
cleaner sources of energy. Senior Advisor to the President for Clean
Energy Innovation and Implementation John Podesta highlighted the
[Inflation Reduction Act Tribal
Guidebook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/),
a resource created by the Biden-Harris Administration to identify
programs and sources of funds specifically allocated for Tribal
communities and outline Tribal eligibility for other Inflation Reduction
Act programs.    
  
This engagement session is part of a series of White House Council on
Native American Affairs engagement sessions with Tribal communities. The
sessions have covered a wide-range of issues on Public Safety and
Justice, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law implementation, Native languages,
and Tribal Homelands Initiatives.
