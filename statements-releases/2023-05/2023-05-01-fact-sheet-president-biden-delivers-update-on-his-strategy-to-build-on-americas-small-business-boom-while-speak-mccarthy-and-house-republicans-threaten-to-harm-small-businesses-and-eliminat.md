*New Report Card and Analysis Released On How the Biden-Harris
Administration Has Ushered in Record New Business Formation*

Today, in honor of National Small Business Week, President Biden is
hosting small business award winners from all 50 states at the White
House to celebrate their contributions to the dynamism and strength of
the U.S. economy, and releasing a [report
card](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Small-Business-Report.pdf)
that highlights the small business boom taking hold as a result of the
President’s small business agenda.  
  
From distributing billions in pandemic assistance, to expanding access
to capital and leveraging billions in federal dollars from the Investing
in America agenda, this new report card lays out how the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken action to support small businesses.
Additionally, the Council of Economic Advisers is releasing a [new
analysis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/01/investing-in-small-businesses/)
that identifies the potential benefits to small businesses from the
hundreds of billions being invested through the President’s Investing in
America agenda.  
  
Americans filed nearly 10.5 million applications to start new businesses
in 2021 and 2022, the two highest years on record for new business
formation. Since President Biden and Vice President Harris took office,
small businesses have created 3.1 million jobs, a near historic level.
At the same time, the Biden-Harris Administration has increased
enforcement against tax evasion by big corporations, and instituted a
corporate minimum tax so that small businesses can fairly compete
against big corporations with complex tax schemes that reduce their tax
burden well below what small businesses pay.  
  
Last week, as part of a reckless attempt to extract concessions as a
condition for the United States simply paying the bills it has already
incurred, House Republicans passed a bill that would put this small
business boom at risk. According to [Moody’s
Analytics](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2023/debt-limit-drama.pdf),
the bill would lead to 780,000 fewer jobs by the end of 2024 and would
meaningfully increase the risk of recession.  
  
**Biden-Harris Investments and Reforms to Support Small Businesses**  
President Biden will host National Small Business Week award winners
from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico at the
White House and announce the following:

-   **A new [Small Business Report
    Card](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Small-Business-Report.pdf)
    demonstrating across-the-board progress**. Released in April 2022,
    the [Biden-Harris Small Business
    Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/President-Biden-Small-Biz-Boom-full-report-2022.04.28.pdf)
    laid out 35 initiatives designed to maintain the nation’s historic
    momentum in fostering new business creation. The report card shows
    significant progress on all 35 initiatives, including delivering
    billions of dollars in loans and support services.  
-   **New Small Business Administration (SBA)
    [guidance](https://www.sba.gov/document/information-notice-5000-846918-community-advantage-small-business-lending-company)
    strengthening more than 100 nonprofit, mission-driven lenders.** The
    Community Advantage Pilot Program allows nonprofit lenders, with a
    proven track record of higher rates of lending to Black, Hispanic,
    women, and veteran-owned businesses, to make SBA-backed loans. A
    permanent license will provide these lenders with long-term
    certainty.  
-   **Applications will open in June 2023 for non-bank lenders applying
    for Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) licenses.** Last month,
    SBA finalized a rule that will allow the agency to issue new SBLC
    licenses for the first time in 40 years. This change will expand
    competition in small business lending and address capital gaps by
    expanding loans to minority and rural small businesses.

**House Republican Proposal Would Harm Small Businesses, Eliminate
Jobs**  
Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans are holding the economy hostage
by refusing to avoid default without slashing billions in funding for
vital programs that support small businesses. Their bill would: 

-   **Slash almost $2 billion from a vital small business initiative,
    reducing needed capital for up to 10,000 small businesses and
    support for 100,000 jobs.** The Republican proposal would claw
    back up to $1.8 billion from Treasury’s State Small
    Business Credit Initiative, particularly harming small business
    loans and equity investments for tribal and other
    underserved entrepreneurs.  
-   **Force cuts to the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other
    federal supports for small business by 22 percent**. This proposal
    would:  
    -   **Exacerbate Access to Capital Gaps. ** The Republican cuts
        would slow loan approvals, impede new lender registration,
        reduce lender oversight, and impede technology updates and
        customer service for small business applicants, forcing small
        businesses to seek more expensive non-SBA capital options.     
    -   **Eliminate free business counseling for 295,000 small
        businesses owners.**  
    -   **Delay certification and training to 15,000 or more small
        business contractors**. Republican cuts would slow training and
        the review of certification applications, denying services to
        15,000 or more businesses annually.  
    -   **Let more pandemic fraudsters escape prosecution.** The plan
        undermines the SBA Office of Inspector General’s ability to
        fight fraud, prosecute criminals, and recoup stolen relief funds
        by rescinding all balances for COVID oversight.  
    -   **Abandon Businesses Recovering from Natural Disasters**. SBA
        would have to reduce its disaster staff by nearly 50 positions,
        hurting SBA’s ability to respond quickly when a disaster strikes
        to ensure access to capital for disaster survivors.
-   **Rescind up to $575 million in support for small businesses
    provided by Community Development Financial Institutions and
    Minority Depository Institutions** through the Emergency Capital
    Investment Program. These funds were designed to help these
    institutions provide support to small businesses in underserved
    communities.

<!-- -->

-   **Slash support for small businesses that export goods and
    services**. The House Republican proposal would reduce support to
    more than 43,000 small businesses served by the International Trade
    Administration, including supporting-first time exporters, resolving
    unfair trade practices, and trade disputes. Small businesses would
    also have less access to State Trade Expansion Program funding
    provided by SBA to state and territory governments to support small
    business export development.  
-   **Reduce support for thousands of rural businesses**.  The
    Republican proposal would cut funding for the U.S. Department of
    Agriculture’s Rural Development Business Programs, resulting in more
    than 2,000 rural businesses—nearly all small businesses—losing
    access to this assistance.
