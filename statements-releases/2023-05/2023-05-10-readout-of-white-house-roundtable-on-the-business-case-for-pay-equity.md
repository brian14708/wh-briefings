title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable on the Business Case for Pay\_Equity"
---
 
Today, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy
Council Jennifer Klein and Assistant to the President, Senior Advisor to
the President, and Director of the Office of Public Engagement Stephen
Benjamin hosted a discussion with Deputy Director of the Office of
Personnel Management Rob Shriver, private sector employers, and equal
pay experts on why pay equity is good for business.

Participants, who included executives from Microsoft, Mastercard, and
Salesforce, discussed policies they have put in place to advance pay
equity at their companies. In addition, pay equity experts from JUST
Capital, EDGE Certified Foundation, and OpenComp discussed the
importance of working with the private sector and companies of all sizes
to advance fair pay practices and strategies. Participants emphasized
that policies and practices that promote pay equity are not just good
for workers—they’re good for businesses’ bottom lines. Policies aimed at
promoting workplace equity, including equal pay, help promote workforce
inclusivity, worker retention, and a culture of transparency and trust
which, in turn, lowers costs related to recruitment, hiring, and
training.

Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment that the
Federal government serve as a model employer, the Office of Personnel
Management announced a proposed rule to advance pay equity for Federal
workers that would prohibit the use of a job applicant’s prior salary
history when making hiring decisions and setting pay for Federal
employees. This newest step to eliminate discriminatory pay practices
addresses an issue that can contribute to and compound wage gaps for
women workers and workers of color.   

Participants agreed that leaders in both the private and public sector
have a part to play in ending discriminatory pay practices that lead to
wage gaps, and committed to partnering together to adopt policies that
are good for workers and good for business. Administration officials
underscored the importance of leading on these issues by example,
thanked the participants for their leadership, and reaffirmed the White
House’s commitment to pay equity.
