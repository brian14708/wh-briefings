Today, as part of Mental Health Awareness Month, Julie Chavez Rodriguez,
Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the White House Office
of Intergovernmental Affairs, and Christen Linke Young, Deputy Assistant
to the President for Health and Veterans Affairs in the White House
Domestic Policy Council, convened representatives from state and local
government for a Forum on Mental Health and Well Being. Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra and senior
White House officials participated in the convening.  
   
Tackling the mental health crisis is a key pillar of President Biden’s
Unity Agenda. The Administration has focused on advancing the
President’s [Mental Health
Strategy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-strategy-to-address-our-national-mental-health-crisis-as-part-of-unity-agenda-in-his-first-state-of-the-union/) across
its three objectives: strengthening system capacity, connecting more
Americans to care, and creating healthy and supportive environments. As
part of that work, the Administration has expanded access to mental
health services, investing billions of dollars through the American
Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and has proposed
tens of billions in further support in his budget request for FY 2024.  
   
During the Forum, Secretary Xavier Becerra laid out the whole-of-society
response to this crisis, including the Department’s launch of 988, the
National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline,
and [FindSupport.gov](http://www.findsupport.gov/), as well as the
expansion of mental health services to support youth in schools and in
communities. Senior White House staff, mayors, county elected leaders,
and representatives also discussed how Medicaid waivers can be leveraged
for comprehensive mental health service provision and how important
investments are being made to grow and diversify the behavioral health
workforce.  
   
Senior White House staff thanked state and local leaders, and the
National Governors Association (NGA), National League of Cities (NLC),
and National Association of Counties (NACo) for their leadership and
affirmed the Administration’s support and partnership in addressing the
mental health crisis.
