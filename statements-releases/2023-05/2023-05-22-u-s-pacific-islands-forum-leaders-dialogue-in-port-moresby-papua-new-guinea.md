---
 
We—the Pacific Islands Forum, represented at this meeting by the
governments of Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New
Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the
Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu,
and the United States of America—meet on the occasion of the
U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Dialogue in Port Moresby, Papua New
Guinea on May 22, 2023.    
  
At the first ever U.S.-Pacific Islands Summit in Washington, D.C. in
September 2022, we announced the Declaration on U.S.-Pacific
Partnership. Today, we reaffirm our shared vision for a resilient
Pacific region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and
prosperity.  
  
We are committed to bolstering Pacific regionalism, with a strong and
united Pacific Islands Forum at its center. We will continue to work
together to tackle shared challenges such as the climate crisis, to
advance inclusive economic growth and social equity for the people of
the Pacific and to jointly advocate on shared priorities.  
  
We reaffirm our commitment to comprehensively address the legacies of
conflict and the promotion of nuclear nonproliferation, and we
acknowledge the nuclear legacy of the Cold War. We remain committed to
addressing the Republic of the Marshall Islands’ ongoing environmental,
public health concerns, and other welfare concerns.  
  
We support the vision of the *2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific
Continent* and recognise its centrality in the strengthening partnership
between the United States and the Pacific Islands Forum. This meeting
builds on three decades of close cooperation between the United States
and the Pacific Islands Forum and we look forward to the Second U.S. –
Pacific Islands Forum Summit in 2023.   
  
Finally and most importantly, we commend and acknowledge the warm
hospitality of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea for hosting
this Dialogue.
