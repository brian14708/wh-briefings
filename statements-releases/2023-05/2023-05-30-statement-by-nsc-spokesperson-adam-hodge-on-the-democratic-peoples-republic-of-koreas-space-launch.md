  \ of Korea\u2019s Space\_Launch"

The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (DPRK) for its launch using ballistic missile technology, which is
a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions, raises
tensions, and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region
and beyond.  This claimed space launch involved technologies that are
directly related to the DPRK intercontinental ballistic missile
program.  The President and his national security team are assessing the
situation in close coordination with our allies and partners.  We urge
all countries to condemn this launch and call on the DPRK to come to the
table for serious negotiations.  The door has not closed on diplomacy
but Pyongyang must immediately cease its provocative actions and instead
choose engagement.  The United States will take all necessary measures
to ensure the security of the American homeland and the defense of our
Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
