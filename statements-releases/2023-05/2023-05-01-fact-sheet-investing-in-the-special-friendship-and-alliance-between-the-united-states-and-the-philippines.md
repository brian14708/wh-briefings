*At the White House, President Biden and President Marcos advanced an
ambitious agenda for the U.S.-Philippines alliance and celebrated the
tremendous momentum now animating bilateral efforts to advance
prosperity, security, and friendship among our peoples.*

Today President Joe Biden welcomes Philippine President Ferdinand R.
Marcos Jr. to the White House. This follows President Biden’s September
2022 meeting with President Marcos in New York, and Vice President
Kamala Harris’s visit to the Philippines in November 2022.  
  
President Biden reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to the
defense of the Philippines, and the leaders discussed efforts to
strengthen the longstanding U.S.-Philippines alliance. The leaders
reviewed opportunities to deepen economic cooperation and promote
inclusive prosperity, expand our nations’ special people-to-people ties,
invest in the clean energy transition and address the climate crisis,
and ensure respect for human rights. The leaders discussed regional
matters and coordinate on efforts to uphold international law and
promote a free and open Indo-Pacific.  
  
President Biden and President Marcos announced a number of new
arrangements and initiatives to expand on the historic momentum in
U.S.-Philippine relations, including the adoption of Bilateral Defense
Guidelines, President Biden’s dispatching of a Presidential Trade and
Investment Mission to the Philippines, the launch of an Open RAN 5G
interoperability lab in Manila, and the establishment of a bilateral
Labor Working Group.

**THE U.S.-PHILIPPINES ALLIANCE**

The Philippines is the United States’ oldest ally in the Indo-Pacific.
Since 1951, the U.S.-Philippines alliance has advanced peace,
prosperity, and security for the United States, the Philippines, and the
broader Indo-Pacific region. Now the United States and the Philippines
are modernizing the alliance and building a strong and resilient
architecture that is designed to meet emerging challenges, while
routinizing joint planning and improving interoperability. On April 28,
we concluded the largest-ever iteration of our flagship bilateral
military exercise, Balikatan. We are also expanding cooperation among
our coast guards to better address the challenges posed by illegal,
unreported, and unregulated fishing and other unlawful maritime
activities; when Vice President Harris visited Palawan in November 2022,
she announced $7.5 million in new assistance to enhance the capabilities
of Philippine maritime law enforcement agencies, as well as a new
program to upgrade the Philippine Coast Guard’s vessel traffic
management system.  
  
Furthermore, the Philippines and the United States have identified four
new sites pursuant to the U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation
Agreement (EDCA), which will strengthen Philippine security and support
the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ modernization goals, while driving
U.S. investment to local communities across the Philippines and
improving our shared ability to rapidly deliver humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief.  
  
At the White House, President Biden reaffirmed the United States’
ironclad alliance commitments to the Philippines, underscoring that an
armed attack in the Pacific, which includes the South China Sea, on
Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft, including those of
the Coast Guard, would invoke U.S. mutual defense commitments under
Article IV of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. President
Biden and President Marcos announced the following arrangements and
initiatives:

-   **<u>Bilateral Defense Guidelines</u>**: The United States and the
    Philippines are adopting Bilateral Defense Guidelines that
    institutionalize key bilateral priorities, mechanisms, and processes
    to deepen alliance cooperation and interoperability across land,
    sea, air, space, and cyberspace. The Guidelines support the
    continued modernization of the alliance and ongoing efforts to adapt
    alliance coordination to respond to the evolving security
    environment. As outlined in the Guidelines, the United States and
    the Philippines will advance efforts to deepen interoperability,
    particularly through enhanced bilateral planning;
    information-sharing; accelerated defense capability development; and
    collaboration on emerging security challenges.  
-   **<u>Enhancing the Capabilities of the Armed Forces of the
    Philippines</u>:** The United States intends to transfer to the
    Armed Forces of the Philippines two Island-class patrol vessels, two
    Protector-class patrol vessels, and three C-130H aircraft, pending
    applicable Congressional notification requirements. Additionally,
    two Cyclone-class coastal patrol vessels were transferred to the
    Philippines in late April, and are now en route to Manila. These
    transfers will support the Armed Forces of the Philippines’
    modernization program by enhancing its maritime and tactical lift
    capabilities.  
-   **<u>EDCA Sites Driving Sustainable Development and Investment in
    Local Communities</u>:** The United States is working closely with
    communities in the vicinity of the EDCA sites to fully realize their
    positive value for local development and for humanitarian assistance
    and disaster relief. To that end, the United States will expand our
    work in these communities and areas to support health, education,
    environmental protection, economic growth, and disaster
    preparedness. 

**ECONOMIC COOPERATION: PROMOTING INVESTMENT, INNOVATION, AND INCLUSIVE
PROSPERITY**

The close economic ties between the United States and the Philippines
have long supported high-quality investment, good jobs, and sustained
economic growth in both countries. All regions of the Philippines
benefit from U.S. investment, and employees of U.S. companies in the
Philippines earn annual wages that are 50% above the average family’s
income. U.S. business services company Concentrix is the Philippines’
largest private sector employer, while U.S. investment firm KKR invested
$1 billion in Philippine telecom infrastructure in 2022 alone and U.S.
technology companies such as Texas Instruments, onsemi, Amkor, and
Analog Devices have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the
Philippines’ semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem.  
  
The Philippines and the United States are also partnering with other
regional countries to negotiate an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for
Prosperity (IPEF), which will promote trade, supply chain resilience,
clean economy development, and anti-corruption and tax efforts. The
countries are also collaborating closely at meetings throughout the U.S.
2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) host year. To add further
momentum to our special economic ties, President Biden and President
Marcos announced the following new initiatives:

-   **<u>Presidential Trade and Investment Mission</u>**: President
    Biden intends to dispatch a Presidential Trade and Investment
    Mission to the Philippines on his behalf – the first mission of its
    kind – to enhance U.S. companies’ investment in the Philippines’
    innovation economy, its clean energy transition and critical
    minerals sector, and the food security of its people. The
    Presidential Trade and Investment Mission will feature the highest
    caliber of U.S. business leaders.  
-   **<u>Bringing the Indo-Pacific Business Forum to the
    Philippines</u>:** The United States and the Philippines will
    co-host the 6th annual Indo-Pacific Business Forum (IPBF) in Manila,
    pending Congressional notification. The IPBF, sponsored by the U.S.
    Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), is the United States’ marquee
    annual commercial event in the region, convening the highest level
    of public and private sector leaders to review policy developments,
    announce new investments, and identify new commercial partnerships.
    Expected to take place in spring of 2024, the Forum will strengthen
    the Philippines’ position as a key hub for regional supply chains
    and high-quality investment.  
-   **<u>Open RAN 5G Interoperability Lab</u>:** To advance a secure 5G
    rollout in the Philippines, strengthen its innovation economy, and
    provide digital upskilling opportunities to Philippine workers, the
    United States intends to establish a brick-and-mortar Open RAN
    Interoperability Lab in Manila, pending Congressional notification.
    The Lab will provide hands-on training to current and aspiring 5G
    professionals and provide an opportunity for vendors and operators
    deploying Open RAN worldwide to teach and educate local engineers in
    how to design, build, and operate these open, secure, and
    interoperable networks.  
-   **<u>Investing in Sustainable, High-Quality Infrastructure</u>:**
    The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is launching a
    new partnership to scale up infrastructure development in the
    Philippines and support the construction of high-quality railways,
    ports, and transport systems. Additionally, over the course of 2023,
    USTDA will launch new sustainable infrastructure activities intended
    to leverage over $3 billion in public and private financing to
    strengthen the Philippines’ critical mineral supply chains, advance
    smart grid technologies and clean energy solutions, promote secure
    5G deployment, strengthen airport security and maritime safety, and
    support healthcare infrastructure across the Philippines.  
-   **<u>Expanding U.S.-Philippines Air Transportation Links</u>:** The
    United States and the Philippines intend to expand air connectivity
    and modernize our bilateral aviation relationship, which will
    strengthen our economic and people-to-people ties. U.S. and
    Philippine aeronautical authorities will formalize a technical
    aviation dialogue at the upcoming APEC Transportation Ministerial
    Meeting in Detroit to enhance policy and regulatory alignment, with
    a view towards modernizing the U.S.-Philippines air transportation
    agreement.  
-   **<u>Space Cooperation</u>:** The United States and the Philippines
    will strengthen bilateral cooperation on space situational awareness
    and the use of space for maritime domain awareness, including
    through the first-ever U.S.-Philippines Civil Space Dialogue. The
    countries will collaborate on the use of space-based technology in
    the areas of disaster management and emergency response, healthcare,
    mapping of resources and accessibility, pollution monitoring,
    deforestation, land use and infrastructure planning, and maritime
    awareness. The leaders welcome the strengthening of bilateral
    cooperation on the Landsat Program, including the possibility for
    the Philippines to download imagery directly from Landsat satellites
    to its ground stations.   

**EDUCATION AND PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE TIES**

The United States and the Philippines benefit from unique bonds of
friendship and community among our peoples, and millions of Filipino
Americans enrich communities across the United States. The United
States’ only overseas VA Service Center is located in Manila, where it
fulfills our special obligations to the many Filipinos who served under
the U.S. flag. The Philippines is also home to the longest continuously
running Fulbright Program – now celebrating its 75<sup>th</sup>
anniversary. We will mark this special milestone by expanding
U.S.-Philippine exchange programs and strengthening alumni networks
among the thousands of Filipinos who have benefited from these programs.
Additionally, President Biden and President Marcos announced the
following new initiatives:

-   **<u>Investing in the Next Generation of Philippine Leaders</u>:**
    The U.S. government is on track to provide $70 million to support
    more than 2,000 exchange participants between the Philippines and
    the United States over the next ten years. This investment will
    allow for an expansion of the Fulbright program, the International
    Visitor Leadership Program, the Philippines Youth Leadership
    Program, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, the Humphrey
    program, and other bilateral exchange initiatives with the
    Philippines. This represents one of the U.S. government’s largest
    long-term people-to-people commitments globally.  
-   **<u>Philippines-U.S. Friendship Fellowship</u>**: The United States
    and the Philippines welcome plans to establish a Philippines-U.S.
    Friendship Fellowship (PUFF), which is designed to provide
    Philippine students and young professionals with unique educational
    opportunities in the United States, building life-long ties among
    the next generation of Philippine and American innovators and
    leaders.  
-   **<u>Building World-Class Universities in the Philippines</u>:**
    USAID will launch a $30 million next-generation higher education
    partnership to strengthen the Philippine education system, working
    with Philippine universities to expand their innovation,
    entrepreneurship, and workforce development capabilities, pending
    availability of funds. This flagship education partnership will
    advance Philippine human capital priorities by supporting
    universities’ curriculum development, faculty training, higher
    education policy and management, research, and community
    engagement.   
-   **<u>Fulbright Advancing Innovation and Capacity-Building</u>**:
    Noting the importance of  collaboration among our scientists,
    innovators, and entrepreneurs, the United States supports the
    partnerships the Fulbright Commission has established with the
    Philippine Commission on Higher Education, Department of
    Agriculture, Department of Health, Competition Commission, Bangko
    Sentral ng Pilipinas, and Space Agency; and commits to explore
    avenues for harnessing these partnerships to achieve
    capacity-building in areas critical to the Philippines’ national
    development and economic growth.

**ADVANCING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS**

The United States and the Philippines’ shared democratic values
strengthen our alliance immeasurably. Promoting respect for human rights
and rule of law, and ensuring civil society leaders and members of
marginalized communities are safe from violence, are key priorities for
the U.S.-Philippines relationship. The United States looks forward to
contributing to the Philippines-UN Joint Programme for Human Rights, a
unique mechanism intended to strengthen Philippine accountability
mechanisms. The United States and the Philippines are also focused on
ensuring workers can organize freely and safely. The United States
appreciates President Marcos’s participation in the second Summit for
Democracy and looks forward to launching a U.S.-Philippines Democracy
Dialogue this year. Today, President Biden and President Marcos
announced:

-   **<u>Establishment of a U.S.-Philippines Labor Working Group</u>:**
    The United States and the Philippines will establish a bilateral
    Labor Working Group, pursuant to the U.S.-Philippines Trade and
    Investment Framework Agreement. The Labor Working Group will serve
    as an important platform through which the United States and the
    Philippines can collaborate to accelerate implementation of
    internationally recognized labor rights. It will also facilitate
    exchange and dialogue among U.S. and Philippine governments and
    labor unions, ensuring that workers’ voices will shape the way
    ahead.

**COLLABORATION ON CLEAN ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION**

The United States and the Philippines are deepening collaboration to
fight climate change, expand clean energy production, and protect the
environment. We will endeavor to keep energy prices down for families
while urgently reducing greenhouse gas emissions by expanding wind,
solar, and geothermal energy production in the Philippines, including
through our Energy Policy Dialogue. We are expeditiously negotiating a
civil nuclear cooperation agreement (or “123” Agreement), which will
provide a legal foundation for significant transfers of nuclear material
and equipment, while concurrently enhancing capacity-building and
commercial cooperation in nuclear energy. Furthermore, the United States
and the Philippines have adopted a “ridge-to-reef” model of
environmental protection, collaborating to promote sustainable fisheries
and marine conservation, combat the illegal lumber and wildlife trade,
advance ecosystem-based adaptation, rehabilitate valuable wetlands, and
promote good governance in the mining sector. Today, President Biden and
President Marcos announced the following new initiatives:

-   **<u>Partnership on Critical Minerals</u>:** USAID will invest an
    additional $5 million, pending Congressional notification, to
    support increased production of processed minerals and expand
    downstream mineral industries in the Philippines, such as the
    production of electric vehicle components and information and
    communications technologies (ICT) equipment, while improving
    governance standards in the mining industry. In addition, the U.S.
    Department of the Interior and the Philippine Department of
    Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) intend to partner on the
    identification and classification of mineral commodity resources,
    and capacity-building on minerals governance. Finally, the
    Department of State will establish technical cooperation with the
    Philippines to develop the country’s nickel and copper resources in
    a manner that promotes sustained economic growth and social benefit.
    This builds on USTDA’s ongoing work to support the development of
    environmentally sustainable nickel processing facilities in the
    Philippines.  
-   **<u>Green Energy Auctions</u>**: USAID will partner with the
    Philippine Department of Energy to conduct the Philippines’ second
    round of green energy auctions – bidding out a combined 11.6GW of
    solar, onshore wind, biomass and waste-to-energy capacity to be
    installed from 2024 to 2026, representing nearly half the country’s
    current energy capacity.  
-   **<u>Partnership on Nuclear Energy</u>**: As the United States and
    the Philippines continue to develop a civil nuclear cooperation
    agreement, the United States will provide capacity-building support
    through the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small
    Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program, which will help the
    Philippines develop a national civil nuclear engineering workforce.
    The United States will also arrange a study tour this summer for
    Philippine legislators and government officials to explore the
    potential for nuclear energy to meet the Philippines’ clean energy
    needs, consistent with the highest standards of nuclear security,
    safety, and nonproliferation.  
-   **<u>Environmental Protection</u>**: The U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency and DENR have committed to work jointly to address
    the serious health and environmental risks associated with climate
    change and environmental degradation. This partnership will apply
    best practices and cutting-edge technologies to address challenges
    like methane reduction, food waste, marine plastic litter, water
    quality, and environmental justice. In addition, the Department of
    Interior intends to partner with DENR to protect shorelines and
    ecosystems through “ridge-to-reef” conservation and research
    efforts.

**SUPPORTING RESILIENT AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES**

The United States and the Philippines are close partners in promoting
health security and supporting inclusive community resilience. In FY
2022 funding alone, USAID expects to provide over $135 million in
development assistance to support these efforts, subject to
Congressional approval. We are proud to have provided the Philippines
more than $52 million in COVID-19 assistance, in addition to donating 33
million safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in partnership with COVAX,
building on the United States’ $600 million investment in the Philippine
health sector over the past twenty years.  
  
USAID has responded to over 50 disasters in the Philippines since 1990,
providing life-saving emergency assistance while building up the
Philippines’ domestic response capacity. Since 2010, the United States
has provided over $363 million in disaster preparedness, response, and
recovery assistance–excluding COVID-19 assistance–to help over 100
cities and municipalities across the Philippines. The United States is
also supporting Philippine efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to
emerging infectious disease threats through technical assistance and
investments that strengthen the capacity of laboratories, improve
disease surveillance and emergency management systems, and establish
robust risk communication and biosafety and biosecurity measures.    
  
Today, President Biden and President Marcos announced the following new
initiatives:

-   **<u>Advancing Food Security</u>:** On May 5, the United States and
    the Philippines will convene their inaugural Food Security Dialogue,
    a high-level platform led by the U.S. and Philippine Departments of
    Agriculture, mandated to coordinate enhanced bilateral efforts to
    create resilient food systems and advance agricultural trade,
    innovation, and sustainability. The Department of Commerce intends
    to dispatch its first-ever trade mission on agricultural technology
    to the Philippines in September 2023, with stops in Manila and Davao
    City. In addition, the U.S. National Science Foundation will support
    joint research on food security with U.S. and Philippine experts at
    the International Rice Institute in Los Baños.   
-   **<u>Advancing Water Security</u>:** USAID assistance will mobilize
    $100 million over the next five years to increase access to safe
    drinking water for 1.22 million Filipinos and provide sanitation
    services to 710,000 people, while strengthening water management
    institutions, increasing access to climate-resilient water supply,
    improving water resource management, and addressing water financing
    gaps.  
-   **<u>Protecting Critical Water Infrastructure</u>:** The United
    States and the Philippines will partner to strengthen the security
    and resilience of Philippine water infrastructure, supply, and
    distribution systems. We plan to share best practices and tools, and
    conduct expert exchanges on ways to prevent, detect, and address
    physical and cyber incidents. We will also provide cybersecurity
    training for government personnel and undertake other capacity
    building efforts.  
-   **<u>Disaster Risk Reduction</u>:** USAID is providing an additional
    $5.3 million for disaster risk reduction and resilience programming
    in the Philippines, building national and local capacity to prepare
    for and respond to disasters, while addressing the long-term needs
    of at-risk communities. In addition, the United States and the
    Philippines, building upon long-standing cooperation in the field of
    science, technology, and innovation (STI), will co-host an
    international workshop on “Harnessing STI for Disaster Risk
    Reduction” in Metro Manila this year, in partnership with the United
    Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development.  
-   **<u>Promoting Health Security and Fighting Tuberculosis</u>:**
    USAID will award an additional $8 million, pending Congressional
    notification, to support global health security in the Philippines
    and invest in the Philippines’ biosafety and laboratory capacity,
    disease surveillance, risk communication, and emergency
    preparedness. In addition, USAID will partner with the Philippine
    Department of Health to address the double burden of
    non-communicable diseases and tuberculosis. This partnership will
    ensure all Filipinos have access to quality treatment. USAID will
    also expand support to the Philippines National Tuberculosis
    Reference Lab, introducing the use the Targeted Next-Generation
    Sequencing technology to address drug-resistant strains.
