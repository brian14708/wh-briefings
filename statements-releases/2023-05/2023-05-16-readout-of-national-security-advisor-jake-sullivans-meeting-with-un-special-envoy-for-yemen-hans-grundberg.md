  \ Special Envoy for Yemen Hans\_Grundberg"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with UN Special Envoy for
Yemen Hans Grundberg on May 15 at the White House.  Mr. Sullivan
underscored President Biden’s commitment to ending the war in Yemen.  He
welcomed the remarkable progress since the UN-mediated truce first went
into effect in April of last year, leading to the quietest period
Yemenis have had since the war began nearly a decade ago.  The two also
discussed the importance of continued donor support to mitigate Yemen’s
humanitarian crisis.  They agreed to remain in close contact as efforts
continue to transition from the truce to a comprehensive, inclusive
UN-led political process.
