title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Bipartisan Budget Agreement in\_Principle"
---
 
Earlier this evening, Speaker McCarthy and I reached a budget agreement
in principle.  
  
It is an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting
critical programs for working people and growing the economy for
everyone. And, the agreement protects my and Congressional Democrats’
key priorities and legislative accomplishments.  
  
The agreement represents a compromise, which means not everyone gets
what they want. That’s the responsibility of governing.  
  
And, this agreement is good news for the American people, because it
prevents what could have been a catastrophic default and would have led
to an economic recession, retirement accounts devastated, and millions
of jobs lost.  
  
Over the next day, our negotiating teams will finalize legislative text
and the agreement will go to the United States House and Senate. I
strongly urge both chambers to pass the agreement right away.
