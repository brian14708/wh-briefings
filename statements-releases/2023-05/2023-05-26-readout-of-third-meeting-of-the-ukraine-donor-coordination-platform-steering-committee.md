title: "Readout of Third Meeting of the Ukraine Donor Coordination Platform Steering\_\
  Committee"
---
 
Today, Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Mike
Pyle, together with Finance Minister of Ukraine, Sergii Marchenko, and
European Commission Director-General for Neighborhood and Enlargement
Negotiations, Gert Jan Koopman, co-chaired the third meeting of the
Steering Committee of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for
Ukraine. The Government of Ukraine and G7 Members of the Steering
Committee, and representatives from international financial institutions
(IFIs), discussed progress on Ukraine’s 2023 early recovery priorities
in the areas of energy infrastructure, civilian demining, critical and
social infrastructure, housing, and support to the private sector.
Ukraine also provided an update on implementation of its reform agenda.
Deputy National Security Advisor Pyle welcomed Ukraine’s commitment to
continued progress on reform efforts, which will be critical for
longer-term economic sustainability and catalyzing financial support
from the private sector. He emphasized that the Ukraine Recovery
Conference (URC) next month in London will be a crucial moment to
demonstrate that the platform is able to provide transparency, clarity,
and coordination in meeting Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction needs.
Collaboration will continue in the coming weeks, and the Steering
Committee will hold its next meeting on the margins of the URC in June.
