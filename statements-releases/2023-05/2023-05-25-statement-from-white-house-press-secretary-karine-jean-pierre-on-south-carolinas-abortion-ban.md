title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on South Carolina\u2019\
  s Abortion\_Ban"
---
 
Today in South Carolina, Governor McMaster signed an extreme and
dangerous abortion ban into law. If allowed to stand, South Carolina’s
ban, like more than a dozen other bans currently in effect, will
criminalize health care providers and cause delays and denials of health
and life-saving care.  
  
With the passage of abortion bans in states like Florida and North
Carolina earlier this year, Republican officials are dismantling women’s
rights across the South, putting their health and lives in jeopardy. 
South Carolina’s ban will cut off access to abortion for women in the
state and those across the entire region for whom South Carolina is
their closest option for care.  
  
President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that in the United
States, reproductive health care should be protected in every state and
doctors shouldn’t be threatened for providing essential care. They will
continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of *Roe* in
federal law – and oppose ongoing attempts by Republican elected
officials to undermine Americans’ fundamental freedoms.
