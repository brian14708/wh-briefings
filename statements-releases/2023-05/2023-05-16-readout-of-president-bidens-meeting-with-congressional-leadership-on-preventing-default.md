title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with Congressional Leadership on\
  \ Preventing\_Default"
---
 
This afternoon, President Biden hosted Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell,
Speaker McCarthy, and Leader Jeffries in the Oval Office for a
productive and direct meeting about the need to ensure America does not
default on its debt for the first time in our history, and on a budget
agreement that can reach his desk.

The President emphasized that while more work remains on a range of
difficult issues, he’s optimistic that there is a path to a responsible,
bipartisan budget agreement if both sides negotiate in good faith and
recognize that neither side will get everything it wants.

The President directed staff to continue to meet daily on outstanding
issues. He said that he would like to check in with leaders later this
week by phone, and meet with them upon his return from overseas.
