title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Highlights Accomplishments on\
  \ Anniversary of Historic Executive Order to Advance Effective, Accountable Policing\
  \ and Strengthen Public\_Safety"
---
 
One year ago, on May 25, 2022, President Biden signed a historic
[Executive Order on <u>Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and
Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public
Safety</u>.](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/05/25/executive-order-on-advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and-public-safety/)
(EO 14074).  The EO went into effect on the second anniversary of the
murder of George Floyd.  
  
Through EO 14074, the President put federal policing on the path to
becoming the gold standard of effectiveness and accountability by
requiring federal law enforcement agencies to: ban chokeholds; restrict
no-knock warrants; mandate the use of body-worn cameras; implement
stronger use-of-force policies, including with the duty to intervene and
duty to render medical aid; provide de-escalation training; submit
use-of-force data to the FBI’s Use-of-Force Data Collection; submit
officer misconduct records into a new national accountability database;
and restrict the sale or transfer of military equipment to local law
enforcement agencies, among other things. The EO also directs the use of
federal tools, such as guidance on best practices, technical assistance,
and grantmaking to support similar reforms within state, Tribal, local,
and territorial (STLT) law enforcement agencies.  
  
Agencies across the federal government have made significant progress in
implementing the requirements of the EO.  Recognizing that effective
implementation of the EO requires not just a whole-of-government
approach, but a whole-of-society effort, agencies also have engaged
directly with stakeholders throughout the implementation process,
including with law enforcement associations, civil rights groups, labor
organizations, technical experts, and families impacted by police
violence.   
  
The Administration remains committed to fully implementing the EO and
strengthening public trust and public safety.  And the President
continues to call for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in
Policing Act to advance accountability, transparency, and public trust
in law enforcement.  Real change at the state and local level requires
Congressional action.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is providing a status update on
actions taken under the Executive Order in the following areas:  
  
**<u>Promoting Accountability</u>**  
  
**The Executive Order has resulted in concrete actions to increase law
enforcement accountability.**

-   **Restrictions on Access to Certain Military Equipment**: DHS, DOD,
    DOJ, GSA, and Treasury have taken steps to ensure that certain
    militarized equipment—including certain firearms and ammunition,
    bayonets, grenades and grenade launchers, explosives, and certain
    vehicles and aircraft—are not sold or transferred to STLT law
    enforcement agencies.  These restrictions will strengthen public
    trust while ensuring state and local law enforcement agencies can
    access and use needed equipment for appropriate purposes, such as
    active shooter scenarios.  
-   **Guidance for Federal Law Enforcement on the Use of Race,
    Ethnicity, and Other  Protected Characteristics**: DOJ updated its
    2014 Guidance on the Use of Race, Ethnicity, Gender, National
    Origin, Religion, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity.  The
    [updated
    guidance](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-05/Sec.%209%28e%29%20-%20Guidance%20for%20Federal%20LEAs%20on%20the%20Use%20of%20Protected%20Characteristics_FINAL%205.25.23_508.pdf),
    which explains the restrictions on relying on race and other
    protected characteristics, strengthens existing protections,
    including by adding disability as a protected category.     
-   **Deaths in Custody Investigations**: DOJ published
    [guidance](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-05/Sec.%202%28a%29%20-%20DOJ%20Guidance%20for%20STLT%20LEAs%20on%20Investigations%20of%20In-Custody%20Deaths_FINAL.pdf)
    for STLT law enforcement agencies for investigating deaths in
    custody.  
-   **Pattern or Practice Investigations**: DOJ strengthened
    communication with State Attorneys General on pattern or practice
    investigations and enhanced protocols for federal investigations of
    federal civil rights violations by law enforcement officers.  
-   **Internal Investigations**: Federal agencies, including DOJ and
    DHS, analyzed and made necessary updates to their internal processes
    for investigating use-of-force incidents involving their law
    enforcement components.   
-   **National Law Enforcement Accountability Database**: DOJ partnered
    with the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement
    Standards and Training (IADLEST) to establish the National Law
    Enforcement Accountability Database. IADLEST runs the National
    Decertification Index (NDI), a national registry of law enforcement
    de-certification and revocation actions relating to officer
    misconduct that is currently used by all 50 states and the District
    of Columbia. The Department is working with IADLEST to: (1) expand
    upon the existing NDI to include the additional categories of
    information required by the Executive Order; and (2) establish a
    system for making available Federal law enforcement records based on
    the NDI model. The Department aims to have the database launched by
    the end of the year.   

**<u>Raising Standards</u>**  
  
**The Executive Order raises standards for Federal Law Enforcement
Agencies.**

-   **Use of Force Policies**: Federal law enforcement agencies,
    including DOJ, DHS, and DOI, which encompass more than 90% of all
    federal law enforcement officers, have adopted policies that:  
    -   Emphasize the importance of valuing and preserving human life;  
    -   Allow the use of deadly force only when necessary, that is, when
        the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such
        force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical
        injury to the officer or another person;  
    -   Require training in and employing where feasible de-escalation
        tactics and techniques;  
    -   Explicitly include the affirmative duty to intervene to prevent
        or stop another officer from using excessive force;  
    -   Explicitly include the affirmative duty to request and/or render
        medical aid, as appropriate.  
-   **Chokeholds and No-Knock Entry Policy**: Federal executive law
    enforcement agencies, including DOJ, DHS, and DOI, which encompass
    more than 90% of federal law enforcement officers, banned chokeholds
    and carotid restraints, unless deadly force is authorized, and
    limited the use of “no-knock” entries.  
-   **Body-worn Cameras (BWC)**: Federal law enforcement agencies,
    including DOJ, DHS, and DOI, which encompass more than 90% of all
    federal law enforcement officers, issued policies requiring officers
    to wear and activate BWC recording equipment for purposes of
    recording their actions during a pre-planned attempt to serve an
    arrest warrant or other pre-planned arrest or the execution of a
    search or seizure warrant or order, and included a presumption that
    BWC recordings depicting conduct resulting in serious bodily injury
    or death of another will be released as soon as practical.
-   **Strengthening recruitment, hiring, promotion, and retention of law
    enforcement officers.** An Office of Personnel Management (OPM)-led
    working group of federal law enforcement agencies has developed an
    action plan identifying a set of core policies and best practices to
    be used across all federal law enforcement agencies regarding
    recruitment, hiring, promotion, and retention. The working group
    also identified best practices for performance evaluations and
    promotion decisions for federal law enforcement officers, as well as
    for conducting background investigations and implementing properly
    validated selection and screening procedures.

**<u>Supporting State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Law Enforcement
 </u>**  
  
**Through federal tools such as guidance,** **technical assistance, and
grantmaking, the Executive Order encourages and supports** **state,
Tribal, local, and territorial law enforcement agencies to adopt and
implement best practices.**

-   **Grantmaking**: Key federal agencies are awarding discretionary
    grants in a manner that supports and promotes the adoption of the
    Executive Order’s policies by STLT law enforcement agencies.  For
    example, starting with the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 grant cycle, in
    relevant solicitations, DOJ included language outlining priority
    consideration for applicants that have policies or practices in line
    with substantive provisions of the Executive Order for which the
    Department has issued policies, guidance, or best practices. The
    Department will expand the list of priority considerations in
    solicitations for FY 2024 and going forward, to include best
    practices and guidance the Department has developed and published in
    recent months. HHS included similar language for its Mental Health
    Awareness Training Grant program and its Behavior Health Partnership
    for Early Diversion of Adults and Youth program.  DHS will include
    incentivizing language in its discretionary grants to STLT law
    enforcement agencies beginning in FY 2024, where appropriate.  
-   **Accreditation Standards**: DOJ created first-of-their-kind
    [accreditation
    standards](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-05/Sec.%2019%28b%29%20-%20DOJ%20National%20Accreditation%20Standards_FINAL.pdf)
    to encourage STLT law enforcement agencies to adopt policies
    consistent with those highlighted in the Executive Order. These
    standards were developed in consultation with accrediting bodies,
    law enforcement stakeholders, and civil rights groups, and are
    designed to help ensure STLT law enforcement agencies seeking
    accreditation are following best policing practices in such areas
    as:  
    -   Hiring and performance evaluation of officers and supervisors;  
    -   Use of force policies in line with DOJ’s policy;  
    -   Directives on the use of in-car and body-worn cameras; and  
    -   Submission of important crime data to the FBI.   
-   **Officer Wellness**: DOJ and HHS published a
    [report](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-05/Sec.%204%28a%29%20-Report%20on%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Advance%20Officer%20Wellness_FINAL.pdf)
    outlining best practices for STLT law enforcement agencies regarding
    officer wellness and will soon publish a second on preventing law
    enforcement suicide, both of which are based on engagement with
    dozens of stakeholder groups.  
-   **Guidelines for Emergency Responses to People with Behavioral
    Health or Other Disabilities**: HHS and DOJ jointly developed
    [guidance](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-05/Sec.%2014%28a%29%20-%20DOJ%20and%20HHS%20Guidance%20on%20Emergency%20Responses%20to%20Individuals%20with%20Behavioral%20Health%20or%20Other%20Disabilities_FINAL.pdf)
    regarding emergency responses to calls and interactions with people
    in behavioral or mental health crisis or persons who have
    disabilities. The guidance addresses response models and the
    facilitation of post-crisis support services as well as federal
    resources, including Medicaid, that can be used to implement
    established and emerging best practices.  
-   **Notifications of Deaths in Custody**: DOJ published
    [guidance](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-05/Sec%2011%28d%29%20-%20DOJ%20Guidance%20on%20Best%20Practices%20for%20Providing%20Official%20Notificaition%20of%20Deaths%20in%20Cu.pdf)
    for STLT law enforcement agencies on best practices for
    notifications to families of individuals who die in law enforcement
    custody, including timely and appropriate notification of, and
    support to, family members.  
-   **Studying the Impact of Use-of-Force Incidents on Communities.** 
    HHS published a
    [report](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/eo-14074-section-11a-report)
    examining the effects of use of force by law enforcement officers on
    individual and community physical, mental, and public health.

**<u>Improving Conditions of Persons Incarcerated or Under
Supervision</u>**  
  
**The Executive Order directed actions to improve conditions of
confinement and promote better outcomes for individuals who are
incarcerated or under supervision.**

-   **The White House Alternatives, Rehabilitation, and Reentry
    Strategic Plan.**  As mandated by the EO, in April the Biden-Harris
    Administration
    [released](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/28/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-action-during-second-chance-month-to-strengthen-public-safety-improve-rehabilitation-in-jails-and-prisons-and-support-successful-reentry/)
    its evidence-informed, multi-year [Strategic
    Plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-White-House-Alternatives-Rehabilitation-and-Reentry-Strategic-Plan.pdf)
    to strengthen public safety by reducing unnecessary criminal justice
    system interactions so police officers can focus on fighting crime;
    supporting rehabilitation during incarceration; and facilitating
    successful reentry.  The plan builds upon President Biden’s Safer
    America Plan – his comprehensive strategy to prevent and combat gun
    crime and violence – and outlines more than 100 concrete policy
    actions to strengthen public safety and improve the criminal justice
    system by leveraging data, research, and proven successful
    strategies from state and local governments across the country.  
-   **Restrictive Housing**: DOJ published a
    [report](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-02/Section%2016%28b%29%28i%29%20Report%20-%20Final%20-%20Initial%20508.pdf)
    on BOP’s use of restrictive housing and efforts to reduce its use.
    The report also highlights BOP’s work to address and decrease the
    use of restrictive housing, including partnering with the National
    Institute of Justice (NIJ) to study and provide recommendations on
    BOP’s use of restrictive housing and creating a task force of senior
    BOP officials to conduct a more immediate assessment and provide
    recommendations.

    on efforts to fully implement the provisions and intent of the First
    Step Act, including by:  
    -   Maximizing the availability of time credits to eligible people
        in BOP custody;  
    -   Assessing and updating the PATTERN assessment;

    on the resources available to individuals on probation or supervised
    release, including how DOJ has utilized resources to facilitate
    successful outcomes for individuals on probation or supervised
    release.  
         

**<u>Strengthening Data Collection and Technology</u>**  
  
**The Executive Order has led to significant actions to improve data
collection and analysis and assess the impact of new technologies.**

-   **Tracking data on use-of-force incidents. ** Federal law
    enforcement agencies are collecting and submitting on a monthly
