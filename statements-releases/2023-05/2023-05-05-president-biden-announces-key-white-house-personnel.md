Today, President Biden announced that Neera Tanden will serve as
Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor. The President
also announced that Stefanie Feldman will serve as Assistant to the
President and Staff Secretary. Additionally, Zayn Siddique will be
promoted to Principal Deputy of the Domestic Policy Council.  
  
*Statement from President Biden:*  
  
“For over two years, Susan Rice has helped craft and implement my
domestic policy agenda and our country owes a debt of gratitude for her
history-making public service. I am pleased to announce that Neera
Tanden will continue to drive the formulation and implementation of my
domestic policy, from economic mobility and racial equity to health
care, immigration and education.   
  
As Senior Advisor and Staff Secretary, Neera oversaw decision-making
processes across my domestic, economic and national security teams. She
has 25 years of experience in public policy, has served three
Presidents, and led one of the largest think tanks in the country for
nearly a decade. She was a key architect of the Affordable Care Act and
helped drive key domestic policies that became part of my agenda,
including clean energy subsidies and sensible gun reform. While growing
up, Neera relied on some of the critical programs that she will oversee
as Domestic Policy Advisor, and I know those insights will serve my
Administration and the American people well. I look forward to
continuing to work closely with Neera in her new role.  
  
Stef is one of my longest-serving and most trusted advisors. I asked
Stef to join me from the White House to the University of Delaware, to
my presidential campaign, and back to the White House because of her
talent and tenacious pursuit of policies that make life better for
hard-working Americans. I have now asked her to serve as Staff Secretary
because I know I can trust her to ensure that I am equipped with the
best advice and counsel.”  
  
Tanden will be the first Asian-American to lead any of the three major
White House policy councils in history.
