President Biden looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of
the United Kingdom for an Official Working Visit to the White House on
Thursday, June 8 to further deepen the close and historic partnership
between the United States and the United Kingdom.  Building on their
recent engagements, the two leaders will review a range of global
issues, including their steadfast support for Ukraine as it defends
itself against Russia’s brutal war of aggression, as well as further
action to bolster energy security and address the climate crisis.  The
President and the Prime Minister will discuss efforts to continue
strengthening our economic relationship as we confront shared economic
and national security challenges.  They will also review developments in
Northern Ireland as part of their shared commitment to preserving the
gains of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.
