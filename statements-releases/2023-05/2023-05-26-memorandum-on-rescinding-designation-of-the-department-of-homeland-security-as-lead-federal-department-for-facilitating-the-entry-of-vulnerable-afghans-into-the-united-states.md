MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

The President has rescinded the direction to the Secretary of Homeland
Security (the Secretary) to lead the coordination of ongoing efforts
across the Federal Government to resettle vulnerable Afghans, including
those who worked on behalf of the United States, pursuant to the
Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Homeland Security Presidential
Directive-5 (Management of Domestic Incidents), and as further
complemented by Presidential Policy Directive-44 (Enhancing Domestic
Incident Response).  The President has further rescinded the direction
to the Secretary to establish a Unified Coordination Group to facilitate
increased Federal response capacity and interagency coordination.    

The Secretary has led an interagency effort to process, receive, care
for, and resettle to their new communities approximately 90,000 Afghan
arrivals — and led a whole-of-society effort to welcome them.  The last
Afghan parolee at our final domestic processing facility departed in
September 2022 for their new community.  With the transition to Enduring
Welcome — the U.S. Government’s multi-year commitment to support our
Afghan allies — the United States will use established roles and
responsibilities as we continue to welcome new arrivals who will enter
with a durable immigration status and directly travel to their new
communities.  Therefore, there is no longer a need for the Unified
Coordination Group and the increased domestic Federal response capacity.

Nothing in this memorandum abrogates, alters, or impedes the ability of
Federal departments and agencies or Federal officials to perform their
responsibilities under law.
