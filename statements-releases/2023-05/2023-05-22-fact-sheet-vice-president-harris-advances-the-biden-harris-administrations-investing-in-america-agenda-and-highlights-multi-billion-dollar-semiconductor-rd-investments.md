  s Investing in America Agenda and Highlights Multi-Billion Dollar Semiconductor\
  \ R&D\_Investments"

Today, Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Applied Materials in
Sunnyvale, California to highlight how the Biden-Harris Administration’s
Investing in America agenda is making historic investments in
semiconductor manufacturing and research and development to support
American innovation, create jobs, and advance America’s competitiveness.
Vice President Harris’ visit coincides with Applied Materials announcing
an investment of up to $4 billion in a new research and development
facility – the EPIC Center, where it will design the next-generation of
tools for semiconductor manufacturing, including in collaboration with
leading chipmakers who will ultimately use those tools in their
factories. In August, President Biden signed into law the CHIPS and
Science Act, which has catalyzed private sector investment, including by
impacting the scale of Applied Materials’ investment. During the visit,
Vice President Harris will also meet with executives from major
semiconductor manufacturing, design, and supply chain companies, to
encourage them to invest in America, create American jobs, and
revitalize American manufacturing and R&D.

The CHIPS and Science Act makes a historic $53B federal investment to
strengthen and revitalize the United States’ position in semiconductor
research, development, and manufacturing, and ensure America is at the
forefront of industries of the future – including nanotechnology, clean
energy, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. The Act is one
component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America
agenda, which is creating a nationwide manufacturing boom, creating
good-paying jobs – many which don’t require a four-year degree, and
shoring up American supply chains. Since the beginning of the
Biden-Harris Administration, private companies have announced $470
billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments in the United
States, including over $200 billion in semiconductor manufacturing.

The CHIPS and Science Act not only provides incentives for companies to
invest in semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, but also
includes historic investments in research and development programs to
advance American innovation in semiconductors and other technologies,
strengthen American supply chains, and advance America’s national
security and economic competitiveness.

**CHIPS and Science Act Mobilizes Historic Private Sector Investments  
**  
In just over nine months since President Biden signed the CHIPS and
Science Act into law, private companies have announced nearly $140
billion in investments in semiconductor production, supply chains, and
R&D to be made over the next decade. And, the Department of Commerce has
already received 300 Statements of Interest from potential applicants
interested in applying for CHIPS incentives, covering projects in 37
states and all parts of the semiconductor ecosystem. In addition to
these investments, universities, community colleges, and other
institutions across the country have been working to support the
semiconductor workforce.

Recently announced investments include:

-   Today, Applied Materials is announcing an investment of up to $4
    billion investment in a new R&D center in California, where it will
    design and build the next generation of tools in collaboration with
    leading chipmakers that will eventually use that equipment.  
-   Analog Devices announced a $1 billion investment to upgrade its
    current facility in Oregon, which will allow it to double
    production.
-   EMP Shield announced a $1.9 billion investment in Kansas for a
    semiconductor manufacturing facility. The project is expected to
    generate over 1,200 jobs.
-   GlobalFoundries and General Motors announced a long-term,
    first-of-its-kind agreement to create dedicated capacity at
    GlobalFoundries for manufacturing the chips designed by General
    Motors’ critical suppliers.
-   IBM announced a $20 billion investment in New York for the design
    and manufacture of semiconductors, as well as to support other
    critical technologies including quantum computing, artificial
    intelligence, and other areas.
-   Intel announced an investment of more than $20 billion to build two
    leading-edge semiconductor facilities in Ohio, which is expected to
    create 10,000 fab and construction jobs. Intel and partners also
    increased investment in Arizona by up to $10 billion.
-   Micron announced plans to invest $20 billion in New York, for a
    megafab for leading-edge memory chips, as well as approximately $15
    billion in a new facility in Idaho. Memory chips play a crucial role
    in industries ranging from computers to autos to data centers.
    Together, these projects are expected to create 11,000 company jobs.
-   Texas Instruments plans to invest $11 billion in a semiconductor
    wafer fab in Utah, that will create 800 jobs and support a variety
    of industries, including the auto industry.
-   TSMC announced a $28 billion increase in its investment in Arizona,
    for a total of $40 billion invested to build two leading-edge
    semiconductor manufacturing facilities. This is the largest foreign
    direct investment in Arizona’s history.
-   Wolfspeed announced a $5 billion investment in North Carolina to
    build a facility for producing silicon carbide wafers. The project
    is expected to create 1,800 new jobs.

**Biden-Harris Administration Reaches Key Milestones in Implementation
of CHIPS and Science Act  
**  
Since the Act’s passage, agencies across the Biden-Harris Administration
have been implementing programs established under the Act to support
semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, supply chain
resilience, and workforce development. The Administration has achieved
the following milestones with respect to CHIPS implementation:

-   In December 2022, the Department of Defense released a Request for
    Solutions for an R&D program funded under the CHIPS and Science Act
    known as the Microelectronics Commons. This program will support
    hardware prototyping, the transition of new technologies from
    lab-to-fab, and workforce training. 
-   In February 2023, the Department of Commerce launched the first
    funding opportunity for the $39 billion in semiconductor
    manufacturing incentives provided in the Act. This funding
    opportunity is for projects to construct, expand, or modernize
    facilities producing semiconductors. Funding opportunities for
    companies in the semiconductor supply chain and for those making R&D
    investments will be released later this year.
-   In March 2023, the Department of Commerce released a proposed rule
    to implement the national security guardrails included in the CHIPS
    and Science Act. These guardrails will make sure that technology and
    innovation funded by the program are not misused by foreign
    countries of concern.
-   In March 2023, the Department of the Treasury issued a proposed rule
    that offers guidance on the implementation of the Advanced
    Manufacturing Investment Credit to support companies investing in
    semiconductor manufacturing.
-   In March 2023, the Department of State announced its plans around
    the International Technology Security and Innovation Fund to support
    semiconductor supply chain security and diversification, as well as
    the use of trustworthy and secure telecommunications networks.
-   In April 2023, the Department of Commerce outlined its strategy for
    the National Semiconductor Technology Center, a critical part of the
    CHIPS research and development program that will help to support
    U.S. leadership in semiconductor innovation, cut down on the time
    and cost of commercializing new technologies, and develop the
    semiconductor workforce.
-   In May 2023, the White House announced a [set of
    strategies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strategies-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
    to train and connect hardworking Americans with jobs created by
    President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, including good-paying
    jobs created in the semiconductor industry and in advanced
    manufacturing.
-   The National Science Foundation is investing in the nation’s
    semiconductor workforce through programs to support fundamental
    research, workforce training, and curriculum development at a range
    of educational institutions.
