international rules and norms, including in the South China Sea, and
reiterated the United States commitment to the defense of the
Philippines under Article IV of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense
Treaty. Building on the Vice President’s visit to Palawan, where she
launched new initiatives to support Philippine maritime law enforcement
agencies, the Vice President and President Marcos discussed
strengthening our Coast Guard partnership and U.S.-Philippine maritime
cooperation.

U.S.-Philippines economic partnership and noted President Biden’s plan
to dispatch a Presidential Trade and Investment Mission to the
Philippines to grow investment between our countries.

and the press, and other democratic principles and the importance of
these areas for the U.S.-Philippines partnership.
