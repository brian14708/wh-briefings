With today’s report, annual inflation has come down 45 percent since
last summer. The annual inflation rate has now come down 10 months in a
row at a time when our economy and job market are strong, with the
unemployment rate at its lowest level in more than 50 years. Gas prices
are down nearly $1.50 from their summer peak, and prices at the grocery
store have actually come down the last two months, providing some
welcome breathing room for families. While we have more work to do to
lower costs for families, the President’s Inflation Reduction Act is
already working to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health care,
and home energy costs. And with more than $400 billion in private sector
manufacturing investments committed already, his Investing in America
agenda is creating good jobs you can raise a family on in communities
throughout the country.

With all this progress, the single biggest threat to our economy would
be if House Republicans fail to prevent default. That would cost
millions of Americans their jobs, increase costs, increase the deficit,
and crater retirement accounts. As the President said to Congressional
leaders yesterday, we must take default off the table – and then have a
separate conversation about the budget. He simply will not accept
attempts to take the full faith and credit of the United States hostage
in order to enact an extreme agenda that would raise costs for
hard-working families.
