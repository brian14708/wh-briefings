title: "Mexico and United\_States Strengthen Joint Humanitarian Plan on\_Migration"
---
 
Today, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico and U.S. Homeland
Security Advisor Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall met in Mexico
City to build on the successful migration initiative that President
López Obrador and President Biden announced in January 2023. Following
that meeting, the United States and Mexico are announcing a set of
additional measures to address the humanitarian situation caused by
unprecedented migration flows at our shared border and in the region.   
   
First, Mexico and the United States will increase joint actions to
counter-human smugglers and traffickers that are exploiting migrants.
This complements the 60-day surge campaign that the United States
recently launched with Colombia and Panama to counter human smuggling in
the Darien.   
   
Second, the two countries committed to continue to enhance their
efforts in Central America to address the root causes of migration and
expand legal pathways. Specifically, Mexico and the United States will
redouble their development efforts that focus on people-to-people
support.  
   
Third, Mexico recognized the great potential value of the regional
processing centers that the United States announced last week, and
discussed how Mexico can contribute to their effectiveness. The United
States intends to welcome as many as 100,000 individuals from Honduras,
Guatemala, and El Salvador under the family reunification
parole processes that Secretary Mayorkas announced last week.  
   
Fourth, Mexico and the United States commit to continue the successful
joint initiative that President López Obrador and President Biden
announced in January 2023 beyond May 11, 2023.  This initiative – which
combines expanded legal pathways with consequences for irregular
migration – achieved a 95 percent drop in border encounters at our
shared border. Today, the United States committed to continue to welcome
individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela under our
parole process. For its part, Mexico will continue to accept back
migrants on humanitarian grounds.   
   
Fifth, we affirm our commitment to modernize our 2000-mile shared
border. To that end, President Biden approved moving forward on a
Presidential Permit to advance the expansion of Calexico East Land Port
of Entry. We jointly commit to take steps to finalize this project by
the end of the year – a step that will benefit both the U.S. and Mexican
economies.
