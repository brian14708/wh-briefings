  \ Manufacturing Companies Who Support President\_Biden\u2019s Climate and Investing\
  \ in America\_Agenda"
---
 
Yesterday, National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi hosted a meeting at the
White House with sustainability executives and business leaders from
companies that are experiencing benefits from the President’s Investing
in America agenda including the Inflation Reduction Act.  At the
meeting, they discussed how the Inflation Reduction Act has changed
their companies’ business models to scale across the country, and how
the tax credits have changed their calculus for their clean energy
work.  These companies expressed significant concerns about how any
repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits – including clean
energy tax incentives – presents substantial economic risk and would
hurt the hundreds of thousands of Americans they employ in communities
across the country.

National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi explained to the executives how the
Inflation Reduction Act and the tax credits are growing our economy and
strengthening our competitiveness. The executives also expressed their
intent to work across the aisle to grow their businesses and continue to
develop a clean energy economy that is made in America.

Companies in attendance included Hannon Armstrong, Holcim, HP, National
Grid, Outdoor Industry Association, Siemens, Vail Resorts, Bonterra
Organic Estates, PepsiCo, and Stonyfield.
