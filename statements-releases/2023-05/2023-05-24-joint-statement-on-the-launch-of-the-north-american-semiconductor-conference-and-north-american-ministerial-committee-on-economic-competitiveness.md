title: "Joint Statement on the Launch of the North American Semiconductor Conference\
  \ and North American Ministerial Committee on Economic\_Competitiveness"
---
 
The United States, Mexico, and Canada fulfilled key commitments made by
President Joseph Biden, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau at the North American Leaders’ Summit in Mexico
City on January 9-10 to deepen our economic cooperation, create the
quality jobs of the future, promote investment, spur innovation, and
strengthen the resilience of our economies.

The three governments organized the first North America Semiconductor
Conference in Washington, D.C. on May 18-19 with the support of the
Semiconductor Industry Association and Arizona State University.  The
conference reflects a shared commitment by government, industry, and
academia to work together to strengthen the resilience of the North
American semiconductor supply chain. 

The United States, Mexico, and Canada also launched the North American
Ministerial Committee on Economic Competitiveness (NAMCEC), fulfilling
another commitment by our leaders at the North American Leaders’ Summit,
which will align efforts at the cabinet-level to strengthen regional
competitiveness and productivity in industries of the future including
semiconductors, clean energy, critical minerals, biomanufacturing, and
information and communications technology.  By harnessing the power of
our private sector and academia, we can create quality, sustainable jobs
and provide industry with the talent required to grow and prosper, and
address the needs of North American workers.

At the Semiconductor Conference, the governments of the United States,
Canada and Mexico committed to grow the following areas of collaboration
in partnership with academia and the private sector: 

-   Information exchange to support a more robust and innovative North
    American research and development ecosystem, with the potential to
    forge new, cross-border partnerships in semiconductor research and
    development in areas of mutual interest.

<!-- -->

-   Industry and academic partnerships to train the semiconductor
    workforce of the future.

<!-- -->

-   Investments in the development, manufacture, and packaging of
    semiconductor technologies and related innovations in a way that
    addresses supply chain gaps and leverages the strengths of each of
    our nations.

To advance these opportunities, the United States, Mexico, and Canada
committed to establish biannual dialogues among officials.  Together we
are taking important steps to enhance North America’s status as a
trusted supplier of semiconductors, printed circuit boards, and related
technologies in the face of shifting global supply chains, while
cultivating domestic expertise and supporting the transition to both a
digital and green global economy.
