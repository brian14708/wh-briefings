title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Commemorating 30 Years of U.S. Diplomatic\
  \ Relations with\_Angola"

Today—as we celebrate 30 years of diplomatic relations between the
United States and Angola—we reflect on the shared values that bind
our partnership. And together, we renew our commitment to achieving our
shared vision for the world—one that is more peaceful, secure, and
democratic for all. 

Our two countries are working together to achieve that vision. We’ve
stepped up to tackle global challenges like climate change and to
bolster peace, prosperity, and cooperation across the Atlantic
region. And, Angola and the United States are expanding our economic
cooperation—including pursuing additional investments through the
Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment to build quality,
sustainable infrastructure that connects Angola to global markets.  

The United States will also continue to stand with the Angolan
government and people to promote greater peace and stability in the
region and strengthen democratic institutions, root out corruption, and
form an inclusive political process.

I look forward to deepening the partnership between our nations—and
friendship between our people—as we forge a better future.
