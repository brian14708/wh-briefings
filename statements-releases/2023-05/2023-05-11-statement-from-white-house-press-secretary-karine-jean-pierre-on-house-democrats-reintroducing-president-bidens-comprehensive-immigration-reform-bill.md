title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on House Democrats\
  \ Reintroducing President\_Biden\u2019s Comprehensive Immigration Reform\_Bill"
---
 
On his first day in office President Biden sent Congress a proposal to
fix our broken immigration system that this administration inherited. We
applaud Congresswoman Linda SÃ¡nchez and House Democrats for
reintroducing this legislation to responsibly manage and secure our
border, keep families and communities safe, and better manage migration
across the Western Hemisphere. Instead of coming to the table to work
together, House Republicans are playing politics and engaging in stunts
that would fail to solve the challenges at our border, while also
pushing deep spending cuts that would fire over 2,000 border patrol
agents and decrease our border security.
