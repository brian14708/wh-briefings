  \ Obrador of\_Mexico"

President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke today with President Andres Manuel
Lopez Obrador of Mexico. The two leaders discussed their ongoing efforts
to strengthen the U.S.-Mexico bilateral relationship, including the
importance of enhancing cooperation between the United States and Mexico
to manage unprecedented migration in the region. Toward that end, they
discussed continued close coordination between border authorities and
strong enforcement measures, in preparation for the return to full
reliance on Title 8 immigration authorities at the U.S.-Mexico border,
which carry steeper consequences for those removed than expulsion under
Title 42. Both leaders underscored the value of managing migration in a
humane and orderly fashion with expanded legal pathways and consequences
for irregular migration. They also affirmed their shared commitment to
address the root causes of migration from Central America and discussed
expanding our two nationsâ€™ joint efforts. They discussed the urgency of
effectively reducing crowding in northern Mexico. The two leaders
affirmed that after May 11th, they will continue to implement the
successful joint initiative which, over four months, achieved a 95
percent drop in border encounters of individuals from Cuba, Haiti,
Nicaragua, and Venezuela at the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Biden and President Lopez Obrador also acknowledged recent
positive developments in other areas of bilateral cooperation, including
enhanced and accelerated efforts to counter illicit fentanyl and arms
trafficking by dismantling criminal networks. President Biden committed
to using all available tools to address arms trafficking and reduce the
flow of firearms into Mexico. The leaders also reaffirmed their
commitment to modernize the shared border and promote inclusive economic
growth.
