President Biden will return to the United States on Sunday, following
the completion of the G7 summit, in order to be back for meetings with
Congressional leaders to ensure that Congress takes action by the
deadline to avert default. The President spoke to Prime Minister
Albanese earlier today to inform him that he will be postponing his trip
to Australia.  He also invited the Prime Minister for an official state
visit at a time to be agreed by the teams.  The President’s team engaged
with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea’s team to inform them as
well.

The President has made clear that members of Congress from both parties
and chambers must come together to prevent default, as they have 78
times before. The President and his team will continue to work with
Congressional leadership to deliver a budget agreement that can reach
the President’s desk.

Revitalizing and reinvigorating our alliances and advancing partnerships
like the Quad remains a key priority for the President. This is vital to
our ability to advance our foreign policy goals and better promote
global stability and prosperity. We look forward to finding other ways
to engage with Australia, the Quad, Papua New Guinea and the leaders of
the Pacific Islands Forum in the coming year.
