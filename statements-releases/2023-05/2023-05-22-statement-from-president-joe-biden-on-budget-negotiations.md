title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Budget\_Negotiations"
---
 
I just concluded a productive meeting with Speaker McCarthy about the
need to prevent default and avoid a catastrophe for our economy.  
   
We reiterated once again that default is off the table and the only way
to move forward is in good faith toward a bipartisan agreement.  
   
While there are areas of disagreement, the Speaker and I, and his lead
negotiators Chairman McHenry and Congressman Graves, and our staffs will
continue to discuss the path forward.
