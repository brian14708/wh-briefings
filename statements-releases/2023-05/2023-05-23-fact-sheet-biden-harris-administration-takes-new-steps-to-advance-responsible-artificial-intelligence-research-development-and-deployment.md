title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes New Steps to Advance Responsible\
  \ Artificial Intelligence Research, Development, and\_Deployment"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new efforts that
will advance the research, development, and deployment of responsible
artificial intelligence (AI) that protects individuals’ rights and
safety and delivers results for the American people.  
  
AI is one of the most powerful technologies of our time, with broad
applications. President Biden has been clear that in order to seize the
opportunities AI presents, we must first manage its risks. To that end,
the Administration has taken significant action to promote responsible
AI innovation that places people, communities, and the public good at
the center, and manages risks to individuals and our society, security,
and economy. This includes the landmark [Blueprint for an AI Bill of
Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) and [related
executive
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/10/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-key-actions-to-advance-tech-accountability-and-protect-the-rights-of-the-american-public/),
the [AI Risk Management
Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework), a
[roadmap for standing up a National AI Research
Resource](https://www.ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NAIRR-TF-Final-Report-2023.pdf),
active work to address the national security concerns raised by AI, as
well as [investments and
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/05/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-promote-responsible-ai-innovation-that-protects-americans-rights-and-safety/)
announced earlier this month. Last week, the Administration also
convened representatives from leading AI companies for a briefing from
experts across the national security community on cyber threats to AI
systems and best practices to secure high-value networks and
information.  
  
**<u>Today’s announcements include:</u>**

-   **An updated roadmap to focus federal investments in AI research and
    development (R&D):** The White House Office of Science and
    Technology Policy (OSTP) is releasing a [National AI R&D Strategic
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/National-Artificial-Intelligence-Research-and-Development-Strategic-Plan-2023-Update.pdf)—updated
    for the first time since 2019—a roadmap that outlines key priorities
    and goals for federal investments in AI R&D. Developed by experts
    across the federal government and with public input, this plan makes
    clear that when it comes to AI, the federal government will invest
    in R&D that promotes responsible American innovation, serves the
    public good, protects people’s rights and safety, and upholds
    democratic values. It will help ensure continued U.S. leadership in
    the development and use of trustworthy AI systems.
-   **A new request for public input on critical AI issues:** OSTP is
    issuing a [Request for Information
    (RFI)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OSTP-Request-for-Information-National-Priorities-for-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf)
    to seek input on national priorities for mitigating AI risks,
    protecting individuals’ rights and safety, and harnessing AI to
    improve lives. This RFI will support the Administration’s ongoing
    effort to advance a cohesive and comprehensive strategy to manage AI
    risks and harness AI opportunities. It complements work happening
    across the federal government to engage the public on critical AI
    issues.
-   **A new report on the risks and opportunities related to AI in
    education:** The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of
    Educational Technology is releasing a new report, [Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) and the Future of Teaching and Learning: Insights
    and
    Recommendations](https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf),
    summarizing the risks and opportunities related to AI in teaching,
    learning, research, and assessment. The report recognizes that AI
    can enable new forms of interaction between educators and students,
    help educators address variability in learning, increase feedback
    loops, and support educators. It also underscores the risks
    associated with AI—including algorithmic bias—and the importance of
    trust, safety, and appropriate guardrails.

In addition to these new announcements, the White House is hosting a
listening session with workers today to hear firsthand experiences with
employers’ use of automated technologies for surveillance, monitoring,
evaluation, and management. The listening session will include workers
representing diverse sectors of the economy, including call centers,
trucking, warehousing, health care, and gig work, as well as policy
experts, researchers, and policymakers. This listening session follows
an
[RFI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/05/01/hearing-from-the-american-people-how-are-automated-tools-being-used-to-surveil-monitor-and-manage-workers/)
released by OSTP earlier this month to advance the Administration’s
understanding of the design, deployment, prevalence, and impacts of
automated technologies that monitor and track workers.
