title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Selection of Ajay Banga to Lead\
  \ the World\_Bank"
---
 
I want to congratulate Ajay Banga — my nominee for the next President of
the World Bank — on his resounding approval by the Bank’s Board of
Governors.

Ajay Banga will be a transformative leader, bringing expertise,
experience, and innovation to the position of World Bank President. And
together with World Bank leadership and shareholders, he will help steer
the institution as it evolves and expands to address global challenges
that directly affect its core mission of poverty reduction—including
climate change. Ajay will also be integral in bringing together the
public and private sectors, alongside philanthropies, to usher in the
fundamental changes in development finance that this moment requires.

I look forward to working with Ajay in his new role and to supporting
his efforts to transform the World Bank, which remains one of humanity’s
most critical institutions to reduce poverty and expand prosperity
around the globe.
