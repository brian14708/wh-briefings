title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on North Carolina\u2019\
  s Abortion\_Ban"
---
 
Today, North Carolina’s Republican supermajority-controlled legislature
passed an extreme abortion ban that would interfere with the
doctor-patient relationship and make it even harder for women —
especially those in the South — to access care. The details of this ban
have been obscured to make it seem less dangerous, but this bill would
make it harder for many women to get the care they need. Since the
Supreme Court’s decision overturning *Roe v. Wade*, women have been
denied medical care they desperately need in order to preserve their
health and even save their lives. They’ve been turned away from
emergency rooms, made to travel hundreds of miles for care, and left
with complications that threaten their ability to bear children in the
future. These impacts are the direct result of extreme state-level
abortion bans. President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue
to fight to restore the protections of *Roe* under federal law.
