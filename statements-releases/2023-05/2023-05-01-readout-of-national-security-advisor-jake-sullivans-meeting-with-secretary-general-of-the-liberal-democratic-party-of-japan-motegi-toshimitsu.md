National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with the Secretary
General of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, MOTEGI Toshimitsu, to
discuss the regional security environment and U.S.-Japan relations. Both
officials underscored their commitment to strengthening bilateral
economic and security cooperation, affirmed their resolve to continue
supporting Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia’s brutal and
unlawful invasion, and discussed the importance of increasing
multilateral cooperation across the region, including with the Republic
of Korea.  Mr. Sullivan noted that President Biden looks forward to
meeting Prime Minister Kishida at the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Hiroshima
this month. The two officials committed to continue deepening the
bilateral partnership to advance their shared vision for a free and open
Indo-Pacific.
