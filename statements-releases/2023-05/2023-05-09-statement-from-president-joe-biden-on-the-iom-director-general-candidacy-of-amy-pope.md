title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the IOM Director General Candidacy\
  \ of Amy\_Pope"
---
 
Amy Pope is an innovative, strategic leader with impeccable
qualifications, and I strongly support her candidacy to serve as the
next Director General of the International Organization for Migration
(IOM). As we grapple with record levels of displacement worldwide, IOM
needs a forward-looking leader who will position the organization to
address the challenges we face. I have worked first-hand with Amy over
her 20-year career in migration and disaster relief. Amy has the
necessary experience to effectively mobilize IOM and its Members to
respond to rising migration challenges, including the impacts of a
changing climate, with innovative and inclusive solutions. She is the
right person for the job. I ask IOM Member States to join the United
States in voting for Amy Pope at the upcoming IOM elections in Geneva,
Switzerland.
