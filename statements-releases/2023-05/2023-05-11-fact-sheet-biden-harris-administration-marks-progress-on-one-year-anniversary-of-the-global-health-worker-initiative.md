title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Marks Progress On One Year Anniversary\
  \ of the Global Health Worker\_Initiative"
---
 
One year ago, the White House launched the [Global Health Worker
Initiative
(GHWI)](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-global-health-worker-initiative/),
recognizing that a health workforce that is supported, equipped and
protected to provide essential public health functions is integral to
reclaiming lost ground from the COVID-19 pandemic and preparing for
future health threats. This initiative aims to meet an urgent need: the
World Health Organization expects a global shortfall of 10 million
health workers by 2030, mostly in low- and middle-income countries.
Through the GHWI we are better aligning investments in health workers
across the U.S. Government, building stronger partnerships on health
workforce with bilateral partners, multilateral institutions, including
the World Health Organization, and other philanthropic partners, and
reorienting our global health programs toward cohesive efforts that
build stronger and more resilient health systems.  
   
The United States is providing approximately $10 billion in global
health program funding with Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 funds. U.S. Government
programs such as the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
(PEPFAR), the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), and U.S.
bilateral global health security partnerships in support of the Global
Health Security Agenda, contribute more than $1.6 billion annually to
support the health workforce across the globe. Building on those ongoing
investments, the President’s FY 2024 Budget requests increased
investments across health programs to strengthen health systems and the
global health workforce, including $20 million in new resources to
directly support the Global Health Worker Initiative.  
   
The GHWI has four pillars focused on: 1) protecting and supporting
health workers; 2) expanding the global health workforce and
accelerating economic development; 3) advancing equity and inclusion;
and 4) driving and investing in technological advancements and
innovation. One year into our implementation of the GHWI, we have
delivered concrete outcomes, including:  
   
**PROTECTING and SUPPORTING HEALTH WORKERS**  
   
The United States has worked to protect health workers by prioritizing
their access to vaccines and personal protective equipment, and working
to safeguard them from violence, including in conflict and humanitarian
settings. For example:  
 

-   **The United States is supporting efforts to learn how to prevent
    and mitigate consequences from attacks on health workers.** As part
    of continuing efforts to support global tracking of attacks on
    health workers, the U.S. Agency for International Development
    (USAID) supports research on the impact of attacks on health and
    best practices for preventing attacks, improving reporting across
    countries, and identifying ways to mitigate consequences on the
    mental and psychosocial health of health workers and provision of
    health service delivery. In 2022, the United States joined more than
    100 countries to co-sponsor a resolution at the World Health
    Assembly calling on Member States to take key actions related to
    planning, financing, education, employment and protections for the
    health and care workforce, with support from the World Health
    Organization.  
-   **The United States is building health worker capacity to advance
    global health security.** This year, the United States has expanded
    support to assist 50 countries to achieve specific health security
    goals and to catalyze support for another 50 countries. This effort
    will continue to increase health workforce capacity, including
    through support for laboratory staff, epidemiologists,
    veterinarians, information technology and social communication
    specialists. In FY 2022, USAID, in partnership with the Africa One
    Health University Network and the Southeast Asia One Health
    University Network, supported workforce development in
    120 universities across 17 countries in Africa and Southeast Asia,
    training over 7,000 health workers in FY 2022 to prevent, detect,
    and respond to global health security threats.

   
**EXPANDING THE GLOBAL HEALTH WORKFORCE AND ACCELERATE ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT**  
  
The United States has worked to expand the global health workforce and
accelerate economic development by creating career pathways, expanding
paid employment, and better equipping health workers to meet population
health needs. For example:  
 

-   **The United States is investing in primary health care workers as
    the backbone of health system recovery.** At the U.S.-Africa Leaders
    Summit in December, [USAID announced the
    launch](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/apr-20-2023-administrator-samantha-power-calls-for-new-strategic-approach-to-regain-global-health-progress-and-invest-in-primary-health-care-workers)
    of Primary Impact, an effort to advance primary health care (PHC)
    working in partnership with governments in seven focus countries in
    Africa and Asia: Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi,
    Indonesia, and the Philippines. Through Primary Impact, the United
    States aims to build country capacity to effectively manage and
    finance health worker production and employment, which is critical
    for the under-resourced ranks of primary health care workers.
    Priorities for advancing primary health care and supporting health
    workers were also integrated into the new [USAID Policy
    Framework](https://www.usaid.gov/policy/documents/mar-23-2023-usaids-policy-framework)
    launched in March 2023.  
-   **Last year, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
    (PEPFAR) supported health workers around the world,** including over
    169,000 community health workers; over 11,000 doctors, medical
    officers and medical assistants; nearly 20,000 nurses and midwives;
    40,000 social work and case management staff; over 6,000 laboratory
    staff and nearly 3,000 pharmacy staff; critically skilled health
    workers, including over 160 epidemiologists and nearly 700 mental
    health providers; and over 7,000 highly skilled and experienced
    technical assistance providers and trainers.  
-   **Community health workers are a critical cadre in delivery of
    services supported across global health programs, and the United
    States supports efforts to professionalize these cadres across the
    globe**. In June 2021, the U.S. PMI changed their policy to allow
    for the payment of community health worker (CHW) salaries and
    stipends with PMI funds, while advancing efforts to catalyze other
    donors and work with partner governments on a sustainable approach
    for governments to assume primary responsibility for health worker
    salaries over time. In addition to supporting efforts in Liberia and
    Guinea to ensure that CHWs are paid using domestic resources, PMI
    has conducted assessments to lay out a path for transferring
    community health worker salaries to governments, including in Sierra
    Leone. USAID is the primary funder and founding member of the
    country-led, global [Community Health Roadmap
    partnership](https://www.communityhealthroadmap.org/) that supports
    more than 15 countries to professionalize and integrate CHWs into
    health systems. Through this partnership, USAID supported the 3rd
    International CHW Symposium in March 2023, led by the Government of
    Liberia. The symposium culminated in a [Monrovia Call to
    Action](https://chwsymposiumliberia2023.org/2023/03/27/the-monrovia-call-to-action-launched-by-the-liberia-ministry-of-health-at-2023-chw-symposium/)
    by 46 countries that calls for investments in country-led community
    health strategies, professionalizing CHW roles, and integrating CHWs
    into health sector plans, among other areas. Due in part to this
    strong partnership, the Government of Liberia announced in March
    2023 that they will be allocating $1.6 million to support the
    payment of CHW supervisors the President of Guinea signed a new law
    in April 2023 committing the government to paying CHW salaries.  
-   **The United States is supporting multilateral institutions to build
    a sustainable health workforce.** The United States is supporting
    the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) in advancing regional
    dialogue on the investment and protection of the health workforce
    and in the development of the Human Resources for Health (HRH)
    Investment Charter, which aims to align and stimulate investments to
    halve inequities in access to health workers; especially in those
    African countries identified as having the greatest shortages.

**ADVANCING EQUITY AND INCLUSION**  
  
The United States is working to advance equity and inclusion by
addressing barriers, including gender, racial/ethnic, geographic, age,
and others, to build a more diverse cohort of health workers and health
leaders who truly reflect their communities. For example:

-   **The United States is promoting fair and timely pay for all health
    workers.** GHWI priorities are aligned with the White House
    [National Strategy on Gender Equity and
    Equality](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/22/fact-sheet-national-strategy-on-gender-equity-and-equality/)
    and the Biden-Harris Administration’s enduring commitment to
    workers’ rights, in support of building the global care economy and
    care infrastructure, and strengthening women’s economic security in
    the health workforce, including by addressing pay inequity,
    harassment, and other barriers to career advancement.  
-   **The United States is creating a more equitable and inclusive
    health workforce to support reduction in maternal and child
    mortality.** USAID launched the [2023-2030 Preventing Child and
    Maternal Deaths
    Framework](https://www.usaid.gov/PreventingChildAndMaternalDeaths/framework),
    which includes the health workforce as one of six strategic
    approaches to further reduce maternal and child mortality across
    priority countries and expand access to high quality equitable care.
    Across Ghana, India, Madagascar, and the Caribbean region, USAID is
    working with country stakeholders to improve nursing and midwifery
    policy issues aimed at improving reproductive, maternal, newborn,
    and child health outcomes.  
-   **PEPFAR released its Five-Year Strategy: Fulfilling America’s
    Promise to End the HIV/AIDS Pandemic by 2030.** **To advance
    Africa’s commitment to increase and retain health care workers, in
    December 2022, PEPFAR committed to investing approximately $1.1
    billion annually to support the more than 325,000 health workers in
    the region who enable the delivery of HIV/AIDS programs. The support
    for this health workforce will not only protect and scale HIV gains,
    but can also be leveraged to fight outbreaks and other disease
    threats.** Important work is also happening in Asia, with an
    emphasis on building health worker capacity at the community and
    national level to address the HIV epidemic. For example, in
    Thailand, PEPFAR-supported community health workers were trained to
    investigate gender-based violence and intimate partner violence and
    now use protocols to guide their work with key population clients.
    In Cambodia, PEPFAR collaborated with the government to train health
    care providers on non-discrimination.

   
**DRIVING AND INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AND INNOVATION**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is working to drive and invest in
technological advancements and innovation to equip health workers with
the ability to provide more efficient, quality-integrated service
delivery, including through the use of digital platforms. For example:

-   **The United States is building the capacity of laboratory workers
    and epidemiologists to detect global health threats.** Through the
    Global Laboratory Leadership Program, the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention (CDC) mentors current and emerging laboratory
    leaders to build, strengthen, and sustain national laboratory
    systems with a One Health focus. The Field Epidemiology Training
    Program (FETP) strengthens countries’ capacity to prevent, detect,
    and respond to public health threats.  FETP graduates were mobilized
    during recent outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever and Crimean-Congo
    hemorrhagic fever in Mauritania, Sudan Ebolavirus in Uganda, and the
    2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, as well as the COVID-19 response in
    multiple countries.  
-   **The United States is improving the availability of health worker
    data to improve quality of care.** USAID supported the revision of
    the Service Provision Assessment (SPA) survey, part of USAID’s
    Demographic and Health Surveys Program which has implemented over
    400 surveys in over 90 countries across the globe. This revision was
    conducted to support the need for better health worker protection
    including: the availability of infection prevention items, health
    workers’ professional qualifications and background, recent
    in-service training, supportive supervision, fair and timely
    payment, equal treatment and opportunities irrespective of gender,
    direct and proxy work satisfaction, including their experience of
    abuse at work. The resulting data will be used to inform more
    effective policies to protect and support health workers and build
    stronger health systems.  
-   **The ASEAN Science and Technology Fellowship,** now in its fifth
    cycle, is a partnership between the ASEAN Foundation, ASEAN
    Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation, ASEAN Secretariat
    and the U.S. Government that provides opportunities for scientists
    in Southeast Asia to apply their knowledge and skills in promoting
    evidence-based policy making in the region. Now in its fifth
    cycle. This year the themes are Digital Economy, Innovative Startups
    and Science, Technology and Innovation for the United Nation’s
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
