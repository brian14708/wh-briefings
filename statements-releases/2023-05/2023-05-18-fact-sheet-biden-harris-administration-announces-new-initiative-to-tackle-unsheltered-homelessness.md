title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Initiative to\
  \ Tackle Unsheltered\_Homelessness"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris administration will announce the launch of *ALL
INside,* a first-of-its-kind initiative to address unsheltered
homelessness across the country. ALL INside is a key part of [*All In:
The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End
Homelessness*](https://www.usich.gov/All_In_The_Federal_Strategic_Plan_to_Prevent_and_End_Homelessness.pdf),
which set a bold goal to reduce homelessness 25 percent by 2025 and
ultimately build a country where every person has a safe and affordable
home.  
  
Through the ALL INside initiative, the U.S. Interagency Council on
Homelessness (USICH) and its 19 federal member agencies will partner
with state and local governments to strengthen and accelerate local
efforts to get unsheltered people into homes in six places: **Chicago,
Dallas, Los Angeles, Phoenix Metro, Seattle**, and the **State of
California**.  
  
To accelerate ongoing efforts by local leaders, the Biden-Harris
Administration will offer innovative and tailored support to
participating communities for up to two years, including by:

-   Embedding a dedicated federal official in each community to
    accelerate locally-driven strategies and enact system-level changes
    to reduce unsheltered homelessness;  
-   Deploying dedicated teams across the federal government to identify
    opportunities for regulatory relief and flexibilities, navigate
    federal funding streams, and facilitate a peer learning network
    across the communities; and  
-   Convening philanthropy, the private sector, and other communities to
    identify opportunities for follow-on support and collaboration.

In addition, the Administration will launch new efforts to address major
barriers to housing, health care, and other support for people
experiencing unsheltered homelessness. They include: 

-   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will provide
    technical assistance to help communities leverage federal programs
    like Medicaid to cover and provide housing-related supportive
    services and behavioral health care.  
-   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S.
    Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration
    (SSA), and HHS will collaborate to address barriers that people may
    encounter when obtaining various forms of government-issued
    identification and other critical documents.  
-   The SSA will work with the communities and the federal *ALL INside*
    team to leverage data-sharing and regulatory flexibilities that can
    help facilitate access to support services like housing vouchers or
    Medicaid.  
-   The U.S. Department of Labor will connect the communities with local
    workforce boards and Job Corps sites to fully leverage local and
    state government employment opportunities for unsheltered youth.   
-   The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide technical
    assistance to the communities to facilitate greater operational
    coordination in response to disasters, which often increase
    homelessness.  
-   HUD will help communities troubleshoot barriers to connecting people
    to rental assistance or housing programs, as well as assist
    communities to use regulatory flexibilities to speed up the
    processes enabling residents to move into properties and transition
    into permanent housing.

Additional USICH member agencies, including AmeriCorps, Department of
Agriculture, Department of Justice, Department of Energy, Department of
Transportation, the General Services Administration, as well as the
Department of the Treasury, have also made commitments to support the
ALL INside communities.

Today’s announcement builds on historic support by the Biden-Harris
Administration to help states and cities battle homelessness. President
Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP)—which represents the largest
single-year investment in ending homelessness in U.S. history—helped
prevent a surge of homelessness. Through the Treasury Department’s State
and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund, for instance, the six *ALL INside* sites
have invested more than $2.5 billion in projects focused on reducing and
preventing homelessness. The ARP provided $5 billion for 70,000
Emergency Housing Vouchers—the first HUD voucher specifically for people
experiencing homelessness beyond veterans. The ARP also delivered over
$21 billion in emergency rental assistance, standing up a
first-of-its-kind national eviction prevention infrastructure that has
helped 8 million struggling households make rent and pay utilities
bills, and kept eviction filings below pre-pandemic levels in the 1.5
years after the end of the eviction moratorium. Through the *House
America* initiative, HUD and USICH worked with more than 100 communities
to make the most of the American Rescue Plan; and in just over a year,
they helped more than 100,000 people experiencing homelessness move into
permanent homes.  
  
Earlier this year, HUD
[released](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_079)
a first-of-its-kind package of grants totaling $486 million and
approximately 3,300 housing vouchers to help 62 communities address
unsheltered homelessness and homeless encampments, including $60 million
to Chicago, $22 million to Dallas, $60 million to Los Angeles, and $36
million to other communities across the state of California.  
  
The President’s Fiscal Year ‘24 Budget proposes unprecedented
investments not only to urgently address homelessness but also to
[prevent
homelessness](https://www.usich.gov/news/how-president-bidens-fy-2024-budget-would-prevent-homelessness),
including through additional housing vouchers; emergency rental
assistance; increasing the supply of affordable housing; and
establishing a guarantee of rental assistance for extremely low-income
veterans and youth aging out of foster care—two groups
disproportionately at risk of and experiencing homelessness.
