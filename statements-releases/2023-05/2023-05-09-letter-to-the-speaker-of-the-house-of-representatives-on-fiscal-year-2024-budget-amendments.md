title: "Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Fiscal Year 2024\
  \ Budget\_Amendments"

Dear Mr. Speaker:  
  
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget
amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education,
Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation as
well as the Environmental Protection Agency and for International
Assistance Programs.  These amendments would not change the base
discretionary budget authority requested in my FY 2024 Budget.  
  
Also included is an amendment providing increased amounts for the
National Science Foundation (NSF) STEM Education account.  This increase
is fully offset from amounts provided from within NSF and the Department
of Agriculture.  Also included for consideration are amendments shifting
amounts provided from within the Department of Defense for higher
priority programs.  
  
This transmittal also contains FY 2024 Budget amendments for
the Legislative Branch.  As a matter of comity and tradition, these
appropriations requests for the Legislative Branch are transmitted
without change.  These amendments would decrease by $17 million the
overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2024 Budget.  
  
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

                                                                       
                 Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
