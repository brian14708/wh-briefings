National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with
President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon.  They discussed the close and
enduring bond between the United States and Gabon, as well as a number
of global and regional matters, to include cooperation during Gabon’s
current term on the United Nations Security Council.  Mr. Sullivan
reiterated appreciation for President Bongo’s participation at the
U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022, including the meeting that
President Biden hosted on the importance of free, fair, and transparent
elections.  Mr. Sullivan and President Bongo affirmed the importance of
tackling security challenges in the Gulf of Guinea and Central Africa
region.  To that end, Mr. Sullivan announced Gabon’s selection for the
Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program. 
Gabon will be paired with a State National Guard in the coming months
and work jointly with the National Guard to tailor the program to its
specific capability gaps and needs.  Mr. Sullivan thanked President
Bongo for his leadership on climate and conservation, including in our
shared Atlantic Ocean region, and they pledged to deepen collaboration
on these important issues.
