The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) held its fourth
ministerial meeting in Luleå, Sweden on May 30-31, 2023. U.S. Co-Chairs
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina
Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai were
joined by EU Co-Chairs European Commission Executive Vice Presidents
Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis to review progress, meet with
a range of U.S. and EU stakeholders, and further enhance Transatlantic
cooperation on trade and technology that delivers for workers and
consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Our nearly 800 million citizens share common values and principles that
directly support the largest economic relationship in the world.  The
changing international environment requires joint collaboration to meet
the opportunities and challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and the
TTC is a key mechanism to deliver economic growth and prosperity for our
citizens.  The deep and binding ties between the United States and the
European Union have been further strengthened through our unprecedented
cooperation in response to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, as seen
in our deep alignment on sanctions and export controls.  We have
enhanced collaboration to address non-market policies, practices, and
economic coercion, while emphasizing our enduring commitment to
democratic governance, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. 

TTC working groups are broadening and deepening U.S.-EU cooperation in
both trade and technology through their work on key areas of our $7
trillion economic relationship, including cooperation on technology
standards, sustainable trade, support for innovation, export controls,
efforts to counter the misuse of technology that undermines the
functioning of democracies and human rights, and cooperation in third
countries to support trusted partners in information and communications
technology services provision.  Across the board, the TTC working groups
are collaborating to address a range of shared challenges in the global
economy, including on non-market policies and practices and coercive
economic actions that run counter to our free market economic systems
and hinder economic growth, including for our small- and medium-sized
enterprises. 

To inform dialogue and information exchange in the TTC working groups,
these mechanisms have incorporated critical input from a broad spectrum
of U.S. and EU stakeholders, including industry, labor unions and
organizations, academia and think tanks, non-profit organizations,
environmental groups, and other members of civil society.  Continued,
robust stakeholder input will be essential to the TTC’s further work.  

During their fourth ministerial meeting, the U.S. and EU TTC co-chairs
reviewed progress and announced key initiatives including:

-   Identification of key tools and technologies critical to Russia’s
    illegal war in Ukraine, further collaboration to counter evasion of
    our unprecedented sanctions and export controls, and intensification
    of efforts to tighten enforcement against potential violators;
-   Collaboration to maximize clean energy development, accelerate the
    transition to a net zero emission economy no later than 2050,

    Transatlantic economy through the U.S.-EU Clean Energy Incentives
    Dialogue;

    bolster Transatlantic preparedness and resilience in support of our

    the G7 Hiroshima process;
-   Establishment of an internal catalogue between the European
    Commission and the U.S. Government’s scientific agencies of relevant

    energy grid optimization, and agriculture optimization;
