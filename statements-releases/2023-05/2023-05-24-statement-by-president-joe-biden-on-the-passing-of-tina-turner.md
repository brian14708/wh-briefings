title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Tina\_Turner"
---
 
Before she was the Queen of Rock and Roll, Tina Turner was a farmer’s
daughter in Tennessee. As a child, she sang in the church choir before
becoming one of the most successful recording artists of all time.

With 12 Grammy Awards, she was the only woman to win in the pop, rock,
and R&B categories, a signal of her versatility, creativity, and broad
appeal. Millions flocked to her concerts. Her high-octane dance
performances were legendary. And her iconic hits – including “Proud
Mary,” “The Best,” “What’s Love Got to Do with It” – continue to be
treasured, and sung at full volume, by generations of fans.

In addition to being a once-in-a-generation talent that changed American
music forever, Tina’s personal strength was remarkable. Overcoming
adversity, and even abuse, she built a career for the ages and a life
and legacy that were entirely hers.

Jill and I send our love and prayers to her husband Erwin, the rest of
the Turner family, and fans around the world who are mourning today for
the woman they agree was “simply the best.”
