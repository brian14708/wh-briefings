title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with CEOs on Advancing Responsible Artificial\
  \ Intelligence\_Innovation"
---
 
Today, Vice President Harris and senior Administration officials met
with CEOs of four American companies at the forefront of AI innovation
to share concerns about the risks associated with AI. President Biden
dropped by the meeting to underscore that companies have a fundamental
responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure before
they are deployed or made public.  
   
The President and Vice President were clear that in order to realize the
benefits that might come from advances in AI, it is imperative to
mitigate both the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals,
society, and national security. These include risks to safety, security,
human and civil rights, privacy, jobs, and democratic values.  
   
Given the role these CEOs and their companies play in America’s AI
innovation ecosystem, Administration officials also emphasized the
importance of their leadership, called on them to model responsible
behavior, and to take action to ensure responsible innovation and
appropriate safeguards, and protect people’s rights and safety. This
includes taking action consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration’s
Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and the AI Risk Management
Framework.  
   
The meeting also included frank and constructive discussion on three key
areas: the need for companies to be more transparent with policymakers,
the public, and others about their AI systems; the importance of being
able to evaluate, verify, and validate the safety, security, and
efficacy of AI systems; and the need to ensure AI systems are secure
from malicious actors and attacks.  
   
Administration officials and CEOs agreed that more work is needed to
develop and ensure appropriate safeguards and protections, and CEOs
committed to continue engaging with the Administration to ensure the
American people are able to benefit from AI innovation.  
   
Today’s meeting was part of a broader, ongoing effort to engage with
advocates, companies, researchers, civil rights organizations,
not-for-profit organizations, communities, international partners, and
others on critical AI issues. This effort builds on the considerable
steps the Administration has taken to date to promote responsible
innovation and risk mitigation in AI. This includes [additional actions
