title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Historic Agreement to Protect Colorado\
  \ River\_System"
---
 
Today’s agreement between the Department of the Interior and seven
Colorado River Basin states on a consensus-based approach marks an
important step forward in our efforts to protect the stability of the
Colorado River System in the face of climate change and historic drought
conditions. Thanks to my Investing in America agenda, we are deploying
record resources to support water conservation and improve the Colorado
River’s long-term sustainability.  This approach will benefit the 40
million people who rely on the Colorado River Basin for agriculture,
drinking water, and power, and is a critical step to building a
sustainable, resilient future for states, Tribes and communities
throughout the West.
