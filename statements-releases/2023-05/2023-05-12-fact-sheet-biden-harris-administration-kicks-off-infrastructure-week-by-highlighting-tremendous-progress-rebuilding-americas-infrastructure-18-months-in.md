title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Kicks off Infrastructure Week\
  \ by Highlighting Tremendous Progress Rebuilding America\u2019s Infrastructure 18\
  \ Months\_In"
---
 
*Announced over $220 billion in funding, now over 32,000 projects across
4,500 communities across the country as part of President Biden’s
Investing in America agenda*

  
Just 18 months ago, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law – a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s infrastructure
and competitiveness. While “Infrastructure Week” became a punchline
under his predecessor, President Biden is investing in America to
deliver an “infrastructure decade.” As part of the President’s Investing
in America agenda, the Biden-Harris Administration is rebuilding our
roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes to provide clean water, cleaning
up legacy pollution, expanding access to affordable, high-speed
internet, and ushering in a new era of clean energy.  
  
To date, the Administration has announced **over $220 billion in
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, including over 32,000 specific
projects and awards,** across over 4,500 communities in all 50 states,
D.C., and territories. To implement the law, agencies have now hired
over 5,000 federal employees, and states and territories have appointed
infrastructure coordinators to facilitate clear communication and
coordination with the federal government.  The White House has created
build.gov as a one-stop shop for information about the law and driven
massive technical assistance to communities- directly from the
government, as well as partners and philanthropy.  The President, Vice
President, Cabinet, and senior federal leaders, have taken more than 300
trips to all 50 states, as well as D.C., Puerto Rico, and the
territories, to discuss this once-in-a-generation opportunity with
community members. Today, the White House Infrastructure Implementation
Team released a [new map highlighting signature projects in all 50
states](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/), along with a map showcasing
the more than [32,000 projects and
awards](https://d2d.gsa.gov/report/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-bil-maps-dashboard)
identified or underway.  
  
Implementation of the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a key
piece of his Investing in America agenda, which is growing the economy
from the bottom up and middle out – **driving over $470 billion in
private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments** in the
United States and creating good-paying jobs that don’t require a
four-year degree. In particular, there have been major new private
sector manufacturing announcements in electric vehicle (EV) charging, EV
battery, rail, buses and fiberoptic cable manufacturing spurred by
infrastructure investments and our Made in America policies.

**FROM BREAKING GROUND TO CUTTING RIBBONS ON MAJOR PROJECTS  
  
**Key projects are moving forward across the country – many of which had
been waiting decades on the sidelines – thanks to the historic
investments from the Biden-Harris Administration. This includes:

-   **Brent Spence Bridge**: In Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington,
    Kentucky, more than $1.6 billion in federal grant funds will upgrade
    the existing Brent Spence Bridge and build a new bridge dedicated to
    interstate drivers to improve traffic along I-71/I-75, a critical
    freight route from Canada to Florida. After years of failed
    promises, the project will break ground later this year. 
-   **Golden Gate Bridge:** In San Francisco, California, more than $400
    million was awarded to the Golden Gate Bridge from the competitive
    Bridge Investment Program to replace, retrofit and install critical
    structural elements to increase resiliency against earthquakes.
-   **Walk Bridge:** In New Haven, Connecticut, the Federal Railroad
    Administration will break ground this week on the Walk Bridge
    Replacement, which carries four tracks of the New Haven Line,
    utilized by Metro North and Amtrak and running between New Haven,
    Connecticut, and Mount Vernon, New York. The bridge is one of the
    oldest and most crucial bridges of the Northeast Corridor, and the
    new structure will enhance safety and resiliency while minimizing
    delays and disruptions to riders.
-   **West Mission Bay Bridge:** In San Diego, California, the ribbon
    was cut for the new 6-lane bridge with pedestrian and bike paths,
    safety barriers, and improved traffic signals which was funded in
    large part by $80 million through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
-   **Frederick Douglass Tunnel:** In Baltimore, Maryland, work is
    underway to replace the 150-year-old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel,
    with Amtrak and North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU)
    signing a project labor agreement and early work, such as
    demolition, utility relocations, and select track work set to begin
    later this calendar year. The project will generate up to 30,000
    jobs, and the Federal Railroad Administration is currently reviewing
    an application for the tunnel project.
-   **Boston Logan International Airport**: In Boston, Massachusetts,
    Boston Logan International Airport was awarded $62 million as a part
    of the new Airport Terminal Program – the most awarded to any major
    U.S. airport – to fund improvements to critical roadways and
    Terminal E that were eliminated due to COVID-related financial
    constraints.
-   **Orlando International Airport**: In Orlando, Florida, the Orlando
    International Airport (MCO) has been awarded $69 million for two
    Terminal C expansion projects including constructing new gates and
    expanding their pedestrian connector bridge.
-   **Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Area Flood Risk Management Project:**
    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and their partners the Metro Flood
    Diversion Authority are accelerating efforts to complete
    construction of a major $2.9 billion flood risk project in the
    Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area in North Dakota thanks to funding
    from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to better protect
    the major health, education, cultural and commercial center from
    flooding.
-   **Montgomery Locks and Dam:** On the Upper Ohio River in
    Pennsylvania, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded over $857
    million to construct a new lock chamber at Montgomery Locks and Dam
    that will allow more barges to reliably and efficiently pass through
    the Upper Ohio River system, relieving landside congestion and
    facilitating timely delivery of goods. Work is underway.
-   **Diablo Canyon**: The Department of Energy announced that it is
    providing up to $1.1 billion to prevent the closure of the Diablo
    Canyon Power Plant which provides up 8.6 percent of California’s
    total electricity.
-   **Arkansas Valley Conduit:** The Department of the Interior is
    providing $100 million from the Infrastructure Law and annual
    appropriations to finally break ground on the Arkansas Valley
    Conduit, a major water infrastructure project that once completed
    will serve 39 southeastern Colorado communities. 
-   **B.F. Sisk Dam:** A more than $125 million investment is supporting
    active construction on safety upgrades and improvements at B.F. Sisk
    Dam, an essential piece of infrastructure that supports water
    supplies for Central Valley communities.
-   **Navajo Gallup Water Supply:** To bring clean, reliable drinking
    water to Tribal communities and the city of Gallup, the Interior
    Department has provided $123 million to help support the Navajo
    Gallup Water Supply Project which is underway.  
-   **Mescalero Apache Tribal Bridge:** The Department of Transportation
    and the Department of the Interior broke ground on a bridge and
    tunnel project in the Mescalero Apache Tribal community, that will
    support the local economy and serves as a main entry for Mescalero’s
    revenue-generating businesses.

**  
18 MONTHS OF DELIVERING INFRASTRUCTURE RESULTS  
**  
The Biden-Harris Administration has made notable progress implementing
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law across key sectors.

-   **Roads & Bridges**: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the
    largest investment in roads and bridges since President Eisenhower’s
    investment in the interstate highway system, including $40 billion
    for bridges alone – the largest dedicated investment in bridges
    ever. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has launched over
    4,600 bridge projects and begin repair on over 69,000 miles of
    roads. The Administration is also investing in road safety, awarding
    over $800 million for more than 500 projects directly to cities and
    counties from the Safe Streets for All program to invest in safety
    planning and roadway safety projects. The Department of
    Transportation also awarded $185 million for planning and
    construction for 45 projects that seek to connect communities
    divided by transportation infrastructure through the Reconnecting
    Communities Pilot Program.

<!-- -->

-   **Rail:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $66 billion for
    passenger and freight rail, the largest investment since the
    inception of Amtrak and an unprecedented investment in rail safety.
    To date, The Biden-Harris Administration has made $9 billion
    available for Northeast Corridor rail projects and another $4.6
    billion through the Fed-State Program to expand rail service outside
    of the Northeast Corridor. Ridership on the Northeast Corridor has
    surpassed pre-pandemic levels and service suspended during the
    pandemic has been fully restored an all routes. Major capital
    projects are underway and are meeting significant milestones,
    including finalizing the funding agreement for Hudson Yards concrete
    casing and initiating procurements for East River Tunnel, Frederick
    Douglass Tunnel and Susquehanna River Bridge.  Through the CRISI
    program, FRA has advanced vital projects that enhance safety,
    strengthen supply chains, and get people and goods where they need
    to be with increased reliability. Amtrak has obligated $4.3 billion
    to upgrade tracks, improve rail infrastructure, and purchase a new
    fleet of trains.  Twenty-one new locomotives have been delivered to
    Amtrak to date.
-   **Airports:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion
    for airports, including the first-ever funding for major airport
    terminals. To date, The Biden-Harris Administration has awarded
    nearly $2 billion in awards for the Airport Terminal Program for
    hundreds of airport terminal projects across 42 states. Of the first
    year’s awards, now 70 projects are in construction. Through the
    Airport Investment Grants Program, the Biden-Harris Administration
    is funding improvements at over 3,000 airports across the country,
    including 600 airport infrastructure projects and over 400 pavement
    projects.
-   **Ports and Waterways:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests
    $17 billion for ports and waterways. To date, The Biden-Harris
    Administration has announced nearly $4 billion in U.S. Army Corps of
    Engineers funding for navigation improvements at coastal ports and
    inland waterways – including major projects like Soo Locks,
    Montgomery Locks, Houston Ship Channel and Norfolk Harbor. Now, 5
    major port and waterway projects are under construction with more
    starting in the coming weeks. The U.S. Army Corps Noyes Cut Project
    in Georgia was the first project completed by the Corps using
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding. The Department of
    Transportation has also awarded $703 million to 41 port projects
    across the country through DOT’s Port Infrastructure Development
    Program (FY22), several of which will get underway in the coming
    months.
-   **Transit:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest
    investment in public transit ever at nearly $90 billion – including
    billions to electrify or upgrade our bus, rail, and ferry fleets. To
    date, the Biden-Harris Administration has funded over 3,500 clean
    school and transit buses through Environmental Protection Agency and
    the Department of Transportation. School buses built in the United
    States have already reached districts across the country – like the
    first LionC zero-emission bus funded under the program that was sent
    from a factory in Joliet, Illinois, to the Mount Desert Island
    Regional School System in Bar Harbor, Maine last December. Last
    year, the Department of Transportation’s Low and No Emission Bus
    Program awarded over $1.6 billion which will double the number of
    clean transit buses on America’s roads. Beyond helping electrify the
    nation’s bus fleet, the Department of Transportation also funded 23
    projects in 11 states to support rural, electric, and low-emission
    passenger ferries, including funding for both new vessels and pier
    and dock infrastructure in rural communities. This funding will be
    particularly impactful in communities throughout the Insular Areas
    and Alaska, where ferries are often the primary means of
    transportation. DOT also awarded $686 million in grants that will
    improve rail station accessibility for 15 grants in 9 states through
    the All Stations Accessibility Program, with construction at most
    stations now underway. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    passed, over $7.4 billion in funding has been put to support 60
    public transit projects across the country through the Capital
    Investment Grant Program. As part of the President’s FY24 Budget,
    the Administration recommended 18 large transit projects in 11
    states to receive $4.45 billion through the CIG program.  
-   **Electric Vehicle Charging, EV Batteries & Critical Materials**:
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest – and first –
    investment in EV charging with $7.5 billion in dedicated funding.
    The Administration has already approved all 52 EV charging state
    plans and unlocked over $2 billion in funding for all 50 states and
    territories to install EV chargers across tens of thousands of miles
    of highways as well as in communities, with the goal of making
    electric vehicles more accessible for Americans all over the
    country. Since President Biden took office, the number of public
    charging ports has by over 40 percent.  In addition, the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law invests over $7 billion to support the domestic
    manufacturing of batteries and the extraction, refinement, and
    processing of the critical materials that power them. This
    investment, paired with the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction
    Act will help accelerate our electric vehicle future, strengthen US
    supply chains, and create good-paying jobs across the country – all
    part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. Last year,
    the Department of Energy announced that the first year of battery
    awards with 20 companies receiving a combined $2.8 billion to build
    and expand commercial-scale facilities in 12 states to extract and
    process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture
    components, and demonstrate new approaches, including manufacturing
    components from recycled materials. The Federal investment will be
    matched by recipients to leverage a total of more than $9 billion to
    boost American production of clean energy technology, create
    good-paying jobs, and support President Biden’s national goals for
    electric vehicles to make up half by 2030. The Law also provided
    $320 million to the Department of the Interior to map critical
    minerals, a key step in securing a reliable and sustainable supply
    of the critical minerals that power everything from household
    appliances and electronics to clean energy technologies like
    batteries, wind turbines and solar.
-   **Clean Water**: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invested over $50
    billion in water infrastructure – the largest upgrade to the
    nation’s water infrastructure in history and the first major effort
    to make significant federal investments in our water infrastructure
    in over half a century. This funding places us on a path to replace
    100% of lead service lines in America and close the wastewater gap
    for 2 million people who lack basic sanitation. These funds –
    administered by the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of
    Water – are already helping finance drinking and wastewater projects
    across the country through grants and forgivable loans. EPA is
    providing all 50 states, territories, the District of Columbia, and
    Tribal water systems with funding for drinking water and wastewater
    improvements. So far, EPA has provided over $5.1 billion of BIL
    funding to states, Tribes, and territories through the long-standing
    and successful State Revolving Funds. This year, EPA also released
    allocations for nearly $8 billion in fiscal year 2023 funding from
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law under the State Revolving Funds
    programs and nearly $2 billion in fiscal year 2022 and 2023 funding
    for the new emerging contaminants in small or disadvantaged
    communities program.  
-   **Superfunds and Brownfields Cleanup**: The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law invested over $5 billion for superfund and
    brownfield projects to restore the economic vitality of communities
    that have been exposed to pollution for far too long.  Using this
    funding, the Environmental Protection Agency has eliminated the
    construction project backlog for the Superfund National Priority
    List (NPL) and launched work to begin construction on 44 of the 49
    locations on the backlog list. Earlier this year, EPA also announced
    that it will use $1 billion to fund the cleanup of 22 new sites and
    expedite the cleanup of 100 ongoing existing projects across the
    country. EPA has also awarded grants to communities and nonprofits
    to assess and clean up brownfield properties and provide technical
    assistance to restore sites to hubs of economic growth. Among
    others, this funding is helping clean up water contamination sites
    in Indiana, an old General Motors foundry in New York State, and a
    landfill in Virginia – and helping environmental justice communities
    like a neighborhood in Atlanta that has been waiting years for
    funding to remove lead for the environment where children play. This
    cleanup work leveraged 20,000 jobs last year alone.
-   **Orphan Wells and Abandoned Mine Lands:** The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law invests $16 billion into cleaning legacy
    pollution.  The Department of the Interior launched three new
    programs to cleanup abandoned oil and gas wells on state, Tribal,
    private, and federal lands. In addition to launching a new program
    office and elevating the importance of this issue across the
    country, federally funded projects are already breaking ground on
    remediation efforts at well sites across the country. Hundreds of
    wells have been completely cleaned up already and the Department of
    the Interior expects to use federal funds to cleanup tens of
    thousands more wells using Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding,
    creating thousands of jobs reducing the harmful methane emissions
    from these sites in communities once dependent on the oil and gas
    industry to survive. The Department of the Interior also approved
    and deployed over $1 billion in Infrastructure Law and regular
    appropriations funding for the remediation of abandoned mine lands
    in nearly two dozen states and on Tribal lands to cleanup thousands
    of hazardous sites.
-   **Resilience**: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $50
    billion in an “all hazards” approach to protect our infrastructure
    and communities from physical, climate, and cybersecurity-related
    threats. That means using investments at the Departments of the
    Interior and Agriculture to protect communities from the threat of
    wildfires by removing hazardous fuels from millions of acres of land
    and setting a target to remediate over 50 million acres around
    vulnerable communities over the next decade. The Infrastructure Law
    also awarded dozens of individual communities grants to develop or
    implement their own community wildfire defense plans in preparation
    for the upcoming fire season. The administration has also funded
    over 130 desalinization, water recycling, storage, efficiency, and
    other projects via the Department of the Interior to address the
    drought crisis in the West – including projects that when complete
    will conserve tens of thousands of acre feet of water in
    drought-stricken areas like the Colorado River Basin. The U.S. Army
    Corps of engineers has also funded over 800 projects across the
    country, including hundreds of projects to improve flood and coastal
    resilience like the [Noyes
    Cut](https://www.sas.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Releases/Article/3084072/noyes-cut-ecosystem-restoration-project-prepares-closures/)
    Ecosystem Restoration Project in Camden County, Georgia – the first
    fully BIL funded project to be completed by the Corps. In order to
    help communities before disaster strikes, the landmark legislation
    also provided FEMA with nearly $7 billion to invest in communitywide
    mitigation, helping to reduce disaster suffering and avoiding future
    disaster costs in the face of increasingly frequent and severe
    weather events. States have all also received initial grants to
    develop cybersecurity plans and procure services alongside local
    partners.
-   **High-Speed Internet:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
    invests $65 billion to help ensure that every American has access to
    affordable, reliable high-speed internet through a historic
    commitment to broadband adoption and infrastructure deployment.
    Since BIL’s passage, the Administration has worked to streamline the
    portfolio of complementary programs into a two-pronged strategy that
    focused most specifically on affordability and access and
    deployment.  The Affordable Connectivity Program is the centerpiece
    of the Administration’s affordability work. Currently, 17.9 million
    households have enrolled in the ACP, with more enrolling every day.
    The FCC has allocated $100 million for paid media and grants to
    organizations to do ACP outreach, the first $73 million of grants of
    which was announced last month. On deployment, Commerce and USDA are
    coordinating a joint effort to announce $1.7 billion in grants for
    rural broadband, $1 billion for Middle Mile high-speed Internet
    infrastructure, and state allocations for the $42.5 billion state
    grant program.  Commerce has also awarded 147 Tribal Broadband
    Connectivity Program (TBCP) grants, totaling more than $1.76
    billion, and serving over 210 Tribal Governments, with additional
    awards expected in the coming week.
-   **Tribal Communities:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests
    more than $13 billion directly to Tribal communities to provide
    affordable high-speed internet, safer roads and bridges, modern
    wastewater and sanitations systems, clean drinking water, reliable
    and affordable electricity, and good paying jobs. Since the Law’s
    enactment, the Department of the Interior, in partnership with FEMA,
    launched a voluntary community driven relocation program, with an
    initial commitment of over $135 million to assist Tribal communities
    severely impacted by climate-related environmental threats. This
    program is one of the first designed to coordinate closely with
    community leaders to help begin the process of relocating crucial
    community infrastructure away from imminent threats and build
    long-term resilience to climate impacts.
