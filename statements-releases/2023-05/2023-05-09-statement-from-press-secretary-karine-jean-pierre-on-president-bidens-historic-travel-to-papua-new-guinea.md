  s Historic Travel to Papua New\_Guinea"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will make an historic stop in Papua New
Guinea while traveling from the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Hiroshima, Japan
to the Quad Leaders’ Summit in Sydney, Australia later this month. While
in Papua New Guinea, President Biden will meet with Prime Minister
Marape of Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island Forum leaders to
follow up on the first-ever U.S.–Pacific Island Summit in Washington, DC
last fall. The leaders will discuss ways to deepen cooperation on
challenges critical to the region and to the United States such as
combating climate change, protecting maritime resources, and advancing
resilient and inclusive economic growth. As a Pacific nation, the United
States has deep historical and people-to-people ties with the Pacific
Islands, and this visit – the first time a sitting U.S. President has
visited a Pacific Island country – further reinforces this critical
partnership.
