title: "Statement by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on a Reasonable Bipartisan\
  \ Budget\_Agreement"
---
 
On Tuesday, the President appointed a senior team to negotiate with the
Speaker’s team. The President and Speaker agreed that any budget
agreement would need to be bipartisan. Last night in DC, the Speaker’s
team put on the table an offer that was a big step back and contained a
set of extreme partisan demands that could never pass both Houses of
Congress. The President has over and over again put deficit reduction
proposals on the table, from limits on spending to cuts to Big Pharma
profits to closing tax loopholes for oil and gas. Let’s be clear: The
President’s team is ready to meet any time. And, let’s be serious about
what can pass in a bipartisan manner, get to the President’s desk and
reduce the deficit. It is only a Republican leadership beholden to its
MAGA wing — not the President or Democratic leadership — who are
threatening to put our nation into default for the first time in our
history unless extreme partisan demands are met.
