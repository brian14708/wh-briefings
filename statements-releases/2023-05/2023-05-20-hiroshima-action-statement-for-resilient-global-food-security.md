title: "Hiroshima Action Statement for Resilient Global Food\_Security"
---
 
We, the leaders of Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Comoros, the Cook
Islands, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, the Republic of
Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Viet Nam and
the European Union, reaffirmed that access to affordable, safe and
nutritious food is a basic human need, and shared the importance of
working closely together to respond to the worsening global food
security crisis with the world facing highest risk of famine in a
generation and to build more resilient, sustainable and inclusive
agriculture and food systems, including through enhancing stability and
predictability in international markets. Noting the key actions outlined
in the United Nations Food Systems Summit 2021 (UNFSS) and the 2022
Global Food Security Roadmap endorsed by over 100 country signatories as
well as the G20’s efforts on global food security, we intend to jointly
take the following actions in cooperation with the international
community to strengthen global food security and nutrition and call on
other partners to join us in these efforts.

**1. Responding to the immediate food security crisis **

Global food security is threatened by multiple factors and risks such as
the COVID-19 pandemic, volatile energy, food and fertilizer prices, the
serious impact of climate change and armed conflicts, with
disproportionate impacts on the most vulnerable, including women,
children and persons with disabilities. The war in Ukraine has further
aggravated the ongoing food security crisis around the world, especially
in developing and least developed countries. We note with deep concern
the adverse impact of the war in Ukraine and stress that it is causing
immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the
global economy – constraining growth, increasing inflation, disrupting
supply chains, heightening energy and food insecurity, and elevating
financial stability risks. Especially in light of its impact on food
security and the humanitarian situation around the world, we support a
just and durable peace based on respect for international law,
principles of the UN charter and territorial integrity and sovereignty.
We call on all participants of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) to
continue and fully implement its smooth operation at its maximum
potential and for as long as necessary, and stress the importance of
allowing grains to continue to reach those most in need. According to UN
and relevant reports, up to 828 million people were facing hunger across
the world in 2021 and 258 million people in 58 food crisis countries,
especially in developing and least developed countries, were estimated
to need emergency food assistance in 2022. We will be working together
to respond to the immediate food security crisis including through:

-   Supporting multisectoral humanitarian assistance to countries
    experiencing crisis and emergency levels of acute food insecurity,
    such as in the Horn of Africa.
-   Advocating for a substantial increase in humanitarian and
    development funding, including from other international donors and
    private sector partners to fill emergency and critical development
    assistance funding gaps to avert famine and build sustainable and
    resilient food systems.
-   Supporting grain exports from Ukraine and Russia including the
    expansion and extension of the BSGI, continuation of the EU
    “Solidarity Lanes” and the restoration of the agricultural sector in
    Ukraine as well as supporting any UN efforts to identify and
    evidence illegal movement of grains.
-   Facilitating rules-based, open, fair, transparent and
    non-discriminatory international trade in food and agricultural
    products, to stabilize markets by reducing the risk of scarcity and
    mitigating price volatility.

<!-- -->

-   Strengthening coordination among donors, the UN including the
    Rome-Based Agencies of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
    the World Food Progamme (WFP) and the International Fund for
    Agricultural Development (IFAD), International Financial
    Institutions (IFIs) and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs),
    including through the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS), the
    Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) and the Global
    Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), to prioritize and
    cover the most urgent needs, to avoid further deterioration of
    humanitarian conditions and to accelerate responsible investments in
    food systems.
-   Supporting immediate assistance to scale up sustainable and
    efficient local, regional and international food production and
    value chains consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.

** 2. Preparing for and preventing future food security crises **

We recognize the importance of enhancing market transparency, minimizing
distortions that are inconsistent with WTO rules, enhancing the
availability of accurate information and analysis as key aspects of
preventing or minimizing the risk of food security crises and
malnutrition and facilitating early actions in cases of crises. We also
recognize the importance of developing a shared understanding of
recommended actions in response to food security crises. Therefore, we
intend to cooperate towards the following purposes:

\(1\) To enhance market transparency and preparedness for food and
nutrition crises

-   Strengthening the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) by
    supporting G20 efforts to broaden its coverage to include fertilizer
    and vegetable oils, as well as improving data provision including on
    stocks.
-   Supporting synergistic data collection, analysis and dissemination
    work by international organizations including the International
    Grains Council’s (IGC) data collection and analysis and the FAO’s
    development of early warning models, and recognizing the importance
    of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) as the
    global standard for acute food insecurity monitoring and analysis,
    the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) initiated in the framework
    of GNAFC to draw attention to the global food security crisis, the
    multi-donor 50×2030 initiative and the GAFS Global Food and
    Nutrition Security Dashboard.
-   Supporting the implementation of existing crisis response and
    preparedness strategies in countries where they exist, and
    contributing to the establishment and implementation of Food
    Security Crisis Preparedness Plans (FSCPP) through World Bank
    support with other countries and relevant stakeholders and in the
    framework of GAFS where needed.
-   Supporting ASEAN Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserve (APTERR) in ASEAN
    region and the East Asia Summit’s (EAS) renewed commitment in 2022
    to implement the 2013 EAS Declaration on Food Security and the ASEAN
    Integrated Food Security Framework and Strategic Plan of Action on
    Food Security 2021-25 as well as the ECOWAS Regional Food Security
    Reserve, as initiatives to respond to food supply disruptions in the
    region.

\(2\) To develop a shared understanding of recommended crisis-time
actions

-   Welcoming and supporting the dialogue on the food security crisis
    between food exporting countries and importing countries to be
    co-hosted by the IGC and Japan under its G7 Presidency in June.
-   Contributing to the identification and the development of guiding
    principles and best practices related to trade and market
    transparency in crisis response based on this dialogue.
-   Reconfirming that agricultural trade must be rules-based, open,
    fair, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and
    consistent with WTO rules, and recalling the WTO Ministerial
    Decision on WFP Food Purchases Exemption from Export Prohibitions or
    Restrictions as well as the WTO Ministerial Declaration on the
    Emergency Response to Food Insecurity.
-   Calling for more concrete actions to address measures that impact
    global food security by seeking meaningful outcomes on the issues in
    the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC13) negotiations.
-   Promoting donor coordination on food crises responses including
    emergency humanitarian assistance and mitigating measures for most
    affected populations through mechanism such as GAFS and GNAFC.
-   Focusing on expanding fertilizer efficiency and soil health
    practices. 

**3. Realizing resilient global food security and nutrition for all **

Realizing resilient global food security and nutrition for all is our
shared goal for a better future for each human being. We are committed
to working together to pave the way to achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, progressively realizing of the right
to adequate food and building resilient, sustainable, efficient and
inclusive food systems, and enabling those in need to access affordable,
safe and nutritious food and healthy diets now and into the future. We
also emphasize the importance of climate change adaptation and
mitigation in agriculture and food systems, of halting and reversing
biodiversity loss while recognizing the strong interrelation between
agriculture and biodiversity, preventing all forms of malnutrition, and
reducing food loss and waste, as well as utilizing traditional knowledge
and promoting gender-responsive approaches that engage women as key
actors of food systems whereas women and girls are often
disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition. We are
joining hands to take the following actions:
