title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Shooting in Allen,\_Texas"
---
 
Yesterday, Allen, Texas was torn apart by a senseless mass shooting at a
shopping mall—one of far too many communities impacted by gun
violence. Doug and I mourn for the eight adults and children who lost
their lives, pray for those wounded, and send our gratitude to the first
responders who ran toward danger. As the President said, our
administration will continue to support federal, state, and local law
enforcement as they investigate.  
   
While there is much we do not yet know about this attack, here is what
we do know: all Americans deserve to be safe from gun violence. But they
are not. Not because we do not know the solutions. Not because the
American people are divided on this issue – even a majority of gun
owners support sensible reforms.  
   
President Biden signed the most significant gun safety legislation in 30
years and implemented important executive actions, but more must be
done. Send a bill to President Biden that bans assault weapons
and high-capacity magazines, implements universal background checks,
and helps keep guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to
themselves and others.  We need action.
