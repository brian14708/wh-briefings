title: "Statement from White\_House Communications Director Ben LaBolt on a Reasonable\
  \ Bipartisan Budget\_Agreement"
---
 
President Biden has made clear for weeks that Congress must act to
prevent default. Earlier this week, the President met with the four
Congressional leaders at the White House, where they agreed to move
forward on a bipartisan budget framework. Following that meeting, the
President assigned an experienced negotiating team and directed them to
act in good faith to reach an agreement. But now, Republicans are taking
the economy hostage and pushing us to the brink of default, which could
cost millions of jobs and tip the country into recession after two years
of steady job and wage growth.

Republicans are recycling a barely watered down version of their extreme
budget proposal that would eliminate 100,000 jobs for teachers and
support staff, cut 2,000 law enforcement positions and could put the
health care coverage for millions of Americans at risk at the same time
as Republicans would extend tax breaks for the wealthiest and
corporations. The Republican position is especially galling given that
the debt increased by 40% under President Trump and those same tax
breaks cost taxpayers $2 trillion. And Republicans are even trying once
again to reward tax cheats by gutting funding for the IRS.

Any serious budget negotiation must include discussion both of spending
and of revenues, but Republicans have refused to discuss revenue.
President Biden has lowered the deficit by $1.7 trillion in his first
two years in office with this balanced approach and proposed a budget
that would cut the deficit by an additional $3 trillion. Republicans,
however, are focused on pulling the rug out from under hardworking
Americans instead of considering the Presidentâ€™s proposal to cut
wasteful spending and cut the deficit by eliminating subsidies for oil
and gas companies and pharma and asking the wealthiest to pay their fair
share.

There remains a path forward to arrive at a reasonable bipartisan
agreement if Republicans come back to the table to negotiate in good
faith. But President Biden will not accept a wish list of extreme MAGA
priorities that would punish the middle class and neediest Americans and
set our economic progress back.
