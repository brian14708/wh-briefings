title: "FACT SHEET: The 2023 G7 Summit in Hiroshima,\_Japan"
---
 
Since President Biden took office, revitalizing our alliances and
partnerships and reestablishing America’s leadership around the world
has been one of his top priorities. The G7 Summit in Hiroshima showed
that the G7 are more united than ever: united on Ukraine, united on
China, united on economic security, united on building the clean energy
economies of the future, united on nuclear disarmament, and united on
fighting poverty and responding to global challenges like the climate
crisis around the world.

**United on Ukraine**  
  
G7 Leaders set forth a powerful statement of unity strength and
commitment in our response to Russia’s war of aggression.  Leaders
announced a set of concrete actions to intensify the G7’s diplomatic,
financial, humanitarian and security support for Ukraine, to increase
the costs to Russia and those supporting its war efforts, and to
continue to counter the negative impacts of Russia’s war on the rest of
the world, particularly on the most vulnerable people.

-   **New sanctions and export controls**. G7 Leaders announced new
    steps to economically isolate Russia and weaken its ability to wage
    its war. They announced new efforts to further disrupt Russia’s
    ability to source inputs for its war; close evasion loopholes;
    further reduce reliance on Russian energy and limit its future
    extractive capacity; and squeeze Russia’s access to the
    international financial system. G7 leaders also reaffirmed their
    commitment to keep Russia’s sovereign assets immobilized until
    Russia pays for the damage it has caused.  To implement these
    commitments, the Departments of Treasury, State, and Commerce rolled
    out new sanctions packages including by expanding our broad
    restrictions, cutting off over 70 companies from Russia and other
    countries from receiving U.S. exports, and sanctioning upwards of
    300 individuals, entities, vessels, and aircraft, including actors
    across the globe.
-   **Discussing peace with a broad range of partners.  **The G7 leaders
    met with the leaders of Ukraine, Australia, Brazil, the Cook
    Islands, Comoros, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and Vietnam
    to discuss international peace and security.  The leaders issued an
    Action Plan on Food Security that notes, “Especially in light of its
    impact on food security and the humanitarian situation around the
    world, we support a just and durable peace based on respect for
    international law, principles of the UN charter and territorial
    integrity and sovereignty.”

**United on China**  
  
G7 Leaders affirmed that G7 countries are not decoupling from China or
turning inwards. At the same time, G7 Leaders recognized the need to
respond to concerns and to stand up for our core values.  

-   **Economic security issues. **The G7 will push for a level playing
    field for their workers and companies and seek to address the
    challenges posed by China’s non-market policies and practices and
    foster resilience to economic coercion. They recognized the
    necessity of protecting certain advanced technologies that could be
    used to threaten our national security.
-   **Indo-pacific. **Leaders reaffirmed the importance of peace and
    stability across the Taiwan Strait and called for a peaceful
    resolution of cross-Strait issues. They highlighted that there is no
    change in the basic positions of the G7 members on Taiwan. They
    registered their serious concerned about the situation in the East
    and South China Seas and reaffirmed their strong opposition to any
    unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.
-   **Core values. **G7 Leaders voiced concerns about the human rights
    situation in China, and called on China not to conduct interference
    activities or undermine the integrity of our democratic
    institutions.

**United on Economic Resilience and Economic Security**  
  
G7 Leaders took steps to enhance strategic coordination on economic
resilience and economic security by strengthening supply chains,
reducing vulnerabilities and countering malign practices that exploit
and reinforce them. 

-   **Protecting critical and emerging technologies**. President Biden
    has taken action in the United States to protect certain dual use
    technologies from falling into the hands of strategic rivals. In
    Hiroshima, G7 Leaders affirmed that this is a common interest across
    G7 countries. To this end, the Leaders further recognized that
    addressing risks from outbound investment could be important to
    complement existing tools of targeted controls on exports and
    inbound investments.
-   **Launching the G7 *Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion***.
    G7 Leaders launched the Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion
    to increase collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and
    response to economic coercion.

**United on Building the Clean Energy Economies of the Future**  
  
At home, President Biden has delivered on an ambitious clean energy
agenda that is centered around bold public investment and working with
partners to build secure and resilient supply chains. In Hiroshima, G7
Leaders outlined the way that G7 partners are working to meet the moment
in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, to build secure and
resilient supply chains, and to ensure strong industrial bases across G7
countries.

-   **Maximizing the impact of incentives.** Thanks to the Inflation
    Reduction Act, this was the first G7 Summit where the President of
    the United States could unambiguously say that the United States is
    on a path to meet our Paris Climate commitments. G7 Leaders
    recognized that achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement urgently
    requires significant new incentives, industrial policies, and public
    as well as private investments. Leaders committed to work together
    to ensure regulations and investments will make clean energy
    technologies more affordable for all nations and help drive a
    global, just energy transition for workers and communities that will
    leave no one behind.

**United on an Affirmative and Ambitious Development Agenda**

President Biden has championed an affirmative and ambitious agenda to
support developing countries, including through reaffirming our support
for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and working to create
fiscal space for increased domestic investments in key development
priorities. In Hiroshima, G7 Leaders emphasized the need to unlock
investments and policy reforms to accelerate progress toward the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including by investing in more
resilient food and health systems, and by addressing the effects of
climate change.

-   **Tackling rising levels of debt. **G7 Leaders highlighted their
    concern that serious challenges to debt sustainability are
    undermining the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
    They reiterated the urgency of addressing debt vulnerabilities in
    low- and middle-income countries and their full support of the G20’s
    effort to improve the implementation of the Common Framework for
    Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI)
    in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner, providing
    clarity to participants.
-   **Promoting the evolution of the multilateral development banks
    (MDBs). **G7 Leaders noted their strong support for the efforts
    underway by multilateral development banks to review and transform
    their business models to better address global challenges such as
    climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict, which are
    integral to achieving poverty reduction and shared prosperity.  They
    encouraged MDBs to expedite this ongoing work. They looked to
    further progress on the World Bank’s evolution agenda toward the
    2023 WBG and IMF Annual Meetings and beyond.
-   **Reversing the first global decline in life expectancy in nearly a
    century**. G7 leaders committed to work with global partners to
    restore access to essential health services to better than
    pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2025, and to strengthen primary
    health care delivery, including by investing in health workers, in
    order to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage. The
    United States is providing approximately $10 billion in global
    health program funding with Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 funds, much of
    which supports essential health services, including addressing
    HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, expanding access to water and sanitation,
    and supporting maternal and child health. One year ago, the
    President also launched the Global Health Worker Initiative, which
    aims to address the global shortage of health workers.  
-   **Investing in health security with U.S. contribution of $250
    Million to the Pandemic Fund.** The President announced that the
    United States plans to provide a $250 million contribution in Fiscal
    Year 2023 appropriations, subject to Congressional notification, to
    the Pandemic Fund to demonstrate the United States’ ongoing
    commitment to strengthening global health security around the world.
    This planned investment in the Pandemic Fund will continue to serve
    as a catalyst for additional contributions from other donors. The
    United States is committed to providing greater investments in
    health security to help break the cycle of panic and neglect in the
    wake of health emergencies.
-   **Launching the *Hiroshima Action Statement for Resilient Global
    Food Security* with partner countries to address needs today and
    into the future. ** G7 Leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment
    to address global food insecurity and the need to build more
    resilient, sustainable, and inclusive food systems. G7 leaders have
    exceeded the $14 billion commitment announced at the 2022 G7 Elmau
    Summit, mobilizing $14.9 billion for food security.  The United
    States remains the global leader on food security. Since the
    beginning of 2022, the United States has provided over $13.5 billion
    in acute and medium to long term assistance for food security.

**Showing Tangible Progress at the PGII One-Year Mark**  
  
One year after G7 Leaders announced PGII as the G7’s collective
infrastructure initiative, G7 Leaders demonstrated that PGII is making
concrete progress.

-   **Collaborating with partners**. During the Summit, G7 Leaders were
    joined by leaders of \[Australia, Brazil, Comoros, Cook Islands,
    India, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Republic of Korea, and the World
    Bank\]. They were also joined by private sector executives of Citi,
    Global Infrastructure Partners, Japan Foreign Trade Council, and
    Nokia to reaffirm their commitment to opening a serious, sustainable
    channel for unlocking public and private capital for these projects
    in the developing world.
-   **Launching new projects. **To date, the United States has mobilized
    $30 billion through grants, federal financing, and leveraging
    private sector investments towards PGII. President Biden announced
    new projects and highlighted the impact of several projects
    announced since PGII’s launch at the 2022 G7 Summit.
-   **Announcing a PGII Investor Forum**. The President announced that
    the United States will seek to launch an annual Investor Forum to
    enable the United States Government to more comprehensively de-risk
    capital, play a matchmaking role between investors and opportunities
    that advance PGII, and hear feedback on how it can continue to
    refine the PGII model to maximize its effectiveness.
