title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on His Veto of H.J. Res.\_39"
---
 
My Investing in America agenda is mobilizing hundreds of billions of
dollars in private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments,
and creating good-paying jobs. When it comes to solar, since I took
office, 51 new and expanded solar equipment manufacturing plants have
been announced, and America is now on track to increase domestic solar
panel manufacturing capacity eight-fold. The fact is: my plan is
working.  
  
I vetoed H.J. Res. 39 because we cannot afford to create new uncertainty
for American businesses and workers in the solar industry. We can and
must strengthen our energy security by maintaining our focus on
expanding U.S. capacity that is ready to come on line as this temporary
bridge concludes in June 2024.
