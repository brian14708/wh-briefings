  Integration"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Saudi Prime Minister
and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, UAE National Security Advisor
Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and National Security Advisor of
India Ajit Doval on May 7 in Saudi Arabia to advance their shared vision
of a more secure and prosperous Middle East region interconnected with
India and the world. Mr. Sullivan also held bilateral meetings with the
Crown Prince, Sheikh Tahnoon, and Mr. Doval to discuss bilateral and
regional matters. He looks forward to further consulting with Mr. Doval
on the margins of the Quad Summit later this month in Australia.

With Crown Prince Mohammed, he reviewed significant progress in talks to
further consolidate the now 15-month long truce in Yemen and welcomed
ongoing UN-led efforts to bring the war to a close, as well as covering
a range of other issues. Mr. Sullivan thanked the Crown Prince for the
support Saudi Arabia has provided to U.S. citizens during the evacuation
from Sudan. The four delegations agreed to maintain regular
consultations and follow up on the matters discussed throughout the day.
