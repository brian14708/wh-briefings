  Integration"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Saudi Prime Minister
and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, UAE National Security Advisor
Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and National Security Advisor of
India Ajit Doval on May 7 in Saudi Arabia to advance their shared vision
of a more secure and prosperous Middle East region interconnected with
India and the world. Mr. Sullivan also held bilateral meetings with the
Crown Prince, Sheikh Tahnoon, and Mr. Doval to discuss bilateral and
regional matters. He looks forward to further consulting with Mr. Doval
on the margins of the Quad Summit later this month in Australia.

With Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed, he reviewed significant
progress in talks to further consolidate the now 15-month long truce in
Yemen and welcomed ongoing UN-led efforts to bring the war to a close,
as well as covering a range of other issues. Mr. Sullivan thanked the
Crown Prince for the support Saudi Arabia has provided to U.S. citizens
during the evacuation from Sudan. The four delegations agreed to
maintain regular consultations and follow up on the matters discussed
throughout the day.
