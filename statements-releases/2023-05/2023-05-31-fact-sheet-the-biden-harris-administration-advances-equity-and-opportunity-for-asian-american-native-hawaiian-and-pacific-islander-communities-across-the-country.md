title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Communities Across the\_\
  Country"
---
 
Since day one of this Administration, President Joe Biden and Vice
President Kamala Harris have prioritized the advancement of opportunity,
equity, and safety for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific
Islander (AA and NHPI) communities to realize the full promise of our
nation. Throughout Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
Heritage Month, the Biden-Harris administration celebrates the diversity
of cultures, breadth of achievement, and remarkable contributions of
these communities while also recognizing the generational inequities,
barriers to access, and discrimination faced by AA and NHPI communities
within the United States. As we continue to make progress to advance
equity and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities, today the
Biden-Harris Administration is providing a comprehensive update on our
efforts to combat anti-Asian violence and discrimination and to provide
AA and NHPI communities the resources, access, and opportunities to
thrive.  
  
**Combatting Anti-Asian Hate and Promoting Belonging and Inclusion of AA
and NHPI Communities.** AA and NHPI communities continue to face
anti-Asian hate, and persistent racism, xenophobia, religious
discrimination, and violence that began long before the Covid-19
pandemic. In May 2021, President Biden signed into law the **COVID-19
Hate Crimes Act**, a bipartisan legislation that makes significant
improvements to our Nation’s response to hate crimes. The bill addresses
two challenges: the lack of resources and training for state and local
law enforcement to accurately identify and report hate crimes to the
FBI, and the language and cultural barriers that many AA and NHPI
communities and communities of color face in reporting hate crimes to
law enforcement.  
  
President Biden has led a historic whole-of-government approach to
combat hate, xenophobia, and intolerance facing AA and NHPI communities
in the United States. In his first week in office, President Biden
signed the **“**[**Memorandum Condemning and Combating Racism,
Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders in the United
States**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-condemning-and-combating-racism-xenophobia-and-intolerance-against-asian-americans-and-pacific-islanders-in-the-united-states/)**.”**
The memorandum directs all federal agencies to take steps to ensure
their actions mitigate anti-Asian bias and xenophobia, especially in the
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
Over the last two years, agencies have worked to deliver real and
lasting results:

-   **Funding critical research to prevent and address bias and
    xenophobia against AA and NHPI communities.** The National Science
    Foundation (NSF) is taking a comprehensive approach to investing in
    research to understand, address, and end bias, discrimination and
    xenophobia, including against AA and NHPI communities.
-   The **Department of Justice (DOJ)** continued its efforts to help
    agencies transition their crime data to the National Incident-Based
    Reporting System (NIBRS), a more detailed, FBI-recommended, national
    crime database that provides a better picture of crime incidents,
    including hate crimes by:
    -   Providing funding and free technical support to assist law
        enforcement agencies transition from the old crime data
        collection system to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting
        System (NIBRS), the only way for state and local agencies to
        submit crime data, including hate crime data, to the FBI.
    -   Conducting outreach to police chiefs, law enforcement groups,
        and mayors to emphasize the importance of accurate hate crime
        data collection.
-   In March 2023, the FBI released its [Supplemental 2021 Hate Crime
    Statistics](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-supplemental-2021-hate-crime-statistics)
    – combining the Summary Reporting System (SRS) and NIBRS data –
    which captured a 167% increase in anti-Asian crime incidents.
-   In September 2022, the **Department of Justice** launched the United
    Against Hate program in all 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices by September
    2023 to help improve the reporting of hate crimes by teaching
    community members how to identify, report, and help prevent hate
    crimes and encouraging trust building between law enforcement and
    communities.
-   In 2022, the **Department of Justice’s** Community Oriented Policing
    Services released a new hate crimes recognition and reporting
    training aimed specifically at line-level officers. The training
    aims to increase state and local law enforcement officers’ ability
    to identify when an incident is a hate crime or hate incident.
-   The **Department of Justice and the Department of Education**
    jointly issued a letter to educators on May 26, 2021, and a fact
    sheet addressing the increased harassment and violence directed at
    AA and NHPI students and reminded schools about their role in
    addressing discrimination, including harassment, against AA and NHPI
    students.
-   **Providing funding for justice programs**: The **Department of
    Justice** awarded over $32 million in grant funding to law
    enforcement and prosecution agencies, community-based organizations,
    and civil rights groups to support outreach, investigations,
    prosecutions, community awareness and preparedness, reporting,
    hotlines, and victim services; as well as supporting research and
    program evaluation studies. Examples include:
    -   [The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes
        Program](https://bja.ojp.gov/program/shepard-byrd-hate-crimes-program/overview),
        which supports state, local and Tribal law enforcement and
        prosecution agencies and their partners in conducting outreach,
        and investigating and prosecuting hate crimes;
    -   [The Community Based Approaches to Prevent and Address Hate
        Crimes
        Program](https://bja.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-bja-2023-171643),
        which supports community-based organizations and civil rights
        groups in implementing comprehensive approaches to promote
        community awareness and preparedness, increase victim reporting,
        strengthen community resiliency, and improve responses to hate
        crimes;
    -   [The Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act
        Program](https://ovc.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-ovc-2023-171708),
        which supports state-run hate crime reporting hotlines and
        assists jurisdictions’ transition to NIBRS to improve hate
        crimes data reporting; and
    -   [The Emmett Till
        Program](https://bja.ojp.gov/program/emmett-till-cold-case-investigations-and-prosecution-program/overview),
        which supports law enforcement and prosecutors and their
        partners in their efforts to investigate and resolve cold-case
        homicides that involve civil rights violations.
-   **Revitalizing the Justice Department’s Community Relations
    Service.** The Justice Department is strategically revitalizing the
    Community Relations Service (CRS), an office which provides
    facilitated dialogue, mediation, training, and consultation for
    communities facing bias-related conflict, including AA and NHPI
    communities. CRS has been meeting with national and local AA and
    NHPI organizations to address community concerns about the rise in
    anti-Asian incidents and individuals’ safety during the pandemic.
    CRS will continue sharing resources and information with affected
    communities, as well as working with government leaders, faith
    leaders, community groups, universities, and schools to help them
    build the capacity to address and prevent hate crimes.
-   **Issuing a memorandum from the Attorney General on hate crimes and
    hate incidents.** In one of his first acts, Attorney General
    Merrick B. Garland issued a directive to the Department to conduct a
    30-day expedited
    internal [review](https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1381396/download) to
    determine how the Department could deploy all the tools at its
    disposal to counter the recent rise in hate crimes and hate
    incidents.
-   On May 27, 2021, following the review’s completion and the passage
    of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, the
    Attorney General issued
    a [memorandum](https://www.justice.gov/media/1143466/dl?inline) announcing
    immediate steps to deter hate crimes and bias-related incidents,
    address them when they occur, support victims, and reduce the
    pernicious effects these incidents have on our society. 
-   On May 20, 2022, the one-year anniversary of the enactment of the
    COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, the **Department of Justice** issued [a
    new guidance
    document](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/addressing-hate-crimes-against-AAPI)
    with the **Department of Health and Human Services**, aimed at
    raising awareness of hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This
    guidance provides an overview of the rise of hate crimes and hate
    incidents during the pandemic, including a surge of hate crimes and
    hate incidents against AA and NHPI communities, and several steps
    that law enforcement, government officials, and others can take to
    raise awareness of increased hate crimes and incidents, and to use
    increased awareness as a tool for the prevention of and response to
    hate crimes.
-   In 2022, U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai
    participated in an event, hosted by the Asia Pacific Foundation of
    Canada and the National Coalition of Canadians Against Anti-Asian
    Racism. Under the banner, ‘Inspiring Next GenerAsian Leaders’, the
    event hosted youth from several Asian organizations and institutions
    across Canada and provided an opportunity for Ambassador Tai to work
    with her Canadian counterpart Minister Mary Ng to convene
    conversations with broader Asian American and Asian Canadian groups.
-   **Providing trainings to enhance civil rights reporting and
    strengthen relationships between law enforcement and community
    members.** The FBI hosted regional conferences across the country
    with state and local law enforcement agencies regarding federal
    civil rights and hate crimes laws; to encourage reporting;
    strengthen relationships between law enforcement and local civil
    rights organizations; and build trust within the diverse communities
    they serve.
-   **Assessing threats against AA and NHPIs.** The Department of
    Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A)
    issued an “Intelligence in Brief” publication that assessed the
    threats targeting AA and NHPI communities. The brief examines
    physical threats and incidents of violence against AA and NHPI
    community members over the last year and provides context for what
    the office views as the potential threats facing the community in
    the near future.
-   **Identifying systemic barriers in accessing nonprofit security
    grant benefits and opportunities.** In July 2021, the Federal
    Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Office for Civil Rights
    and Civil Liberties at the Department of Homeland Security
    collaborated to award FEMA Nonprofit Security Grants to 17 AA and
    NHPI serving organizations.
-   **Integrating AA and NHPIs into community-based violence prevention
    efforts.** DHS’s Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships
    (CP3) Regional Prevention Coordinators conducted outreach and built
    connections with local and regional partners across the country to
    ensure that AA and NHPI communities are integrated into broader
    local community-based prevention efforts to increase the ability of
    local community leaders to prevent violence and build community
    resilience against discrimination and hate. 

**Promoting Equitable Data and Data Disaggregation for AA and NHPI
Communities.** The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to advancing
racial equity and inclusion through improved data collection, research,
access, and disaggregation efforts. Better data leads to better and more
informed policies that reflect the needs and priorities of the AA and
NHPI communities.

-   The **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)’s**, Health
    Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) posted in the [Federal
    Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/10/21/2022-22867/agency-information-collection-activities-proposed-collection-public-comment-request-information)
    the proposed expansion of demographic characteristics reporting in
    the Uniform Data System (UDS) beginning with the 2023 reporting
    period to better align with HHS race/ethnicity data standards in
    accordance with Section 4302 of the Affordable Care Act. UDS will be
    updated to include subpopulation categories for AA and NHPI, and a
    broader selection for Hispanic ethnicity. These options will more
    accurately reflect the diversity of patients served by health
    centers as well as continue to align with OMB’s minimum categories
    for race and ethnicity data collection. High-quality accessible data
    is critical to strategically meeting the needs of patients and
    identifying opportunities for clinical process improvement.
-   In September 2022, the **Department of Labor (DOL)’s**, Bureau of
    Labor Statistics [published for the first
    time](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bls.gov%2Fblog%2F2022%2Fbls-now-publishing-monthly-data-for-native-hawaiians-and-other-pacific-islanders-and-people-of-two-or-more-races.htm&data=05%7C01%7CChen.Christina.E%40dol.gov%7C53bacd39cc4949d27a0a08db349056d5%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C638161566756866764%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=FVaGq%2BYOpLev1XzEIccOEL1%2FO7zb2X2envMsWbMo78E%3D&reserved=0)
    monthly labor force estimates for NHPIs regarding the unemployment
    rate, the employment–population ratio, the labor force participation
    rate, and other key metrics. With the release of the [Employment
    Situation](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bls.gov%2Fnews.release%2Fempsit.nr0.htm&data=05%7C01%7CChen.Christina.E%40dol.gov%7C53bacd39cc4949d27a0a08db349056d5%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C638161566756866764%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=WX7SiA1GCAInHQZrFaTVa%2Bv7HIsJiB1zB7moZkmH%2BJc%3D&reserved=0)
    report on September 2, 2022, monthly data for NHPIs are available
    going back to January 2003.
-   The **Department of Commerce (DOC)’s** **Census Bureau** released
    the [Demographic and Housing Characteristics File
    (DHC](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/dec/2020-census-dhc.html))
    and [Demographic
    Profile](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/dec/2020-census-demographic-profile.html)
    on May 25, 2023. These 2020 Census data products provide demographic
    and housing characteristics of local communities. More demographic
    and housing characteristics will be included in the Detailed
    Demographic and Housing Characteristics File A (DHC-A).
-   On February 8, 2023, the Census Bureau held the [AA and NHPI Proof
    of Concept
    Webinar](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2023/detailed-dhc-a-proof-of-concept.html),
    with nearly 80 organizations. The Census Bureau offered targeted and
    tailored outreach in advance to AA and NHPI data users and key
    stakeholders to discuss the proof of concept, which included
    proposed content and disclosure avoidance settings, and was based on
    2010 Census data that represents the tables planned for publication
    in the 2020 Census Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics
    File A, which will provide the population counts and sex and age
    statistics for approximately 370 detailed racial and ethnic groups
    and 1,200 American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and villages and
    is scheduled for release in September 2023.
-   The **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau** (CFPB) has finalized a
    rule required by Congress to increase transparency in small business
    lending, promote economic development, and combat unlawful
    discrimination, including against AA and NHPI businesses. Lenders
    will collect and report information about the small business credit
    applications they receive, including geographic and demographic
    data, lending decisions, and the price of credit. The rule will work
    in concert with the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires
    certain financial institutions to meet the needs of the communities
    they serve. The increased transparency will benefit small
    businesses, family farms, financial institutions, and the broader
    economy.
-   The **Federal Housing Finance Agency** (FHFA) now receives
    disaggregated AA and NHPI data for single-family automated
    underwriting system mortgage applications. FHFA will use these data
    to monitor fair lending impacts to subgroups and to inform future
    policy decisions that support equal treatment of all future
    homeowners.
-   The **Department of Education (ED)** will collect highly
    disaggregated race and ethnicity data on its Free Application for
    Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is filled out by all federal
    student aid applicants. This data feeds into a variety of student
    outcome measures reported for postsecondary institutions and
    programs and will allow for more robust disaggregated reporting on
    college access and success.
-   At the request of the **U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador**
    Katherine Tai, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), an
    independent U.S. agency, released a report in November 2022 that
    catalogued information on the distributional effects of trade and
    trade policy on underrepresented and underserved communities. The
    report summarizes the literature and confirms clear gaps in trade
    data focusing on Tribal nations, Indigenous and AA and NHPI workers;
    workers with disabilities; and workers based on their
    race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation.  Ambassador Tai also
    requested that the USITC update the distributional effects report
    every three years. 

**Lowering Health Care Costs and Improving Health Outcomes for AA and
NHPI Communities.** The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the systemic
inequities in our economy and healthcare system. The Biden-Harris
Administration has used every lever and tool to ensure access to safe,
free, and convenient vaccines and invest in more equitable public health
infrastructure to better serve communities across America, including in
AA and NHPI communities.

-   **Expanding access to health care.** The American Rescue Plan (ARP)
    has lowered or eliminated health insurance premiums for millions of
    lower- and middle-income families enrolled in health insurance
    marketplaces. The Administration’s efforts to expand access to
    coverage has driven the uninsured rate to historic lows, with more
    than 3.6 million people gaining coverage during last year’s
    recording breaking 16.3 million ACA enrollment period.
    -   The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) locks in lower monthly
        premiums – about 197,000 uninsured AA and NHPI Americans will
        continue to save money on health care coverage, including the
        50,000 AA and NHPI people that could find a plan for $0-premium
        plan in 2021.
    -   By continuing the improvements made through the American Rescue
        Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act keeps free or low-cost health
        insurance available. About 120,000 more AA and NHPI Americans
        will have health insurance coverage in 2023, compared to without
        the Inflation Reduction Act.
    -   As outlined in his February 2023 State of the Union address, the
        President is calling on Congress to make permanent the improved
        ACA tax credits that lower health care premiums for millions of
        Americans and to close the Medicaid coverage gap.
-   **Ensuring health care resources are readily available for AA and
    NHPI communities.** The Department of Health and Human Services
    Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded culturally
    appropriate and understandable health care information for the AA
    and NHPI community, including releasing the “Medicare & You”
    handbook in Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. CMS also conducted
    targeted outreach to AA and NHPI communities for the 2022 Affordable
    Care Act (ACA) Open Enrollment season, including specific social
    media and television advertisements, and hosting an AA and NHPI week
    of action during December 2022.
-   **HHS has also launched an Equity Technical Assistance (TA) Center**
    to provide training, tools, and TA for HHS employees to make sure
    that policies, programs, research, and analyses more equitable,
    including TA on strategies for reducing disparities in access to,
    and use of, grants and other HHS policy levers.
-   **Supporting the mental health needs of AA and NHPI communities.**
    In October 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services,
    [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
    (SAMHSA)](https://www.samhsa.gov/aanhpi-coe) awarded a grant to the
    Hawaii State Department of Health/Behavioral Health Administration
    to establish the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific
    Islander Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (AANHPI-CoE). The
    purpose of this Center of Excellence is to advance the behavioral
    health equity of AA, NH, and PI communities. The AANHPI-CoE will (1)
    develop and disseminate culturally-informed, evidence-based
    behavioral health information and (2) provide technical assistance
    and training on issues related to addressing behavioral health
    disparities in AA, NH, and PI communities. The AANHPI-CoE serves as
    a resource to behavioral healthcare providers, community-based and
    faith-based organizations, research institutions, and federal
    entities.

**Promoting Economic Opportunity for AA and NHPI Communities.** By
signing into law the historic American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS and Science Act
implementing robust regulatory reform, the Biden-Harris Administration
has led [the most equitable economic recovery on
record](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-report-advancing-equity-through-the-american-rescue-plan/),
creating more than 12 million jobs since coming to office and helping
create new economic opportunities for all Americans, including AA and
NHPI workers, small business owners, and entrepreneurs.

-   **Improving engagement with AA and NHPI businesses and
    entrepreneurs.** In January 2023, the White House Initiative on
    Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (WHIAANHPI)
    launched a series of [regional economic
    summits](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/26/biden-harris-administration-launch-summit-series-advance-asian-american-native-hawaiian-pacific-islander-economic-equity.html)
    to connect AA and NHPI community members directly with federal
    leaders and resources. The events are being held in different cities
    in collaboration with the U.S. Small Business Administration, U.S.
    Department of the Treasury, U.S. Department of Health and Human
    Services (HHS)’s Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business
    Utilization, the National Asian / Pacific Islander American Chamber
    of Commerce & Entrepreneurship, and local officials. The series was
    spurred by a recommendation from the President’s Advisory Commission
    on AA and NHPIs and aims to improve the accessibility of federal
    resources, including contracting and procurement opportunities, as
    well as federal jobs, grants, and programs.
-   **The Small Business Administration established a Community
    Navigators Pilot Program (CNPP) via the American Rescue Plan.** In
    the program’s first year (through November 30, 2022), CNPP provided
    business counseling to more than 17,000 unique clients and general
    training to another 200,000+ attendees, resulting in over $170
    million in approved funding. Of the 51 grant recipients engaged in
    the Community Navigators Pilot, 18 have a particular focus on AA and
    NHPI entrepreneurs, including the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber,
    which specializes in providing in-language support for ESL
    entrepreneurs in the AA and NHPI community, and Maui Economic
    Development Board, which works with community organizations serving
    smaller Hawaiian Islands, such as Moloka‘i and Lanai. Navigator
    organizations have also directly counseled over 1,400 clients
    identifying as AA and NHPI.
-   **The Small Business Administration (SBA) distributed loans to AA
    and NHPI business owners and entrepreneurs.** SBA distributed 1,084
    loans totaling $1.5 billion through its 504 Program, which provides
    long-term, fixed rate financing for major fixed assets that promote
    business growth and job creation; 5,603 loans totaling $5.3 billion
    through its 7(a) Program, which provides financial support for small
    businesses; and 165 microloans totaling $3.7 billion (in FY 2022)
    and 22,800 grants via the temporary Cares Act Restaurant
    Revitalization Fund totaling $5.95 billion (in FY 2021) to help
    small businesses and certain non-profit childcare centers start up
    and expand.
-   **Good Jobs Challenge to support AA and NHPI businesses.** The
    Department of Commerce (DOC)’s Economic Development Agency (EDA)
    announced grant awards to 32 industry-led workforce training
    partnerships in 31 states and Puerto Rico as part of the $500
    million Good Jobs Challenge funded by ARP.
    -   **Resilient Hawaii:**  The Good Jobs Challenge is investing $16
        million in the University of Hawaii, an EDA University Center
        and an Asian American and Native American Pacific
        Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI), to support four of
        Hawaii’s major industries: healthcare; information technology;
        energy and resilience; and film, arts, and media. The sectoral
        partnerships funded by this program will train thousands of
        workers, with a focus on NHPI communities, to secure quality
        jobs with local employers including Adventist Health Castle,
        Bank of Hawaii, and Diagnostic Laboratory Services.
    -   **Greater Boston Region (GBR) Regional Workforce Training System
        (RWTS):** The Good Jobs Challenge is investing $23 million in
        the Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Boston.
        In partnership with over 100 local employers, EDIC will create
        demand-driven pathways into quality childcare, healthcare, and
        energy jobs. Its clean energy sector partnership, led by
        Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology, an Asian American and
        Native American Pacific Islander-serving Institution, will
        partner with local unions to develop skilled journeymen workers
        to develop clean energy infrastructure.
-   **Strengthening export capacity.** The Department of Commerce
    (DOC)’s International Trade Administration (ITA) is leading the U.S.
    Commercial Service’s Global Diversity Export Initiative is committed
    to helping underserved communities in the United States, including
    AA and NHPI businesses among others to increase their exports.
    Through the Strategic Partnership Program, ITA continues its
    partnership with the Asian American Chamber of Commerce and the US
    Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce.
-   **Investing in Equitable Workforce Training.** The President is
    committed to creating pathways to the middle class, especially for
    people from underserved communities, by expanding skills-based
    hiring and increasing access to Registered Apprenticeship and
    workforce training. States, localities, community colleges, and
    community-based organizations have leveraged $40 billion in ARP
    funds to deliver training, expand career paths, encourage more
    Registered Apprenticeships, provide retention and hiring bonuses in
    critical industries, and power efforts to help underserved Americans
    and those who face barriers to employment secure good jobs. In 2022,
    the Department of Labor (DOL) awarded $121 million in grants to
    expand, diversify, and improve access to Registered Apprenticeships
    for underserved communities, including AA and NHPIs. The agency is
    also awarding $95 million to help people in marginalized and
    underrepresented populations overcome barriers to career and
    technical education programs they need to connect with quality jobs.
-   **Reversing decades of disinvestment through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law.** For years, politicians have talked about
    investing in our national infrastructure, but up until now they have
    failed to follow through. The lack of investment has fallen most
    heavily on underserved communities. The Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law will: replace lead pipes; increase access to training and
    good-quality jobs; expand affordable high-speed internet, reliable
    public transit, and clean drinking water; reconnect neighborhoods
    divided by legacy highway infrastructure; and provide other
    resources to communities.
-   **Ensuring digital equity.** The Department of Commerce (DOC)’s
    National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
    tentatively reserved $3 million to award grants to the U.S.
    territories. In addition, NTIA tentatively reserved $15 million to
    award grants to Indian Tribes, Alaska Native entities, and Native
    Hawaiian organizations for the purpose of creating Tribal / Native
    digital equity plans.
-   **Supporting rural development.** The Department of Agriculture’s
    Rural Development mission area has so far invested $467 million in
    Hawaii, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
    Islands, Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of
    Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, in grants, loans, and
    investments in infrastructure.

**Addressing Housing Discrimination and Helping AA and NHPI Communities
Stay in their Homes.** The Administration implemented a series of
measures that protected homeowners from foreclosure, including a
foreclosure moratorium, increased options for mortgage payment
forbearance, and enhanced loan modifications to resolve delinquencies.
In addition, the American Rescue Plan is helping struggling homeowners
catch up with their mortgage payments and utility costs through the
Homeowner Assistance Fund.

-   **Protecting AA and NHPI access to housing by combating housing
    discrimination.** Following President Biden’s Presidential
    Memorandum directing his Administration to address racial
    discrimination in the housing market, in February 2023, **Department
    of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)** published a Notice of
    Proposed Rulemaking to fulfill obligations under the Fair Housing
    Act to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing. This rule would help
    overcome patterns of segregation and to hold state, localities, and
    public housing agencies that receive federal funds accountable for
    ensuring that underserved communities have equitable access to
    affordable housing opportunities.
-   **New actions to protect renters and promote rental
    affordability.** In January 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration
    announced new actions to increase fairness in the rental market and
    further principles of fair housing. This includes actions to
    identify practices that may unfairly prevent applicants and tenants
    from accessing or staying in housing such as the discriminatory use
    of tenant background checks and algorithms in tenant screenings.
     These actions align with a new [Blueprint for a Renters Bill of
    Rights](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-House-Blueprint-for-a-Renters-Bill-of-Rights-1.pdf).
    The Blueprint lays out a set of principles to drive action by the
    federal government, state and local partners, and the private sector
    to strengthen tenant protections and encourage rental affordability.
-   In March 2023, the **Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
    Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity** **(FHEO)** awarded
    approximately $54 million in funding for the Fair Housing
    Initiatives Program (FHIP) to address violations of the Fair Housing
    Act and end housing discrimination. Included within these awards
    were seven FHIP grants that serve the AA and NHPI community. The
    grantees will provide education and outreach, translate materials
    into Asian and Pacific Islander languages and conduct enforcement
    related activities to address discriminatory acts against the AA and
    NHPI community.
-   **HUD’s FHEO and its Fair Housing Assistance Program partners** have
    reached conciliation agreements in 54 housing discrimination cases
    in FY2021 and FY2022 where an AA and NHPI individual filed a
    complaint based on race or national origin. For example, in May
    2021, HUD reached a
    [settlement](https://archives.hud.gov/news/2021/pr21-090.cfm) with
    housing providers in California who had allegedly failed to provide
    language access services to Vietnamese residents. The settlement
    resulted in financial compensation to affected residents and with
    the housing providers agreeing to make available free oral
    interpretation services and translated documents when required by
    law.
-   The **Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Federal
    Housing Administration (FHA)** has supported homeownership in the AA
    and NHPI community with a number of programs:
    -   FHA mortgage insurance facilitated affordable home financing or
        refinancing for over 55,000 AA and NHPI individuals and families
        over FY2021 and FY2022.
    -   More than 1,700 senior AA and NHPI homeowners used FHA’s Home
        Equity Conversion Mortgage program to age in place in their own
        homes over FY2021 and FY2022.
    -   Through expanded COVID-19 forbearance options, more than 52,000
        AA and NHPI homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages obtained a
        mortgage payment forbearance over FY2021 and FY2022.
    -   HUD-approved housing counseling agencies served more than 67,000
        AA and NHPI clients over FY2021 and FY2022.
-   **Providing stable housing for Native Hawaiian families.** The
    Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s Office of Native
    American Programs (ONAP) made available $5 million in Native
    Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) funding through the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s American Rescue Plan, providing
    critical rental and utility assistance to 564 low-income Native
    Hawaiian families in FY 2022. HUD also supported homeownership by
    issuing 107 Section 184A mortgage loan guarantees in FY 2021 and FY
    2022 representing over $30 million dollars in mortgage capital to
    Native Hawaiian families. 
-   The **Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s Office of
    Native American Program (ONAP)** provided training and technical
    assistance to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) to create
    a tenant-based rental assistance program for kupuna (elders). HUD
    [published](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_004)
    a proposed rule on January 4, 2023, that would make changes to the
    NHHBG regulation to clarify that NHHBG funds may be used for
    tenant-based or project-based rental assistance, thereby
    diversifying the types of affordable housing options available for
    Native Hawaiian communities.

**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity in K-12 Schools and an
Education Beyond High School.** The Biden-Harris Administration has
delivered the support necessary to enable every school to return to
full-time, in-person instruction and ensure student success by
accelerating academic recovery and addressing the mental health needs of
students. The Administration has also made college more affordable,
provided college students with supports for completion, and helped
federal student loan borrowers as they recover from the pandemic. He has
also worked to ensure equitable access to high-quality education for AA
and NHPI students.

-   **Confronting COVID-19 related harassment in schools**. In May 2021,
    the U.S. Department of Education wrote a letter to educators to
    address the increased harassment and violence directed at AA and
    NHPI students and families and remind schools about their roles in
    protecting AA and NHPI students as they returned to in-person
    learning. The Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) shared a
    resource guide on how to navigate these situations, and also shared
    “How to File a Discrimination Complaint with the Office for Civil
    Rights” in 24 languages, including in 11 Asian languages. The Civil
    Rights Divisions of the Department of Justice and Department of
    Education also partnered to create a resource on Confronting
    COVID-19-Related Harassment in Schools, to assist AA and NHPI
    students who have reported bullying and harassment by classmates
    because of their race or national origin, including their ethnicity,
    ancestry, and language.
-   **Safely reopening K-12 schools.** The ARP has provided more than
    $122 billion to help K-12 schools reopen safely.  These investments
    include set asides at the local and state level to ensure states and
    districts address the learning loss and social and emotional needs
    of students disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including AA
    and NHPI students, English learners, and students with disabilities.
-   **Supporting college students.** The ARP provided more than $36
    billion in support to institutions of higher education, including
    institutions that primarily serve AA and NHPI students, to help
    students stay enrolled, lower costs, keep faculty and staff
    employed, and slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. All
    students, regardless of citizenship, who met the appropriate
    criteria were eligible to receive emergency financial aid grants
    funded by the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. The
    Biden-Harris Administration delivered $5 billion in ARP funds to
    support Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving
    Institutions (AANAPISIs).
-   In October 2022, The **Department of Commerce (DOC)’s Minority
    Business Development Agency (MBDA)**  awarded a [Minority Colleges
    and Universities
    grant](https://www.mbda.gov/news/press-releases/2022/10/mbda-announces-175-million-grants-minority-colleges-and-universities)
    to a Native Hawaiian Serving Institution (NHSI), which is now the
    fourth MBDA Equity in Hawaii.  Chaminade University of Honolulu,
    Hawaii received $300,711 and will develop and pilot a Sustainability
    Entrepreneurship course (expanding to a public certificate program)
    and develop a “Pathways to Entrepreneurship” series of workshops and
    seminars.
-   The **Department of Defense (DoD)’s** SMART Program is creating
    University Liaison positions that will focus on building
    relationships with HBCUs, and MSIs, to include AANAPISIs and ANNHs,
    to strengthen and expand SMART’s academic partnership opportunities.
    The SMART Program received:
    -   2,555 applicants for the 2022 cohort.
    -   128 applicants attended an Asian American and Native American
        Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI) and 8 attended
        an Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian (ANNH)-Serving Institution.
    -   Among all applicants (irrespective of institution), 8.9%
        identified as Asian and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
        Islander.
    -    482 individuals were ultimately awarded a SMART scholarship as
        part of the 2022 cohort, with 21 awardees attending AANAPISI and
        1 attending an ANNH.
    -   Among all awardees (irrespective of institution), 8.9%
        identified as Asian and 0.1% as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
        Islander.
    -   The SMART Program received 3,061 applicants for consideration in
        the 2023 cohort.
    -   284 applicants attend an AANAPISI and 4 attend ANNH
        institutions. 
    -   Among all applicants (irrespective of institution), 9.7%
        identified as Asian and 0.2% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
        Islander. Awardees for the 2023 cohort will be announced in
        April 2023.
-   On February 27, 2023, the **Department of Commerce (DOC)’s**
    **National Telecommunications and Information Administration
    (NTIA*)***, awarded more than $175 million to 61 colleges and
    universities as part of the [Connecting Minority Communities Pilot
    Program](https://www.ntia.gov/press-release/2023/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-175-million-internet-all-grants-61)
    (CMC). These new awards cover colleges and universities in 29 states
    and four territories. American Samoa Community College was awarded
    $2.99 million and the College of Micronesia –FSM was awarded $1.2
    million. The grants will provide access to affordable, reliable,
    high-speed internet service, which is necessary for minority
    students and local communities to fully access school, healthcare,
    and jobs.
-   **Providing support to borrowers.** President Biden believes that a
    post-high school education should be a ticket to a middle-class
    life, but for too many AA and NHPI students and graduates, the cost
    of borrowing for college is a lifelong burden that deprives them of
    that opportunity.

In August 2022, President Biden announced a plan that:

-   **Provides one-time debt relief to low- and middle-income borrowers
    to make sure borrowers are not worse off with respect to their loans
    because of the pandemic.** President Biden’s one-time debt relief
    plan provides up to $20,000 in debt relief to Pell Grant recipients
    with loans held by the Department of Education, and up to $10,000 in
    debt relief to non-Pell Grant recipients. Borrowers are eligible for
    this relief if their individual income is less than $125,000
    ($250,000 for married couples. No one in the top 5% of incomes will
    benefit from this action. While litigation is currently preventing
    the Administration from providing this debt relief, the
    Administration remains confident that the program is legal. In the
    less than four weeks that the application was available, 26 million
    people either applied for debt relief or had already provided
    sufficient information to the Department of Education to be deemed
    eligible for relief. Over 16 million of those borrowers’
    applications were fully approved by the Department and sent to loan
    servicers before the program was enjoined in litigation.
-   **Makes the student loan system more manageable for current and
    future borrowers.** These steps include:
    -   Cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans. The
        Department of Education is proposing an income-driven repayment
        plan that protects more low-income borrowers from making any
        payments and caps monthly payments for undergraduate loans at 5%
        of a borrower’s discretionary income—half of the rate that
        borrowers must pay now under most existing plans. This means
        that the average annual student loan payment will be lowered by
        more than $1,000 for both current and future borrowers.
    -   Fixing the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program
        by ensuring that borrowers who have worked at a nonprofit, in
        the military, or in federal, state, Tribal, or local government,
        receive appropriate credit toward loan forgiveness. These
        regulatory changes build on temporary changes the Department of
        Education made to PSLF, under which roughly 360,000 public
        servants received more than $24 billion in loan forgiveness.
    -   Ensuring targeted student loan forgiveness programs work. To
        date, the Department of Education has approved a total of more
        than $66 billion in relief to over 2.2 million student loan
        borrowers who were defrauded by their college, enrolled in a
        college that abruptly closed, are permanently disabled and
        unable to work, and borrowers who serve our country through
        government or non-profit work.
-   **Protecting future students and taxpayers by reducing the cost of
    college and holding schools accountable when they hike up
    prices.** The President championed the largest increase to Pell
    Grants in the last decade – a combined increase of $900 to the
    maximum award for students over the last two years – and has a plan
    to double the maximum Pell Grant by 2029 to nearly $13,000. To
    further reduce the cost of college, the President will continue to
    fight to make community college free. Meanwhile, colleges have an
    obligation to keep prices reasonable and ensure borrowers get value
    for their investments, not debt they cannot afford. This
    Administration has already taken key steps to strengthen
    accountability, including in areas where the previous Administration
    weakened rules such as holding career colleges accountable for
    leaving their students with mountains of debt that they cannot
    repay.

**Ensuring Language Access and Native Language Revitalization for AA and
NHPI Communities.** At the President’s direction, agencies across the
Biden-Harris Administration have taken a number of steps to improve
access to vital federal programs for AA and NHPI communities.

-   The **Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s Office of
    Field Policy and Management** translated the [Office of Davis-Bacon
    and Labor Standards’ *Construction Workers Pocket
    Guide*](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Labor/documents/Davis-Bacon_Worker_Pocket_Guide.pdf)
    into
    [Vietnamese](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Labor/documents/Davis-Bacon_Worker_Pocket_Guide_Vietnamese.pdf)
    and
    [Chinese](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Labor/documents/Davis-Bacon_Worker_Pocket_Guide_Simplified%20_Chinese.pdf)
    this year, along with other languages, to increase accessibility and
    broader understanding of federal wage protections in HUD-funded
    projects.
-   The **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** conducted initial
    assessments to determine which vital documents have been translated
    into top AA and NHPI languages encountered in select homeland
    security programs, specifically terrorist alerts and messaging on
    domestic extremism; access to civil rights complaints; immigration
    detention; immigration benefits; and security and safety statements
    related to immigration enforcement during disasters. DHS translated
    its National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin into Chinese
    (Simplified and Traditional), Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese
    and its statements on safety and immigration issued during Hurricane
    Ida and Hurricane Ian into Chinese (Simplified and Traditional) and
    Vietnamese.   
-   The **Federal Housing and Finance Agency** **(FHFA)** translated
    multiple origination and servicing-related documents into Korean,
    Chinese, Vietnamese, and Tagalog, and these translations are now
    available on FHFA’s website. In March 2023, the requirement to ask
    for and maintain an applicants’ preferred language was implemented.
    The industry is now required to ask borrowers their preferred
    language as part of an addendum to the loan application and that
    information will transfer to the mortgage servicer.
-   The **Social Security Administration (SSA)** expanded its internet
    site to include Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog and Simplified Chinese
    translated publications. SSA also made linguistic updates to its
    visitor intake kiosks to better facilitate the check-in process at
    local field offices.
-   In FY 2022, the **Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)**
    posted translations of 18 additional webpages in Chinese, Korean,
    Vietnamese, and Tagalog and continued to assess its language access
    capabilities by reinvigorating its Language Access Working Group and
    beginning to identify potential updates to the agency’s existing
    Language Access Plan.
-   The **Department of Interior (DOI)’s Office of Native Hawaiian
    Relations** developed a Department Manual (DM) chapter to
    standardize the use of ʻŌlelo Hawai‘i by the Department.
-   The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** now provides document
    translation, in-person and virtual interpretation, voice
    over/subtitle, web-support, and telephonic interpretation services,
    which are available for all EPA HQ and regional program offices. The
    telephonic interpretation service is available for use by all EPA
    employees 24/7 with over 175 languages available.
-   The **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** awarded a new
    translations contract which now allows the agency to provide
    enhanced translation capability including in AA and NHPI languages.
    The **Commission** created consumer-friendly fact sheets and other
    materials online about its Affordable Connectivity Program and
    translated them into Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Korean,
    Vietnamese, and Tagalog.
-   The **Department of Justice (DOJ)** continued to make efforts to
    improve and expand language access across its department and to law
    enforcement agencies. Efforts include:
    -   Convening the Language Access Working Group which provides
        technical assistance and training across its components as they
        continue to improve language access for all, including AA and
        NHPI communities;
    -   Launching the [Law Enforcement Language Access
        Initiative](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-new-language-access-law-enforcement-initiative),
        a nationwide effort to assist law enforcement agencies in
        meeting their obligations to provide meaningful language
        assistance to Limited English Proficiency (LEP ) individuals;
        and
    -   Adding information to its website on reporting hate crimes in 24
        languages, including 18 of the most frequently spoken AA and
        NHPI languages in the country.
-   **Implementing** [**Language Access at
    HUD**](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/FHEO/documents/HUD_Language_Access_Plan.pdf).
    HUD’s language access plan outlines HUD’s commitment to providing
    meaningful access for people with limited English proficiency across
    all programs, services, and activities conducted by the Department.
    HUD developed social media and [web-based
    resources](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/housing-counseling/fheo/) for
    housing counseling agencies to reach those with limited English
    proficiency who may be struggling to make their mortgage payments
    due to COVID-19. These materials are available in multiple
    languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Samoan, Tagalog,
    Thai, Vietnamese, and Punjabi. Similarly, HUD has general homebuying
    information available for housing counselors to use with clients in
    multiple languages, including Korean, Laotian, Tagalog, Mandarin,
    and Vietnamese.
-   **Expanding language access and assistance for arts
    programs**. Using ARP funds, the National Endowment for the Arts
    (NEA) expanded language access and language assistance, including
    for the first time translating [guidelines and supporting
    materials](https://www.arts.gov/about/news/2021/nea-offers-relief-funds-help-arts-and-culture-sector-recover-pandemic) into
    Chinese. The NEA has also held grant workshops with the Asian
    American Arts Alliance, the Asian American Writers’ Workshop, the
    Consortium of Asian American Theaters & Artists, and HowlRound.
    These workshops provided technical assistance for ARP grant
    applications, better equipping culturally-specific organizations to
    apply successfully for relief funding.
-   **Increasing access to contracting, grant, employment, and
    internship opportunities at the Department of Defense
    (DoD). ** Through the implementation of specific outreach programs
    to advance inclusivity, the Department of Defense’s Taking the
    Pentagon To The People Program (TTPTTP) is aimed at increasing
    access to contracts, federal grants, resources, and employment
    programs for AA and NHPIs and other underserved communities.  In
    addition, DOD is working to strengthen the capacity and the
    infrastructure of Asian American Native American Pacific Islander
    Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs) and other Minority-Serving
    Institutions (MSIs) and increase opportunities for AA and NHPI
    serving institutions to participate in Federal programs. 

**Advancing Equity for AA and NHPI Communities Through White House
Leadership and Initiatives.** On his first day in office, President
Biden signed the historic Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and
Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. The
President’s Order emphasized the enormous human costs of systemic
racism, persistent poverty, and other disparities, and directed the
Federal Government to advance an ambitious whole-of-government equity
agenda that matches the scale of the challenges we face as a country and
the opportunities we have to build a more perfect union. Over the last
two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has championed racial equity
and advanced equal opportunity for underserved communities, including AA
and NHPI communities. During the President’s first year in office, 90
federal agencies across the federal government, including all
Cabinet-level agencies as well as over 50 independent agencies,
conducted equity assessments of three to five of their agency’s
high-impact services for the American people, to uncover where systemic
barriers to access may exist. Using those findings, agencies developed
Equity Action Plans for addressing—and achieving—equity in their mission
delivery for all Americans. The Equity Action Plans include
accountability mechanisms and identify success metrics and key
milestones toward progress.

-   **Executive Order on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
    Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.** To
    strengthen the federal government’s equity commitment, on February
    16, 2023, President Biden signed a second Executive Order on equity
    that directs the federal government to continue the work to make the
    promise of America real for every American including communities of
    color, Tribal communities, rural communities, LGBTQI+ individuals,
    people with disabilities, women and girls, veterans and communities
    impacted by persistent poverty. This second equity Executive Order
    requires agencies to designate senior leaders accountable for
    implementing the Executive Order; directs agencies to produce Equity
    Action Plans annually and report to the public on their progress;
    requires agencies to improve the quality, frequency, and
    accessibility of their community engagement; formalizes the
    President’s goal of increasing the share of federal contracting
    dollars awarded to small disadvantaged business by 50 percent by
    2025; directs agencies to spur economic growth in rural areas and
    advance more equitable urban development; instructs agencies to
    consider bolstering the capacity of their civil rights offices and
    focusing their efforts on emerging threats like algorithmic
    discrimination in automated technology; directs the White House
    Office of Management and Budget to support agencies’ Equity Action
    Plans and invest in underserved communities each year through the
    formulation of the President’s budget; and further promotes data
    equity and transparency.
-   **Reestablishing and expanding the White House Initiative and
    President’s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native
    Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.** In May 2021, the President
    signed [Executive Order
    14031](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-establishes-the-white-house-initiative-on-asian-americans-native-hawaiians-and-pacific-islanders/) reestablishing
    the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
    Pacific Islanders, and delivering on the President’s commitment to
    reinstate and reinvigorate this historic Initiative. The Initiative
    is led out of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and
    is co-chaired by HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and U.S. Trade
    Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai. The Initiative is charged
    with driving an ambitious, whole-of-government agenda to advance
    equity, justice, and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities. In
    addition, the Executive Order establishes a Presidential Advisory
    Commission on AA and NHPIs to advise the President on ways the
    public, private and non-profit sectors can work together to advance
    equity and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities.  The Commission
    is also charged with advising the President on policies to address
    anti-Asian xenophobia and violence, ways to build capacity in AA and
    NHPI communities through federal grantmaking, and policies to
    address the barriers that AA and NHPI women, LGBTQI+ people, and
    people with disabilities face.
     The [Commission](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/20/president-biden-announces-intent-to-appoint-commissioners-to-the-presidents-advisory-commission-on-asian-americans-native-hawaiians-and-pacific-islanders/) is
    made up of leaders who reflect the rich diversity of AA and NHPI
    communities across the country.
-   **Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA)
    in the Federal Government**. In June 2021, the President signed
    an [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/) advancing
    diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the federal
    government. The Executive Order establishes that it is the policy of
    the Biden-Harris Administration to cultivate a workforce that draws
    from the full diversity of the nation. As the nation’s largest
    employer, the federal government must be a model for diversity,
    equity, and inclusion, and accessibility, where all employees are
    treated with dignity and respect. In particular, the Executive Order
    directs agencies to mitigate barriers that AA and NHPI employees,
    first generation professionals, religious minorities, and workers
    with limited English proficiency face in accessing federal
    employment opportunities, including in positions of leadership.
-   **Signed the Respect for Marriage Act.** In December 2022, President
    Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law, which requires
    that interracial marriages and same-sex marriage must be recognized
    as legal in every state in the nation. The is a vital step towards
    advancing the civil rights of all Americans.
-   **Launching a National Strategy to Advance Equity, Justice, and
    Opportunity for AA and NHPI Communities: **In January 2023, the
    Biden-Harris Administration [released its first-ever national
    strategy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/17/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-to-uplift-asian-american-native-hawaiian-and-pacific-islander-communities/)
    to promote safety and equity for AA and NHPIs. The strategy, which
    comprises action plans prepared by 32 federal agencies—including all
    15 executive departments in the President’s Cabinet—builds on the
    Administration’s broader equity agenda and details much needed
    investments in AA and NHPI communities and priorities, including
    data disaggregation, language access, and combatting anti-Asian
    hate.
-   **Strengthening the pipeline for AA and NHPIs in the Federal
    Workforce.** On May 23, 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration
    [hosted a historic
    conference](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/30/biden-harris-administration-hosts-historic-asian-american-native-hawaiian-pacific-islander-federal-employee-leadership-development-conference.html)
    focused on supporting AA and NHPI federal employees and cultivating
    leaders within the federal government–marking the first time such an
    event has been held at this scale and by any administration
    since 2014. More than 1,000 employees representing over 100 federal
    agencies registered to attend the hybrid conference, which was
    organized by the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native
    Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (WHIAANHPI) in close partnership
    with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the U.S.
    Department of Transportation (DOT).

**Strengthening Partnerships with AA and NHPI Communities.** The
Biden-Harris Administration is committed to strengthening our engagement
efforts and foster greater collaboration with AA and NHPI communities.

-   On May 3, 2023, the White House and the White House Initiative on
    Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (WHIAANHPI)
    hosted **The White House Forum on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians,
    and Pacific Islanders (AA and NHPIs)** in Washington DC, kicking off
    AA and NHPI Heritage Month under the theme ‘Visible Together.’ The
    all-day event drew more than 1,300 AA and NHPI community
    members from over two dozen states and U.S. territories, making it
    one of the largest in-person events ever hosted by the Biden-Harris
    Administration in celebration of AA and NHPI Heritage Month.
-   In October 2022, the **Department of Transportation (DOT)**’s
    Federal Transit Administration (FTA) launched its national series of
    public transit listening sessions in New York City before holding
    its second session in San Francisco in January 2023 and its third
    session in Houston in April 2023. As a follow-up to those listening
    sessions, DOT is directly engaging specific stakeholders. FTA also
    plans to host additional listening session throughout 2023 in cities
    across the country, including Denver, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Las
    Vegas.
-   The **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**, Bureau of Consumer
    Protection staff conducted outreach and consumer education campaigns
    to and through ethnic media outlets, as well as directly to
    communities, including AA and NHPI communities, about the financial
    impact of the pandemic.
-   The **Department of the Interior (DOI)**, for the first time in the
    agency’s history, will require formal consultation with the Native
    Hawaiian community. Two new Department Manual (DM) chapters that
    provide the policy and process for consultation were reviewed by all
    necessary internal officials at DOI and shared with the Native
    Hawaiian community and then publicly in October 2022.  Consultations
    were held on November 10 and December 5, 2022, and comments were
    received through February 1, 2023. Input is now being reviewed and
    deliberated.
-   In September 2022, the **Department of the Interior (DOI)** also
    released new guidance from the Bureau of Land Management, National
    Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to improve federal
    stewardship of public lands, waters, and wildlife in collaboration
    with the Native Hawaiian community. DOI’s expanded outreach and
    engagement are in recognition of its distinct obligations to the
    Native Hawaiian community.
-   The **Department of Interior’s Office of Insular Affairs (OIA)**
    provided $55 million through CARES Act grant assistance for
    facilities, medicine, food, and supplies to Pacific Islander
    populations in the U.S. territories, the Republic of Palau, the
    Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall
    Islands, and to support OIA’s Insular Area Pacific Islander
    populations in the contiguous United States. 
-   Building upon extensive engagement from Massachusetts to Los
    Angeles, **U.S. Trade Representative** Ambassador Katherine Tai and
    USTR officials continue to meet consistently with domestic AA and
    NHPI community-based leaders and organizations.  In recent meetings
    within Houston and with Commissioner Victoria Huynh and Atlanta
    Metropolitan Area community members, the discussions focused both on
    the Administration’s intentional design of inclusive,
    worker-centered trade policy and the work of WHIAANHPI and the
    Commission.  Ambassador Tai also tasked the entire agency to
    identify opportunities for engagements concerning upcoming key trade
    and investment activities.
    -   For example, USTR is integrating economic inclusion for AA and
        NHPIs and other underserved and underrepresented groups into
        engagement planning during the United States’ host year of Asia
        Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). The theme is *“Creating a
        Resilient and Sustainable Future for All.”  In March 2023, USTR
        released additional information about its inclusive trade work
        in the* [Congressional Budget
        Justification](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/march/ustr-releases-fiscal-year-2024-congressional-budget-justification)
        and the  [President’s 2023 Trade Agenda and 2022 Annual
        Report](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/2023%20Trade%20Policy%20Agenda%20and%202022%20Annual%20Report%20FINAL%20(1).pdf),
        which specifically mentions WHIAANHPI for the first time in the
        history of the report.
-   In May 2021 and May 2022, **the United States Patent and Trade
    Office (USPTO)** hosted an [AA and NHPI Innovation and
    Entrepreneurship event
    series](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/events/aanhpi-innovation-and-entrepreneurship-event-series)
    that offered opportunities for AA and NHPI independent inventors,
    entrepreneurs, and small business owners to learn about resources
    and opportunities to use their creative works to reach their full
    potential. The USPTO is hosting the [2023 AA and NHPI
    Innovation](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/events/2023-asian-american-and-native-hawaiianpacific-islander-innovation-and)
    on May 31, 2023. The 2023 Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific
    Islander Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program offers
    opportunities for independent inventors, entrepreneurs, small
    business owners, and intellectual property (IP) professionals to
    learn about resources available to the AA and NHPI innovation
    community.

        roundtable on COVID-19 Response and Recovery. This was an
        historic event as the first in-person national event for
        WHIAANHPI and Region 9 Southwest post-pandemic. Participants
        included Commissioners Kerry Doi and Dr. Raynald Samoa of the
        President’s Advisory Commission on AANHPIs, state and elected
        officials, state senior appointees, AA and NHPI community
        leaders and stakeholders, academic partners, and federal

    community about contracting and business opportunities as well as
    employment opportunities resulting from investments via the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. The DOE
    also participated in two WHIAANHPI Regional Summits in Seattle and
    New York City to share Federal and DOE opportunities related to
    careers, grants, financial assistance, and internships. Finally, the
    DOE will be sponsoring the upcoming Federal Asian American Pacific
    Council (FAPAC)’s 2023 National Leadership Training Program in Long
    Beach, CA in May. The Department is partnering with the DOE’s Asian
    American Pacific Islander Network (AAPIN) Employee Resource Group to
    sponsor ERG members in the Federal workforce for professional
    development, capacity-building, and enhancing leadership skills.

    Annual Asian American and Pacific Islander Conference and Career
    Expo in February 2023, collaborated with PepsiCo Foundation and two
    higher education institutions, California State University (Cal
    State), Fresno and York College in Queens, NY. As part of the
    conference, USAID hosted an Innovation and Diversity Engagement case

    to directly impact the youth in our underserved communities and to
    inspire local students to pursue careers in the sciences. NOAA
    provided a unique opportunity to engage with students earlier in
    their project process, and provided a direct link to NOAA data,
    science, and scientists.  Each year, there are approximately 6,000
    participants across 100 Public and Private School fairs, with about
    30% advancing to compete at one of nine District Fairs.

**Restoring Fairness and Humanity to Our Immigration System. **
President Biden is committed to reforming our immigration system,
promoting racial equity in our immigration policies, and providing legal
protections for all noncitizens, including AA and NHPI noncitizens, who
call this country home.

-   **Promoting naturalization.** President Biden is committed to making
    the naturalization process more accessible for eligible noncitizens,
    directing the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
    and the Secretary of State to improve naturalization processing,
    identify and remove barriers to naturalization, and reduce backlogs
    for naturalization applications. To advance these goals, the
    President established an Interagency Working Group, which developed
    the Interagency Strategy to Promote Naturalization. In Fiscal Year
    (FY) 2022, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) reduced
    the naturalization application backlog by 62 percent and welcomed
    more than 1 million new U.S. citizens to this country, the highest
    number of naturalized citizens in nearly 15 years. USCIS also
    awarded nearly $20 million in grants to 66 organizations to provide
    citizenship preparation resources, support, and information to
    immigrants and immigrant-serving organizations.
-   **Promoting integration and inclusion for new Americans.** To ensure
    that lawfully-present new immigrants and refugees receive the
    support they need to fully participate in and contribute to our
    country and their communities, the President established the Task
    Force on New Americans. The Task Force on New Americans is
    coordinating the federal government’s efforts to welcome and support
    immigrants, including refugees, catalyzing State and local
    integration and inclusion efforts, and developing recommendations on
    new policy options and strategies to promote immigrant integration
    and inclusion.
-   **Utilizing all available employment-based immigrant visas**.  U.S.
    Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Department of
    State issued more than 275,000 employment-based immigrant visas
    (green cards) in FY 2022 – double the pre-pandemic number. Over the
    past two fiscal years, more than 223,000 employment-based visas have
    been issued to nationals of India and China, the countries with the
    longest wait time for such visas.
-   **Supporting immigrant veterans.** The Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA) has partnered with DHS to provide needed care and
    services to deported veterans, including timely and accurate
    information on immigration services. In addition, DHS established an
    online center to consolidate federal resources for immigrant
    veterans, which includes a portal for deported veterans to request
    permission to return to the United States or access VA benefits to
    which they may be entitled. To date, DHS and the VA have worked to
    facilitate the return of more than 60 deported veterans to the
    United States through the joint Immigrant Military Members and
    Veterans Initiative (IMMVI).
-   **Supporting comprehensive immigration reform
    legislation.**  President Biden remains committed to passing
    broad-based legislation to finally reform our broken immigration
    system and provide a pathway to citizenship to millions of
    undocumented individuals, including AA and NHPI noncitizens.

**Building an Administration that Represents America.** President Biden
has assembled the most diverse Administration in our nation’s history
and is proud to serve alongside Vice President Kamala Harris—the first
Black American and South Asian American to be elected Vice President— as
well as the 14 percent of all agency appointees that are AA and NHPI,
exceeding their 7 percent share of the Census population. In the White
House itself, 17 percent of all staff and 26 percent of the President’s
commissioned officer staff identify as AA and NHPI. The Biden-Harris
Administration has taken further action to ensure equal opportunity and
inclusion is emphasized throughout the administration, including:

Appointing AA and NHPIs to lead critical agencies. AA and NHPIs are
represented at the top level of the administration in the President’s
Cabinet and as heads of agencies. This list of senior officials includes
United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai, Director of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Rohit Chopra, Surgeon General of
the United States Vice Admiral Vivek Murthy, Chair of the Federal Trade
Commission Lina Khan, Director of the Office of Personnel Management
Kiran Ahuja, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, Director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy Rahul Gupta, Director of the
Office of Science and Technology Policy Arati Prabhakar, and Acting
