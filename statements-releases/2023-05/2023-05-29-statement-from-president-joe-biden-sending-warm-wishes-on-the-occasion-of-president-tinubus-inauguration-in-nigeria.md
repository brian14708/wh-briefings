  \ President Tinubu\u2019s Inauguration in\_Nigeria"

On behalf of the people of the United States, I send warm wishes to the
government and people of Nigeria as they inaugurate a new President.  My
administration has worked to strengthen ties between the United States
and Nigeria, and I look forward to continuing this work with President
Tinubu to support economic growth, advance security, and promote respect
for human rights.  The people-to-people connections between our two
countries run particularly deep, nurtured by a vibrant Nigerian Diaspora
in the United States.  As we further deepen our partnership with
Nigeria, I look forward to drawing even more on the ideas and energy of
this dynamic connection between our countries.  As Africa’s largest
democracy and economy, Nigeria’s success is the world’s success. 
Elected leaders owe it to their people to show that democracy can
deliver for their needs.  And the United States will continue to work
closely with Nigeria, as a friend and partner, to deliver a more
peaceful and prosperous future for our world.
