title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Minnesota\
  \ Enacting Paid Family and Medical\_Leave"
---
 
Today, with Governor Tim Walz’s signature, Minnesota has become the
twelfth state, along with the District of Columbia, to pass paid family
and medical leave legislation, and the first state to do so in 2023.
President Biden commends the leadership of Governor Tim Walz, Lt.
Governor Peggy Flanagan, Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman, Senate
Majority Leader Kari Dziedzic, legislative sponsors, and state and
community leaders who played essential roles in this achievement for
Minnesota families. This legislation will ensure that Minnesotans can
take the time they need to recover from a serious illness, care for a
sick family member, or welcome a new child without losing a paycheck.
The paid family and medical leave program will grow Minnesota’s economy
by helping Minnesotans stay in the workforce and boosting families’
economic security. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to support
national paid family and medical leave for families across the country
and applauds states like Minnesota that have made significant progress
in advancing comprehensive paid leave.
