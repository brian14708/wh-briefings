title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on United Steelworkers Vote in Fort Valley,\_\
  GA"
---
 
Congratulations to the workers at Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Georgia, on
their vote to unionize and join the United Steelworkers. The men and
women at Blue Bird are building electric school buses that are powering
America’s clean energy future, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and
ensuring our kids breathe cleaner air. The fact is: the middle class
built America. And unions built the middle class. That’s why my
Investing in America Agenda is about creating good-paying jobs – jobs
that don’t require a four year degree, jobs you can raise a family on.
Jobs where you get a free and fair choice to join a union.

Where is it written that America can’t lead the world again in
manufacturing? The workers at Blue Bird, and at companies just like it
all over the country, are proving the future can and will be built in
America. And union workers will be a big part of that future.
