title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on House Passage of the Bipartisan Budget\_\
  Agreement"
---
 
Tonight, the House took a critical step forward to prevent a first-ever
default and protect our country’s hard-earned and historic economic
recovery. This budget agreement is a bipartisan compromise. Neither side
got everything it wanted. That’s the responsibility of governing. I want
to thank Speaker McCarthy and his team for negotiating in good faith, as
well as Leader Jeffries for his leadership.  
  
This agreement is good news for the American people and the American
economy. It protects key priorities and accomplishments from the past
two years, including historic investments that are creating good jobs
across the country. And, it honors my commitment to safeguard Americans’
health care and protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It
protects critical programs that millions of hardworking families,
students, and veterans count on.  
  
I have been clear that the only path forward is a bipartisan compromise
that can earn the support of both parties. This agreement meets that
test. I urge the Senate to pass it as quickly as possible so that I can
sign it into law, and our country can continue building the strongest
economy in the world.
