  Biden\u2019s Meeting with Quad\_Leaders"
---
 
After President Biden had to postpone his trip to Australia, the Quad
leaders agreed that they would hold their summit in Hiroshima to ensure
that the four leaders could come together to mark the Quad’s progress
over the past year. So tomorrow, in addition to the G7, President Biden
will participate in the third in-person Quad Leaders’ meeting with Prime
Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of
Japan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. Along with sharing
strategic assessments, the leaders will welcome new forms of Quad
cooperation on secure digital technology, submarine cables,
infrastructure capacity building, and maritime domain awareness.
President Biden thanks Prime Minister Albanese, as well as the Prime
Ministers of Japan and India, for their flexibility, and he looks
forward to rescheduling his trip.
