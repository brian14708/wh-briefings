title: "Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Roadmap to Support Good\_Jobs"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Investing in America Agenda is sparking a
manufacturing, construction, and clean energy renaissance across the
country. To help ensure America’s workers can access the good jobs
created by historic new investments, the Administration is aligning on a
whole-of-government effort, the Roadmap to Support Good Jobs. The
purpose of this collaborative vision is to build our workforce by
ensuring every American—whether they go to college or not—will have
equitable access to high-quality training, education, and services that
provide a path to a good career without leaving their community.

To accomplish the President’s vision of growing our economy from the
bottom up and middle out, we will strengthen and expand our workforce by
partnering with employers to provide opportunities for good-paying,
family-sustaining jobs across the country. The President’s historic
investments in a future Made in America will create millions of jobs
rebuilding our infrastructure, supply chains, and manufacturing here at
home, through the American Rescue Plan (ARP), Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law (BIL), CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. Breaking
down longstanding barriers that have left many on the sidelines,
including women and people of color, is not just an historic
opportunity—it’s an economic necessity.

To meet this moment, we must ensure students and workers at all stages
of life have equitable access to education and training for good jobs in
their communities. At the heart of this effort is ensuring the full
range of our education and training systems, including middle and high
schools, community colleges, community organizations, unions, and more,
work in lockstep with employers to prepare and place millions of
students and workers from all backgrounds in sustainable quality jobs
across critical sectors—including clean energy, semiconductor
manufacturing, construction, healthcare, information technology,
education and child care, and biotechnology.

The roadmap focuses on four priorities: 1) connecting people to good
jobs; 2) ensuring we have the skilled, diverse workforce for our
transformational investments; 3) boosting education and training efforts
so every community can meet its foundational labor needs; and 4)
creating good quality, family-sustaining jobs, including union jobs.

In its first two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has already
taken historic steps in these four areas, with provisions to strengthen
our workforce built into the President’s signature legislation, which
can help serve as demonstrations to build off in future initiatives.
Today, the White House is announcing a series of actions to build on
that progress that will connect American workers to good-paying jobs and
make sure no community is left behind.  

**1. Connecting People to Good Jobs:** To achieve the President’s goals,
we must channel the full skills and talents of all our people. The
Administration is committed to ensuring all people can find and keep
quality jobs in their communities and that companies can find the best
talent. That means expanding free and affordable job training
opportunities such as Registered Apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship;
ensuring that wherever possible, federal funds support services (such as
child care) that help Americans enter and remain in the workforce; and
encouraging employers to hire workers based not on the degrees they
have, but the talent and skills they possess.

*Actions to achieve these goals include:*

-   The Department of Labor (DOL) will award $85 million in competitive
    and formula grants to states to better support state Registered
    Apprenticeship capacity, while also driving system capacity and
    readiness. DOL will also engage in rulemaking to build a modern and
    more navigable national apprenticeship system.
-   The Department of Transportation (DOT) will build on recent
    [guidance](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativeprograms/centers/workforce_dev/OST_Workforce_Development_Fact_Sheet.aspx)
    and help states and other partners understand how they can use
    flexible transportation funding—including annual highway formula
    funds, currently $48 billion under BIL—for workforce development
    services that connect people to jobs on projects, such as
    transportation assistance, child care, and other supportive
    services.
-   The Department of Commerce (DOC) will launch its new Recompete Pilot
    Program, awarding $200 million in grants to persistently distressed
    communities to support job creation, evidence-based workforce
    interventions, and long-term economic development.  

*Key actions to date:*

-   Promoted worker-centered sectoral training strategies through the
    American Rescue Plan’s $500 million [Good Jobs
    Challenge](https://www.eda.gov/arpa/good-job-challenge), providing
    training and credentials to get more workers into in-demand jobs in
    fields such as health care, clean energy manufacturing, and
    infrastructure.
-   Scaled and expanded Registered Apprenticeships to provide
    earn-while-you-learn opportunities by investing a historic $285
    million in fiscal year (FY) 2023, proposing [$335
    million](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/03/09/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-for-fiscal-year-2024/)
    in the FY 2024 budget, and encouraging Registered Apprenticeships
    through Federal grants and contracts. Launched the [Apprenticeship
    Ambassadors
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-the-apprenticeship-ambassador-initiative-to-create-equitable-debt-free-pathways-to-high-paying-jobs/#:~:text=FACT%20SHEET%3A%20Biden%2D%E2%81%A0Harris,Pathways%20to%20High%2DPaying%20Jobs)
    to amplify the Registered Apprenticeship model with private- and
    public-sector employers and took bold action to quickly scale
    apprenticeship in critical sectors like
    [cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/15/fact-sheet-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-accomplishes-cybersecurity-apprenticeship-sprint/).
-   Released [nearly $23
    million](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/03/31/hhs-awards-start-up-funds-community-based-health-care-providers-develop-programs-train-medical-dental-residents-in-community-settings.html)
    in American Rescue Plan funds to develop and establish new primary
    care residency programs in underserved and rural communities.  
-   Invested in career opportunities for justice-involved, youth, and
    other underserved workers—including through $115 million through
    2023 appropriations for the [Reentry Employment Opportunities
    program](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/reentry), $65 million for
    [Strengthening Community Colleges training
    grants](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/skills-training-grants/scc),
    and $105 million for [YouthBuild](https://youthbuild.org/).
-   Reduced barriers that limit workers’ access to good jobs, including
    proposing a [ban on non-compete
    agreements](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-noncompete-clauses-which-hurt-workers-harm-competition)
    covering nearly all American workers, and expanding opportunities in
    Federal service for people without four-year degrees through
    [skills-based
    hiring](https://chcoc.gov/content/guidance-release-eo-13932-modernizing-and-reforming-assessment-and-hiring-federal-job).

**2. Preparing Workers for Our Transformational Investments**: The
Administration has made major investments through the ARP, BIL, CHIPS,
and the Inflation Reduction Act that will create new jobs in sectors
vital to economic and national security such as advanced manufacturing,
cybersecurity, climate resilience, and electrification. The success of
these historic investments, and the building of a sustainable, resilient
economy for every community, depends upon the Nation’s education and
training systems adapting to emerging needs in these growing sectors. In
particular, we need to ensure schools and colleges, unions, non-profit
organizations, and governments at every level are collaborating with
employers to meet our economy’s needs and bring in workers traditionally
underrepresented in these fields. To that end, the Administration is
taking action to convene employers, labor unions, and workforce
development organizations to develop high-quality education and training
standards, portable credentials, and labor-management partnerships to
ensure a diverse, skilled workforce and good jobs in critical supply
chains. We are expanding career-connected learning strategies for youth,
including work-based learning, college credit, and industry credentials;
and maximizing use of federal workforce investments, including new
Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax incentives for projects
employing Registered qualified apprentices from Registered
Apprenticeship programs and training funds in BIL and CHIPS.

*Actions to achieve these goals include:*

-   DOC will award $500 million through its Tech Hubs program to
    accelerate the growth of select U.S. regions so that they become
    globally competitive in emerging technologies. This will include
    building the workforce needed to support innovation.
-   DOT will announce $1.7 billion in funding for bus and bus facilities
    grants. The program gives additional consideration to applicants
    with a strong plan for creating good-paying jobs and Registered
    Apprenticeship programs that include supportive services. Transit
    agencies moving to zero-emission fleets may request up to 5 percent
    of the grant for workforce development and supportive services to
    help current workers update their skills and train new hires.
-   The Department of Energy (DOE) will invest $150 million in BIL funds
    to expand its Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) Program, increasing
    pathways for workers into high-quality clean energy jobs and
    supporting small and medium-sized American manufacturers. The IAC
    Program will form new partnerships with community colleges, trade
    schools, and union training programs, offering hands-on experience
    for engineers-in-training while helping manufacturers save energy,
    reduce costs, increase productivity, and boost competitiveness.

*Key actions to date:*

-   Announced $80 million in [Building Pathways to Infrastructure
    Jobs](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/skills-grants/h1-b-skills-training)
    grants to train jobseekers in advanced manufacturing; information
    technology; and professional, scientific, and technical services
    occupations that support the renewable energy, transportation, and
    broadband infrastructure sectors. The grants from the Department of
    Labor (DOL) will fund partnerships between employers and the public
    sector to develop, strengthen, and scale promising and
    evidence-based training models in in-demand occupations. DOL intends
    to make a total of approximately $200 million available for Building
    Pathways to Infrastructure Jobs grants over multiple rounds of
    funding.
-   Invested more than [$40
    billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/12/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-over-40-billion-in-american-rescue-plan-investments-in-our-workforce-with-more-coming/#:~:text=July%2012%2C%202022-,FACT%20SHEET%3A%20White%20House%20Announces%20over%20%2440%20Billion%20in%20American,Our%20Workforce%20%E2%80%93%20With%20More%20Coming&text=On%20Wednesday%2C%20the%20White%20House,strengthening%20and%20expanding%20our%20workforce.)
    in workforce efforts through ARP funds to strengthen and expand our
    workforce, including efforts to train workers for in-demand jobs in
    fields from healthcare to clean energy manufacturing to
    infrastructure. This includes major investments of ARP State and
    Local Fiscal Recovery Funds—with state and local governments making
    3,500 workforce investments worth $11 billion.
-   Secured commitments to equitable workforce development from [more
    than 350
    organizations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-celebrates-new-commitments-toward-equitable-workforce-development-for-infrastructure-jobs/)
    in construction, broadband, and electrification as part of the White
    House Infrastructure Talent Pipeline Challenge.
-   Launched the [Battery Workforce
    Initiative](https://netl.doe.gov/bwi), an industry-driven,
    government-facilitated sectoral strategy to develop a skilled
    domestic battery manufacturing workforce.
-   Expanded equitable construction training opportunities through a
    [$20 million cooperative
    agreement](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20230306)
    with TradesFutures and the National Urban League, which will enroll
    13,000 young adults—particularly those from underrepresented
    communities—in apprenticeship readiness programs in the construction
    trades. 

**3. Ensuring Every Community Can Meet Its Foundational Labor Needs**:
The Administration will continue work to meet both long-term and urgent
labor supply needs and improve job quality in sectors foundational to
our economy and communities—urban and rural—such as health care, child
care, education, and transportation. This effort will require innovating
and strengthening education-to-workforce connections nationwide,
ensuring that education and training opportunities serve youth,
students, and workers at every stage of their career. To that end, the
Administration is strengthening high-quality, affordable career pathways
to healthcare and teaching jobs so that we have the nurses and teachers
we need; improving the quality of vital jobs such as child care, home
care, and meatpacking that experience recruitment and retention
challenges; and ensuring that supportive services like child care and
transportation assistance are integral to our workforce investments.

*Actions to achieve these goals include:*

*Key actions to date:*

-   [Child Care Stabilization
    funding](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-funds-provided-a-critical-lifeline-to-200000-child-care-providers-helping-millions-of-families-to-work/),
    already reaching over 220,000 child care programs across the
    country. These funds are allowing child care providers to retain and
    rehire workers and continue to support working families. More than
    one-third of child care programs receiving assistance report that
    they would have been forced to close permanently without this
    assistance.
-   [Nursing Expansion Grant
    Program](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20230511-0) to
    support workforce training programs and address staffing challenges
    nursing professionals face in the care economy.
-   and provided more than $400 million in competitive funding toward
    programs to develop, recruit, and retain high-quality educators.
-   [120 new trucking Registered
    Apprenticeship](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/04/fact-sheet-the-biden-administrations-unprecedented-actions-to-expand-and-improve-trucking-jobs/)
    programs.
-   [CHIPS
    Incentives](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/02/biden-harris-administration-launches-first-chips-america-funding)
    grants greater than $150 million provide a plan to improve access to
    high-quality child care for their semiconductor manufacturing and
    construction workforces.

**4. Boosting Job Quality to Promote Recruitment and Retention:** The
President’s goal is to ensure every job is a good job—consistent with
the [Good Jobs
Principles](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/principles)—meaning
they are well-paying, quality jobs, with benefits, safety, stability,
and worker voice. Key to this effort are expanding workers’ rights to
organize and collectively bargain and enhancing employer responsibility
for creating good jobs that people want to keep. To achieve this, we’re
working to triple Registered Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships to
ensure high-quality jobs—including union jobs—are accessible to those
previously excluded; and embedding job quality criteria in federal
funding opportunities. And we’re ensuring employers: comply with worker
protection laws; root out bias, discrimination, and harassment in the
workplace; guarantee workers a free and fair choice to join a union; and
provide high-quality benefits such as health care and child care.

*Actions to achieve these goals include:*

-   HHS will propose minimum staffing standards at nursing
    homes—promoting job quality and staffing among care workers—based on
    its research into the level and type of staffing needed to ensure
    safe and quality care.
-   DOT will issue a primer on local and economic hiring preferences—a
    key tool for workforce equity enabled for the first time in federal
    legislation under BIL—including best practices and case studies from
    across the country.

*Key actions to date:*

-   Created the [Good Jobs
    Initiative](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs) to provide
    critical resources to workers, employers, and governments as they
    work to improve job quality and equitable workforce development
    pipelines into good union jobs free from discrimination and
    harassment. The Good Jobs Initiative has collaborated with
    BIL-funded agencies to embed equity and good jobs criteria in more
    than [$97 billion](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/gji-impact)
    of competitive and formula funding.
-   Launched the [Mega Construction Projects (Megaprojects)
    Program](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/Mega-Construction-Project-Program)
    with participation from BIL- and CHIPS-implementing agencies. The
    program offers on-the-ground compliance assistance and stakeholder
    engagement from the earliest stages of a large construction project
    to remove hiring barriers and ensure a diverse pool of qualified
    workers—including women, people of color, veterans, and people with
    disabilities—for jobs in the trades. The program will also provide
    demographic data on underrepresented workers’ participation in
    Megaprojects.
-   Released
    [guidance](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/cte/perkins-educator-prep.pdf)
    for states, local educational agencies, community colleges, and
    other partners on leveraging Pell Grants and Career and Technical
    Education (CTE) funds for Registered Apprenticeships.
-   Launched a new [National Early Care and Education Workforce
    Center](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/02/02/hhs-launches-first-national-early-care-and-education-workforce-center.html),
    a $30 million investment to support research and technical
    assistance for states, territories, Tribes, and communities working
    to recruit, retain, and support a diverse and highly skilled early
    care and education workforce.
