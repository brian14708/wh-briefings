The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,

suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to

the threat of a catastrophe in the counties of Adams, Amite, Covington,
Forrest, Franklin, George, Greene, Hancock, Harrison, Jackson,

Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures, including
direct federal assistance will be provided at 75 percent Federal
funding.
