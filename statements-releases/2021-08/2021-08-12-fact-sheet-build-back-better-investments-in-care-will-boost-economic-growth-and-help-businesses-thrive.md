*On Thursday August 12<sup>th</sup>, Vice President Harris will meet
with business leaders to discuss how the care provisions in the Build
Back Better Agenda will help workers, businesses and the economy*  
  
*Leaders of Airbnb, Chobani, Etsy, Gap, Microsoft, Patagonia, Seventh
Generation to join Vice President Harris at the White House*  
  
*Care Can’t Wait Coalition announces support from over 275 companies for
care provisions in Build Back Better*  
 

Today, employers from across the country have stood together to make it
clear that a strong care infrastructure is critical to their businesses
and the U.S. economy.  
  
They know that it is bad for business and the economy when working
families do not have the support they need to work and find quality care
for their children and older or disabled relatives.  When workers don’t
have adequate care for their families, they are more likely to
experience care disruptions, which can translate to lower productivity,
increased absenteeism, and higher turnover – all hurting the bottom line
for businesses. For example, the [Work Institute’s 2020 Retention
Report](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=c26e82bdb6&e=60572324a0)
estimates that replacing an employee costs as much as 30% of a worker’s
annual salary.  
  
And, with a large portion of the workforce facing care challenges, it is
harder for businesses to recruit and retain a skilled, stable workforce
so that they can compete globally. The United States has been falling
behind its economic competitors in terms of the share of prime age men
and women (ages 25 to 54) participating in the labor force, in part due
to care challenges. One study estimates that [lack of access to
“family-friendly”
policies](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=6fab819cef&e=60572324a0),
such as child care and paid parental leave, explains nearly a third of
the decline in U.S. women’s labor force participation relative to other
OECD countries. Stagnant or falling labor force participation not only
hurts businesses directly, but it also represents a missed opportunity
to increase U.S. GDP growth.  
  
The President’s Build Back Better agenda has a robust plan to invest in
care —making child care and long-term care accessible and affordable,
and establishing national paid family and medical leave. These policies
are a win-win for both employees and employers and will strengthen our
economy as a whole. One economist finds the [President’s
plan](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=a57e7cabfc&e=60572324a0),
and especially its investments in the care economy, would [increase
labor force
participation](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=189bfdc01a&e=60572324a0)
by almost a full percentage point—with even greater gains for women—and
[boost the economy’s real GDP
growth](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=02abcb172b&e=60572324a0)
by 10 to 15 basis points in the long-term.    
  
**Child Care**  
  
[About
one-third](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=684d2638da&e=60572324a0)
of the U.S. workforce live with children under the age of 14. The
COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how the strain of child care hurts
businesses and the economy. [U.S. Chamber of Commerce
Foundation](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=e6bfd8b9dd&e=60572324a0)
research found that two-thirds of working parents faced child care
instability due to COVID-19, and that businesses have seen large numbers
of workers leaving due to child care issues. But, families have long
faced a caregiving crisis. Child care costs have been rising for
decades, and even before COVID-19, [43
percent](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=06b29853d0&e=60572324a0)
of parents with children under age six reported struggling to find
adequate child care for their children.

-   **Child care increases worker productivity and business revenue.**
    One
    [study](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=c8ebe145d8&e=60572324a0)
    found a $57 billion annual cost to the economy due to child-care
    related lost earnings, productivity, and revenue, including nearly
    $13 billion that employers shoulder due to workers’ inability to
    access high-quality, affordable care.
-   **Access to affordable, high-quality child care would increase
    workforce participation, providing a more robust recruitment
    pipeline for businesses**. Lack of childcare can make it
    logistically difficult for parents to work outside the home. Indeed,
    many parents
    [report](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=37dd9a1d59&e=60572324a0) that
    they work fewer hours than they need to or would prefer in order to
    care for their young children, and [86
    percent](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=cf9dc48774&e=60572324a0)
    of primary caregivers say problems with child care hurt their
    efforts or time commitment at work. The lack of adequate child care
    especially puts a strain on working mothers. In a
    [study](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=6424177cd1&e=60572324a0)
    of corporate America in 2020, one in four mothers considered slowing
    down their careers – including by reducing their hours, moving to
    part time, or taking a less demanding job – or leaving the workforce
    altogether.
    [Studies](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=8ccbb66ae1&e=60572324a0)
    of child care subsidies find that increased access to child care can
    increase the likelihood parents are [employed and employed
    full-time](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=f801bcc1fa&e=60572324a0).
-   **Child care investments would boost family incomes, which can
    support business and economic growth.** Child care has helped women
    enter the workforce, and over the past 40 years, as more women
    entered the labor force and brought home larger paychecks, they have
    driven [91
    percent](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=d1e9fa20b3&e=60572324a0) of
    the income gains experienced by middle-class families. When families
    have higher incomes, they can better save for retirement and
    purchase needed goods and services, driving consumer demand, and
    supporting business and economic growth.
-   **Investments in child care would make the U.S more competitive.**
    The United States now lags behind other developed countries
    in [investments](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=9c1d76c71b&e=60572324a0) in
    child care and early education, one major reason its labor force
    participation is declining while those of its competitors rise.
    Investments in child care can help reverse that trend, helping
    American businesses win the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

   
**Paid Family and Medical Leave**  
  
The United States is one of the only countries in the world that does
not guarantee paid leave of any kind — [95 percent of the lowest wage
workers](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=246c57ee5f&e=60572324a0),
who tend to be who [predominantly
women ](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=e34f2eb79f&e=60572324a0)and [workers
of
color](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=bc27ade0b6&e=60572324a0),
lack any access to paid  leave. But, comprehensive paid family and
medical leave is good for business. 

-   **Comprehensive paid family and medical leave policies are
    associated with higher profits for businesses.** The adoption of a
    paid leave program is associated with a [4.6 percent
    increase](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=3db3365ffb&e=60572324a0)
    in revenue per full-time employee and 6.8 percent increase in profit
    per full-time employee. State programs across the country have
    demonstrated that paid leave can increase recruitment, retention,
    productivity and morale. For example, in California, most employers
    surveyed found that adoption of the paid leave program was
    associated with either positive or neutral impacts on [profitability
    and
    performance](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=902d7b2b28&e=60572324a0),
    and some employers surveyed reported cost savings.
-   **National paid family and medical leave levels the playing field
    for small businesses.** Less than one-third of small businesses with
    100 or more employees offer paid  leave, and that number drops to 14
    percent for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Small
    businesses may lack the capital and the scale to provide paid leave,
    even when owners want to provide that benefit. While some small
    businesses may have the resources to offer paid leave to certain
    employees or on an ad hoc basis, the need for such leave is often
    unpredictable, and small businesses may not be able to offer leave
    consistently, equitably, or when it would be most beneficial to both
    the business and employees. [Small businesses
    support](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=2b973a99c4&e=60572324a0)
    paid leave programs which help reduce business costs and level the
    playing field with larger employers, while also allowing
    small-business owners themselves the ability to take paid leave and
    care for their own families too.
-   **Businesses say paid family and medical leave would improve their
    resiliency.** [More than 75 percent of businesses
    agree](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=0a4075cd38&e=60572324a0)
    that a national paid leave policy would help them be better
    positioned to weather future public health emergencies and economic
    crises. 

   
**Long-term Care**  
  
[Fifty-three million
adults](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=43dc082853&e=60572324a0)
are unpaid caregivers for an adult or child with disabilities. Over 60
percent of those caregivers work and, of those, 61 percent reported an
impact on their work. 

-   **Investments in long-term care can increase workforce stability and
    boost workforce participation**. According to a [2019 Bank of
    America
    survey](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=b32f91e1d0&e=60572324a0),
    working caregivers report missing an average of 12 hours per month
    of work because of their caregiving responsibilities. And, [10
    percent](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=5b5ce74eab&e=60572324a0)
    left work entirely.
-   **Long-term care investments will be especially critical in the
    coming years.** The demand for home- and community-based long-term
    care will increase significantly with the aging of the population –
    [by
    2060](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=56a2e55103&e=60572324a0),
    there will be nearly 95 million adults over the age of 65, almost
    twice the number of adults over the age of 65 in 2016. Despite the
    growing demand for long-term care, there aren’t enough paid
    caregivers to provide these critical services. An analysis conducted
    in
    [2017](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=2c3d7e4a31&e=60572324a0)
    estimates that there will be a national shortage of 151,000 direct
    care workers by 2030 and 355,000 workers by 2040.
-   **Improving the quality of caregiving jobs is necessary to address
    the existing – and looming – workforce shortage issue**. Paid
    caregivers – who are disproportionally women of color – have been
    [underpaid and
    undervalued](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=3398fc8917&e=60572324a0)
    for far too long. Wages for essential home care workers are
    approximately [$13 per
    hour](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=15d2947f55&e=60572324a0),
    putting them among the lowest paid workers in our economy. In fact,
    [one in
    six](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=3550c293b1&e=60572324a0)
    workers in this sector live in poverty. Improving caregiver wages is
    critical to bolstering our caregiving workforce, so they can enable
    more Americans to re-enter the workforce, pickup more hours, or face
    fewer care disruptions.

  
**The President’s Plan Will Invest in Care so Businesses Can Compete**  
  
President Biden’s plan:

-   **Cuts costs of child care by more than half for most American
    families – and enables them to access more convenient, higher
    quality care where workers receive a better wage and benefits.** The
    President’s plan fully covers the cost of high-quality child care
    for young children for the most hard-pressed working families, and
    ensures that families earning up to 1.5 times their state’s median
    income will pay no more than seven percent of their income for
    high-quality child care for all children under age five.
-   **Supports employers to build on-site child care facilities.** The
    President is calling for an expanded tax credit to encourage
    businesses to build child care facilities at places of work.
    Employers will receive 50 percent of the first $1 million of
    construction costs per facility so that employees can enjoy the
    peace of mind and convenience that comes with on-site child care. 
-   **Creates a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave
    program** that will provide a total of 12 weeks of leave per year
    for parental, family care, and personal illness/safe time by year 10
    of the program, as well as three days of bereavement leave per year
    so that workers aren’t forced to choose between their jobs and their
    caregiving responsibilities.
-   **Expand access to quality, affordable home- or community-based
    care**, while improving quality of care by boosting wages of
    caregivers**.**
-   **Provides low- and middle-income families a tax cut based on care
    expenses.** Families can receive a tax credit up to half of their
    expenses related to caring for a child or a loved one with
    disabilities. This would make permanent the dramatic expansion of
    the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) enacted in the
    American Rescue Plan. With this expanded credit, families earning
    $125,000 can receive up to a total of $4,000 for one dependent or
    $8,000 for two or more. And, families earning up to $400,000 get at
    least as generous of a credit as they receive today.
