title: "FACT SHEET: Biden Administration Takes Additional Steps to Prevent Evictions\
  \ as the Delivery of Emergency Rental Assistance Continues to\_Increase"
---
 
Today, the Biden Administration is announcing new actions to help
protect vulnerable tenants and landlords, including steps the [Treasury
Department](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0333) is
taking to strengthen existing guidance and implement new policies to
ensure that state and local grantees can further accelerate Emergency
Rental Assistance (ERA) to aid the struggling landlords and renters most
at risk of eviction.

For months, the Administration has worked to speed up state and local
grantees’ delivery of ERA and help keep American families stably housed.
As the President has made clear, no state or locality should delay
distributing resources that have been provided by Congress to meet
families’ critical needs and prevent the tragedy of unnecessary
eviction.  
  
Most notably, today Treasury is providing even more explicit permission
for grantees to utilize self-attestation without further documentation
in order to speed the delivery of assistance to households in need
during the public health emergency. In addition to the enhancements of
the Emergency Rental Assistance program, the Administration continues to
take an all of government approach to protect families at-risk of
eviction. Today, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Health and
Human Services (HHS), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Veterans
Affairs (VA) are taking additional action to protect and support
vulnerable renter households.  
  
Additionally, the Treasury Department is releasing new data on ERA
spending in July. Last month, 341,000 households received rental and
utilities assistance, up from 293,000 in June and 157,000 in May. State
and local agencies have provided approximately one million assistance
payments to benefit households at-risk of eviction, and have spent more
than $5.1 billion in ERA funding. Treasury data also show that ERA is
reaching the lowest income tenants – over 60 percent of the households
served earn no more than 30 percent of area median income.    
  
**Treasury Announces New Guidance to Encourage States and Localities to
Expedite Relief, Including Through Efficient Self-Attestation**  
  
The Biden Administration continues to work with and listen to rental
assistance administrators, tenant advocates, landlords, and other
stakeholders to prevent evictions and provide the clearest possible
guidance to state and local programs to improve the speed and
effectiveness with which they deliver assistance to tenants, landlords,
and utility providers.  
  
Today, Treasury is further clarifying existing policies and taking the
following new steps to ensure that state and local grantees can further
accelerate emergency rental assistance to families at-risk of eviction.

-   **Self-attestation can be used in documenting each aspect of a
    household’s eligibility for ERA, including with respect to: a)
    financial hardship, b) the risk of homelessness or housing
    instability, and c) income.** The use of self-attestation for
    documenting household eligibility clearly speeds up the processing
    of applications for rental assistance.  Treasury is providing even
    greater clarity and specificity with regard to the use of
    self-attestation and is encouraging grantees to simplify application
    processes to use self-attestation when other forms of documentation
    are not immediately available.
-   **During the public health emergency, state and local ERA programs
    may rely on self-attestation alone to document household income
    eligibility when documentation is not available.** During the period
    of the public health emergency, in order to rapidly provide
    assistance, Treasury is clarifying that grantees may rely solely on
    a self-attestation of income when applicants are unable to provide
    other documentation of their income.
-   **State and local grantees may provide an advance on expected
    assistance to landlords and utility providers.** To speed
    assistance, Treasury is establishing guidelines for providing a
    portion of estimated bulk payments to landlords and utility
    providers in anticipation of the full satisfaction of application
    and documentation requirements. These changes balance the need to
    assist households served by larger landlords and utilities while
    also protecting taxpayers.
-   **State and local grantees may enter into partnership with
    nonprofits to deliver advance assistance to households at risk of
    eviction while their applications are still being processed.** Where
    an expedited payment could reasonably be viewed as necessary to
    prevent an eviction that may occur under a grantee’s standard
    application process, Treasury is establishing guidelines for state
    and local programs to engage with non-profit organizations able and
    willing to take on the financial risk of advancing assistance prior
    to an application being fully processed to speed aid to at-risk
    households.
-   **Grantees may make additional payments to landlords who take on
    tenants who face major barriers to securing a lease, including those
    who have been evicted or experienced homelessness in the past
    year.** State and local ERA programs may make an additional rental
    payment required as a condition for entering into a lease with a
    “hard-to-house” household that would not otherwise qualify under a
    pre-existing and lawful screening or occupancy policy.
-   **Past arrears at previous addresses may be covered.** To remove
    barriers a household may face in accessing new housing if they have
    outstanding debt in collections, Treasury guidance makes clear that
    state and local grantees may—at an eligible tenant’s request—provide
    assistance to cover remaining rental or utility arrears at a
    previous address.
-   **A tenant’s costs associated with obtaining a hearing or appealing
    an order of eviction may be covered with ERA funds as an eligible
    “other expense.”**  Many states and localities require tenant
    payments of rent to a court on behalf of the landlord (often
    referred to as “rent bonds”) as a condition for a tenant to have the
    opportunity to defend herself in court before being evicted. New
    guidance makes clear that rent bonds are an eligible ERA expense.

These policies are meant to accelerate assistance to the thousands of
applicants who are in the pipeline in many state and local programs, on
top of those who have already received aid through the end of July.
Treasury and the Department of Justice are also working to encourage
states and localities to put in place additional protections against
evictions, including for tenants whose applications are awaiting
review.  
  
This new guidance builds on the work Treasury has  already done to make
clear through past guidance on [May
7](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/FACT_SHEET-Emergency-Rental-Assistance-Program_May2021.pdf)
and [June
24](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initiatives-to-promote-housing-stability-by-supporting-vulnerable-tenants-and-preventing-foreclosures/)
and via presentations by Treasury and White House officials that
grantees have significant flexibility to award ERA funds quickly by
using simplified forms and allowing for self-attestation. This previous
guidance has helped to unlock faster, more streamlined assistance,
including, for example, cutting wait times before assistance must be
offered to tenants with non-responsive landlords and allowing aid to
flow directly to tenants at the point of application; outlining
approaches for helping families who are currently unhoused or
transitioning to new living situations; establishing options for bulk
payments to landlords or utility providers servicing large numbers of
eligible tenants; and offering the use of self-attestation and
fact-based proxies to reduce burdens in supporting determinations of
eligibility. Building on promising practices like those previously
[highlighted](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/emergency-rental-assistance-program/promising-practices)
by Treasury, many grantees have made significant strides in successfully
getting assistance to families most in need.  
  
**Continuing an All-of-Government Approach to Prevent Evictions  
**  
The Biden Administration continues to take actions to accelerate aid to
renters and landlords, and ensure available support quickly reaches
families in need.  In addition to today’s announced enhancements of the
Emergency Rental Assistance program, Departments across the
Administration are taking further action to protect families at-risk of
eviction, including:

-   **Preventing evictions for non-payment in USDA multifamily
    properties.** The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will
    collaborate with the owners of 400,000 rental units in USDA-backed
    multifamily properties to mitigate all pending evictions.
    Additionally, USDA is:
    -   Offering additional support to property owners waiting to access
        available ERA resources by allowing them access to reserves for
        operating shortfalls;
    -   Providing financial incentives to property management agents
        that tap ERA to clear arrearages;
    -   Continuing to leverage field staff to perform outreach to local
        leaders and public housing authorities.  
-   **Ensuring tenants in public housing and properties with
    project-based rental assistance facing eviction for non-payment of
    rent have a fair chance to receive emergency rent relief.** HUD will
    act to require public housing authorities and owners participating
    in HUD’s project-based rental assistance program to provide tenants
    facing eviction for non-payment of rent with additional time and
    other protections to allow them the opportunity to secure ERA help
    that may stave off eviction entirely. For the duration of the
    presidentially-declared national emergency related to the COVID-19
    pandemic, HUD will extend the time its programmatic regulations
    require before a tenant is required to vacate a unit once a notice
    of eviction for non-payment has been issued from 14 days to 30 days,
    consistent with CARES Act protections. Additionally, in order to
    initiate eviction, HUD may require additional steps of covered
    landlords.
-   **Increasing rental support to at-risk veterans and their
    families. **The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) will expand its
    Supportive Services to Veteran Families (SSVF) program, which
    provides supplemental rental assistance to very low-income Veteran
    households, from 7 states and the District of Columbia, to all 50
    states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the District of
    Columbia.
-   **Continuing to spread awareness of available assistance through
    federal programs. **Following up from the [July 28<sup>th</sup> call
    to
    action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-companies-non-profits-government-agencies-answer-biden-harris-call-make-combined-commitment-to-alert-tens-of-millions-of-americans-to-emergency-rental-assistance/)
    on ERA that reached tens of millions of households, government
    agencies continue to leverage their networks to spread the word
    about rental assistance. For example, HHS has distributed letters to
    health centers, grantees, and networks through its Bureau of Primary
    Health Care, Administration of Children and Families, and
    Administration for Community Living. In the coming weeks, HHS will
    send an additional letter to child welfare leaders to facilitate
    participation in ERA and will remind Medicare Advantage plans that
    rental support is a permissible benefit for certain enrollees.  
      
    Today’s announcements build on the all-of-government approach taken
    by the Biden Administration to help keep families in their homes. In
    addition to previous policy announcements on May 7 and June
    24<sup>th</sup>, this work includes White House-led summits in
    [June](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/30/readout-of-the-white-house-eviction-prevention-summit/)
    and
    [July](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/21/readout-of-the-second-white-house-eviction-prevention-convening/)
    focused on encouraging local action and collaboration to prevent
    evictions and a [July

    call to action that resulted in commitments from companies,
    non-profits, and government agencies to help alert families to the
    availability of emergency rental assistance. On August 11, Attorney
    General Merrick Garland met with over 35 chief justices of state
    supreme courts to emphasize eviction diversion strategies and
    highlight the Associate Attorney General’s June
    [letter](https://www.justice.gov/asg/page/file/1405886/download)
    outlining steps that state courts could take to raise awareness of
    emergency rental assistance and to implement eviction diversion
    strategies in their jurisdictions. On August 17, Administration
    officials from the White House, and Departments of Labor, Treasury,
    Justice, and Health and Human Services, plus the Centers for Disease
    Prevention and Control,
    [met](https://www.usmayors.org/2021/08/17/readout-u-s-conference-of-mayors-meets-with-labor-secretary-walsh-cdc-director-walensky-biden-administration-officials-to-discuss-eviction-prevention/)
    with the U.S. Conference of Mayors to discuss eviction diversion
    strategies and best practices for the swift delivery of emergency
    rental assistance funds.
