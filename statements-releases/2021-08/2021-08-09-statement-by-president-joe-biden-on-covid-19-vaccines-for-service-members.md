title: "Statement by President Joe Biden on COVID- \u2060 19 Vaccines for Service\
  \ Members"

I strongly support Secretary Austin’s message to the Force today on the
Department of Defense’s plan to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of
required vaccinations for our service members not later than
mid-September. Secretary Austin and I share an unshakable commitment to
making sure our troops have every tool they need to do their jobs as
safely as possible. These vaccines will save lives. Period. They are
safe. They are effective. Over 350 million shots have been given in the
United States alone. Being vaccinated will enable our service members to
stay healthy, to better protect their families, and to ensure that our
force is ready to operate anywhere in the world. We cannot let up in the
fight against COVID-19, especially with the Delta variant spreading
rapidly through unvaccinated populations. We are still on a wartime
footing, and every American who is eligible should take immediate steps
to get vaccinated right away. I am proud that our military women and men
will continue to help lead the charge in the fight against this
pandemic, as they so often do, by setting the example of keeping their
fellow Americans safe.
