President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy talked
today about the latest developments in Afghanistan. They discussed the
importance of continued close coordination between their military and
civilian personnel in Kabul, who are working together tirelessly to
safely evacuate their citizens, Afghans who courageously supported us
and NATO in the war effort, and other vulnerable Afghan nationals. They
welcomed the opportunity for the G7 to plan a common approach to
Afghanistan policy at next week’s virtual leaders’ meeting.
