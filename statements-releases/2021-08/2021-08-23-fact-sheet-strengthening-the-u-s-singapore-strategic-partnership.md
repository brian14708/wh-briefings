---
 
The United States and Singapore are enduring strategic partners, and we
share a strong tradition of working together to promote peace,
stability, and prosperity in Southeast Asia and beyond. Over the past 55
years of diplomatic relations, our two countries have developed deep
economic, cultural, and security ties. Thousands of U.S. companies
maintain a presence in Singapore, supporting 215,000 American jobs.
Approximately 4,000 Singaporean students study in U.S. universities each
year, while 41 U.S. universities maintain partnerships with Singaporean
counterparts, supporting 110 exchange programs. Singapore provides
critical access for U.S. military units deployed to the region, hosting
nearly 1,000 service members, civilians, and dependents which support
port visits and sorties transiting the country’s military airfields –
while Singapore has the second largest military presence in the United
States of any foreign partner, with 1,000 Singapore military personnel
and dependents stationed across the country.

The Vice President’s travel to Singapore reaffirmed the excellent
U.S.-Singapore partnership and broke new ground on a range of key
issues, including: addressing climate change and cyber threats,
promoting inclusive growth and innovation, promoting growth, innovation,
and resilient supply chains, fighting COVID-19 and preparing for the
next pandemic, facing common security challenges, and deepening
people-to-people ties.
