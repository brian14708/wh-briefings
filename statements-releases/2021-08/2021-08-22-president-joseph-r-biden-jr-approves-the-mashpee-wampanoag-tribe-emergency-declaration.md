Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that an emergency exists
for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement the Tribe’s response efforts due to the emergency conditions
resulting from Tropical Storm Henri beginning on August 20, 2021, and
continuing.  
   
The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to
protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe.  
   
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures, limited to
direct federal assistance and reimbursement for mass care including
evacuation and shelter support will be provided at 75 percent Federal
funding.   
   
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named James R. McPherson as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.
