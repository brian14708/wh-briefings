*New Report from the Council of Economic Advisers and Office of
Management and Budget*

Over the last three decades, American families have experienced a rise
in the costs of many necessities that has made it difficult for them to
attain economic security. While prices of some services and goods have
fallen substantially over this period, especially when bearing in mind
increases in their quality, several others—particularly health care,
prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially,
and in many cases, faster than incomes. Rising income inequality and the
fact that low- and middle-income-families spend a higher share of their
budgets on necessities mean that low- and middle-income families are
more exposed to these cost increases.

Through the Build Back Better economic agenda, the Biden Administration
has proposed critical investments to address these long-standing cost
pressures. Families with young children will benefit most from the
proposed expansion of the Child Tax Credit, universal preschool, and
improvements in the quality of childcare and a reduction in associated
out-of-pocket costs. Proposals to lower prescription drug cost through
Medicare-negotiated prices, add dental and vision benefits to Medicare,
and expand access to home- and community-based care through Medicaid
will especially benefit households with elderly members. Combined, these
policy proposals, and others put forward by the President, will help
ensure that families can meet costs and share in a broad prosperity.
