  \ with G7\_Leaders"

During a meeting this morning with the G7 leaders, the President
conveyed that our mission in Kabul will end based on the achievement of
our objectives. He confirmed we are currently on pace to finish by
August 31<sup>st </sup>and provided an update on progress in evacuating
Americans who want to come home, third-country nationals, and Afghans
who were our allies during the war.  
  
He also made clear that with each day of operations on the ground, we
have added risk to our troops with increasing threats from ISIS-K, and
that completion of the mission by August 31<sup>st</sup> depends on
continued coordination with the Taliban, including continued access for
evacuees to the airport. In addition, the President has asked the
Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans to adjust the
timeline should that become necessary.
