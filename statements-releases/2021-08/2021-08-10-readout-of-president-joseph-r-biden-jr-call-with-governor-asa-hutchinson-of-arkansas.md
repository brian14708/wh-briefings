Yesterday, President Biden spoke with Governor Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas to discuss the increasing COVID-19 case rates in the State and
what more the federal government can do to offer support. Last month,
the Administration announced COVID-19 Surge Response resources,
including increased testing, treatment and vaccination support, and the
Surge Response teams are working hand in hand with state officials to
help get the virus under control. The President commended Governor
Hutchinson on his efforts to get more Arkansans vaccinated, including
through his Community COVID Conversations, and noted the increasing rate
of vaccinations in Arkansas. Governor Hutchinson thanked the President
for his support and the two leaders committed to continue to work
together to protect the health and well-being of all Arkansans.
