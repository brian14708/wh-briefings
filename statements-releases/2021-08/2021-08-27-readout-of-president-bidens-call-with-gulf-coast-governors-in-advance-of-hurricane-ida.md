title: "Readout of President Biden\u2019s Call with Gulf Coast Governors in Advance\
  \ of Hurricane Ida"
---
 
This afternoon, President Biden convened a call with the Governors of
Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell,
Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, and Director of
Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Rodriguez to discuss ongoing
preparations for Hurricane Ida, which is projected to strengthen to a
Category 4 Hurricane. Ida is expected to make landfall on the Gulf Coast
as a dangerous Major Hurricane on Sunday, the 16th anniversary of
Hurricane Katrina’s landfall on the Gulf Coast. Earlier this afternoon,
the President approved an Emergency Declaration for the State of
Louisiana.

The President and the Governors talked about the potential impacts of
Ida, and the concerns about life-threatening storm surge, heavy
rainfall, and hurricane-force winds. They discussed the actions the
States are taking to pre-position resources and initiate evacuation
operations, including moving nursing home residents out of harm’s
way. Governor Edwards spoke of his commitment to prevent the spread of
COVID-19 in shelters through the use of masks, rapid testing, and social
distancing. The President emphasized the importance of getting
vaccinated. They discussed the need for residents in the storm’s path to
prepare <span style="text-decoration: underline">now</span> for
significant impacts given the intensity of the storm and the expected
rainfall and storm surge, including by visiting Ready.gov and listening
to local officials’ guidance.

FEMA is pre-positioning food, water, generators, and other resources in
the region. It has more than 2,000 personnel in the affected region and
has activated another 500 to provide response support. Urban Search and
Rescue teams and additional ambulances are deploying to the region, and
the U.S. Coast Guard is prepositioning aircraft and vessels for deep
water search and rescue efforts. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has
deployed a Power Restoration Team to Alexandria, Louisiana in
anticipation of widespread power outages. The President described the
mutual assistance that is being provided by numerous electric utilities
from outside the storm’s path, which involves the staging of more than
11,000 line and tree crews and other equipment to support the
restoration of power.

On the call, the President made clear that impacted communities will
have the full support of the Federal government to augment state and
local emergency response efforts.

The President and his team were joined on the call by:

-   Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards
-   Alabama Governor Kay Ivey
-   Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves
