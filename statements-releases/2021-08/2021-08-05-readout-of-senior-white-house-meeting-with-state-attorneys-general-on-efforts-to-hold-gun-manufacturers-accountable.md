title: "Readout of Senior White\_House Meeting with State Attorneys General on Efforts\
  \ to Hold Gun Manufacturers\_Accountable"

Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, White House Counsel Dana
Remus, and Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie
Rodriguez hosted a virtual convening with attorneys general from seven
states and the District of Columbia to discuss policies and strategies
for holding gun manufacturers and dealers accountable for wrongful
conduct that contributes to the supply of firearms used to commit gun
crimes. This convening is the first of two meetings with state and local
officials that were announced in President Biden’s [comprehensive
plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/)
to reduce gun crimes, including by supporting local law enforcement,
investing in proven community violence interruption efforts, and
stemming the flow of guns used to commit crimes.

President Biden has repeatedly and forcefully called for Congress to
repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). This law
gives gun dealers and manufacturers special immunity from certain
liability for their products, hindering the public’s ability to address
the epidemic of gun violence through the use of civil litigation in the
same way they have been able to with the tobacco and opioid industries.
As the President said in the Rose Garden this past April, “Imagine how
different it would be had the same exemption been available to tobacco
companies who knew and lied about the danger they were causing.” During
today’s discussion, attorneys general shared how PLCAA has served as a
significant barrier to holding gun manufacturers and dealers accountable
for unlawful conduct that led to shootings, homicides, and other gun
crimes, and how repeal of PLCAA would enhance their ability to advance
the public safety of Americans.

As directed in the President’s gun crime reduction strategy,
participants in the convening also discussed how we can hold gun
manufacturers and dealers accountable for unlawful conduct while PLCAA
is still the law of the land. Attorneys general discussed the
opportunity and barriers to using generally applicable state consumer
protection and nuisance laws to take action against gun manufacturers
and gun dealers under PLCAA’s predicate exception. They also discussed
how state legislators could enact firearm-specific liability laws, like
New York State’s new law, to potentially create new predicates allowing
litigation to proceed under PLCAA.
