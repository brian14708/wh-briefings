Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, joined by Acting
Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Joey Hood,
traveled to Tunis and met today with President Kais Saied of Tunisia.
During the visit, he delivered a message from President Biden
reaffirming his personal support, and that of the Biden-Harris
Administration, for the Tunisian people and urging a swift return to the
path of Tunisia’s parliamentary democracy. Principal Deputy National
Security Advisor Finer discussed with President Saied the urgent need to
appoint a prime minister designate who would form a capable government
able to address the immediate economic and health crises facing Tunisia.
Empowering a new government to stabilize the economy will also create
space for an inclusive dialogue about proposed constitutional and
electoral reforms in response to the widely expressed demands of many
Tunisians for improved living standards as well as honest, effective,
and transparent governance. Principal Deputy National Security Advisor
Finer also met with civil society leaders and conveyed U.S. support for
civil society’s active participation in building a democratic and
prosperous future for all Tunisians.
