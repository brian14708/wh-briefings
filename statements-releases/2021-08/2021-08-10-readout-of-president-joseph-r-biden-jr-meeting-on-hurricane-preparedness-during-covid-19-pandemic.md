title: "Readout of President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Meeting on Hurricane Preparedness\
  \ During COVID-\u206019\_Pandemic"
---
 
Today, President Biden met with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell,
Chief Medical Advisor and NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, Homeland
Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, and COVID-19 Response Coordinator
and Counselor to the President Jeff Zients, as well as members of his
Homeland Security and COVID-19 Response teams, for a briefing on the
state of the COVID-19 pandemic in hurricane-prone states in the South
and Southeast.  They discussed efforts underway to protect public
health, enhance preparedness, and adapt response and recovery operations
to meet the challenges of the combined effects of hurricanes and the
spread of the Delta variant. 

The President was briefed on the data that demonstrates that the most
important preparatory step people can take to prepare for peak hurricane
season is to get vaccinated to ensure they will be protected from
COVID-19 if they have to evacuate their homes. They also discussed how
FEMA is innovating during the pandemic by working with partner
organizations to enable COVID-safe sheltering, providing vaccination
options at shelters and recovery centers, and protecting its workforce
so they maintain mission readiness.
