title: "Readout of the President and Vice President\u2019s Meeting with Asian American,\
  \ Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Leaders"
---
 
Today, the President and Vice President met with 13 Asian American,
Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA & NHPI) leaders representing
the rich diversity of the AA & NHPI communities to discuss a wide range
of issues, including the Administration’s Build Back Better Agenda. The
conversation focused on the importance of combating the rise in
anti-Asian hate crimes, economic opportunity, commitment to equity,
protecting the sacred right to vote, and immigration reform. During the
meeting, the President and Vice President reiterated their promise to
work together to ensure the needs of the diaspora of the AA & NHPI
communities are heard, uplifted and met. The meeting also commemorated
nine years since the horrific 2019 Sikh Temple mass shooting in Oak
Creek, Wisconsin. The President and Vice President restated their
support for a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, farm workers, TPS
holders, and essential workers through reconciliation, pledging to work
with the AA & NHPI community on immigration reform. The President and
Vice President acknowledged the AA & NHPI community record turnout in
civic engagement and vowed to continue working to strengthen our
democracy and the protection of voting rights.
