title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with House Leadership and Committee\
  \ Chairs on Build Back Better\_Agenda"
---
 
This afternoon, the President held a virtual meeting with House
Democratic leadership and the chairs of 15 House committees of
jurisdiction about moving forward with his Build Back Better agenda,
which would cut prescription drug costs, reduce the cost of housing and
education, strengthen care for veterans, take on climate change, and
help families afford childcare and care for older Americans.  
   
The President and House leaders agreed that the American people cannot
afford to wait for the generational benefits these initiatives would
deliver in terms of creating jobs, growing our economy in a manner that
overwhelmingly benefits the middle class, and cutting costs for
families. They agreed that we can pay for these long term investments by
finally letting Medicare negotiate lower prescription drug costs and
asking the largest corporations and wealthiest Americans to pay their
fair share.   
   
The President noted that these policies go to the heart of the values
that he ran on, conveyed his appreciation for the strong backing it has
received, and reiterated his enthusiasm for signing the Build Back
Better bill and the historic bipartisan infrastructure legislation as
soon as possible.
