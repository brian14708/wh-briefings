  \ Advancement\_Act"

Congressman John Lewis was an American hero who dedicated his life to
fighting for our nationâ€™s highest ideals. Today, the House of
Representatives honored Congressman Lewis by passing his namesake
legislation, which restores and expands the historic Voting Rights Act.
This important step represents progress, but there is more work to do.
The Senate must pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act so
it can become the law of the land and protect voters across the country.
