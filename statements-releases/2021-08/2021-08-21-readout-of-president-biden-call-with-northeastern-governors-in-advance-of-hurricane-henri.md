title: "Readout of President\_Biden Call with Northeastern Governors in Advance of\
  \ Hurricane\_Henri"
---
 
This afternoon, President Biden convened a call with Northeastern
Governors, FEMA Administrator Criswell, and Homeland Security Advisor
Liz Sherwood-Randall to discuss Hurricane Henri’s anticipated landfall
on Long Island or Southern New England on Sunday.

They discussed how Governors are working closely with FEMA and the
National Guard to prepare for and be ready to respond to the storm’s
impacts, which could include widespread power outages, coastal storm
surge, and inland flooding.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell discussed the resources and supplies
that FEMA is pre-positioning in the region, including over 700 response
personnel, meals, tarps, and generators. They also discussed what the
utility companies are doing to prepare for the potential for widespread
power outages, including by moving additional line and tree crews and
other equipment from outside the affected region where assistance can be
surged from if needed.

They discussed how important it is for residents in the storm’s path to
prepare now for significant impacts, including by visiting Ready.gov,
since this is the first Hurricane to make landfall in the Northeast in
30 years.  Additionally, the President and other participants discussed
the need to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through the use of vaccines,
masks, and social distancing if sheltering is required. On the call, the
President made clear that states have the full support of the Federal
government to aid local emergency response efforts.

The President and his team were joined on the call by:

-   Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont
-   Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker
-   Maine Gov. Janet Mills
-   New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy
-   New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo
-   New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul
-   Rhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee
