title: Statement by President Joe Biden Extending the Pause on Student Loan Repayment
---
 
On my first day in office in January, I directed the Department of
Education to pause federal student loan repayments for millions of
Americans through September. The pause has been a critical lifeline so
they don’t have to choose between paying for basic necessities or their
student loan during the pandemic that upended their lives.

As today’s jobs numbers show, we have the tools that will allow us to
beat COVID-19 and keep our economy recovering at a record rate. But we
know there is more work to do and the road will still be long for many
people – especially for the one in six adults and one in three young
people who have federal student loans.

That’s why today, my administration is extending the pause on federal
student loan repayments one final time until January 31, 2022. This will
give the Department of Education and borrowers more time and more
certainty as they prepare to restart student loan payments. It will also
ensure a smoother transition that minimizes loan defaults and
delinquencies that hurt families and undermine our economic recovery.
