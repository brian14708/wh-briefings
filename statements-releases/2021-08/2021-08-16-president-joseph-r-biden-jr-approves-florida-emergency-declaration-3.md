The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,

relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to

Dixie, Escambia, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson,
Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Manatee, Okaloosa, Santa
Rosa, Taylor, Wakulla, Walton, and Washington.  
  
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures, limited to
direct federal assistance and reimbursement for mass care including
evacuation and shelter support will be provided at 75 percent Federal
funding.   
  
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Kevin A. Wallace as the
