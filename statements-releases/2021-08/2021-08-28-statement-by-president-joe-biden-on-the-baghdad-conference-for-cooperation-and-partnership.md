title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Baghdad Conference for Cooperation
  and Partnership
---
 
I congratulate the Government of Iraq on hosting a successful and
ground-breaking regional summit today. This kind of diplomacy has never
been more important as we seek to ease tensions among neighboring states
and expand cooperation across the Middle East, and Iraq’s leadership on
this is historic. I also thank President Macron for his engagement and
support for this summit.

The United States continues to stand with our partner Iraq as we work
together toward greater stability across the Middle East. We remain
committed to strengthening our bilateral relationship under the
Strategic Framework Agreement.

When Prime Minister Al-Kadhimi and I met in the Oval Office last month,
we discussed Iraq’s important role in the region and the significant
efforts led by the Government of Iraq, including the Kurdistan Regional
Government, to improve and strengthen the ties between Iraq and its
neighbors.

Diplomacy must be the first tool of our foreign policy, and we are
grateful to have partners who share that vision.
