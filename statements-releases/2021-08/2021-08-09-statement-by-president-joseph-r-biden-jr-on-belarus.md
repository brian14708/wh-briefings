title: Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on Belarus
---
 
One year ago today, the people of Belarus sought to make their voices
heard and shape their own future through that most basic expression of
democracyâ€”an election. Rather than respect the clear will of the
Belarusian people, the Lukashenka regime perpetrated election fraud,
followed by a brutal campaign of repression to stifle dissent. From
detaining thousands of peaceful protesters, to imprisoning more than 500
activists, civil society leaders, and journalists as political
prisoners, to forcing the diversion of an international flight in an
affront to global norms, the actions of the Lukashenka regime are an
illegitimate effort to hold on to power at any price. It is the
responsibility of all those who care about human rights, free and fair
elections, and freedom of expression to stand against this oppression.
The United States will continue to stand up for human rights and free
expression, while holding the Lukashenka regime accountable, in concert
with our allies and partners. Toward that end, today, we are issuing a
new Executive Order that enhances our ability to impose costs on the
regime and announcing new sanctions against Belarusian individuals and
entities for their role in attacks on democracy and human rights,
transnational repression, and corruption. As I told the leader of the
Belarusian opposition, Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, we stand with the
people of Belarus as they bravely pursue their democratic aspirations.
