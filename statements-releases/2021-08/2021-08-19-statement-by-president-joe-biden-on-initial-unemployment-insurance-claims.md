title: Statement by President Joe Biden on Initial Unemployment Insurance Claims
---
 
This morning, we learned that the number of Americans filing initial
unemployment insurance claims fell to the lowest level since the
pandemic began. This reflects the important progress we are making in
our economic recovery.

When I took office in January, an average of more than 830,000 Americans
were filing initial unemployment insurance claims. That number has
fallen by more than half to below 378,000.  
   
Our economy has created more than 4 million jobs since I took office –
more jobs created at this point than any previous administration. Our
economy is also growing at the fastest rate in the first half of a year
in nearly 40 years.

This morning’s news reinforces the historic nature of our economic
recovery, due in part to the American Rescue Plan that got relief to
those who needed it most, resources to our communities to fight COVID
and vaccinations in the arms of the American people.  
  
While our economic recovery is far from complete – and while we will
have ups and downs along the way as we continue to battle the Delta
surge of COVID – the Biden plan to grow the economy from the bottom up
and middle out is working, and delivering real results for American
workers.
