title: "Readout of the Fifth National Climate Task Force\_Meeting"

*On the heels of the latest IPCC report, the National Climate Task Force
met to discuss delivering on President Biden’s entire Build Back Better
agenda in Congress and driving additional climate ambition.*

Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the fifth
National Climate Task Force meeting where she was joined by Cabinet
members and senior leadership from 17 federal agencies. The Task Force
discussed the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
report, and its “code red” warning for the global community to take
immediate action to avert the worst effects of climate change. This
report underscores the need for action and achieving the President’s
goal of taking bold action in this decisive decade on the path to
economy-wide net zero emissions. Americans are already feeling the
effects of climate change – from devastating wildfires to extreme heat
to a historic drought – and the IPCC report reminds us that we must act
swiftly and decisively to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

During the meeting, Biden Administration officials discussed passage of
the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal through the Senate, and the
Senate’s important step forward to passing the President’s full Build
Back Better agenda, which includes creating an energy efficiency clean
energy standard, expanding tax cuts for clean electricity, electric
vehicles, and clean energy manufacturing, and creating a Civilian
Climate Corps.

Additionally, agency leadership shared updates on the Administration’s
whole-of-government approach to deliver the President’s vision to build
back better:

-   **Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory** and
    **Acting OMB Director Shalanda Young** discussed the
    recently-released [Justice40 interim
    guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/07/20/the-path-to-achieving-justice40/)
    that will ensure the federal government is delivering at least 40
    percent of the overall benefits from federal investments in climate
    and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. The interim guidance
    identifies a pilot of 21 priority programs that will provide a
    blueprint for other agencies to help inform their work to implement
    the Justice40 Initiative across government.
-   **Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg** and **EPA
    Administrator Michael Regan** discussed the recent proposed rules
    issued by their agencies that would establish the most robust
    standards for fuel efficiency and emissions ever. They also
    discussed the President’s new goal that half of all vehicle sales be
    zero-emissions vehicles by 2030, and the accompanying
    standard-setting actions directed by the President, which will
    strengthen save consumers money, cut pollution, boost public health,
    advance environmental justice, and tackle the climate crisis.
-   **Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland** and **Secretary of
    Agriculture Tom Vilsack** provided an update on the devastation
    caused by the current wildfire season and the on-going severe
    drought that is afflicting communities across the West, including
    information on how each of their agencies are taking steps to invest
    in both immediate response efforts and long-term climate resilience
    to reduce the catastrophic effects of future wildfires and droughts.

As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 [Executive Order on Tackling
the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/),
