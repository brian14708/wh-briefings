title: "FACT SHEET: Biden Administration and Private Sector Leaders Announce Ambitious\
  \ Initiatives to Bolster the Nation\u2019s\_Cybersecurity"
---
 
Today, President Biden met with private sector and education leaders to
discuss the whole-of-nation effort needed to address cybersecurity
threats. Recent high-profile cybersecurity incidents demonstrate that
both U.S. public and private sector entities increasingly face
sophisticated malicious cyber activity. Cybersecurity threats and
incidents affect businesses of all sizes, small towns and cities in
every corner of the country, and the pocketbooks of middle-class
families. Compounding the challenge, nearly half a million public and
private cybersecurity jobs remain unfilled.

Cybersecurity is a national security and economic security imperative
for the Biden Administration and we are prioritizing and elevating
cybersecurity like never before. On May 12, 2021, President Biden
[issued an Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/)
that modernizes Federal Government defenses and improves the security of
technology. To secure our critical infrastructure, this spring the Biden
Administration launched a 100-day initiative to improve cybersecurity
across the electric sector with others to follow. On July 28, the
President [issued a National Security
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-further-actions-to-protect-u-s-critical-infrastructure/)
establishing voluntary cybersecurity goals that clearly outline our
expectations for owners and operators of critical infrastructure. The
Administration has also
[engaged](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Memo-What-We-Urge-You-To-Do-To-Protect-Against-The-Threat-of-Ransomware.pdf)
with the private sector on the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity
as a central part of their efforts to maintain business continuity. And
internationally, the Biden Administration has rallied G7 countries to
hold accountable nations who harbor ransomware criminals and to update
NATO cyber policy for the first time in seven years.

The purpose of today’s meeting was to discuss opportunities to bolster
the nation’s cybersecurity in partnership and individually. Several
participants announced commitments and initiatives including:

-   **The Biden Administration announced that the National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) will collaborate with industry and
    other partners to develop a new framework to improve the security
    and integrity of the technology supply chain.** The approach will
    serve as a guideline to public and private entities on how to build
    secure technology and assess the security of technology, including
    open source software. Microsoft, Google, IBM, Travelers, and
    Coalition committed to participating in this NIST-led initiative.
-   **The Biden Administration also announced the formal expansion of
    the Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative to a second
    major sector: natural gas pipelines**. The Initiative has already
    improved the cybersecurity of more than 150 electric utilities that
    serve 90 million Americans.
-   **Apple announced it will establish a new program to drive
    continuous security improvements throughout the technology supply
    chain**. As part of that program, Apple will work with its suppliers
    — including more than 9,000 in the United States— to drive the mass
    adoption of multi-factor authentication, security training,
    vulnerability remediation, event logging, and incident response.
-   **Google announced it will invest $10 billion over the next five
    years to expand zero-trust programs, help secure the software supply
    chain, and enhance open-source security.** Google also announced it
    will help 100,000 Americans earn industry-recognized digital skills
    certificates that provide the knowledge that can lead to secure
    high-paying, high-growth jobs. 
-   **IBM announced it will train 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills
    over the next three years, and will partner with more than 20
    Historically Black Colleges & Universities to establish
    Cybersecurity Leadership Centers to grow a more diverse cyber
    workforce.**
-   **Microsoft announced it will invest $20 billion over the next 5
    years to accelerate efforts to integrate cyber security by design
    and deliver advanced security solutions.** Microsoft also announced
    it will immediately make available $150 million in technical
    services to help federal, state, and local governments with
    upgrading security protection, and will expand partnerships with
    community colleges and non-profits for cybersecurity training.
-   **Amazon announced it will make available to the public at no charge
    the security awareness training it offers its employees**. Amazon
    also announced it will make available to all Amazon Web Services
    account holders at no additional cost, a multi-factor authentication
    device to protect against cybersecurity threats like phishing and
    password theft.
-   **Resilience, a cyber insurance provider, announced it will require
    policy holders to meet a threshold of cybersecurity best practice as
    a condition of receiving coverage.**
-   **Coalition, a cyber insurance provider, announced it will make its
    cybersecurity risk assessment & continuous monitoring platform
    available for free to any organization.**
-   **Code.org announced it will teach cybersecurity concepts to over 3
    million students across 35,000 classrooms over 3 years**, to teach a
    diverse population of students how to stay safe online, and to build
    interest in cybersecurity as a potential career.
-   **Girls Who Code announced it will establish a micro credentialing
    program for historically excluded groups in technology.** The
    program will make scholarships and early career opportunities more
    accessible to underrepresented groups.
-   **University of Texas System announced it will expand existing and
    develop new short-term credentials in cyber-related fields to
    strengthen America’s cybersecurity workforce**. A major part of this
    effort will be to upskill and reskill over 1 million workers across
    the nation by making available entry-level cyber educational
    programs through UT San Antonio’s Cybersecurity Manufacturing
    Innovation Institute. Credentials do not depend on traditional
    degree pathways, and should also contribute significantly to
    diversifying the pipeline. 
-   **Whatcom Community College announced it has been designated the new
    NSF Advanced Technological Education National Cybersecurity Center,
    and will provide cybersecurity education and training to faculty and
    support program development for colleges to “fast-track” students
    from college to career.** The nature of community colleges dispersed
    in every community in the nation makes them an ideal pipeline for
    increasing diversity and inclusion in the cybersecurity workforce.
