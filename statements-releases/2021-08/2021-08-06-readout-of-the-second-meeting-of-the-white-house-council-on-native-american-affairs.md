Today, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and Domestic Policy Advisor
Susan Rice convened the second meeting of the White House Council on
Native American Affairs (WHCNAA).  They were joined by eleven Cabinet
Secretaries and senior administration officials in a discussion focused
on bolstering the government-to-government relationship and advancing
self-determination and self-government of Tribal Nations.  During the
meeting, the Domestic Policy Council, White House American Rescue Plan
Implementation Team, and Department of Interior committed to lead an
interagency process to support Tribal Nations’ use of the historic
infusion of federal funding dedicated to tribal needs. The WHCNAA Health
Committee also announced it will host a Nation-to-Nation dialogue on
COVID-19 and improving health systems in Indian Country this fall. This
will be an opportunity for Tribal engagement with Administration
leadership on federal emergency management programs and resources and to
share the latest data. The Health Committee will develop a workplan
informed by this dialogue to strengthen inter-agency federal emergency
response efforts.  
  
The Council will continue to coordinate with Tribal Nations as it
advances work on key issues such as climate change, Tribal homelands and
treaties; economic development, energy and infrastructure; health;
education; public safety and justice; and international Indigenous
issues.
