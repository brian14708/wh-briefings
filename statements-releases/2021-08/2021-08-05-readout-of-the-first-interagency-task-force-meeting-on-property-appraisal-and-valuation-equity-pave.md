*Biden-Harris Administration Launches first-of-its-kind interagency
initiative to address inequity in home appraisals*

Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia
L. Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Ambassador Susan Rice convened the
first principal-level meeting for the Interagency Task Force on Property
Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE). They were joined by senior
leadership from Cabinet and independent agencies that have been invited
to participate in the Task Force.

Task Force members discussed how current appraisal practices are a
significant contributor to the disparity in housing values. The practice
of comparing properties within similar neighborhoods can be a proxy for
racial demographics, which leads to the perpetuation and exacerbation of
the legacy of segregation and redlining. The group identified near- and
long-term opportunities to advance equity in home appraisals that will
help narrow the racial wealth gap and reinvest in communities that have
been historically left behind. The Task Force Members will work together
and consult with civil rights organizations, advocacy groups, industry,
and philanthropic entities to drive change.

Additionally, Task Force members agreed that the scope of the Task Force
will be to:

1.  Ensure that government oversight and industry practice further
    valuation equity;
2.  Combat valuation bias through educating the consumer and training
    the practitioner;
3.  Ensure equity in valuation by making available high-quality data;
4.  Create a comprehensive approach to combating valuation bias through
    enforcement and other efforts.

The Task Force is chaired by Secretary Fudge and Ambassador Rice, and
includes cabinet-level leaders from executive departments and additional
members from independent agencies. The Task Force will deliver a final
action report within 180 days.

The Task Force membership is comprised of the following officials:

-   Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (co-chair)
-   Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy (co-chair)
-   Director of the National Economic Council
-   Attorney General of the United States

-   Secretary of Veterans Affairs
-   Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
-   Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve

    Financial Institutions Examination Council
