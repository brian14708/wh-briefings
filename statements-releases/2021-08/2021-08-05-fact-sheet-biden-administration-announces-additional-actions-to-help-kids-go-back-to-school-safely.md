title: "Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Announces Additional Actions to Help Kids\
  \ Go Back to School\_Safely"
---
 
Over the next six weeks, more than 50 million students will head back to
school, and more than 20 million students will return to undergraduate
and graduate studies. For young people, getting vaccinated right away is
the best way back to the things they love – like playing sports,
completing their studies, and spending time with friends and loved ones.
Today, the Biden Administration announced additional actions to get
students ages 12 and above vaccinated and to ensure all students can go
back to school safely this fall:  
  
Today, the Administration is highlighting the following efforts to get
more young people vaccinated:

-   **Incorporating COVID-19 vaccination into sports physicals for
    student athletes this summer and fall**: Today, the American Academy
    of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Medical Society for Sports
    Medicine (AMSSM), and ten other sports and medicine organizations
    are issuing a consensus statement to all their members urging all
    medical providers to ask about COVID-19 vaccine status during sports
    physicals, and where available to also administer the COVID-19
    vaccine. Both AAP and AMSSM have issued updated guidance for
    physicians incorporating COVID-19 vaccination into sports physical
    protocols, and AAP has issued revised forms for doctors, parents,
    and student athletes to use to document their pre-participation
    examination including language on COVID-19 vaccination. The AAP
    estimates that approximately 60 to 70 percent of children and
    adolescents participate in organized sports across the country. Each
    year, millions of these student athletes receive a pre-participation
    exam, also known as a sports physical, in order to participate. This
    action will help elevate the importance of getting vaccinated
    against COVID-19 as a key part of safe competitive play. The
    organizations signing onto the consensus statement are:  
-   American Academy of Pediatrics
-   American Academy of Family Physicians
-   American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
-   American College of Emergency Physicians
-   American College of Sports Medicine
-   American Medical Society for Sports Medicine
-   American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine
-   American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine
-   National Athletic Trainers’ Association
-   National Federation of State High School Associations
-   National Collegiate Athletic Association
-   U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee  
-   **Sending pediatricians to ‘Back to School Nights’ to get
    communities vaccinated against COVID-19**: The National Parent
    Teacher Association (PTA) is calling on its 22,000 local member PTAs
    and parent leaders nationwide to host community conversations about
    getting vaccinated at Back to School parent meetings this summer and
    fall. National PTA will partner with the American Academy of
    Pediatrics to deploy local pediatricians to be a part of these Back
    to School parent meetings, so parents can have their questions
    answered by doctors who know and treat their children. AAP will also
    produce digital materials on the vaccine and kids that parent
    leaders can use as they convene community conversations. Alongside
    other trusted partners like teachers and school nurses,
    pediatricians around the country have been active in showing up to
    parent meetings and other events this summer to talk about the
    vaccine and how to keep kids safe in school this fall.  
-   **Providing schools and colleges with additional resources to host
    pop-up vaccine clinics as students come back to school and back to
    campus**: In an effort to get more kids 12 and older vaccinated,
    last week President Biden called on school districts nationwide to
    host at least one pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks,
    and the Administration directed pharmacies in the federal pharmacy
    program to work with school districts and colleges across the
    country to host vaccination clinics on-site. Today, the
    Administration will release additional resources to help schools
    host pop-up vaccine clinics, including a detailed guide for hosting
    school-based clinics, template letters and text messages for
    district and school leaders to use in sending messages home to
    students and families about the vaccine, resources for teachers to
    use in discussing the vaccine with students and their parents, and
    materials parent leaders can use as part of community conversations
    on the vaccine. The Administration also released a “Vax to School”
    College Checklist, detailing eight ways that colleges and
    universities can increase awareness of and access to the vaccine as
    students come back to campus – building off of the work of the
    nearly 900 colleges in the COVID-19 College Challenge who have
    committed to building vaccination rates on their campuses this
    summer and fall. The American Rescue Plan has provided billions of
    dollars that school districts and institutions of higher education
    can use to create awareness and build vaccine confidence, host
    vaccine clinics, and provide incentives such as paid time off for
    staff to get vaccinated.  
-   **Launching the Back to School “Week of Action” with partners
    nationwide to get young people vaccinated:** Beginning August 7th
    and ending August 15th, the Health and Human Services’ We Can Do
    This campaign and Made to Save are launching a Week of Action to
    encourage vaccinations for young people and support parents and
    schools as they get kids back to safe, in-person learning.  The Week
    of Action will mobilize school districts, students, teachers,
    national organizations, local government leaders, businesses, social
    media influencers, celebrities, and thousands of volunteers to kick
    off the school year by encouraging young people to get vaccinated
    and offering accessible ways to do it in their community. More than
    90 youth-based organizations, faith-based organizations, and schools
    are committed to hosting over 200 vaccination events focused on
    school and campus-based COVID-19 vaccination drives for students,
    their families, and their communities, with hundreds more events
    taking place throughout the month of August. Events will take place
    all over the country, including canvassing, phone banks, text banks
    and more. As part of the Week of Action, Second Gentleman Douglas
    Emhoff and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will travel to Topeka,
    KS to visit a back-to-school vaccine clinic; and trainings will be
    provided for teachers, parents, and student organizations on how to
    engage young people and their families on the vaccine. To kick off
    the Back to School Week of Action, the Second Gentleman and National
    Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony
    Fauci will host a virtual discussion with youth leaders who expanded
    access to the vaccine for young people and their communities. The
    Second Gentleman and Dr. Fauci will ask the young leaders about why
    they got involved in vaccine efforts, and how they have responded to
    the needs of their peers and their communities in getting more young
    people vaccinated. The virtual event will be livestreamed on the
    White House YouTube channel.  

Today’s announcements build on the Administration’s release earlier this
week of the “Return to School Roadmap,” a resource to support students,
schools, educators, and communities as they prepare to return to safe,
healthy in-person learning this fall and emerge from the pandemic
stronger than before. The Roadmap provides key resources and supports
for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build
excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines
how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to
in-person learning. Over the course of the next several weeks as schools
reopen nationwide, the Roadmap will lay out actionable strategies to
implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) updated
guidance for K-12 schools, so that schools can minimize transmission and
sustain in-person learning all school-year long.  
  
The Roadmap includes three “Landmark” priorities that schools,
districts, and communities are encouraged to focus on to ensure all
students are set up for success in the 2021-2022 school year. These
include: (1) prioritizing the health and safety of students, staff, and
educators, (2) building school communities and supporting students’
social, emotional, and mental health, and (3) accelerating academic
achievement. As part of the Roadmap, the Department will release
resources for practitioners and parents on each of these priorities, and
will highlight schools and districts that are using innovative practices
to address these priorities. The Department will also lift up ways that
the American Rescue Plan and other federal funds can be used to address
these priorities in schools and communities across the country, as well
as outline additional investments from President Biden’s Build Back
Better agenda that are needed to ensure our schools and communities can
rebuild from the pandemic even stronger than they were before and
address inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, particularly for
students in underserved communities.
