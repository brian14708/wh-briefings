Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced in Singapore that the
United States is offering to host the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) in 2023. This demonstrates the importance the United States
places on the region and multilateral cooperation. APEC is the premier
platform for advancing regional economic policies to promote  inclusive
and sustainable growth. The United States remains committed to expanding
and deepening economic ties within APEC for the benefit of the American
people and our partners.
