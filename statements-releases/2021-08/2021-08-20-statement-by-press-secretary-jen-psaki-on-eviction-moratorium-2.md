title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on Eviction\_Moratorium"
---
 
The Administration believes that CDC’s new moratorium is a proper use of
its lawful authority to protect the public health, and we are pleased
that the circuit court joined the district court in leaving the
moratorium in place that is keeping hard-pressed Americans in their
homes in areas of substantial or high COVID-19 spread. Throughout the
pandemic, national, State and local eviction moratoria have kept people
housed and slowed the spread of COVID-19. As we continue our effort to
stop the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant, the eviction
moratorium remains vitally important.

The President continues to call on State and local governments to do
more to protect vulnerable households. In the last week, Administration
officials have continued their engagement with State and local elected
officials and judges to encourage the swift delivery of emergency rental
assistance funds and implementation of eviction diversion strategies. As
the President has said, State and local elected officials should move
more aggressively to distribute the $46.5 billion in Emergency Rental
Assistance funds provided in part through the American Rescue Plan. And,
State and local courts should issue their own moratoria and implement
policies to discourage eviction filings until landlords and tenants have
sought Emergency Rental Assistance funds. State and local funds from the
American Rescue Plan are also available and should be deployed when
needed to support these and other eviction prevention strategies.
