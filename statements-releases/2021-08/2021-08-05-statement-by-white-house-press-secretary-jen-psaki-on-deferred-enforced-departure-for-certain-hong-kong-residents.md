title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on Deferred Enforced\
  \ Departure for Certain Hong Kong\_Residents"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. signed a memorandum directing the
deferral of removal of certain Hong Kong residents who are present in
the United States, giving them a temporary safe haven. This action
demonstrates President Biden’s strong support for people in Hong Kong in
the face of ongoing repression by the People’s Republic of China (PRC),
and makes clear we will not stand idly by as the PRC breaks its promises
to Hong Kong and to the international community. Since taking office,
the Biden Administration has been clear that we, alongside our allies
and partners, strongly oppose the PRC’s wielding of the National
Security Law to deny basic rights and freedoms, assault Hong Kong’s
autonomy, and undermine its remaining democratic processes and
institutions. Given the politically motivated arrests and trials, the
silencing of the media, and the diminishing the space for elections and
democratic opposition, we will continue to take steps in support of
people in Hong Kong.
