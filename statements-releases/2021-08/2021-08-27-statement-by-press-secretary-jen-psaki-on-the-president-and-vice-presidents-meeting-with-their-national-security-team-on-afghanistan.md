  s Meeting with Their National Security Team on\_Afghanistan"
---
 
The President met this morning in the Situation Room with his national
security team, including our commanders and diplomats in the field. The
Vice President joined by secure video teleconference. They advised the
President and Vice President that another terror attack in Kabul is
likely, but that they are taking maximum force protection measures at
the Kabul Airport.

They reported that even in the face of those threats, our courageous
service women and men are continuing to operate a historic evacuation
operation. The U.S. military is airlifting out thousands of people every
few hours. They continue to prioritize evacuating the remaining American
citizens who have indicated that they wish to leave, and are engaged in
a variety of means to get them to the airport safely. The President
directed the Secretary of State to continue diplomatic efforts with
international partners to secure means for third-country nationals and
Afghans with visas to leave the country even after the U.S. military
presence ends.

Our commanders also updated the President and Vice President on plans to
develop ISIS-K targets. The next few days of this mission will be the
most dangerous period to date. The President reaffirmed with the
commanders his approval of all authorities they need to conduct the
operation and protect our troops, and all reported back that they have
the resources they believe they need to do so effectively.

The President and Vice President were joined by Secretary Blinken,
Secretary Austin, Chairman Milley, Director Haines, Director Burns,
National Security Advisor Sullivan, Ambassador Wilson, General McKenzie,
Admiral Vasely, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Finer,
Homeland Security Advisor Sherwood-Randall, and other senior officials.
