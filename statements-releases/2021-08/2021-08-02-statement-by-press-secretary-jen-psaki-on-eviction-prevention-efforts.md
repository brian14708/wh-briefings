title: Statement by Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Eviction Prevention Efforts
---
 
Today, President Biden is taking further action to prevent Americans
from experiencing the heartbreak of eviction. Thanks to State eviction
moratoria, almost 33% of the country will be spared evictions for the
rest of this month. But in the remaining States, action is needed.

Thanks to the bipartisan COVID relief act Congress passed in December
2020 and the American Rescue Plan Congress and the Biden Administration
enacted in March 2021, State and local governments long ago received
Emergency Rental Assistance—a $46.5 billion plan to protect millions of
Americans facing deep rental debt and potential eviction during the
pandemic. Some cities and States have demonstrated their ability to
release these funds efficiently to tenants and landlords in need. But
even though funds began to be distributed in February by the Biden
Administration, too many States and cities have been too slow to act.

As the Administration made clear last week, there is no excuse for any
State or locality not to promptly deploy the resources that Congress
appropriated to meet the critical need of so many Americans. This
assistance provides the funding to pay landlords current and back rent
so tenants can remain in their homes or apartments, not be evicted. No
one in America should be evicted when Federal funds are available, in
the hands of State and local government, to pay back rent due.

Last week the Administration also made clear that given the spread of
the Delta variant among those Americans most likely to face eviction and
lacking vaccinations, the President would have strongly supported a
decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to
further extend its eviction moratorium to protect renters at this moment
of heightened vulnerability. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court declared
on June 29<sup>th</sup> that the CDC could not grant such an extension
without “clear and specific congressional authorization (via new
legislation).”

Given the rising urgency of containing the spread of the Delta variant,
on Sunday, the President asked the CDC to consider once again the
possibility of executive action. He raised the prospect of a new, 30-day
eviction moratorium—focused on counties with High or Substantial case
rates—to protect renters. This temporary measure would spur States and
localities to ramp up Emergency Rental Assistance programs to full speed
this month, giving every landlord the opportunity to collect the rent
they are owed and ensuring no eligible family gets evicted.

To date, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and her team have been unable to
find legal authority for a new, targeted eviction moratorium. Our team
is redoubling efforts to identify all available legal authorities to
provide necessary protections.

In the meantime, the President will continue to do everything in his
power to help renters from eviction. The Administration has provided
States and local governments with the flexibility to get funds out
efficiently without burdensome documentation; to use funds to help those
who are homeless or in need of new housing; and to use American Rescue
Plan State and local funds to expand any effort to help those whose
housing is at risk due to the pandemic.

Today, the President is taking these additional measures:

-   Directing his White House policy, implementation, and legal teams to
    assemble all Federal agencies to reexamine whether there are any
    other authorities to take additional actions to stop evictions.
-   Calling on States and localities to extend or put in place evictions
    moratoria for at the least the next two months. Among those behind
    on their rent, 1 in 3 renters live in States that have already
    extended protections against evictions due to State eviction
    moratoria—which are not covered by the Supreme Court’s ruling. The
    rest of the States should follow course by also extending eviction
    moratoria.
-   Calling on State and local courts to heed the call of the Justice
    Department to pause eviction proceedings until tenants and landlords
    can first seek to access Emergency Rental Assistance—making
    evictions a last, not first—resort.
-   Directing his Cabinet Departments to use their powers to prevent
    evictions and tell landlords: If your government is backing your
    mortgage or providing you housing tax relief, you should not be
    choosing eviction over the Emergency Rental Assistance we have
    provided to make you whole and keep your tenants and their families
    safely housed.
-   Challenging every landlord to hold off on evictions for the next 30
    days and instead seek out the Emergency Rental Assistance Congress
    and the Administration meant for them.
-   Challenging utilities providers to work with State and local
    governments to access Emergency Rental Assistance and other
    resources made available by Congress and the Administration to avoid
    cutting off services for those behind in payments due to the
    pandemic and at risk of eviction.
-   Directing the Treasury Department to make clear that States and
    localities can use emergency housing and State and local relief to
    support eviction prevention efforts by courts, legal aid, and
    housing counselors, as well as to give incentives to landlords who
    cooperate in these efforts by offering housing to those who have
    been evicted or are homeless, or by offering leases to the most
    hard-pressed tenants at a length that ensures true housing
    stability.
-   At the request of Congressional leadership, directing the White
    House, Treasury Department, and other relevant Federal agencies to
    continue examining why State and local governments have failed to
    distribute rental assistance Congress has provided, and explore any
    authorities the Federal government has to press the States and
    localities to make these distributions.

The Administration remains deeply committed to doing everything in its
power to keep people safely and securely housed, which is essential to
the health, well-being, and dignity of us all.
