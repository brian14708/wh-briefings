Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that an emergency exists

The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,

suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,

Chenango, Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Kings, Montgomery,
Nassau, New York, Orange, Otsego, Putnam, Queens, Rensselaer, Richmond,
Rockland, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Suffolk, Sullivan, and

Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures, limited to
direct federal assistance and reimbursement for mass care including
evacuation and shelter support will be provided at 75 percent Federal
funding. 

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
