title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Need for Reliable\
  \ and Stable Global Energy\_Markets"

Higher gasoline costs, if left unchecked, risk harming the ongoing
global recovery. The price of crude oil has been higher than it was at
the end of 2019, before the onset of the pandemic.  
  
While OPEC+ recently agreed to production increases, these increases
will not fully offset previous production cuts that OPEC+ imposed during
the pandemic until well into 2022. At a critical moment in the global
recovery, this is simply not enough.   
  
President Biden has made clear that he wants Americans to have access to
affordable and reliable energy, including at the pump. Although we are
not a party to OPEC, the United States will always speak to
international partners regarding issues of significance that affect our
national economic and security affairs, in public and private. We are
engaging with relevant OPEC+ members on the importance of competitive
markets in setting prices. Competitive energy markets will ensure
reliable and stable energy supplies, and OPEC+ must do more to support
the recovery.
