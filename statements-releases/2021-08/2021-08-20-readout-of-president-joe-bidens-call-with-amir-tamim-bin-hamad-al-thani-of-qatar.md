President Joe Biden and Amir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar spoke to
reaffirm the longstanding friendship between the United States and
Qatar.  The President expressed appreciation for Qatar’s generous
support for the ongoing evacuation from Afghanistan of U.S. citizens,
diplomatic staff from the U.S. and several partner nations, and
vulnerable Afghan nationals.  The President noted that this is the
largest airlift of people in history and that it would not have been
possible without the early support from Qatar to facilitate the transfer
of thousands of people daily.  The President also thanked the Amir for
the important role Qatar has long played to facilitate intra-Afghanistan
talks.  The two leaders underscored the importance of continued close
coordination on developments in Afghanistan and the broader Middle East,
and they welcomed the upcoming summit of regional states to be held in
Baghdad towards the end of the month.
