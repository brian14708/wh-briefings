title: "FACT SHEET: Strengthening the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive\_Partnership"
---
 
Last year, the United States and Vietnam celebrated our 25th anniversary
of diplomatic relations.  Over the past several decades, the bilateral
relationship between our countries has made significant strides, to the
point where our nations now cooperate on a wide range of issues,
including fighting COVID-19 and preparing for future health security
threats, combatting climate change, and addressing shared legacies of
war.  We have deepened our economic ties as Vietnam’s second largest
trading partner and its top export market worldwide, and our support for
one another is mutually reinforcing: a vibrant Vietnamese economy is
critical to the supply chains Americans depend on, a point that COVID-19
has made clear when production shutdowns abroad have led to difficulties
in shipping goods at home. Our security relationship has dramatically
expanded as we support Vietnam’s independence and sovereignty,
particularly in the maritime domain.  The United States and Vietnam have
also advanced capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious
disease threats through our partnership on the Global Health Security
Agenda. The already-robust and growing partnership between our peoples
has resulted in nearly 30,000 Vietnamese studying in the United States,
contributing nearly $1 billion to the U.S. economy, and the opening of a
Peace Corps office in Hanoi.  
  
The Vice President’s travel to Vietnam signifies the United States’ deep
commitment not only to the region, but also to the U.S. – Vietnam
relationship.  In bilateral meetings with Vietnamese leaders, Vice
President Harris reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to a strong, prosperous,
and independent Vietnam, as well a free, open, healthy, and resilient
Indo-Pacific region.    
  
**COVID-19 and Health Security:**  The Vice President reinforced the
United States’ commitment to leading the world in ending the COVID-19
pandemic.  She announced new COVID-19 vaccine donations to Vietnam,
critical support for vaccine distribution, and the opening of a new
regional CDC office to enhance health security cooperation.

-   Vaccine donation: Recognizing the critical toll that the COVID-19
    has taken on both our countries, and the Biden-Harris
    Administration’s effort to serve as an arsenal of vaccines for the
    world, the Vice President announced that the U.S. is donating an
    additional one million doses of Pfizer vaccine to Vietnam, bringing
    our total donation to Vietnam to 6 million doses. 
-   COVID-19 technical and programmatic assistance: Through the American
    Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and other emergency assistance funding to
    date, USAID and CDC are supporting Vietnam’s response to COVID-19
    with an additional $23 million in technical assistance and
    programmatic support, bringing the total assistance provided since
    the start of the pandemic to nearly $44 million. This assistance
    will accelerate equitable access to and delivery of safe and
    effective COVID-19 vaccines, strengthen Vietnam’s health system to
    respond to COVID-19, and build capacity to detect and monitor
    COVID-19 and future disease threats. USAID also provided the Vietnam
    Red Cross $1 million to reduce the impacts and prevent the spread of
    COVID-19 in vulnerable communities.
-   Support for vaccine distribution: The Department of Defense has
    committed to provide 77 ultra-low temperature vaccine freezers to
    assist vaccination distribution efforts in all 63 provinces. These
    freezers are specially designed to accommodate the most extreme
    vaccine storage requirements, significantly enhancing Vietnam’s
    national vaccine distribution network. 
-   Emergency Operations: Through the Defense Threat Reduction agency,
    the U.S. provided two Regional Public Health Emergency Operations
    Centers, which are now operating 24/7 to collect and share COVID-19
    surveillance information through the Ministry of Health. 
-   Launch of the new CDC Southeast Asia Regional Office: The Vice
    President launched the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) Southeast Asia Regional Office in Hanoi alongside
    Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister and Health Ministers from ASEAN and
    Papua New Guinea. The CDC office will advance global health security
    by maintaining a sustainable presence in the region, enabling a
    rapid and effective response to health threats—wherever they
    occur—and reinforcing CDC’s core mission of protecting Americans.

**Combatting Climate Change:**  The Vice President and Vietnamese
government and civil society leaders agreed on the importance of
combatting the climate crisis, increasing resilience, and collaborating
towards a clean energy future.

-   Leveraging the Private Sector in Climate Action: USAID and the
    Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) signed a Memorandum
    of Understanding (MOU) to boost Vietnam’s competitiveness, expand
    market opportunities for U.S. companies, and strengthen Vietnam’s
    environmental policy. This MOU with VCCI will improve VCCI’s focus
    on sustainability, green technology and climate change. USAID also
    intends to support VCCI in developing a Green Index to help U.S.
    businesses select provinces that are investing in green operations.
     
-   Expanding Clean Energy and Electric Vehicles: The U.S. government
    announced the Vietnam Low Emission Energy Program II (V-LEEP II), a
    five-year, $36 million USAID project which aims to accelerate
    Vietnam’s transition to a clean, secure, and market-driven energy
    system.  The project will work to improve government energy
    planning, increase competition to encourage U.S. private sector
    involvement in energy service provision, and increase clean energy
    systems. The project will help Vietnam scale up adoption of electric
    motorbikes and implement the Direct Power Purchase Agreement (DPPA)
    mechanism to allow businesses to procure electricity directly from
    private firms producing renewable energy.
-   Protecting the Mekong Delta region: Through USAID, the U.S.
    government launched the Mekong Coastal Habitat Conservation project,
    a new three-year, $2.9 million project with the International Union
    for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This project aims to protect key
    coastal habitats in the Mekong Delta region for sustainable
    fisheries, climate change adaptation and biodiversity conservation.
-   Accelerating Climate-Smart Agriculture: The United States welcomed
    Vietnam joining the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate
    (AIM4C), an initiative announced at President Biden’s Leaders’
    Summit on Climate that will be launched at COP-26 in November 2021.
     AIM4C participants will work together to accelerate global
    agricultural innovation and the adoption of climate smart
    technologies.  Together the United States and Vietnam, along with
    our global partners, can address shared climate challenges and
    create innovative solutions to improve food security and drive
    economic growth around the world. 

**Development Assistance and Market Access**:  The Vice President
emphasized the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to promote economic
growth and opportunity. 

-   Promoting women and ethnic-minority owned enterprises: The U.S.
    government announced the Improving Private Sector Competitiveness
    (IPSC) project, a $36 million USAID flagship effort to grow women
    and ethnic minority-owned businesses and promote job-growth in rural
    areas through the adoption of new U.S. technology.
-   Support for Vietnam’s transition to a digital economy: The U.S.
    government announced the Workforce for an Innovation and Startup
    Ecosystem (WISE), a USAID project providing up to $2 million to
    support Vietnam’s effort to transition from an economy dominated by
    labor intensive, low-skilled industry to a workforce better equipped
    to participate in the global digital economy. Building Vietnam’s
    digital skills will increase opportunities for trade between the
    United States and Vietnam and will promote U.S. technologies.
-   Lower tariffs on U.S. exports: U.S. farmers and pork producers will
    have greater access to markets in Vietnam — the United States’
    seventh largest agricultural export market — as a result of
    Vietnam’s positive consideration of our proposal to eliminate or
    reduce MFN import duties on corn, wheat, and pork products. These
    tariff cuts allow U.S. farmers to provide Vietnam with quality and
    competitively-priced products while also helping reduce the U.S.
    trade deficit with Vietnam

**Human Rights & Civil Society**:  The Biden-Harris Administration is
putting human rights at the center of our foreign policy and, while in
Vietnam, Vice President Harris emphasized the essential role that civil
society plays in global development.

-   Promoting civil society and grassroots advocacy: The United States
    supports Vietnam’s civil society and advocates for freedom of
    expression, belief, and association in Vietnam—as raised by the Vice
    President in her government meetings.  Additionally, the Vice
    President will hold a meeting on August 26th with representatives of
    grassroots advocacy groups, in which she will emphasize the critical
    role of civil society as a driver of sustainable development and
    inclusive prosperity. 

**Addressing Legacy of War Issues**:  The United States and Vietnam have
overcome a difficult past to become trusted partners.  Vice President
Harris committed to Vietnamese government leaders our resolve to
continue addressing shared war legacy issues.   

-   Addressing shared war legacies: The United States commits to provide
    an additional $17.5 million for surveying and clearing unexploded
    ordnance (UXO), demonstrating our continued pledge to addressing war
    legacy issues. The State Department commits to continue extensive
    UXO survey and clearance projects, build capacity for the national
    mine action center, and implement risk education initiatives to save
    lives and create economic opportunities.   
-   Support for persons with disabilities: The U.S. government, through
    USAID, announced two new awards to local Vietnamese organizations,
    in support of persons with disabilities:  Raising Voices, Creating
    Opportunities II and Hold My Hand II. These projects, with a total
    budget of approximately $4 million, will support persons with
    disabilities by improving their quality of life and promoting their
    social inclusion. As one of our oldest war legacy initiatives, under
    Senator Leahy’s War Victims Fund since 1989, disability programming
    has long served as a core element of bilateral cooperation.

**Security Cooperation**:  The United States supports Vietnam’s
enhancement of its maritime security and law enforcement capabilities. 

-   Commitment to a Security Partnership: The United States and Vietnam
    affirmed our commitment to continuing our high-level security
    cooperation in support of a strong, prosperous and independent
    Vietnam, including humanitarian engagements like Pacific Partnership
    and visits by U.S. ships, including aircraft carriers. 
-   Increasing our Coast Guard Partnership: The Vice President discussed
    the deep ties between the Vietnam and U.S. Coast Guards, including
    the possible provision of a third U.S. Coast Guard high-endurance
    cutter, subject to the will of Congress.  This cutter would
    complement two other U.S.-provided cutters, a fleet of 24 patrol
    boats, base facilities, piers, law enforcement training, and other
    joint activities that bolster Vietnam’s capacity to contribute to
    maritime security in the South China Sea.
-   Expanding humanitarian and disaster response cooperation: The U.S.
    and Vietnam committed to establish a medical trauma exchange between
    the Vietnam Military and the Department of Defense to expand
    humanitarian and disaster response capacity, while cooperatively
    advancing critical patient care for soldiers, veterans, and the
    people of Vietnam.

**Investments in the Bilateral Relationship**:  Vice President Harris
and Vietnamese government leaders reaffirmed the strength of
U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership, as signified by the signing of a
new U.S. Embassy compound and the opening of Peace Corps Vietnam. 

-   Opening of Peace Corps Vietnam: The Vice President is announcing the
    launch of Peace Corps Vietnam, which marks the conclusion of 17
    years of negotiations, and opens a new era of opportunities for
    young Americans to serve abroad and foster people-to-people ties
    between our two countries.  Peace Corps Vietnam will welcome its
    inaugural cohort of Peace Corps Volunteers in 2022.
-   New U.S. Embassy Compound Signing: The Vice President will be
    witnessing the signing of the lease for the new U.S. Embassy
    Compound in Hanoi, Vietnam to symbolize the future of our
    partnership.  The U.S. Embassy celebrated the 25th anniversary of
    normalization in 2020, and formalizing the lease agreement allows us
    to look ahead to the next 25 years and beyond of U.S. engagement in
    Vietnam.

**Reinforcing International Norms on the Peaceful Exploration of
Space**: The United States and Vietnam support efforts to ensure space
activities are conducted in a responsible and sustainable manner. 

-   The United States and Vietnam recognize the growing importance of
    space in providing benefits to all humanity, to tackling climate
    challenges and ensuring development on Earth. We also exchanged
    views on the Artemis Accords during the visit and acknowledge the
    pivotal role international cooperation plays in sustaining the outer
    space environment to maximize the benefits space offers. In this
    regard, the United States and Vietnam are committed to a civil space
    dialogue, to take place in the first quarter of 2022 which would
    serve to align our goals of ensuring space activities are conducted
    in a responsible and sustainable manner.

**Support for Higher Education**:  Vice President Harris underscored the
United States’ commitment to the future of Vietnam and the enduring
nature of the U.S.-Vietnam partnership. Partnering on education reform:
USAID announced the Partnership for Higher Education Reform, a five-year
project providing up to $14.2 million to strengthen teaching, research,
innovation, and governance within the three largest national
universities in Vietnam.  With U.S. university and private sector
partners, the project will support inclusive economic opportunities for
nearly 150,000 Vietnamese students in support of a strong, prosperous,
and independent Vietnam as a vital U.S. partner.
