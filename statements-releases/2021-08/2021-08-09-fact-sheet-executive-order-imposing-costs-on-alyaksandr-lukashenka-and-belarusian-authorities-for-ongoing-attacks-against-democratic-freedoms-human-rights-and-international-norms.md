title: "FACT SHEET: Executive Order Imposing Costs on Alyaksandr Lukashenka and Belarusian\
  \ Authorities for Ongoing Attacks Against Democratic Freedoms, Human Rights, and\
  \ International\_Norms"
---
 
Today, on the anniversary of the fraudulent Belarusian election of
August 9, 2020, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. signed an Executive Order
(E.O.) imposing further consequences upon Alyaksandr Lukashenka and his
regime for their ongoing assault against the democratic aspirations and
human rights of the Belarusian people, transnational repression and
abuse, affronts to international norms, and corruption.

This E.O. provides strengthened authorities that empower the United
States to raise the costs on the Lukashenka regime. Specifically, this
E.O. expands the scope of the national emergency declared in E.O. 13405
of June 16, 2006, by authorizing the imposition of blocking sanctions on
persons operating in certain identified sectors of the Belarus economy,
including the defense and related materiel sector, security sector,
energy sector, potassium chloride (potash) sector, tobacco products
sector, construction sector, transportation sector, or any other sector
of the Belarus economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is also issuing its largest round of
sanctions to date against Belarusian individuals and entities pursuant
to E.O. 13405 as well as the E.O. of August 9, 2021, including:

-   Belaruskali OAO, which is one of Belarus’s largest state-owned
    enterprises, one of the world’s largest producers of potash, and a
    source of illicit wealth for the regime;  
-   The Belarusian National Olympic Committee, which is accused of
    facilitating money laundering, sanctions evasion, and the
    circumvention of visa bans, and which the International Olympic
    Committee has publicly reprimanded for its failure to protect
    Belarusian athletes from political discrimination and repression;  
-   Prominent businesspeople who support the Lukashenka regime as well
    as fifteen companies with which they are affiliated – including
    Absolutbank, a private Belarusian bank; and,  
-   Additional entities that operate in the tobacco products,
    construction, energy, and transportation sectors of the Belarus
    economy.

Democratic countries are strongest when we stand together. The United
States welcomes the coordinated steps taken today by the United Kingdom
and Canada against the Lukashenka regime and measures announced by the
European Union on June 24.

In May, when Belarus forced the diversion of a commercial Ryanair
flight, President Biden pledged to “develop appropriate options to hold
accountable those responsible” and “to stand with the people of Belarus
in their struggle.” Since then, the regime has only further expanded it
repression, including by threatening the safety of an Olympic athlete
outside its borders. With today’s actions, President Biden is abiding by
his pledge to hold the Belarussian regime accountable for its abuses.
The Biden administration’s position remains clear: the Lukashenka regime
must permit a legitimate international investigation into the Ryanair
flight diversion; it must immediately release all political prisoners;
it must stop targeting activists and dissidents, including across
borders, and it must initiate a genuine and comprehensive political
dialogue with democratic opposition and civil society figures that
results in a free and fair presidential election under OSCE observation.

Absent such steps, the U.S. government will continue to use this E.O.
and other authorities to impose costs on the Lukashenka regime and its
support network for enabling corruption, human rights abuses,
transnational repression, and attacks against democratic freedoms and
international norms.
