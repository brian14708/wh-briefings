National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with Foreign
Minister Fuad Hussein of Iraq. He expressed appreciation for Iraqi
condolences for the recent attack in Kabul that killed U.S. service
members and Afghan civilians. They discussed the important role of Iraq
in the region and the significant diplomatic efforts led by the
Government of Iraq to bring countries together and de-escalate tensions
wherever possible. To that end, National Security Advisor Sullivan noted
President Biden’s full support for the upcoming regional conference in
Baghdad with an aim to elevate diplomacy and dialogue across the Middle
East region. Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Hussein further committed to a
continued security partnership consistent with the recent Strategic
Dialogue held last month in Washington to ensure that ISIS can never
resurge in Iraq and to allow communities recovering from terror to
rebuild with dignity. They both emphasized the firm commitment of the
United States and Iraq to continue coordinating with global partners to
combat ISIS’s financing, propaganda, and movement of foreign fighters.
Finally, National Security Advisor Sullivan conveyed President Biden’s
strong commitment to Iraq and its people and to further strengthening
our enduring bilateral relationship under the Strategic Framework
Agreement.
