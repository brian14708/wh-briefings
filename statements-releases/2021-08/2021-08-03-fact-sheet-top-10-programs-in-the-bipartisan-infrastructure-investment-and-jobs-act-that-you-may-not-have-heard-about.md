title: "FACT SHEET: Top 10 Programs in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and\
  \ Jobs Act That You May Not Have Heard\_About"
---
 
1.  **Weatherization:** Two-thirds of low-income U.S. households have
    high energy burdens, meaning they spend more than 6 percent of their
    income on utility bills. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will
    invest a historic $3.5 billion in the Weatherization Assistance
    Program, reducing energy costs for more than 700,000 low-income
    households by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes, while
    ensuring health and safety and creating jobs.  
2.  **Wildfires:** One estimate found that 4.5 million homes in the
    United States are at risk of wildfire. The bill invests $8 billion
    in wildfire risk reduction by providing funding for community
    wildfire defense grants, mechanical thinning, controlled burns, the
    Collaborative Forest Restoration Program, and firefighting
    resources.  
3.  **Floods:** The cost of flood damage was approximately $17 billion
    annually in the last decade, and is expected to increase
    significantly due climate-related extreme weather and rising sea
    levels. The bill invests $12 billion in flood mitigation, including
    funding for FEMA flood mitigation grants, making infrastructure
    investments to increase coastal resilience, and improving mapping
    and data so that households and businesses can better protect
    themselves from future flood events.  
4.  **Brownfields and superfund**: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of
    Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher
    percentage than for Americans overall. Proximity to a Superfund site
    can lead to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood. The deal
    invests $5 billion in addressing legacy pollution at these sites,
    creating good-paying union jobs and advancing economic and
    environmental justice.  
5.  **Natural gas wells and coal mines:** In thousands of rural and
    urban communities around the country, hundreds of thousands of
    former industrial and energy sites, including orphan wells and
    abandoned land mines, are now idle – sources of blight and
    pollution. The deal invests $16 billion in creating good-paying
    union jobs capping these wells and mines.  
6.  **Pipeline safety:** More than 20,000 miles of cast iron
    pipelines—much of which was installed in the 1800’s and early
    1900’s—transports natural gas underneath communities in the U.S.
    This infrastructure, which is prone to leaks and fugitive methane
    emissions, is mostly located in disadvantaged areas including older
    cities like Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, New York, and St.
    Louis.  Since 2010, the U.S. has experienced thousands of pipeline
    incidents, resulting in hundreds of injuries and deaths, tens of
    thousands of evacuations, and more than $4 billion in damages. The
    bill includes $1 billion for the “Natural Gas Distribution
    Infrastructure Safety and Modernization Grant Program” to modernize
    natural gas distribution pipelines, reducing incidents and
    fatalities, and avoiding economic losses.  
7.  **Battery manufacturing:** Today, the U.S. relies heavily on
    importing advanced battery components from abroad, exposing the
    nation to supply chain vulnerabilities that threaten to disrupt the
    availability and cost of these technologies, as well as the
    workforce that manufactures them. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal
    will invest $6B to spur U.S. advanced battery processing,
    manufacturing, and recycling, creating good-paying jobs and enabling
    American manufacturers to win the 21<sup>st</sup> century.    
8.  **Safe Streets:** Over 36,000 Americans died in motor vehicle
    crashes in 2019, including over 6,200 pedestrians and about 850
    bicyclists. The United States has one of the highest traffic
    fatality rates in the industrialized world, double the rate in
    Canada and quadruple that in Europe. The Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Deal includes $5 billion for a first-of-its kind “Safe Streets for
    All” program to fund state and local “vision zero” plans and other
    improvements to reduce crashes and fatalities, especially for the
    most vulnerable of roadways users.  
9.  **Transit station ADA program:** More than 30 years after the
    passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, nearly 1,000 transit
    stations are still not fully accessible, which prevents millions of
    older Americans and individuals with disabilities from fully
    enjoying public transit. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal includes
    a total of $2 billion for transit ADA, including $1.75 billion for
    All Stations Accessibility and $250 million for Enhanced Mobility
    for Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. These programs will
    remove barriers to transportation service and expand transportation
    mobility options for Americans across the country.  
10. **Cybersecurity:** The recent cybersecurity breaches of federal
    government data systems, critical infrastructure, and American
    businesses underscore the importance and urgency of strengthening
    U.S. cybersecurity capabilities. The bipartisan Infrastructure
    Investment and Jobs Act will invest about $2 billion to modernize
    and secure federal, state, and local IT and networks; protect
    critical infrastructure and utilities; and support public or private
    entities as they respond to and recover from significant
    cyberattacks and breaches.
