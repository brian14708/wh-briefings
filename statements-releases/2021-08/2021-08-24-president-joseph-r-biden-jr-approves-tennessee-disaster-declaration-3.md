Yesterday, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Tennessee and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by a severe storm
and flooding on August 21, 2021.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in Humphreys County.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to State and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency protective measures in Humphreys
County.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Myra M. Shird as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
counties can begin applying for assistance tomorrow by registering
