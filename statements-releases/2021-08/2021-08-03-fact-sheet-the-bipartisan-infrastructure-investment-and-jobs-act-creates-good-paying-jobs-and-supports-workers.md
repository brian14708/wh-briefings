title: 'FACT SHEET: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Creates
  Good-Paying Jobs and Supports Workers'
---
 
The deal reached by President Biden and the bipartisan group of Senators
makes a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure and will
create good-paying union jobs repairing our roads and bridges, replacing
lead pipes, and building energy transmission lines. It invests in clean
energy manufacturing and zero-emission vehicles ensuring that the jobs
in the clean energy industry are good-paying, quality American jobs. The
deal ensures that all taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects use
materials made in America.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create good
jobs for workers across the country, including workers in rural areas,
hard-hit energy workers, historically disadvantaged workers, and workers
in distressed areas. This historic investment will accelerate the
economic recovery, put Americans back to work, and boost wages for
workers across the country.

The legislation will:

-   **Create millions of good-paying jobs.** With the President’s Build
    Back Better agenda, the investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Investment and Jobs Act will add, on average, around 2 million jobs
    per year over the course of the decade, accelerating America’s path
    to full employment while bringing workers who have been left behind
    into the labor force.  
     
-   **Protect critical labor standards on construction projects. **The
    overwhelming majority of the funds in the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Investment and Jobs Act will be subject to Davis-Bacon requirements,
    which ensure that contractors pay workers on construction projects a
    fair, prevailing wage so that local wages, labor markets, and
    workers won’t be undercut. These requirements will protect wages for
    millions of workers, grow the economy, and support good-paying,
    union jobs.  
     
-   **Grow wages in the clean energy industry.** President Biden
    committed to ensuring that the new jobs created in the clean energy
    industry—solar, wind, carbon capture, energy transmission—would be
    good-paying, union jobs. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment
    and Jobs Act extends prevailing wage protections to all energy
    infrastructure provisions, including the construction of EV charging
    stations on highways and in communities, ensuring that these
    critical jobs come with good wages and benefits and support local
    unions.  
     
-   **Put pipefitters to work making communities safer.** The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will put pipefitters to work
    across the country with an historic investment in our water
    infrastructure, including funding to replace all of the nation’s
    lead water pipes. It also invests $1 billion to modernize and repair
    natural gas distribution pipelines, creating good-paying jobs while
    fighting the climate crisis by reducing methane emissions, as well
    as making our communities safer.  
     
-   **Buy America. **The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
    Act lives up to the President’s commitment to ensure that the future
    is made in America by American workers. The legislation includes a
    comprehensive Buy America provision to ensure that all
    taxpayer-funded infrastructure and public works projects are built
    with American iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction
    materials. This will create good-paying manufacturing jobs here at
    home and further the President’s commitment to revitalizing the
    domestic industrial base.  
     
-   **Protect and support transit workers**. The agreement provides
    unprecedented support for transportation workers who have worked
    tirelessly on the frontlines of the pandemic. The legislation
    includes new provisions to prevent operator assaults built on
    collective bargaining and labor-management collaboration, so that no
    transit worker should fear for their safety just for doing their
    job. And it provides over $300 million in grant funding to train
    transit workers on the zero-emission vehicles of the future,
    including through registered apprenticeships and other joint
    labor-management training programs.  
     
-   **Support auto workers**. Auto workers and good, union auto
    manufacturing jobs are the backbone of communities across the
    country. As the country transitions to zero-emission vehicles, the
    President committed to building those vehicles and their components
    here in the United States. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment
    and Jobs Act invests in grants to support battery and battery
    component manufacturing, manufacturing facilities, and retooling and
    retrofitting of existing facilities. It also invests in good-paying
    jobs building a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging
    infrastructure along highway corridors, which will accelerate the
    adoption of electric vehicles to address the climate crisis and
    support domestic manufacturing jobs.  
     
-   **Invest in coal and energy communities**. America’s coal miners and
    energy workers have powered this country for more than a century.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act invests in
    places impacted by shifting energy markets, including directing
    billions of dollars for advanced energy manufacturing facilities and
    clean energy demonstration projects to communities where coal mines
    or power plants have been shut down. The legislation also invests
    $21 billion in environmental remediation, creating good-paying union
    jobs in hard-hit energy communities cleaning up superfund and
    brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned
    gas wells.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is just one part
of President Biden’s plan to create and support good-paying, union jobs
and deliver workers the dignity and rights they are owed. The
President’s Build Back Better plan will pair job creation efforts with
workforce development programs, invest in child care and long-term care
and the care workers that enable others to go to work, provide national
paid family and medical leave, ensure federal agencies have the
necessary resources to protect workers, and invest in other efforts to
create good, union jobs.
