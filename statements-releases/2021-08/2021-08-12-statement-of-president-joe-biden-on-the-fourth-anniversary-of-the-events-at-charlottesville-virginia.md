  \ at Charlottesville,\_Virginia"

Four years ago today in Charlottesville, Virginia the battle for the
soul of America was laid bare for all to see.  
   
The forces of hate and violence were summoned from the shadows as
Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and white supremacists descended on a historic
American city. With torches in their hands and veins bulging from their
necks, they spewed the same antisemitic bile that was heard in Germany
in the 1930s and with the same beatings and bigotry we saw in Jim Crow
America for nearly a century.  
   
But what they didn’t account for was the extraordinary force of American
goodness and decency. In that moment and as we’ve seen throughout our
history, Americans of different races, religions, and backgrounds stood
ground and stayed true to the promise of our nation: that we are all
created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.
   
 In that moment, the courage of the nation was summoned. One brave
woman, Heather Heyer, a young civil rights activist, was murdered while
representing the best of us. Her life and activism are reminders that
while we have never fully lived up to the promise of America, we have
never fully walked away from it either.  
   
What happened in Charlottesville – and securing the promise of America
for every American – motivated me to run for president and now motivates
my Administration’s work to ensure that hate has no safe harbor in
America.  
   
In my first week in office, I signed an executive order establishing
whole-of-government effort to advance racial equity and support
underserved communities, and a presidential memorandum directing all
federal agencies to combat the resurgence of xenophobia against Asian
Americans that we’ve seen during this pandemic.  
   
And in May, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act that empowers
the U.S. Department of Justice and our entire Administration to address
the critical problem of hate crimes being underreported. The law
includes provisions in Heather Heyer’s name that will help state and
local governments to ensure hate crimes information is more accessible
to the public.  
   
Heather’s mother joined me at the bill signing. As I told her on that
day, I know it’s hard. Even with the significance of the law being
changed, it’s like getting the news of her death just seconds ago.  It
takes enormous courage. It’s also especially hard on this day of
commemoration. Jill and I are thinking about Heather and her family.  
   
And we know there is more work we must do as a nation – as we saw with
the mob of insurrectionists at the United States Capitol on January
6<sup>th</sup> that joins the horror we saw in Charlottesville as
shameful chapters in our history.  
   
We must acknowledge what America’s intelligence community has already
confirmed, and what Charlottesville and so many other communities know
all too well: the most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland in recent
years has been domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy.  We cannot
ignore it.  We must confront the spread of hate-fueled violence in every
form.  
   
To that end, in June, my Administration laid out America’s first-ever
comprehensive effort to take on the threat of domestic terrorism.  We
are doing so by countering and reducing online radicalization and
recruitment to violence, disrupting the networks that inspire violence
by domestic terrorists and hate groups, and providing new resources for
communities to build up local resilience against the spread of hate.  
   
Charlottesville is an example of how this is the work of all of us.  
   
In the hours and days after what happened there, America’s moral
conscience stirred. The nation’s military, business, and labor leaders
took a firm stand. Political, community, and faith leaders raised their
voices. Religious leaders held a prayer service at St. Paul’s Memorial
Episcopal Church the night before the rally and marched in the streets
the next day. When the Neo-Nazi marchers passed Charlottesville’s only
synagogue, Beth Israel, the congregation continued worship services,
stood up to the hate, and helped their neighbors. And we should never
forget the courage of that small group of University of Virginia
students who stared down the mob and did not flinch.  
   
While it may come with enormous pain and cost, the greatness of America
is that at our best, we meet President Lincoln’s appeal to embrace the
“better angels of our nature.”  
   
That’s what we must do – together – to win this battle for the soul of
America.
