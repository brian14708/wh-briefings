Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq.*), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order
to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 13405 of June 16, 2006 (Blocking Property of Certain Persons
Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Belarus), finding
that the Belarusian regime’s harmful activities and long-standing abuses
aimed at suppressing democracy and the exercise of human rights and
fundamental freedoms in Belarus — including illicit and oppressive
activities stemming from the August 9, 2020, fraudulent Belarusian
presidential election and its aftermath, such as the elimination of
political opposition and civil society organizations and the regime’s
disruption and endangering of international civil air travel —
constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security
and foreign policy of the United States.  The order augments the
sanctions designation criteria for current threats to United States
national security and foreign policy interests posed by the Belarusian
regime.  All executive departments and agencies are directed to take all
appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.  
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued. 

  
Sincerely,  
  
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
