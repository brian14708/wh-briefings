As we approach the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the terrorist attacks
of September 11, 2001, we must never forget the enduring pain of the
families and loved ones of the 2,977 innocent people who were killed.
For them, 9/11 was not only a national and international tragedy; it was
a personal devastation. For 20 years, children have grown up without
parents. Husbands and wives have had to find a way forward without their
partners in life. Brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, have
celebrated 20 years of birthdays, family gatherings, and milestones, all
with a hole in their hearts. I know well the all-consuming grief of
losing someone you love so suddenly. I can only imagine the added pain
these families have endured, spending 20 years pursuing accountability
and justice.  
  
As I promised during my campaign, my Administration is committed to
ensuring the maximum degree of transparency under the law, and to
adhering to the rigorous guidance issued during the Obama-Biden
Administration on the invocation of the state secrets privilege. In this
vein, I welcome the Department of Justiceâ€™s filing today, which commits
to conducting a fresh review of documents where the government has
previously asserted privileges, and to doing so as quickly as
possible.  
  
My heart and my prayers continue to be with the 9/11 families who are
suffering, and my Administration will continue to engage respectfully
with members of this community. I welcome their voices and insight as we
chart a way forward.
