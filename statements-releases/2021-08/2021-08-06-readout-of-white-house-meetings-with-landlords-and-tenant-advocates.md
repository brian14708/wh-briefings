title: Readout of White House Meetings with Landlords and Tenant Advocates
---
 
This week, White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling
and Special Assistant to the President for Housing and Urban Policy
Erika Poethig, along with other Biden-Harris Administration officials,
held virtual listening sessions with groups representing landlords and
tenant advocates to discuss state and local disbursement of emergency
rental assistance funds and ways to protect renters from eviction.

Administration officials communicated the need for landlords to accept
rental assistance before pursuing evictions. They also received feedback
on strengths and weaknesses of state and local rental assistance
programs as well as ways the Administration can work with governors and
mayors to expedite the release of rental assistance funds. Landlords
also offered their feedback on how grantees might speed delivery and
increase access to rental assistance.  In their discussions with tenant
advocates, Administration officials also heard about the challenges
renters are facing in accessing emergency rental assistance funds. They
also shared examples of where evictions are proceeding and ways to
promote eviction diversion strategies.

In both meetings, Administration officials reiterated the commitment
made by President Biden that his Administration will not rest—nor should
state and local governments—until emergency rental assistance dollars
reach Americans in need. 

The meetings with these groups are part of continued engagement by the
Administration to [raise awareness among tenants and
landlords](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-companies-non-profits-government-agencies-answer-biden-harris-call-make-combined-commitment-to-alert-tens-of-millions-of-americans-to-emergency-rental-assistance/)
on available resources and [increase the pace of

of the billions in emergency rental assistance that is available to
state and local governments to prevent evictions and make landlords
whole.
