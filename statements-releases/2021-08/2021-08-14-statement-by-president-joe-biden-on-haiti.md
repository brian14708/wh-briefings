In what is already a challenging time for the people of Haiti, I am
saddened by the devastating earthquake that occurred in Saint-Louis du
Sud, Haiti this morning. We send our deepest condolences to all those
who lost a loved one or saw their homes and businesses destroyed. I have
authorized an immediate US response and named USAID Administrator
Samantha Power as the senior US official to coordinate this effort.

Through USAID, we are supporting efforts to assess the damage and assist
efforts to recover those who were injured and those who must now
rebuild. The United States remains a close and enduring friend to the
people of Haiti, and we will be there in the aftermath of this tragedy.
