title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Anniversary of the Voting\
  \ Rights Act of\_1965"
---
 
Fifty-six years ago today – surrounded by Democrats and Republicans,
activists and leaders including Dr. Martin Luther King, John Lewis, and
Rosa Parks – President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 into law. The Voting Rights Act remains one of the most
important pieces of legislation in our nation’s history. It is estimated
that in the five years after passage, almost as many Black Americans
registered to vote in some southern states as in the 100 years prior to
1965.   
   
On the anniversary of its signing, we honor the generations of Americans
who marched, organized, and sacrificed, and we commit to continuing the
fight. Today, voting rights are once again under attack. Over the past
decade, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted by Supreme Court
decisions. As a result, states have passed anti-voter legislation. Just
this year, 18 states have passed 30 laws that make it more difficult for
Americans to vote, including by limiting vote-by-mail, early voting, and
other restrictive measures. We must fight back, and we are.  
   
There are two landmark pieces of federal legislation moving through
Congress now that our Administration fully supports—the For the People
Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Just as leaders
recognized 56 years ago, we are in a critical moment, and that is why we
must pass these bills.  
   
It will not be easy. But the struggle over voting rights has never been
easy. Each generation has fought to expand voting rights, and we owe it
to the next generation to fight for every American’s right to vote and
have their vote counted.
