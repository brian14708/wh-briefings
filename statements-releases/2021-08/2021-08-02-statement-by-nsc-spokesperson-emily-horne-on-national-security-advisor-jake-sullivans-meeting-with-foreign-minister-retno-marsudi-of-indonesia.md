National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Foreign Minister
Retno Marsudi of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. to discuss opportunities
to deepen the U.S.-Indonesia Strategic Partnership. Mr. Sullivan
informed Foreign Minister Marsudi that the United States will provide an
additional $30 million in COVID-19 assistance to Indonesia, bringing the
total U.S. assistance to Indonesia since the start of the pandemic to
more than $65 million.

Mr. Sullivan underscored the United States’ enduring commitment to
Southeast Asia and reiterated our support for ASEAN centrality and
ASEAN’s essential role in the Indo-Pacific’s regional architecture. He
noted we will continue high-level engagement with Indonesia and the
region as part of our efforts to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific.
They also discussed a range of bilateral and regional issues including
the climate crisis and the importance of freedom of the seas and
adherence to UNCLOS principles in the South China Sea. They shared deep
concerns regarding the crisis in Burma and recommitted to promoting a
swift return to democracy.

On COVID-19, they discussed the surge of cases in Indonesia and Mr.
Sullivan underscored that his thoughts are with all those affected and
that the United States will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with
the Indonesian people and support them as they battle the pandemic. He
noted that the new $30 million in U.S. assistance will support
additional oxygen and medical supplies to treat COVID-19 patients and
enhance Indonesia’s ability to get shots into arms by supporting cold
chain vaccine distribution, facilities readiness, and other
measures. They discussed U.S. efforts to serve as an arsenal of vaccines
for the world and our singular focus on saving lives, and they welcomed
the August 1 arrival of an additional 3.5 million U.S.-donated Moderna
vaccine doses to Indonesia through COVAX, bringing the total to 8
million doses donated by the United States to Indonesia thus far. They
also discussed the Defense Department’s donation of PPE to the
Indonesian armed forces for distribution to the civilian medical system
as part of the ongoing Garuda Shield exercise. Finally, they discussed
Indonesia’s continued leadership in advancing global health security and
agreed on the need to create sustainable global health partnerships to
prepare for future biological threats.
