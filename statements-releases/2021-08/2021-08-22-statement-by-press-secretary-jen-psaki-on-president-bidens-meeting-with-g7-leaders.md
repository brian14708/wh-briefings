President Biden will virtually meet with G7 leaders on August 24, 2021.
The leaders will discuss continuing our close coordination
on Afghanistan policy and evacuating our citizens, the brave Afghans who
stood with us over the last two decades, and other vulnerable Afghans.
They will also discuss plans to provide humanitarian assistance and
support for Afghan refugees. The meeting will build on President Biden’s
calls this week with G7 leaders Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the
United Kingdom, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Emmanuel
Macron of France, and Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy.
