title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Veteran and Military Family\_Organizations"

Today, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Dennis McDonough, Senior Advisor to
the President Cedric Richmond, and Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Josh
Geltzer hosted a virtual meeting with over 70 veteran, military family,
caregiver and survivor organizations to discuss the ongoing drawdown of
U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Administration officials offered condolences
following yesterday’s terrorist attacks in Kabul that took the lives of
brave American service members and killed and wounded innocent Afghan
civilians.  
  
In what was a somber and serious discussion, participants updated
Administration officials on how these organizations are working to
support the drawdown and also highlighted their priorities which include
providing veterans and military families access to mental health and
other support services, adequate funding for resettlement agencies, and
combatting extremist rhetoric and misinformation about Afghan allies who
will be resettled in U.S communities.  
  
Administration officials reiterated the President’s commitment to both
our allies and the brave men and women who have and currently serve our
nation, committed to continued engagement and partnership with these
groups, and ended by thanking participants for their extraordinary and
ongoing efforts to help veterans, military families and our Afghan
allies.
