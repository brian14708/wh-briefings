The eviction moratoriums issued by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) saved lives by preventing the spread of the COVID-19
virus throughout the pandemic.  
  
The Biden Administration is disappointed that the Supreme Court has
blocked the most recent CDC eviction moratorium while confirmed cases of
the Delta variant are significant across the country. As a result of
this ruling, families will face the painful impact of
evictions, and communities across the country will face greater risk of
exposure to COVID-19.    
  
In light of the Supreme Court ruling and the continued risk of COVID-19
transmission, President Biden is once again calling on all entities
that can prevent evictions – from cities and states to local courts,
landlords, Cabinet Agencies – to urgently act to prevent evictions.    
  
Earlier this week, the White House released the following fact sheet:
