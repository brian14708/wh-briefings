Today, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, White House Counsel Dana Remus,
and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta convened the first listening
session of the White House Legal Aid Interagency
Roundtable (WH-LAIR). They were joined by five panelists and 33
administration officials to discuss access to justice challenges during
the COVID-19 pandemic. During the meeting, Mr. Emhoff, Ms. Remus, and

address some of the most pressing challenges posed by the pandemic,
including the Administration’s recent actions to prevent evictions. They
also re-affirmed the Administration’s commitment to working with direct
legal service providers to expand access to legal representation and the
courts, and to ensure that federal resources make their way to the
people who need them most.
