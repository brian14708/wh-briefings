Today, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, White House Counsel Dana Remus,

the COVID-19 pandemic. During the meeting, Mr. Emhoff, Ms. Remus, and

address some of the most pressing challenges posed by the pandemic,
including the Administration’s recent actions to prevent evictions. They

legal service providers to expand access to legal representation and the
courts, and to ensure that federal resources make their way to the
people who need them most.
