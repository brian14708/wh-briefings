WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to appoint
Maria-Elena Giner to be the U.S. Commissioner of the International
Boundary and Water Commission. As a first-generation college graduate
and daughter of an immigrant, she will be the first Latina nominated as
Commissioner of the International Boundary Water Commission. 

The U.S Section of the [International Boundary and Water
Commission](https://www.ibwc.gov/About_Us/history.html) is a federal
government agency that implements boundary and water treaties between
the United States and Mexico and provides binational solutions when
issues arise around rivers, sanitation, water quality, and flood control
in the border region.

Boundary and Water Commission</u>**

Maria-Elena Giner has over 25 years of experience serving the residents
of the U.S.-Mexico border region on water issues. The United States and
Mexican governments appointed her in 2010 as the General Manager for the
Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC). Much of her work at
BECC focused on modernizing the institution by expanding its municipal
infrastructure programs and updating its organizational tools to meet
the dynamic needs of the region while balancing the interests of the
federal administrations. During her tenure, she focused on a progressive
agenda that addressed binational cooperation on water, energy, and
climate change.

Dr. Giner is well regarded with state agencies and local communities in
California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and the 6 Mexican border states.
With the support of staff, she led the development and financing of $9
billion in environmental infrastructure, benefitting about 100
communities and over 10 million residents. In addition, she has
published extensively on water policy and transboundary bilateral
cooperation. Her education includes a Bachelor of Science in Civil
Engineering from Loyola Marymount University, a Master of Business
Administration from the University of Texas in El Paso, and a Ph.D. in
Public Policy from the University of Texas at Austin. Also, she is a
registered professional engineer in the state of Texas.
