title: Statement by Vice President Kamala Harris on the Passing of AFL-CIO President
  Richard Trumka
---
 
Today, our nation lost a great leader. Richard L. Trumka was a champion
of workers everywhere. As the President of the AFL-CIO, our nation’s
largest federation of unions, he lived and breathed solidarity. Never
afraid of a fight, Rich put the “strong” in “union strong.”  
   
As a young boy, Rich saw firsthand the struggles his father and
grandfather faced as they participated in mine workers’ strikes and
negotiated for fairer pay and better working conditions. When he first
told his grandfather that he’d like to become an attorney to stand up
for workers’ rights, his grandfather replied, “If you want to help
workers, you first need to help people.”   
   
Rich was dedicated to helping people. He lived his beliefs. That work
has dignity. That workers should be respected and have a voice. That
justice and equality are hallmarks of a strong nation.  
   
I was lucky to know Rich for many years, and I was always proud to work
with him. Today, my thoughts and prayers are with Rich’s wife Barbara,
their son Rich Jr., and their grandchildren Richard and Taylor.
