title: "President\_Biden to Convene Leaders\u2019 Summit for\_Democracy"
---
 
The President has said that the challenge of our time is to demonstrate
that democracies can deliver by improving the lives of their own people
and by addressing the greatest problems facing the wider world. In his
first six months in office, the President has reinvigorated democracy at
home, vaccinating 70% of population, passing the American Rescue plan,
and advancing bipartisan legislation to invest in our infrastructure and
competitiveness. And he has rebuilt our alliances with our democratic
partners and allies, rallying the world to stand up against human rights
abuses, to address the climate crisis, and to fight the global pandemic,
including by donating hundreds of millions of vaccine doses to countries
around the globe.

In keeping this commitment, today President Biden is pleased to announce
that in December he will bring together leaders from a diverse group of
the world’s democracies at a virtual Summit for Democracy, to be
followed in roughly a year’s time by a second, in-person Summit. The
virtual Summit, to take place on December 9 and 10, will galvanize
commitments and initiatives across three principal themes: defending
against authoritarianism, fighting corruption, and promoting respect for
human rights. Following a year of consultation, coordination, and
action, President Biden will then invite world leaders to gather once
more to showcase progress made against their commitments. Both Summits
will bring together heads of state, civil society, philanthropy, and the
private sector, serving as an opportunity for world leaders to listen to
one another and to their citizens, share successes, drive international
collaboration, and speak honestly about the challenges facing democracy
so as to collectively strengthen the foundation for democratic renewal.
