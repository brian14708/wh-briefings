President Biden convened a virtual meeting today with the Governors of
Louisiana and Mississippi and mayors from cities and parishes most
impacted by Hurricane Ida to receive an update on the storm’s impacts,
and to discuss how the Federal Government can provide assistance.
Joining the President at the meeting were Senior Advisor and Director of
Public Engagement Cedric Richmond, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs
Julie Rodriguez, and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. The President
made clear State and local officials have the full support of the
Federal Government, and named Richmond as his Administration’s direct
line for Gulf Coast State and local officials throughout the recovery.

President Biden highlighted how this will be a whole-of-government and
whole-of-community response and recovery effort, and we are closely
coordinating with State and local officials every step of the way. He
talked about how the Administration is supporting efforts to get
electricity and transmission lines back up and running, and how there
are more than 25,000 line and tree crews from at least 30 States en
route to help local utilities begin restoration work. The President
announced that he has asked the Department of Defense and the Department
of Homeland Security to immediately make available satellite imagery,
and he asked the Federal Aviation Administration to work with Louisiana
and Mississippi to authorize the use of surveillance drones to help
State and local governments assess the damage from Hurricane Ida. He
also spoke about Federal efforts to assist cellular customers as work
continues to restore cellular service in impacted areas.

The Biden Administration is working with its Federal, State and local
partners as well as non-governmental agencies to support the needs of
areas affected by Ida. The President approved a Major Disaster
Declaration for the State of Louisiana and a pre-disaster Emergency
Declaration for the State of Mississippi. More than 3,600 FEMA employees
are deployed to Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Texas, and FEMA staged more than 3.4 million meals, millions of liters
of water, more than 35,700 tarps, and roughly 200 generators in the
region in advance of the storm. Hundreds of additional ambulances and
air ambulances have been moved into the area. Seven FEMA Incident
Management Assistance Teams and 17 Urban Search and Rescue teams
consisting of more than 950 personnel have been activated. Dozens of
shelters remain open in affected areas. The U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services is deploying a 250-bed Federal medical shelter to
Alexandria, Louisiana. The U.S. Coast Guard has 27 rotary or fixed wing
aircraft, and the Department of Defense has 60 high water vehicles and
14 rotary wing aircraft prepositioned to assist with search and rescue.
Governors have activated more than 5,200 National Guard personnel in
Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama to support response efforts.
The Army Corps of Engineers has activated planning and response teams
for debris removal, temporary roofing, and temporary housing.
