title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with Business, University and Health\
  \ Care Leaders on COVID-\u206019 Vaccination\_Requirements"
---
 
Today, President Biden virtually met with four business, university and
health care leaders who have adopted COVID-19 vaccination requirements
for their workforces. The President expressed his appreciation for these
leaders stepping up to protect the lives of their employees and
communities. He highlighted the Administration’s vaccination
requirements for the federal workforce, including requiring COVID-19
vaccinations for health care workers at the Department of Veterans
Affairs and the Department of Defense’s plan to add the COVID-19 vaccine
to the list of required vaccinations for service members. During the
meeting, the leaders shared how they arrived at their decision to
require vaccinations and how they are working to implement their own
requirements. The President asked each of these leaders to talk to their
industry peers about this important step to share best practices and
encourage additional action. He expressed his optimism that additional
employers would follow suit, and he noted that the federal government
will continue to support employers as they require COVID-19
vaccinations.
