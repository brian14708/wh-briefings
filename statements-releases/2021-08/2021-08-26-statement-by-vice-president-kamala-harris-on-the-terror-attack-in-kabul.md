title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Terror Attack in\_Kabul"
---
 
Today in Kabul, a terror attack killed 13 American service members.
These courageous servicemembers died while saving countless lives. They
are heroes.  
   
Doug and I grieve for the Americans we lost, we pray for the Americans
injured in the attack, and our hearts go out to their loved ones. We
also grieve for the Afghan civilians killed and injured.  
   
Our country is grateful to all our women and men in uniform, and in
particular, those working today to get Americans and our Afghan partners
out of harm’s way. And we will complete that mission.    
   
Today, we honor those who gave their lives in service to their nation.
We will never forget.
