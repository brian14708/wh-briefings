National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with Prime Minister
Kaja Kallas of Estonia to reinforce the strong bilateral relations

shared support for transparent infrastructure investments in Europe and
around the world. Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed the unwavering U.S. support

the U.S. commitment to hold the Lukashenka regime in Belarus to account
for its attacks on democracy and human rights, transnational repression,
and corruption.
