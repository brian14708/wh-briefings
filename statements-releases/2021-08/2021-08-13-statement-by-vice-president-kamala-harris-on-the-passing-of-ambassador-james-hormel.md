title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Ambassador James\_\
  Hormel"

During his remarkable life, Ambassador James Hormel made history – and
he made the world a better place. Jim’s kindness and commitment to human
rights, including his efforts to help found the Human Rights Campaign
and advocate for those living with HIV/AIDS, changed lives and inspired
generations of leaders. As our country’s first openly gay ambassador,
Jim’s distinguished service represented the very best of America and
paved the way for others. 

I will always be grateful for Jim’s friendship and counsel over many
years. He will be missed. Doug and I send our condolences to Jim’s
husband Michael, children Alison, Anne, Elizabeth, Jimmy, and Sarah, and
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
