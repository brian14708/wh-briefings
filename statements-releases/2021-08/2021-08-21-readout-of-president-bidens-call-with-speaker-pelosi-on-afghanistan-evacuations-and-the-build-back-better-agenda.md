title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with Speaker Pelosi on Afghanistan\
  \ Evacuations and the Build Back Better\_Agenda"
---
 
This afternoon, the President and Speaker Pelosi spoke by phone about
the ongoing evacuation operations in Afghanistan as well as the
President’s Build Back Better agenda and the upcoming House action this
week on key domestic issues.

The President updated Speaker Pelosi about increasing progress made
evacuating American citizens, our allies, Afghans who aided American
military and other efforts, and additional vulnerable Afghans as rapidly
as possible.

The President also reiterated his support for Speaker Pelosi’s work to
advance the rule that would provide for the House’s consideration of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the Build Back Better Agenda—which
would cut prescription drug costs, reduce the cost of housing and
education, strengthen care for veterans, take on climate change, and
help families afford childcare and care for older Americans.

Similarly, they also followed up on the consensus from their
conversations with 15 House committee chairs that we can pay for these
vital, cost-cutting, long-term investments in the Build Back Better bill
by empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices and
asking the largest corporations and wealthiest Americans to pay their
fair share.
