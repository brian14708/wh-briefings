title: "Readout of the President and Vice President\u2019s Meeting with Latino Leaders"
---
 
Today, the President and Vice President met with 12 Latino leaders to
discuss the Build Back Better Agenda and this Administration’s
commitment to equity. During the meeting, the President and Vice
President reiterated their promise to invest in Latino families and
businesses across the country as we work to recover from the COVID-19
pandemic and the economic downfall that resulted from it. The President
and Vice President discussed their belief in the American Dream and the
promise of America for all, and they vowed to continue working to
strengthen our democracy and protect voting rights. Two years after the
El Paso massacre, they vowed to keep fighting against the most lethal
terrorist threat to our homeland – domestic terrorism rooted in white
supremacy, hate-fueled violence in all forms, and the scourge of gun
violence in America. President Biden and Vice President Harris also
restated their support for immigration reform in reconciliation that
provides a path to citizenship for Dreamers, farm workers, TPS holders,
and essential workers.
