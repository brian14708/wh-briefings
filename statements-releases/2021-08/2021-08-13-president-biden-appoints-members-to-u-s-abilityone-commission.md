WASHINGTON – Today, President Biden announced that he has appointed the

-   Bryan Bashin, Appointee for Commissioner

**Bryan Bashin, Commissioner**  
Bryan Bashin is CEO of the Lighthouse for the Blind and

the comprehensive training and employment of blind people.  For 30 years
his organization has employed blind workers through the National

AbilityOne program. Over the last 11 years, Bashin has overseen
significant expansions of direct blind employment in the AbilityOne
space, but most importantly in competitive, integrated workplaces.
Bashin previously worked as an Assistant Regional Commissioner for the
Department of Education’s Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA)
where he supervised $400 million in federal disability spending in
Arizona, Nevada, California, Hawaii, and Pacific territories. From 1998
until 2004, Bashin was Executive Director of the Sacramento Society for
the Blind, where he led a strong expansion of blindness services,
including competitive employment programs. Bashin has also been an
expert witness in cases involving employment of people with
disabilities. A former science journalist, Bashin is well acquainted
with industrial and technical processes and skill needs of employers.
Bashin is currently a Board member of VisionServe Alliance, a membership
association of more than 100 U.S. blindness agencies.   
  
**Christina Brandt, Commissioner**  
Christina Brandt is the CEO of an innovative nonprofit, an AbilityOne
producer with over four decades of quality service to the government
customer. She transformed AtWork! from a sheltered workshop paying
subminimum wages to a nationally recognized best-practice provider of
customized and integrated community employment for people with
intellectual and developmental disabilities. As a subject matter expert,
Christina has delivered training and technical assistance in multiple
states, including significant work in Oregon implementing the settlement
of *Lane vs. Brown*. Throughout her 46-year career she has advanced
equity and inclusion for people with disabilities and was instrumental
in securing Washington State’s Employment First legislation.  
  
**Gabe Cazares, Commissioner**  
Gabe Cazares currently serves as the Director of Mayor Sylvester
Turner’s Office for People with Disabilities in the City of Houston,
Texas. In this capacity, Gabe oversees the accessible and timely
delivery of city services, programs, and activities for over 215,000

the Manager of Government Affairs at the National Federation of the
Blind in Baltimore, Maryland. There he managed the organization’s
education, technology, immigrants’ rights, LGBTQ, and blind entrepreneur
small business policy portfolio. Gabe holds a Bachelor of Arts in

**Chai Feldblum, Commissioner**  
Chai Feldblum is a national expert in disability law and employment. She
led the drafting and negotiating of the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990 and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. As a law professor at
Georgetown University Law Center, she and her students represented
non-profit organizations, including disability rights organizations, in
advocating for legislation and administrative regulations to support
social justice goals. Chai served as a Commissioner of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission during the Obama-Biden Administration,
where she spearheaded the issuance of regulations under Section 501 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Those regulations established a goal of
12% representation in the federal workforce of people with all
disabilities and a 2% representation of people with significant
disabilities. The latter group includes people with the type of
disabilities hired under the AbilityOne program. Chai is a lesbian and
has a psychiatric disability of anxiety disorder.
