title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Evacuation Mission in Kabul
---
 
This morning, I met with my national security team in Washington and my
commanders in the field. We discussed the strike that U.S. forces took
last night against the terrorist group ISIS-K in Afghanistan. I said we
would go after the group responsible for the attack on our troops and
innocent civilians in Kabul, and we have. This strike was not the last.
We will continue to hunt down any person involved in that heinous attack
and make them pay. Whenever anyone seeks to harm the United States or
attack our troops, we will respond. That will never be in doubt. I
thanked General McKenzie for his leadership of that mission, and for his
commitment to the safety of our troops in Afghanistan.

The situation on the ground continues to be extremely dangerous, and the
threat of terrorist attacks on the airport remains high. Our commanders
informed me that an attack is highly likely in the next 24-36 hours. I
directed them to take every possible measure to prioritize force
protection, and ensured that they have all the authorities, resources
and plans to protect our men and women on the ground. They assured me
that they did, and that they could take these measures while completing
the mission and safely retrograding our personnel.

Despite the treacherous situation in Kabul, we are continuing to
evacuate civilians. Yesterday, we brought out another 6,800 people,
including hundreds of Americans. And today, we discussed the ongoing
preparations to help people continue to leave Afghanistan after our
military departs.

The 13 service members that we lost were heroes who made the ultimate
sacrifice in service of our highest American ideals and while saving the
lives of others. Their bravery and selflessness has enabled more than
117,000 people at risk to reach safety thus far. May God protect our
troops and all those standing watch in these dangerous days.
