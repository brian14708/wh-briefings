  s Independence\_Day"

On this day, August 15, 1947, India achieved its long journey toward
independence, guided by Mahatma Gandhi’s message of truth and
non-violence. Today, that foundational commitment to respecting the will
of the people through democracy continues to inspire the world and is
the basis of the special bond between our two nations. Over the decades,
the ties between our people, including a vibrant community of more than
four million Indian-Americans, have sustained and strengthened our
partnership.

This past year, our nations have come together in new ways as we tackle
the COVID-19 pandemic, including working in partnership with Japan and
Australia—through the Quad—to expand global manufacturing of safe and
effective COVID-19 vaccines and to strengthen our “last-mile”
coordination to reach people throughout the Indo-Pacific. In this moment
of great challenges and opportunities, the partnership between India and
the United States is more important than ever. Together, we must show
the world that our two great and diverse democracies can deliver for
people everywhere. And as we do, the friendship between our nations will
continue to flourish and grow. I wish all those celebrating today, in
India, in the United States, and throughout the world, a safe and happy
Indian Independence Day.
