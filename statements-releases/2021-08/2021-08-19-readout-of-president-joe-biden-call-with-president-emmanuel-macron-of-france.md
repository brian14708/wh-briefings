President Joe Biden and President Emmanuel Macron of France spoke today
about developments in Afghanistan. They lauded the tireless efforts of
their personnel working closely together in Kabul on the evacuation of
their citizens, the brave Afghans who have stood by us and our NATO
partners, and other vulnerable Afghan nationals. They underscored the
importance of continued close coordination among allies and democratic
partners on Afghanistan, including through multilateral fora, on the
provision of humanitarian assistance and support for refugees. They
welcomed the virtual G7 leadersâ€™ meeting next week to help coordinate
these efforts and discuss a common approach.
