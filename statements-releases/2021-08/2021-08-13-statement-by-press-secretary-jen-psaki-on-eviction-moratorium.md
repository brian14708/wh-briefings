title: Statement by Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Eviction Moratorium
---
 
Throughout the pandemic, preventing evictions and keeping people in
their homes has been a proven way of slowing the spread of COVID-19.

The Administration believes that CDC’s new moratorium is a proper use of
its lawful authority to protect the public health. We are pleased that
the district court left the moratorium in place, though we are aware
that further proceedings in this case are likely.

The President continues to call on State and local elected officials and
judges to issue local eviction moratoriums and move aggressively to
distribute the $46.5 billion in emergency rental assistance funds that
are available through the bipartisan COVID relief act that Congress
passed in December 2020, and through the President’s American Rescue
Plan that was enacted in March 2021. And, the President calls on
landlords to seek out rental assistance and not evict tenants from their
homes, and echoes Attorney General Garland’s calls for state and local
courts to implement policies to discourage eviction filings until
landlords and tenants have sought emergency rental assistance funds.
