title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Shooting at Michigan State\_University"
---
 
Jill and I are praying for the three students killed and the five
students fighting for their lives after last night’s shooting at
Michigan State University. Our hearts are with these young victims and
their families, the broader East Lansing and Lansing communities, and
all Americans across the country grieving as the result of gun violence.

Last night, I spoke to Governor Whitmer and directed the deployment of
all necessary federal law enforcement to support local and state
response efforts. I assured her that we would continue to provide the
resources and support needed in the weeks ahead.

Too many American communities have been devastated by gun violence. I
have taken action to combat this epidemic in America, including a
historic number of executive actions and the first significant gun
safety law in nearly 30 years, but we must do more.

The fact that this shooting took place the night before this country
marks five years since the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas
High School in Parkland, Florida, should cause every American to exclaim
“enough” and demand that Congress take action.

As I said in my State of the Union address last week, Congress must do
something and enact commonsense gun law reforms, including requiring
background checks on all gun sales, banning assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines, closing loopholes in our background check
system, requiring safe storage of guns, and eliminating immunity for gun
manufacturers who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets. Action is
what we owe to those grieving today in Michigan and across America.
