  of\_Governors"

Today, President Biden announced his intent to appoint Indiana Governor
Eric J. Holcomb and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to the
Council of Governors for two-year terms. The Council of Governors is
comprised of 10 bipartisan Governors from across the country and serves
as the lead forum to increase coordination around preparedness,
resilience, and response between the Federal government and state
governments, and strengthen the Federal-State partnership that’s
critical to protecting our nation from threats to our homeland security.
The Council of Governors serves as the lead forum for communication and
collaboration between the States and the Federal government on homeland
defense, civil support, synchronization and integration of State and
Federal military activities in the United States, and matters of mutual
interest pertaining to the National Guard. This year, the Council of
Governors will for the first-time discuss supply chain resiliency and
Federal-State cooperation to mitigate risks to defense critical
infrastructure.  
   
The Council includes leaders across the Federal government: the
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant
to the President for Homeland Security, the Deputy Assistant to the
President for Intergovernmental Affairs, Chief of the National Guard
Bureau, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and
Hemispheric Affairs, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and the
Commander of U.S. Northern Command. Other key Federal officials such as
the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are
regular participants.  
   
Governors Holcomb and Lujan Grisham will replace Oregon Governor Kate
Brown and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee who completed their terms on the
Council of Governors.  
   
Governors Holcomb and Lujan Grisham will join eight members of the
Council of Governors who were appointed by the President in July 2021.

Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards

**Governor Eric J. Holcomb**  
Eric J. Holcomb currently serves as the 51st Governor of the State of
Indiana. Elected by his fellow Hoosiers to a second term in 2020, he
received the most votes for governor in Indiana history. Under Holcomb’s
leadership, Indiana’s economy is strong, the state’s finances are
honestly balanced, and the state is streamlining government services and
returning dollars to Hoosier taxpayers, while simultaneously delivering
significant investments and advancements in infrastructure, education,
workforce, quality of life, and public health. During Holcomb’s terms,
Indiana employees and employers are enjoying consecutive record-breaking
years of job commitments. Holcomb serves on the Executive Committee of
the Republican Governors Association and previously served as its policy
chairman. In 2018, The Hill named him one of 10 governors shaping the
future of politics.  
   
He is a graduate of Pike High School in Indianapolis and Hanover College
in southeastern Indiana. Prior to his election as Governor in 2016,
following an unprecedented 106-day campaign, Holcomb served as Indiana’s
51st Lieutenant Governor.  
   
**Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham**  
Michelle Lujan Grisham currently serves as the thirty-second governor of
the state of New Mexico, the first Democratic Hispanic woman to be
elected governor in U.S. history. Under Lujan Grisham’s leadership, New
Mexico has implemented a series of evidence-based policies aimed at
transforming New Mexico’s public education system, expanding the state’s
economy to include more high-quality employment opportunities, and
preserving New Mexico’s air, land, and water. Lujan Grisham is building
a comprehensive cradle-to-career education system, expanding cost-free
child care to more New Mexico families than ever before and
establishing the most expansive free college program in the country. She
has prioritized economic diversification, leading the state’s booming
film and television industry to record-breaking growth and bringing the
state’s unemployment rate to a fifteen-year low. Prior to serving as
governor, Lujan Grisham served three terms in Congress representing New
Mexico’s 1<sup>st</sup> Congressional District.  
   
Lujan Grisham is a graduate of St. Michael’s High School in Santa Fe and
the University of New Mexico where she received her undergraduate and
law degrees.  
  
**About the Council of Governors:**  
The Council of Governors was authorized in 2008 by the National Defense
Authorization Act and formally established by then-President Obama’s
Executive Order 13528 issued on January 11, 2010. The Council focuses on
matters of homeland security; homeland defense; civil support;
synchronization and integration of state and Federal military activities
in the United States; and other matters of mutual interest, including
those involving the National Guard. Federal-State cooperation is
critical to protecting communities given the evolving challenges and
threats facing our country, which range from extreme weather to domestic
and international terrorism to a global pandemic.
