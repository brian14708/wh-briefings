Today, President Biden announced that Stephen Benjamin will serve as
Senior Advisor and Director of the Office of Public Engagement. In this
role, Benjamin will oversee the White House Office of Public Engagement,
which works at the local, state, and national levels to ensure community
leaders, diverse perspectives, and new voices have the opportunity to
inform the work of the President in an inclusive, transparent and
responsible way.

Statement from President Biden: “Mayor Benjamin is a longtime public
servant, who has served the people of South Carolina for over two
decades statewide and as a three-term mayor of Columbia. As a former
President of both the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the African American
Mayors Association, Steve’s deep relationships with communities across
the country will serve our Administration and the American public well.

As mayor of Columbia, Steve focused on the economic development of Main
Street, job creation and maintaining a just, diverse, and trusted law
enforcement department. He understands what Americans across the country
expect and deserve from their government.

Under Keisha’s leadership, the Office of Public Engagement has kept
equity at the heart of our agenda, and continues to serve as the
connective tissue between our Administration and everyday Americans who
may not have a voice to reach Washington otherwise. I have leaned on
Keisha as a close advisor with exceptional instincts, and I am grateful
to her for serving our nation with honor and integrity. I wish her the
best as she returns home to Atlanta to be with her family.”
