*Made in America Policies and New Technical Standards Support the Future
of the Electric Vehicle Charging Industry,   
  
Public and Private Actions Accelerate Buildout of National Network and
Catalyze Manufacturing Boom *

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced its latest set of
actions aimed at creating a convenient, reliable and Made-in-America
electric vehicle (EV) charging network so that the great American road
trip can be electrified.  These steps will help the United States meet
President Biden’s ambitious goals to confront the climate crisis, by
building a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers along
America’s highways and in our communities and have EVs make up at least
50% of new car sales by 2030, all while advancing an industrial strategy
to continue to build-out the domestic EV and EV charging industry. The
path to net-zero emissions by 2050 is creating good-paying manufacturing
and installation jobs on the way.   

President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion in
EV charging, $10 billion in clean transportation, and over $7 billion in
EV battery components, critical minerals, and materials. These flagship
programs complement the Inflation Reduction Act’s landmark support for
advanced batteries and new and expanded  tax credits for purchases of
EVs and to support installations of charging infrastructure, as well as
dozens of other federal initiatives designed to drive domestic
manufacturing and build a national network of EV charging. The result is
that the future of American transportation is on track to be cleaner,
safer, more affordable, and more reliable than ever before. Today’s
announcements are a further demonstration of the President’s successful
industrial strategy, ensuring that the clean energy transition is
powered by American manufacturing and good-paying union jobs. 

Because of President Biden’s leadership and record federal investment,
EV sales have tripled and the number of publicly available charging
ports has grown by at least 40% since he took office. There are now more
than three million EVs on the road and over 130,000 public chargers
across the country. Further accelerating the buildout of a convenient,
reliable charging network is critically important to make electric
vehicle charging a seamless experience. Today, companies including
Tesla, General Motors, EVgo, Pilot, Hertz and bp, among others, are
announcing new commitments to expand their networks by thousands of
public charging ports in the next two years, using private funds to
complement federal dollars and putting the nation’s EV charging goals
even closer within reach.  

**Today’s actions include:**

-   The Department of Transportation, in partnership with the Department
    of Energy, finalized new standards to make charging EVs convenient
    and reliable for all Americans, including when driving long
    distances. The new standards will ensure everyone can use the
    network – no matter what car you drive or which state you charge in.
    The standards also require strong workforce standards;
-   The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) outlined its final plan
    for compliance with the Build America, Buy America Act for federally
    funded EV chargers.  Effective immediately, all EV chargers funded
    through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law must be built in the
    United States. The plan requires that, effective immediately, final
    assembly and all manufacturing processes for any iron or steel
    charger enclosures or housing occur in the United States.  By July
    2024, at least 55 percent of the cost of all components will need to
    be manufactured domestically as well;
-   The new Joint Office of Energy and Transportation released a notice
    of intent to issue a funding opportunity for its Ride and Drive
    Electric research and development program. This program will advance
    the goal of building a national network of EV chargers for all
    Americans by supporting EV charging reliability, resiliency, equity,
    and workforce development;
-   The Department of Energy today announced $7.4 million in funding for
    seven projects to develop innovative medium-and heavy-duty EV
    charging and hydrogen corridor infrastructure plans serving millions
    of Americans across 23 states;
-   FHWA announced details for its soon-to-launch Charging and Fueling
    Infrastructure (CFI) discretionary grant program. The program will
    make available more than $2.5 billion over five years – including
    $700 million in funding through the first round of funding available
    to states, localities, Tribes, territories, and public authorities –
    to deploy publicly accessible charging and alternative fueling
    infrastructure in communities across the country, including at
    schools, grocery stores, parks, libraries, apartment complexes, and
    everywhere else Americans live and work; and,
-   The Administration highlighted major manufacturing and other new
    facilities spurred by these investments and the Biden-Harris
    Administration’s Made in America policies, including new commitments
    from domestic EV charging manufacturers and network operators.

These announcements build on the well over $100 billion that the private
sector has invested in electric vehicle, battery, and EV charging
manufacturing in the United States to date. Today’s announcements are
evidence of the President’s successful industrial strategy, ensuring
that federal funds are attracting private investment to ensure the clean
energy transition is powered by American manufacturing and good-paying
union jobs. Combined with investments in battery manufacturing and tax
credits for electric vehicle purchases and charging infrastructure
driven by the Inflation Reduction Act, these programs are key to
achieving the Administration’s climate goals.

**ACCESSIBLE, RELIABLE, CONVENIENT, USER-FRIENDLY EV CHARGING NETWORK*  
***  
To ensure ready access to charging and spur good manufacturing jobs at
home, President Biden has publicly committed to building out a
convenient, reliable, and user-friendly national network of 500,000 EV
chargers by 2030.  In support of this vision, the Department of
Transportation announced the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
program (NEVI), a $5 billion initiative to create a coast-to-coast
network of electric vehicle chargers focused on major highways that
support the majority of long-distance trips.  This national network will
give drivers confidence they can always find a place to charge, jump
start private investment in charging infrastructure and electric
vehicles, and support the President’s goal of at least 50% of vehicle
sales to be electric by 2030.

Today, FHWA, with support from the Joint Office, unveiled new national
standards for federally funded EV chargers, including NEVI-funded
chargers. All 50 states, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico are
participating in the NEVI program and initial investments will electrify
over 75,000 miles of the national highway system. These standards will
direct federal dollars to build out a national EV charging network that
is user-friendly, reliable, and accessible so that charging is as easy
as filling up at a gas station. Until now, there were no comprehensive
standards for the installation, operation, or maintenance of EV charging
stations, and disparities exist among EV charging stations in key areas,
such as connector types, payment methods, data privacy, speed and power
of chargers, reliability, and the overall user experience. A [recent
survey of EV
users](https://pluginamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-PIA-Survey-Report.pdf)
reported frustration with chargers that are too slow, too crowded, or
that just don’t work. Under FHWA’s new standards, we are fixing this.
The standards will ensure that:

-   **Charging is a predictable and reliable experience**, by ensuring
    that there are consistent plug types, power levels, and a minimum
    number of chargers capable of supporting drivers’ fast charging
    needs;
-   **Chargers are working when drivers need them to**, by requiring a
    97 percent uptime reliability requirement;
-   **Drivers can easily find a charger when they need to,** by
    providing publicly accessible data on locations, price,
    availability, and accessibility through mapping applications;
-   **Drivers do not have to use multiple apps and accounts to charge**,
    by requiring that a single method of identification works across all
    chargers; and,
-   **Chargers will support drivers’ needs well into the future,** by
    requiring compatibility with forward-looking capabilities like Plug
    and Charge.

The standards will also help to ensure that these historic investments
in EV charging create good-paying jobs and that EV chargers are
well-serviced by requiring strong workforce standards such as Registered
Apprenticeships and the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program
(EVITP). Through the White House Talent Pipeline Challenge,
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) has certified
20,000 electricians through EVITP.

Together, the standards will ensure that chargers operated by different
networks operate similarly and provide the traveling public with a
predictable EV charging experience – no matter what car you drive or
what state you charge in.

**ACCELERATING THE BUILDOUT OF EV CHARGING NETWORKS*  
***  
The Biden-Harris Administration’s actions on EVs have spurred network
operators to accelerate the buildout of coast-to-coast EV charging
networks. Public dollars will supplement private investment by filling
gaps, serving rural and hard to reach locations, and building capacity
in communities. Announcements being spotlighted today will add more than
100,000 public chargers available for all EVs, and include:

-   **Tesla,** for the first time, will open a portion of its U.S.
    Supercharger and Destination Charger network to non-Tesla EVs,
    making at least 7,500 chargers available for all EVs by the end
    of 2024. The open chargers will be distributed across the United
    States. They will include at least 3,500 new and existing 250 kW
    Superchargers along highway corridors to expand freedom of travel
    for all EVs, and Level 2 Destination Charging at locations like
    hotels and restaurants in urban and rural locations.  All EV drivers
    will be able to access these stations using the Tesla app or
    website. Additionally, Tesla will more than double its full
    nationwide network of Superchargers, manufactured in Buffalo, New
    York.
-   **Hertz and bp **are announcing their intention to build out a
    national network of EV fast charging infrastructure to accelerate
    the adoption of electric vehicles.  Hertz and bp intend to bring
    charging infrastructure to Hertz locations across America, including
    major cities such as Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver,
    Houston, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Phoenix, San Francisco, and
    Washington, DC. The charging hubs will serve rideshare and taxi
    drivers, car rental customers and the general public at high-demand
    locations, such as airports. A number of installations are expected
    to include large-scale charging hubs, known as “gigahubs.” bp aims
    to invest $1 billion in EV charging in the US by 2030. Hertz’s
    objective is to make one-quarter of its fleet electric by the end of
    2024.
-   **Pilot Company, General Motors, and EVgo** have partnered to build
    a coast-to-coast network of 2,000 high power 350 kW fast chargers at

**AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE FUTURE THAT IS MADE IN AMERICA*  
***  
The Build America, Buy America implementation plan for EV charging
equipment reflects the success of the Biden-Harris Administration at
spurring new domestic investments in the manufacture of EV fast-charging
equipment.  The rapidly-expanding industry is ramping up production to
make high-quality, Buy America compliant chargers, creating good jobs
and helping the Unites States strengthen its leadership in clean energy
manufacturing.  That strategy will ensure that electric vehicle chargers
purchased through the NEVI program will be assembled in the United
States, effective immediately, and fully compliant with Build America,
Buy America requirements for manufactured products by July 1, 2024 to
support investments in the supply chain consistent with an aggressive
expansion of domestic manufacturing.

Today’s announcement is a tool to promote domestic production. The Build
America, Buy America requirements for EV charging equipment will help
revitalize our manufacturing base. The phased approach to these
requirements will incentivize companies to invest in domestic production
of EV charging components, positioning U.S. workers and businesses to
compete and lead globally while providing a transition period for
companies to onshore their supply chains.  In order to meet the
requirements of the Build America, Buy America Act, domestic
manufacturing is ramping up aggressively.  The Office of Management and
Budget’s new Made in America Office is working with agency experts,
labor and industry to implement industrial strategy by incentivizing
greater U.S. manufacturing in key sectors.

-   Domestic assembly requirements for electric vehicle charging
    equipment will be effective immediately. This ensures that all
    electric vehicle charging equipment supported by federal funds
    supports American jobs and American technological leadership.
-   FHWA’s Buy America requirements will be effective immediately for EV
    charger enclosures and housing predominantly of steel or iron.  This
    means that all manufacturing processes for these enclosures, from
    melting and pouring through the final application of coatings, must
    occur in the United States. 
-   Beginning July 1, 2024, FHWA will require that the cost of
    components manufactured domestically for EV charging equipment must
    meet the Build America, Buy America Act’s requirement of at least 55
    percent domestic content for manufactured products, consistent with
    an ambitious build out of this new industry.
-   In order to ensure that chargers installed during the bulk of the
    NEVI program are fully compliant with the requirement under the
    Build America, Buy America Act of 55 percent domestic content, any
    equipment that does not meet that standard must be installed no
    later than October 1, 2024.

Federal agencies and states are standing up processes to implement and
track Made in America requirements to ensure that federally-funded
infrastructure projects use American-made iron, steel, construction
materials, and manufactured products. Our success in creating an EV
charging equipment industry nearly from scratch demonstrates what Made
in America policies can do to build a manufacturing base.

**MANUFACTURING BOOM*  
***  
The Biden economic agenda has ignited a manufacturing boom.  Made in
America requirements have already sent a strong signal to the market
that federal dollars will be spent on products that are produced and
sourced in the United States – and industry has responded. Since the
President took office, companies have announced more than $100 billion
in manufacturing investments for EVs, batteries and chargers.

A recent report found that private sector investment in EVs and related
infrastructure in the United States is now surpassing China and other
nations for the first time. Three years ago, there was little American
footprint in the advanced EV charging industry. Now, producers are
making investments to establish new headquarters, facilities, or
production lines to build the next generation of EV chargers in the
United States. For six of these companies, these investments represent
their first U.S. manufacturing footprint.
