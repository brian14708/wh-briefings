title: "President\_Biden Nominates Julie Su for Secretary of the Department of\_Labor"
---
 
Today, President Biden announced his intent to nominate Julie Su to
serve as Secretary of the Department of Labor. Julie is a tested and
experienced leader, who will continue to build a stronger, more
resilient, and more inclusive economy that provides Americans a fair
return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.  
   
“It is my honor to nominate Julie Su to be our country’s next Secretary
of Labor. Julie has spent her life fighting to make sure that everyone
has a fair shot, that no community is overlooked, and that no worker is
left behind. Over several decades, Julie has led the largest state labor
department in the nation, cracked down on wage theft, fought to protect
trafficked workers, increased the minimum wage, created good-paying,
high-quality jobs, and established and enforced workplace safety
standards.  
   
Julie is a champion for workers, and she has been a critical partner to
Secretary Walsh since the early days of my Administration. She helped
avert a national rail shutdown, improved access to good jobs free from
discrimination through my Good Jobs Initiative, and is ensuring that the
jobs we create in critical sectors like semiconductor manufacturing,
broadband and healthcare are good-paying, stable and accessible jobs for
all.  
   
I look forward to continuing to work with Julie to build an economy that
works for working people, and I respectfully ask the Senate to take up
this nomination quickly so that we can finish the job for America’s
workers.”  
   
**Julie Su, Secretary of Labor**  
   
Julie Su has spent her career fighting for workers, and currently serves
as the Deputy Secretary of Labor, a position she has held since her July
2021 Senate confirmation. As Deputy Secretary, Su has worked side by
side with Secretary Walsh to advance President Biden’s vision of a
strong, resilient, inclusive economy with worker well-being at its
center.   
   
Previously, Su was the Labor Secretary for the State of California where
she worked closely with unions and employers to build high road training
partnerships to connect people—often those left out of prosperity—to
good, union jobs. Su began her life in government service as the
California Labor Commissioner where she launched the “Wage Theft is a
Crime” campaign with the support of both labor and management. Su spent
17 years as a civil rights attorney representing workers who are often
invisible, including 72 Thai garment workers who were trafficked into
the US and forced to work behind barbed wire and under armed guard. Her
work earned her a MacArthur “genius” award.  
   
Su is a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School. She is
the daughter of immigrants, speaks Mandarin and Spanish, and she has 2
daughters, LiMei and AnLing, who are both in college.
