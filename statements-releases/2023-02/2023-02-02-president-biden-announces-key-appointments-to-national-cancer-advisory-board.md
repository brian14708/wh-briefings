  Board"

WASHINGTON – Today, President Biden announced his intent to appoint six
members to the National Cancer Advisory Board, which plays an important
role in guiding the Director of the National Cancer Institute in setting
the course for the national cancer research program. The National Cancer
Advisory Board will complement the Cancer Moonshot, which President
Biden reignited a year ago to end cancer as we know it today – including
by making sure his Administration is investing in research and
development that will help advance breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and
treat diseases like cancer.

The Latino Cancer Institute, Duron is nationally recognized as an
influential patient advocate leader dedicated to building community
knowledge and capacity to respond to the cancer challenge. She works to
amplify Latino voices around issues of cancer; collaborate in research

**Fred K. Tabung, Member, National Cancer Advisory Board**

Fred K. Tabung is an Assistant Professor at the Ohio State University
College of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, where he conducts a
research program aiming to advance our understanding of how diet-related
metabolic dysregulation impacts cancer risk and treatment response and
to translate this knowledge into heathier eating and therapeutic diets.
He is pioneering innovative approaches to studying the role of diet in
cancer, some of which includes integration of the metabolic properties
of specific foods beyond their caloric content. Tabung’s life
experiences growing up and working in Africa strongly influenced his
focus on diet and nutrition as a key determinant of health and disease,
especially cancer. After obtaining his undergraduate degree in medical
laboratory science, Tabung worked in the pathology laboratory of a
reference hospital in Yaounde, Cameroon, helping to diagnose cancer,
while also volunteering time to help start a population-based cancer
registry for the city. Convinced that effective cancer prevention
methods were sorely needed, Tabung pursued graduate-level education in
nutrition and cancer epidemiologic research under the Fulbright
Scholarship Program, where he focused upon the study, elucidation, and
development of novel dietary pattern research methods.

Tabung’s work as a researcher has been recognized with multiple awards,
including the Breakthrough Graduate Scholar Award and the Doctoral
Achievement Award at the University of South Carolina in recognition of
outstanding graduate school accomplishments. Most recently, he was named
an American Cancer Society Research Scholar. Tabung was also appointed
to serve in the Mechanisms Expert Committee advising the World Cancer
Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research on potential
biological mechanisms underlying the role of diet in cancer risk and
prognosis, for their Global Cancer Update Program.
