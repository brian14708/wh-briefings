title: "FACT SHEET: The Congressional Republican Agenda: Repealing the Affordable\
  \ Care Act and Slashing\_Medicaid"
---
 
Speaker McCarthy and congressional Republicans have [committed to
balance the
budget](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-15/republicans-balanced-budget-aim-clashes-with-fiscal-realities)
while adding [$3 trillion or
more](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-the-congressional-republican-agenda-to-increase-the-debt-by-over-3-trillion/)
to the deficit through tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and large
corporations. As a matter of simple math, that requires [trillions in
program
cuts](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/what-would-it-take-balance-budget).
Congressional Republicans have yet to disclose to the American people
where these cuts will come from. But past Republican
[legislation](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R44883.pdf),
[budgets](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/house-gop-budget-retains-tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy-proposes-deep-program),
and
[litigation](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20210617.665248/),
along with recent
[statements](https://www.axios.com/2023/01/13/debt-ceiling-fight-medicare-medicaid),
[proposals](https://rescueamerica.com/12-point-plan/), and
[budget](https://banks.house.gov/uploadedfiles/rsc_2023_budget_final_version.pdf)[plans](https://americarenewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Budget-Center-for-Renewing-America-FY23.pdf),
provide clear evidence that health care will be on the chopping block
for severe cuts.  
  
***Virtually every Republican budget or fiscal plan over the last decade
has included repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and deep cuts to
Medicaid.*** That would mean: higher health care costs for tens of
millions of Americans; ending critical protections for people with
pre-existing conditions; millions of people losing health coverage and
care; and threats to health care for seniors and people with
disabilities, including growing home care waiting lists and worse
nursing home care.  
  
The American people deserve to see congressional Republicans’ full and
detailed budget plan, including what it cuts from the ACA and Medicaid,
Social Security and Medicare, and other critical programs, and should
have the chance to compare it with the President’s budget plan, which he
will release March 9.  
  
**If Republicans are successful in repealing the Affordable Care Act and
making deep cuts to Medicaid:**  
  
**Millions of Americans Will Have Higher Health Care Costs**

-   **More than 100 million people** **with pre-existing health
    conditions could lose critical protections.** Before the ACA, [more
    than 100 million
    Americans](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/255396/Pre-ExistingConditions.pdf)
    with pre-existing health conditions could have been denied coverage
    or charged more if they tried to buy individual market health
    insurance. Republican repeal proposals either eliminate these
    protections outright or find
    [other](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cassidy-graham-plan-undercuts-gops-promise-to-protect-health-coverage-for-preexisting-conditions/2017/09/22/50458db2-9fa6-11e7-9083-fbfddf6804c2_story.html)
    [ways](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/cbo-analysis-refutes-ryan-claims-that-house-health-bill-maintains-protections-for)
    to gut them.
-   **Up to 24 million people could lose protection against catastrophic
    medical bills.** Before the ACA, insurance plans were not required
    to limit enrollees’ total costs, and [almost one in
    five](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/usc-brookings-schaeffer-on-health-policy/2017/01/17/health-insurance-as-assurance-the-importance-of-keeping-the-acas-limits-on-enrollee-health-costs/)
    people with employer coverage had no limit on out-of-pocket costs,
    meaning they were exposed to tens of thousands of dollars in medical
    bills if they became seriously ill.
-   **Tens of millions of people** **could be at risk of lifetime
    benefit caps.** Prior to the ACA, [105 million
    Americans](https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/under-affordable-care-act-105-million-americans-no-longer-face-lifetime-limits-health-benefits),
    mostly people with employer coverage, had a lifetime limit on their
    health insurance benefits, and every year up to [20,000
    people](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/increasing-transparency02162012a)
    hit that cap and saw their benefits exhausted just when they needed
    them most.
-   **Millions of people** **could lose free preventive care.** The ACA
    requires private health insurers to cover [preventive
    services](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/786fa55a84e7e3833961933124d70dd2/preventive-services-ib-2022.pdf),
    like cancer screenings, cholesterol tests, annual check-ups, and
    contraceptive services, at no cost. Before these requirements were
    in place, millions of Americans with health insurance faced cost
    sharing – sometimes high costs – for these services, which is part
    of why the ACA resulted in [increased
    use](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/preventive-services-covered-by-private-health-plans/)
    of critical preventive care.
-   **Over $1,000** **average increase in medical debt for millions
    covered through Medicaid expansion.** Repealing the ACA, in
    particular the expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults, would
    reverse major gains in financial security. Within the first two
    years of the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid, medical debt sent to
    collection agencies dropped by [$3.4
    billion](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24002/w24002.pdf),
    and there were 50,000 fewer medical bankruptcies. Among people
    gaining coverage through expansion, medical debt fell by an average
    of [over $1,000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30393411/).
    Expansion states also saw [significant
    drops](https://www.cbpp.org/evictions-fell-sharply-in-medicaid-expansion-states-0)
    in evictions compared to non-expansion states.
-   **Tens of millions of people** **could see their prescription drug
    coverage scaled back.** Prescription drug coverage is an optional
    benefit under Medicaid. If states faced large cuts to their federal
    Medicaid funding, millions of Medicaid enrollees could see their
    coverage scaled back or have a harder time getting their
    prescriptions because of extra red tape.

**Millions of Americans Will Lose Their Health Insurance**

-   **40 million people’s health insurance coverage would be at risk.**
    Over [16
    million](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2023-open-enrollment-period-report-final-national-snapshot)
    people have signed up for ACA marketplace coverage for 2023, over
    [22
    million](https://data.medicaid.gov/dataset/6c114b2c-cb83-559b-832f-4d8b06d6c1b9/data?conditions%5b0%5d%5bresource%5d=t&conditions%5b0%5d%5bproperty%5d=enrollment_month&conditions%5b0%5d%5bvalue%5d%5b0%5d=1&conditions%5b0%5d%5bvalue%5d%5b1%5d=2&conditions%5b0%5d%5bvalue%5d%5b2%5d=3&conditions%5b0%5d%5boperator%5d=in&conditions%5b1%5d%5bresource%5d=t&conditions%5b1%5d%5bproperty%5d=enrollment_year&conditions%5b1%5d%5bvalue%5d=2022&conditions%5b1%5d%5boperator%5d==)
    people are enrolled in Medicaid expansion coverage available due to
    the ACA, and another [1
    million](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2023-open-enrollment-period-report-final-national-snapshot)
    people have coverage through the ACA’s Basic Health Program. The
    total number of people with some form of ACA coverage has risen
    significantly since 2017, when the Congressional Budget Office
    [estimated](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52752) the House-passed
    repeal bill would grow the ranks of the uninsured by 23 million.
-   **An**
    [**additional**](https://data.medicaid.gov/dataset/6c114b2c-cb83-559b-832f-4d8b06d6c1b9/data?conditions%5b0%5d%5bresource%5d=t&conditions%5b0%5d%5bproperty%5d=enrollment_month&conditions%5b0%5d%5bvalue%5d%5b0%5d=1&conditions%5b0%5d%5bvalue%5d%5b1%5d=2&conditions%5b0%5d%5bvalue%5d%5b2%5d=3&conditions%5b0%5d%5boperator%5d=in&conditions%5b1%5d%5bresource%5d=t&conditions%5b1%5d%5bproperty%5d=enrollment_year&conditions%5b1%5d%5bvalue%5d=2022&conditions%5b1%5d%5boperator%5d==)
    **69 million people with Medicaid could lose critical services, or
    could even lose coverage altogether.** Slashing federal funding for
    Medicaid would force states to make Medicaid eligibility changes
    that would make it harder to qualify for and enroll in Medicaid
    coverage. States would also likely consider capping or limiting
    enrollment, cut critical services, and cut payments rates, making it
    harder for people with Medicaid to access care.
-   **Thousands more preventable deaths** **each year.** The ACA
    Medicaid expansion is preventing thousands of premature deaths among
    older adults each year, [research
    finds](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/3/1783/6124639),
    likely because it [improves access to
    care](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/report/the-effects-of-medicaid-expansion-under-the-aca-updated-findings-from-a-literature-review/),
    including medications to control chronic conditions and preventive
    care such as cancer screenings. ACA marketplace coverage also
    [prevents premature
    deaths](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/1/1/5911132).

**Worse Care for Seniors and People With Disabilities**

-   **Over** [**7
    million**](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-releases-first-ever-home-and-community-based-services-quality-measure-set)
    **seniors and people with disabilities** **could receive worse home
    care, with ballooning wait lists for those still in need.** The
    number of people on home care wait lists has dropped by 20 percent
    since 2018. This progress would likely be reversed under a block
    grant or per-capita cap because there would be fewer dollars
    available for home care services, an optional benefit in Medicaid.
    Faced with large federal funding cuts, states would almost certainly
    ration care. That would likely mean wait lists for home care in the
    [13
    states](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/a-look-at-waiting-lists-for-home-and-community-based-services-from-2016-to-2021/)
    and DC that don’t currently have them, and skyrocketing wait lists
    in 37 states that do.
-   **Hundreds of thousands of nursing home residents would be** **at
    risk of lower quality of care.** Over [60
    percent](https://www.macpac.gov/subtopic/nursing-facilities/) of
    nursing home residents are covered by Medicaid. With large cuts in
    federal funding, states would be forced to cut nursing home rates to
    manage their costs, as
    [many](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/trends-in-state-medicaid-programs-looking-back-and-looking-ahead/)
    states have done during recessions.
    [Research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet-protecting-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-by-improving-safety-and-quality-of-care-in-the-nations-nursing-homes/)
    shows that when nursing homes are paid less, residents get worse
    care.

**Millions of People Will Lose Access to Opioid Treatment and Mental
Health Care**

-   [**Millions**](https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/healthcare/313672-keep-obamacare-to-keep-progress-on-treating-opioid-disorders/)
    **of people** **could lose access to substance use treatment or
    mental health care.** Across the country, the ACA, especially its
    expansion of Medicaid, has dramatically expanded access to opioid
    treatment and other substance use disorder care, including
    [increases](https://www.kff.org/report-section/building-on-the-evidence-base-studies-on-the-effects-of-medicaid-expansion-february-2020-to-march-2021-report/)
    in medication assisted treatment prescriptions for opioid and other
    substance use treatment and [improved
    access](https://www.kff.org/report-section/the-effects-of-medicaid-expansion-under-the-aca-updated-findings-from-a-literature-review-report/)
    to mental health care.
-   [**34
    million**](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/national-medicaid-chip-program-information/downloads/october-2022-medicaid-chip-enrollment-trend-snapshot.pdf)
    **children** **at risk of losing guaranteed access to mental health
    care.** Past Republican plans proposed ending Medicaid’s guarantee
    of comprehensive health coverage for children. This would jeopardize
    children’s access to mental health care at a critical point in
    efforts to address the burgeoning youth mental health crisis. It
    would also cause children to go without other services, like annual
    check-ups and speech and physical therapy. And Republican proposals
    could endanger schools’ ability to bill Medicaid for mental health
    care, speech therapy, or physical therapy for students.

**Rural Hospitals Would Be Forced to Close**

-   **More of the over 500 rural hospitals at risk of closure could
    close.** The ACA, especially its expansion of Medicaid, helped cut
    hospital uncompensated care by [about $12
    billion](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/uncompensated-care-costs-fell-in-nearly-every-state-as-acas-major-coverage),
    helping hospitals, especially rural hospitals, stay afloat. Between
    2010 and 2021, nearly three-fourths of rural hospital closures were
    in states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion, with research
    finding that expansion [disproportionately improved rural hospital
    margins](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/affordable-care-acts-medicaid-expansion-benefits-hospitals-particularly-in-rural)
    and [helped
    avert](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0976)
    rural hospital closures. If the ACA is repealed, and millions lose
    coverage, closures among [at-risk
    hospitals](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/892-hospitals-at-risk-of-closure-state-by-state.html)
    could increase significantly.

Separate from all these quantifiable harms, Republican ACA and Medicaid
plans propose abrupt, unprecedented upheaval, with consequences for the
entire health care system. In 2017, [patient
groups](https://www.cff.org/press-releases/2017-09/sixteen-patient-and-provider-groups-oppose-graham-cassidy-bill),
[physicians](https://searchlf.ama-assn.org/undefined/documentDownload?uri=%2Funstructured%2Fbinary%2Fletter%2FLETTERS%2F2017-9-19-AMA-Letter-on-Graham-Cassidy-Amendment-Final.pdf),

[insurance

[health care
experts](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/20/jimmy-kimmel-bill-cassidy-obamacare-repeal-242932),
and [governors from both
parties](https://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/docs/Letters/Bipartisan-Governors-Letter-RE-Graham-Cassidy-9-19-17.pdf)
all expressed alarm that ACA repeals could have far-reaching
consequences for the stability of health insurance markets and
availability of affordable coverage and care.
