title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Earthquakes Impacting Turkiye and\_\
  Syria"
---
 
Jill and I were deeply saddened by the news of the devastating
earthquakes that have thus far claimed thousands of lives in Turkiye and
Syria. My Administration has been working closely with our NATO Ally
Turkiye, and I authorized an immediate U.S. response. Â At my direction,
senior American officials reached out immediately to their Turkish
counterparts to coordinate any and all needed assistance. Our teams are
deploying quickly to begin to support Turkish search and rescue efforts
and address the needs of those injured and displaced by the earthquake.
U.S.-supported humanitarian partners are also responding to the
destruction in Syria. Today, our hearts and our deepest condolences are
with all those who have lost precious loved ones, those who are injured,
and those who saw their homes and businesses destroyed.
