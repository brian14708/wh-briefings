title: "FACT SHEET: On One Year Anniversary of Reignited Cancer Moonshot, Biden-\u2060\
  Harris Administration Announces New Actions to End Cancer as We Know\_It"
---
 
One year ago, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden reignited
the Cancer Moonshot, setting an ambitious, achievable goal: to reduce
the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25
years, and improve the experience of people and families living with and
surviving cancer, ultimately [ending cancer as we know it
today](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-reignites-cancer-moonshot-to-end-cancer-as-we-know-it/).  
  
The Cancer Moonshot has spurred tremendous action across the federal
government and from the public and private sectors, building a strong
foundation for the work ahead. Today, the Administration is announcing
new actions from inside and outside of government that will drive
additional progress, drawing us closer to ending cancer as we know it
today.  
  
Last year, the President stood up the first-ever Cancer Cabinet to
mobilize the federal government, and called on individuals, health care
providers, and leaders across sectors to step up and take action in five
key priority areas: (1) close the screening gap, (2) understand and
address environmental exposure, (3) decrease the impact of preventable
cancers, (4) bring cutting-edge research through the pipeline to
patients and communities, and (5) support patients and caregivers.  
  
To date, the Cancer Moonshot has [announced over 25 new programs,
policies, and
resources](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cancermoonshot/fact-sheets/) to
address these five priority areas. The First Lady has traveled the
country and the world to hear from cancer patients and their loved ones,
as well as the researchers, physicians, nurses, and patient navigators
who support them – focusing on the importance of early detection and
improving the experience of patients, families, and caregivers. And, the
White House and Cancer Cabinet have held more than 50 community
conversations and events. More than 60 private companies, non-profits,
academic institutions, and patient groups have also stepped up with new
actions and collaborations.  
  
Today’s new actions will build on the work done in the first year of the
reignited Cancer Moonshot. In addition, today, the President is also
announcing his intent to appoint six members to the National Cancer
Advisory Board, which plays an important role in guiding the Director of
the NCI in setting the course for the national cancer research
program.  
  
**The Cancer Cabinet is taking the following new actions:**

-   **National Cancer Institute (NCI) is launching a first-of-its-kind,
    public-private partnership to bring clinical and patient navigation
    support to families facing childhood cancer. **The National Cancer
    Institute (NCI) is launching the Childhood Cancer – Data Integration
    for Research, Education, Care, and Clinical Trials (CC-DIRECT) to
    support children and Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) with cancer
    throughout their cancer journey; provide patient navigation support
    to families seeking information and optimal care; facilitate
    research participation; and establish a portable, shareable,
    standardized cancer health record. This means families facing
    childhood cancer can reach out for support and get connected to
    excellent care and the opportunity to participate in research
    through clinical trials and data sharing initiatives. This new
    entity represents a groundbreaking collaboration between NCI, the
    Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
    (ONC), Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (ACTO), American
    Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Cancer Society (ACS),
    the MITRE Corporation, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
    (CMS), Children’s Oncology Group (COG), and the American Association
    for Cancer Research (AACR).  
-   **Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is awarding
    $10 million to improve access to lifesaving cancer screenings and
    early detection including patient navigation support services**.
    HRSA, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS), is doubling its investment in new partnerships to bring
    community health centers together with NCI-Designated Cancer Centers
    to facilitate access to lifesaving cancer screenings and early
    detection services for underserved communities. Health centers that
    receive funding will conduct patient outreach in these communities
    to promote early detection of cancer, connect patients to screening
    services, and provide direct navigation assistance with accessing
    high quality cancer care and treatment, as needed. Today’s awards
    total more than $10 million for 22 HRSA-funded health centers,
    expanding on the $5 million awarded to 11 health centers in 2022  
     
-   **HHS is launching “CancerX,” a Public-Private Partnership developed
    as a national accelerator to boost innovation in the fight against
    cancer. **HHS, ONC and Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health
    (OASH), is launching the “CancerX” National Innovation Accelerator
    Initiative, a government wide effort to develop tools, such as
    digital solutions to improve cancer patient care coordination and
    communication, new software technology to help community
    organizations meet cancer patients where they are, or new platforms
    to support patients with their post-treatment care. This new
    public-private partnership will drive support for and accelerate the
    development of biotech and health tech startups solutions focused on
    the continuum of cancer care, including prevention, detection,
    treatment, and transitions in care. Organizations whose missions are
    aligned with the Cancer Moonshot goals will work together to surface
    innovative solutions and coordinate access to research, mentorship,
    resources, and other collaborative opportunities. This work will
    help startups scale their business and work toward creating
    ‘challenge-focused’ solutions for cancer with health equity in mind.
    This initiative will build on previous models deployed by successful
    HHS InnovationX program accelerators such as KidneyX and PandemicX.

**The public and private sector is stepping up with the following new
actions:**  
  
**Promoting Cancer Prevention**

-   **National Minority Quality Forum (NMQF) is launching local
    community-based activities to increase cancer screenings in at-risk
    communities. **NMQF, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that
    integrates data and expertise in support of initiatives to eliminate
    health disparities, is releasing a new online hub, which includes
    several interactive features designed to increase awareness about
    cancer disparities, innovation in early detection and treatment, and
    patient- and clinician-oriented resources to close gaps in cancer
    care delivery. In addition, to help spur action on the ground, the
    Cancer Stage Shifting Initiative, which was created to move from
    late stage to early- stage diagnosis and treatment of cancer,
    improving cancer care and reducing cancer deaths for all, will work
    together with private and public partners and local advocates to
    increase awareness of cancer risk and treatment, improve clinical
    trial diversity, and support efforts to understand the impact of the
    water crisis on cancer risk in Flint, Michigan.  
     
-   **Supergoop! is committing to donate SPF sunscreen to schools and
    communities across the country to encourage children to start
    protecting their skin at a young age. **Since sun exposure is
    cumulative throughout a person’s lifetime, Supergoop! is committing
    to providing the country’s youth the education and resources to keep
    them protected. Supergoop! is growing the “Ounce by Ounce Program”,
    designed to give SPF sunscreen to schools for free. So far,
    Supergoop! has donated more than 6,800 SPF sunscreen pumps to over
    1,900 classrooms and youth organizations and is dedicated to
    expanding this cancer prevention program.

**Supporting Patients and Caregivers through their Cancer Fight**

-   **American Cancer Society and the Richard M. Schulze Family
    Foundation launch $10 Million challenge grant to benefit five
    American Cancer Society Hope Lodges. **The American Cancer Society
    and the Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation (RMSFF) announced the
    launch of a $10 million challenge grant to benefit five American
    Cancer Society Hope Lodges – in Omaha, NE; Charleston, SC;
    Lexington, KY; Lubbock, TX; and Kansas City, MO. Funds raised
    through the RMSFF challenge grant will be used to establish $2
    million endowments at each of the five Hope Lodges to support
    ongoing maintenance of their physical facilities and operations and
    support physical improvements to those building.  
     
-   **Colorectal Cancer Alliance is launching BlueHQ, the
    first-of-its-kind comprehensive support hub for patients, survivors,
    and caregivers to navigate colorectal cancer.** BlueHQ is a free
    support service designed to help patients learn, connect, and take
    action to improve outcomes. The support hub includes features to
    suggest helpful information and resources that align with the
    patient’s profile; connects patients to allies with similar
    experiences, as well as a patient and family support navigator; and
    safely and securely stores appointments and notes or journal
    entries, which can be shared with caregivers and healthcare
    providers.  
     
-   **New coalition launches to address the obstacles rural patient
    communities face accessing care.** A broad national advocacy
    campaign is set to be launched, bringing together a diverse
    coalition of public-private partners to raise awareness and spur
    action to address the persistent, underlying issues that have caused
    rural America to fall behind in healthcare, technology, and
    infrastructure. The coalition includes Stupid Cancer, the American
    Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Prevent Cancer Foundation,
    Cervivor, National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, Cancer and
    Careers, Triage Cancer, Tigerlily Foundation and Fight Colorectal
    Cancer Patient Advocate Foundation. Underpinning these efforts will
    be a storytelling campaign led by OffScrip Health, a leading digital
    health media platform focused on patient engagement, health equity,
    and access to care, and FINN Partners, a global integrated marketing
    and communications agency that will tackle critical issues impacting
    rural communities’ health, such as access to care, broadband
    infrastructure, consumer goods, clean water, telehealth, and more.
    The series will also spotlight the new technologies, partnerships,
    and practices that can make a difference in addressing this crisis
    of care.

**Bringing Cancer Screening to More Communities**

-   **Prevent Cancer Foundation to launch “Early Detection = Better
    Outcomes” campaign to improve knowledge and completion of
    recommended cancer screenings**. The Prevent Cancer Foundation is
    launching a new signature campaign, “Early Detection = Better
    Outcomes,” to educate Americans on what recommended cancer
    screenings and cancer-related vaccinations they need and to
    encourage them to schedule appointments. Better Outcomes shares
    evidence-based resources, including screening options by age and
    information on vaccinations to prevent cancer, tools to find free
    and low-cost cancer screenings, and information on how family
    history can impact cancer risk. The campaign will address two
    additional barriers that Americans face — fear of screening
    examinations and lack of access — and introduce a new, interactive
    tool to deliver a personalized screening plan that can be shared
    with a health provider.  
     
-   **Siemens Healthineers is committing to address cancer screening
    disparities in underserved regions.** Siemens Healthineers is
    working to increase breast screening capabilities and capacity by
    providing a mobile mammography screening truck, as well as dedicated
    technologists to perform scans and artificial intelligence- (AI-)
    technology to help read 3D examinations in Pennsylvania and North
    Carolina. To date 680 free mammography screenings have been
    administered, in partnership with Penn Medicine and the Office of
    Children and Families Philadelphia in Southwest Philadelphia and
    WakeMed Health & Hospitals at Raleigh Medical Park. Expanding on the
    success of this program, Siemens Healthineers will be purchasing an
    additional mobile screening truck with the goal to partner on 10-12
    additional mobile screening events this year, reaching at least
    2,000 women in underserved areas, including urban and rural sites
    around the country.

**Driving Research Advances through Data Sharing and Clinical Trial
Expansion**

    American Society of Clinical Oncology, and Owkin, a French-American
    AI biotech company, launch an initiative to improve outcomes for
    people facing metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). They
    will use data from CancerLinQ Discovery®, a real-world oncology
    database of de-identified electronic health record (EHR) data from
    more than 6 million patients with cancer and blood diseases in the
    United States to identify possible predictive factors of why some
    patients with NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer, respond
    poorly to immunotherapy treatment. The goal is to use the data
    routinely collected at the point of care to learn how to better
    tailor treatments for patients with advanced NSCLC.  
     
-   **Hyundai Hope On Wheels awards nearly $15 million to accelerate
    pediatric cancer research and treatments. **Hyundai Hope On Wheels,
    a non-profit organization supported by Hyundai and its U.S. dealers,

    or metastasis. With this investment, Komen is now supporting more
    than 152 active research projects, representing more than $115
    million in funding. Additionally, Komen has expanded access and
    affordability for breast cancer screening and diagnosis by growing
    its screening and diagnostics program to 12 cities and providing
    no-cost breast cancer screening mammograms and diagnostic tests to
    individuals who meet income qualifications.

**Today’s announcements build on actions taken in the first year of the
reignited Cancer Moonshot:**

-   The Administration
    launched [WhiteHouse.gov/CancerMoonshot](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cancermoonshot/),
    where patients can share their stories of inspiration and hope,
    people can provide their ideas on how to make progress, and
    organization, companies, and institutions can commit new actions to
    help achieve Cancer Moonshot goals.
-   President Biden launched ARPA-H, a new agency to deliver new ways to
    prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other diseases, appointed its
    first-ever Director, and secured $2.5 billion in initial investment,
    including $1.5 billion in the Fiscal Year 2023 omnibus package.
-   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued more than $200
    million in grants as part of greater than $1 billion commitment to
    advance cancer prevention and control through cancer screening
    programs reaching every state, U.S. territories, and tribal
    organizations;
-   The Environmental Protection Act (EPA) dedicated $1 billion in
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to accelerate clean up at up
    to 80 previously underfunded Superfund sites.
-   EPA committed $7.4 billion to help states replace lead pipes and
    service lines, which will protect millions of families from
    so-called “forever chemicals” and other contaminants that may
    increase people’s risk of getting certain cancers.
-   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing the
    President’s bipartisan PACT Act, with 1.5 million veterans already
    receiving screening for toxic exposure as of January 2023, and in
    November, VA announced it would expedite veterans’ benefits claims
    for cancers associated with the PACT Act, helping these veterans
    gain more timely access to health care and other financial benefits.
-   The Food and Drug Administration proposed rules prohibiting menthol
    cigarettes and flavored cigars that, if finalized, could avert up to
    654,000 smoking-related deaths, including approximately 238,000
    among African Americans. Tobacco use is the leading cause of
    preventable cancer and death from cancer—30 percent of all cancer
    deaths in the United States are caused by smoking;
-   The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced its new Agricultural
    Science Center of Excellence for Nutrition and Diet for Better
    Health (ASCEND for Better Health) to accelerate research on
    diet-related chronic diseases, including cancer, and aims to
    translate research into impactful solutions that improve public
    health and well-being goals as support of the Cancer Moonshot and
    the National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health.
-   Tens of thousands of cancer patients could see their prescription
    drug costs go down by thousands annually because the President
    signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which caps out-of-pocket
    prescription drug costs at $2000 per year for Medicare
    beneficiaries.
-   NCI launched a large national trial that, if successful, will
    identify effective blood tests for the detection of one or more
    cancers, providing the opportunity for additional, less-invasive
    tools for early detection.
