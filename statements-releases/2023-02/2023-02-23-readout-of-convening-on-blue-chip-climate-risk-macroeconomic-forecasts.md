title: "Readout of Convening on Blue Chip Climate-Risk Macroeconomic\_Forecasts"
---
 
Yesterday, the Council of Economic Advisers, National Economic Council,
Office of Management and Budget, Office of Clean Energy Innovation and
Implementation, and Climate Policy Office hosted a convening on Blue
Chip Climate-Risk Macroeconomic Forecasts with economists from the
private sector, government, and academia.  
   
The meeting was convened to build a public-private community of practice
around incorporating the physical and transition risks of climate change
into macroeconomic forecasting. In particular, the convening’s goals
were three-fold:

1.  To identify best practices and novel methodologies for incorporating
    climate risks into macroeconomic forecasts;
2.  To share methodologies developed or considered to date and identify
    important data gaps or missing modeling capabilities;
3.  To elevate the visibility of private-sector assessment and
    management of climate-related macroeconomic risks in policymaking,
    and vice-versa.

One central challenge guides these goals: climate change—and the
required policy response to address it—is a first-order risk to the
macroeconomy. The transformation of energy systems will entail
fundamental shifts in how, when, and where we invest; the physical risks
of a changing climate will alter the trajectory and composition of
economic growth. Given the scale of the risks from climate change, it is
critical that we better understand and manage their effects throughout
the economy. Additionally, transparency and collaboration in forecasting
climate risks help improve our projections’ accuracy and credibility. 
This, in turn, offers a stronger foundation from which to develop
policies to ensure a smooth, managed transition to a net-zero world and
a stable, fair economy. 

The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes this challenge. Shortly after
taking office, President Biden signed an Executive Order on
Climate-Related Financial Risk, which—among other things—instructs CEA,
OMB, and Treasury to develop methods to account for the physical and
transition risks of climate change in the economic assumptions and
long-term budget outlook of the President’s Budget. CEA and OMB have
been leading a government-wide technical working group (ITWG) to develop
methods to account for climate risks in macro-economic forecasting. As
the Administration works to develop new capacities, particularly with
respect to forecasting transition risks, sharing knowledge about and
fostering alignment on climate-related risk forecasting methodologies
with the private sector can advance the USG’s knowledge base and
encourage private actors to advance with us towards incorporating
climate into broader economic forecasting.  
  
This convening represents the first such step in building a
public-private community of practice surrounding macroeconomic
climate-risk analysis.
