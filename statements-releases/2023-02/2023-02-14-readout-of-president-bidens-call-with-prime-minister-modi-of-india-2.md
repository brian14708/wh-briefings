President Joe Biden spoke today with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of
India to discuss the historic agreement for Air India to purchase over
200 American-made aircraft from Boeing. President Biden noted how the
sale will support over one million American jobs across 44 states, and
help Air India meet growing demands for air transportation in India.
President Biden and Prime Minister Modi also discussed the importance of
the strategic technology partnership between India and the United
States, highlighting the recent inaugural launch of the Initiative on
Critical and Emerging Technology hosted in Washington two weeks ago.
During the call, the two leaders reaffirmed the strength of the
U.S.-India relationship and committed to continue working together and
in groups like the Quad to advance economic growth for our two countries
and expand cooperation on our shared priorities.
