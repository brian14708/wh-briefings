title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Actions to Expand\
  \ Offshore Wind Nationally and Harness More Reliable, Affordable Clean\_Energy"
---
 
*Proposes first-ever Gulf of Mexico offshore wind lease sale; welcomes
California and Louisiana to Federal-State Partnership to build America’s
supply chain and increase skilled workforce for offshore wind*

  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing its latest steps to
expand offshore wind jobs and local economic development across the
country. These actions, which include proposing the first-ever Gulf of
Mexico offshore wind lease sale, are advancing President Biden’s clean
energy and economic agenda to revitalize American manufacturing and
harness American innovation to deliver reliable, affordable power to
homes and businesses, while saving families money and strengthening
energy security.  
  
Today’s actions—alongside investments from President Biden’s Inflation
Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—will spur offshore wind
deployment beyond the East Coast, boost American leadership on floating
offshore wind technologies, and create good-paying jobs for workers
throughout the nation, by:

-   **Advancing Offshore Wind in the Gulf of Mexico:** For the first
    time, the Department of the Interior (DOI) is announcing a proposed
    offshore wind lease sale for three areas in the Gulf of Mexico,
    offshore Texas and Louisiana. These areas have the potential to
    generate enough clean energy to power almost 1.3 million homes. The
    proposed auction includes provisions that would incentivize new
    investments in workforce training and a domestic supply chain, to
    expand economic opportunities across offshore wind manufacturing,
    port operations, and more. DOI’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
    (BOEM) collaborated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration to analyze the entire Gulf of Mexico ecosystem to
    find areas that have the least conflict with other uses and the
    lowest environmental impact.
-   **Expanding the Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation
    Partnership:** Last year, President Biden joined East Coast
    governors to launch the [Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation
    Partnership](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-administration-launches-new-federal-state-offshore-wind-partnership-to-grow-american-made-clean-energy/),
    with eleven states working alongside the Administration to maximize
    the benefits of Atlantic offshore wind development for workers and
    communities. Now, following DOI’s recent [California offshore wind
    auction](https://doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-winners-california-offshore-wind-energy-auction)
    and ahead of the proposed Gulf of Mexico offshore wind auction, both
    California and Louisiana are joining the Partnership to collaborate
    with federal agencies and other states on priorities including
    building an American supply chain and skilled workforce for offshore
    wind. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Louisiana Governor John
    Bel Edwards have been leaders on seizing clean energy opportunities
    that create good-paying jobs, lower costs for families, and reduce
    climate pollution.
-   **Accelerating Progress on Floating Offshore Wind:** Today, the
    Departments of Energy, the Interior, Commerce, and Transportation
    are kicking off a two-day [Floating Offshore Wind Shot
    Summit](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/events/floating-offshore-wind-shottm-summit),
    convening a broad range of leaders across sectors to advance the
    Administration’s goal of reducing the costs of floating offshore
    wind energy by over 70% by 2035. Floating technologies are key to
    harnessing about two-thirds of U.S. offshore wind energy potential,
    including along the West Coast, Gulf of Maine, and other deep-water
    areas. The Summit is bringing together Administration leaders,
    Governors, Members of Congress, industry and labor leaders, and a
    wide array of stakeholders working to advance innovation priorities,
    infrastructure buildout, community engagement, and other key aspects
    of floating offshore wind deployment. As part of this Summit, the
    Department of Energy is announcing new efforts on transmission
    planning and research partnerships to support floating offshore wind
    on the West Coast.   

President Biden has taken decisive action to jumpstart the American
offshore wind industry, ushering in billions of dollars in investments
since he took office—including [$9.8
billion](https://www.offshorewindus.org/market-report/) in new
investments in 2022 alone, more than triple the previous year. While
advancing the first large-scale projects, and new manufacturing and port
activity along the East Coast, the Administration has also supported
development of the entire supply chain that stretches across other
regions, from steel production in Alabama, Kentucky, and West Virginia
to shipbuilding in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and beyond.   
  
The President has also set [bold
goals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-expand-u-s-offshore-wind-energy/)
of deploying 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2030, as well as 15
GW specifically of floating offshore wind by 2035. The White House,
federal agencies, states, and other key stakeholders are coordinating to
achieve the President’s goals while advancing environmental justice,
protecting biodiversity, supporting the creation of good-paying jobs,
and promoting ocean co-use. In addition to executive actions, the
Administration is also working to swiftly implement provisions of
President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law that will further accelerate offshore wind, including clean energy
tax credits to support manufacturing and deployment, as well as
investments in transmission and port infrastructure.
