title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Marty\_Walsh"
---
 
Marty Walsh is one tough union chief. His record at the Department of
Labor is a testament to the power of putting a card-carrying union
member in charge of fighting for American workers. Marty has gone to bat
for working families every day, and with his help, this administration
has helped workers recover from a historic economic downturn and launch
a new era of worker power.  
  
Through Marty’s leadership, this administration has helped unions secure
a historic pay raise for rail workers, continued the fight for paid sick
days for all American workers, strengthened workplace protections, and
ushered in a historic surge in union organizing. He knows that unions
make us all stronger, no matter what we do or where we come from.   
   
My dad used to say that a job is about a lot more than a paycheck, it’s
about dignity and it’s about respect. Few people understand that more
than Marty. I thank Marty for his work, which has made life better for
millions of working Americans, and will serve as a model for all future
Labor Secretaries who truly value American working people.
