title: "ICYMI:  Defense Secretaries Panetta and Hagel: \u201CDebt-ceiling brinksmanship\
  \ weakens US national\_security\u201D"
---
 
Today, former Secretaries of Defense Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel warned
that brinksmanship on the debt ceiling would have serious consequences
for national security, noting: “The consequence of debt-ceiling
brinksmanship is a dangerous self-inflected wound that tells both our
friends and our enemies that we cannot be trusted. Such brinksmanship
weakens our national security.”  
  
The former Defense Secretaries write that the consequences of default
would be devastating: “Not only would default seriously damage America’s
economic credibility; it would also weaken our nation’s security by
interfering with our ability to pay our troops and maintain military
readiness.”  
  
President Biden is committed to avoiding Congressional Republicans’
threat of default on the full faith and credit of the U.S., which would
weaken national security, raise costs and cost jobs, and create economic
chaos. Congressional Republicans should take the threat of default off
the table, and put their fiscal plans—which could increase the debt by
more than $3 trillion—on the table.

\[Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel, 2/24/23\]  
   
With a new era of geopolitical competition underway with China and the
anniversary of a major land war for freedom in Ukraine, nations around
the world are turning to the United States to exercise strong and
decisive world leadership.  
   
The key to that leadership is credibility in our military power, our
diplomatic engagement and our economic stability. Our word must be
trusted if our national security is to be protected. The United States
is facing more threats in the world than we have had since World War II.
Alliances are critical to our ability to preserve peace and prosperity
in the 21st century.  
   
As former secretaries of defense, we have had the opportunity to engage
with both allies and adversaries. Our word is our greatest weapon with
both. If our word cannot be trusted, it will weaken our relationship
with allies and empower our adversaries.  
   
The “full faith and credit” of the United States not only underpins our
global financial order, but it also constitutes our word in the most
literal sense. The consequence of debt-ceiling brinksmanship is a
dangerous self-inflected wound that tells both our friends and our
enemies that we cannot be trusted. Such brinksmanship weakens our
national security.  
   
One year ago, as Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his brutal
war of aggression against Ukraine, the world rallied together behind
U.S. leadership to impose unprecedented sanctions on Moscow, provide
critical weapons, training and ammunition to Ukrainian forces, and
reinforce our commitment to NATO countries.  
   
All of that is predicated on U.S. global economic leadership and
credibility. Our unified actions sent an unmistakable message of
strength, not just to Putin but to every other adversary in the world.  
   
As Putin escalates this conflict in a futile effort to break the will of
the Ukrainian people, the United States and our allies, he will be
watching to measure the credibility of U.S. economic power. To default
on our financial obligations at this time would both undermine our own
power and encourage Putin to continue his futile war on democracy.  
   
Other tyrants would be encouraged as well. In particular, a default
would cripple our strength in the signature competitive dynamic of the
21st century — our competition with China. We compete on technology
across the spectrum — from microchips to supercomputers to hypersonic
weapons. Yet we have significantly different economic models. The
autocratic model of Chinese President Xi Jinping uses state control and
centralized planning to advance authoritarian policies and deepen the
civil-military fusion that is turning China into a peer rival in the
Western Pacific. A debt default would be an unforced economic error for
the United States in the face of these growing tensions. It would hand
Xi the argument he needs to attack the strength and credibility of the
U.S. free enterprise system.  
   
The restoration of U.S. world leadership is taking place at a critical
time in the 21st century in the competition between democracy and
autocracy. So much of that progress would be undermined by an
unnecessary debt default. We have never defaulted before in our history.
Not only would default seriously damage America’s economic credibility;
it would also weaken our nation’s security by interfering with our
ability to pay our troops and maintain military readiness.  
   
Bipartisan commitments to the national security needs of friends and
allies would be impacted. Critical weapons and support to Ukraine would
be thrown into doubt. Funding for essential civilian and defense
modernization efforts would be undermined. The U.S. has never defaulted
before, so there is much we do not know about the tragic consequences.  
   
A decade ago, we faced a similar crisis. Defense leaders warned of the
consequences — and Congress did the right thing. Today we need similar
courage and similar foresight. While we deeply appreciate the need to
restore fiscal discipline to the federal budget, it makes little sense
to create even greater fiscal chaos by defaulting on the nation’s “full
faith and credit.”  
   
A debt ceiling solution does not add a single dollar to the U.S.
deficit. It simply says that we stand by our word and that our economy
will remain stable and strong. Our adversaries are watching to see how
unstable our democracy may be. Our friends are concerned because they
too could be vulnerable to the same enemies.  
   
This is about protecting our national security. It is the oath we all
take on assuming public office. Republicans and Democrats in the
Congress have a responsibility to put country ahead of party. Congress
needs to act without delay to raise the debt limit to protect our
credibility, our word and our leadership in the world.  
   
Leon E. Panetta served as the 23rd U.S. secretary of defense. Chuck
Hagel served as the 24th U.S. secretary of defense.
