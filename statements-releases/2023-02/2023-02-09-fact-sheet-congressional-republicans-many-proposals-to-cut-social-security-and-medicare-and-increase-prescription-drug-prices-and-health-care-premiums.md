title: "FACT SHEET: Congressional Republicans\u2019 Many Proposals to Cut Social Security\
  \ and Medicare, and Increase Prescription Drug Prices and Health Care\_Premiums"
---
 
*During his Tampa visit, the President will contrast his commitment to
protecting and strengthening Medicare and Social Security and lowering
prescription drug prices, with Congressional Republicans’ plans to cut
these programs*

President Biden has taken action to strengthen Medicare and protect
Social Security – bedrock programs that Americans have paid into and
that tens of millions of seniors depend on to support their livelihoods.
Congressional Republicans, however, have a different record. For years,
Republican Members of Congress have repeatedly tried to cut Medicare and
Social Security, move toward privatizing one or both programs, and raise
the Social Security retirement age and Medicare eligibility age. And
just last week, House Republicans introduced legislation to repeal
President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which would give tens of
billions of dollars in subsidies back to Big Pharma, raise seniors’
prescription drug prices, and raise taxes on an estimated 14.5 million
people – all while increasing the deficit.  
  
In Tampa, Florida today, President Biden will highlight the work his
Administration is doing to protect and strengthen Medicare and Social
Security, while Republican Members of Congress continue to push plans
that would undermine these programs and the economic security of
millions of their constituents.  
  
**Congressional Republicans’ long record of working to cut Medicare,
Social Security:**

-   Senator Mike Lee
    [said](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/senator-accuses-biden-of-lying-about-gop-plans-on-social-security-and-medicare-162874437604):
    “One thing that you probably haven’t ever heard from a politician:
    it will be my objective to phase out Social Security. To pull it up
    by the roots, and get rid of it.”
-   In November, John Thune, the number two Senate Republican in
    leadership,
    [declared](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-29/gop-s-thune-sees-debt-ceiling-hike-as-vehicle-for-budget-cuts)
    that Social Security and Medicare benefits should be slashed.
-   Florida Senator Rick Scott is championing [a
    plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/01/fact-sheet-by-the-numbers-millions-of-americans-would-lose-health-care-coverage-benefits-and-protections-under-congressional-republicans-plans/)
    to put Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security on the chopping block
    every five years, which would put the health and economic security
    of 63 million Medicare beneficiaries, 69 million Medicaid
    beneficiaries and 65 million Social Security beneficiaries at risk.
    Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin proposed sunsetting these laws
    every year.
-   The Republican Study Committee – which includes a majority of House
    Republicans – released a formal budget that,
    [according](https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/10-17-2022/wh-dings-scalise/)
    to Politico, included “raising the eligibility ages for each
    program, along with withholding payments for individuals who retire
    early or had a certain income, and privatized funding for Social
    Security to lower income taxes.”
-   And in 2015, most House Republicans, including Speaker McCarthy,
    Rep. Scalise, and a host of others in current leadership,
    [voted](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2015/H/138?5) to raise the
    retirement age to 70, which would cut Social Security benefits for
    tens of millions of seniors who paid into the system for years.

**Republican Members of Congress have proposed making health care and
prescription drugs more expensive:  
**  
Last week, Republicans in the House proposed repealing the Inflation
Reduction Act, including its health care provisions. And, just
yesterday, Republicans on the House Budget Committee floated a proposal
to repeal the health care provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Here’s what that would mean for working families across the country and
in Florida:

-   **<u>A 62-year-old in Tampa earning $55,000 would see their premium
    increase by $7,000 per year.</u>**
-   14.5 million Americans nationwide will pay higher health insurance
    premiums and see a tax increase.
-   Everyone with Medicare will see higher drug prices if Medicare
    cannot negotiate the price of drugs.
-   Tens of billions of dollars will go right back to Big Pharma, which
    will increase the deficit.
-   [3.3](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/01/fact-sheet-by-the-numbers-millions-of-americans-would-lose-health-care-coverage-benefits-and-protections-under-congressional-republicans-plans/)
    million Medicare beneficiaries who use insulin will no longer have
    the peace of mind of knowing that their insulin is capped at $35.
-   Millions of seniors will no longer be able to get recommended
    vaccines for free.
-   Drug companies could go back to increasing drug prices faster than
    inflation with no accountability, which happened for [1,200
    prescription
    drugs](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/09/30/new-hhs-reports-illustrate-potential-positive-impact-inflation-reduction-act-prescription-drug-prices.html)
    last year.

**President Biden has called for protecting Medicare and Social
Security, and lowering health care costs for working families:  
**  
In this week’s State of the Union, President Biden vowed to protect
Social Security and Medicare and build on the progress we’ve made in
lowering health care costs for millions of seniors and American
families.  
  
Through President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act:

-   Seniors are paying no more than $35 per month for an insulin
    prescription. **<u>If this law had been in effect in 2020, over
    90,000 Floridians would have saved an average of $476.</u>**
-   Seniors are able to get recommended vaccines for free, saving many
    seniors hundreds of dollars.
-   Seniors’ out of pocket prescription drug costs will be capped at
    $2000 per year – benefitting [over a
    million](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/01/fact-sheet-by-the-numbers-millions-of-americans-would-lose-health-care-coverage-benefits-and-protections-under-congressional-republicans-plans/)
    Medicare beneficiaries and cancer patients paying skyrocketing
    prices for prescription drugs each year.
-   An estimated 14.5 million Americans are saving on health insurance
    premiums under the Affordable Care Act.  **<u>Over 3.2 million
    Floridians signed up for coverage this year.</u>**
-   Drug companies will have to pay Medicare a rebate if they raise
    their prices faster than inflation. Today, the Department of Health
    and Human Services is announcing next steps for implementing this
    key provision of the President’s prescription drug law, which will
    lower drug costs for millions of Americans. 

And President Biden wants to build on this historic progress. In his
State of the Union Address, the President has called on Congress to:

-   Commit to taking cuts to Social Security and Medicare off the table.
-   Expand the insulin cap in the Inflation Reduction Act, so all
    Americans can benefit from insulin being capped at $35 for a month’s
    supply.
-   Make permanent the ACA tax credits that – thanks to President
    Biden’s prescription drug law –  **<u>are lowering health insurance
    premiums for an estimated 14.5 million people, and close the
    Medicaid coverage gap to benefit more than 1 million
    Floridians.</u>**
