  \ and Women\u2019s\_Rights"
---
 
Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris hosted an event to
honor the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Family Medical Leave Act
(FMLA).  
   
Prior to the event, the White House Office of Public Engagement in
coordination with the Office of the Vice President and the Gender Policy
Council hosted a roundtable of Black women leaders, in celebration of
Black History Month, to discuss priority issues for Black families and
Black communities.  
   
Administration officials and community leaders discussed recent actions
President Biden has taken to support women in the workplace and advance
racial equity. This includes passing the end-of-year omnibus, which
included the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and the PUMP Act for Nursing
Mothers. Thanks to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, pregnant and
postpartum workers will be guaranteed a right to reasonable
accommodations for pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical
conditions, including basic commonsense accommodations, like bathroom
breaks and light duty. And the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act extends
break time and private space protections for nursing parents to nearly 9
million workers, including teachers, nurses, and farmworkers. These laws
are particularly important for the health and economic security of Black
women, to address their higher risk for pregnancy-related complications
and maternal mortality, and gender and racial pay disparities that lower
their earnings.  
   
The meeting also coincided with President Biden issuing a Presidential
Memorandum today to support and advance women’s economic security by
calling on heads of federal agencies to provide access to leave for
federal employees when they need it, including during their first year
of service.  
   
The leaders applauded the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing
commitment to racial equity as it intersects with healthcare and
supporting families across the country.  
   
The roundtable participants included:

-   Jocelyn Frye, President, National Partnership for Women & Families
-   Fatima Goss Graves, President, National Women’s Law Center
-   Carol Joyner, Executive Director, Family Values @ Work Action
-   Josie Kalipeni, Executive Director, Family Values @ Work

-   Dr. Jamila Taylor, President, National WIC Association
