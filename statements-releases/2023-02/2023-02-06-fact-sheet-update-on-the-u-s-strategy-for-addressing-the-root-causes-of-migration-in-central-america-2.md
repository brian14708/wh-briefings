title: "FACT SHEET: Update on the U.S. Strategy for Addressing the Root Causes of\
  \ Migration in Central\_America"
---
 
**February 2023**

Vice President Harris continues to lead the implementation of the Root
Causes Strategy, which tackles the drivers of irregular migration by
improving the conditions in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras so
people do not feel compelled to leave their homes.  This includes
tackling economic, governance, and security challenges. These efforts
are providing hope and opportunity to the people of Central America,
affirming that a secure and prosperous future lies in their home
communities. We remain committed to policies and programs that improve
the lives of people in Central America so that they may see a future at
home.  
  
Highlights to date include:

-   **Creating Opportunities:** U.S. Government support for nearly 8,000
    private sector firms in northern Central America has helped create
    and sustain more than 90,000 jobs. Additionally, U.S. efforts have
    enabled micro and small businesses to access $179 million in
    financing to promote economic recovery in the region.

-   **Improving Economic Livelihoods:** In response to the Vice
    President’s Call to Action for Northern Central America,
    approximately 47 companies and organizations have committed to
    invest more than $4.2 billion to strengthen economic security for
    people in the region. These investments are producing concrete
    results by creating jobs, connecting people to the digital economy,
    expanding access to financing for small businesses, providing
    training and education for youth and workers, and improving economic
    livelihoods for people in the region. With the launch of Central
    America Forward today, the U.S. Government and the non-profit
    Partnership for Central America (PCA) are expanding this
    public-private partnership to further integrate it with broader
    objectives of the Root Causes Strategy.

<!-- -->

-   **Promoting Decent Work:** The U.S. Government, through the U.S.
    Department of Labor, is partnering with local organizations to
    increase access to decent work. For example, in Honduras, over 500
    government officials have been trained on inspection procedures to
    prevent child labor and forced labor, and promote freedom of
    association and collective bargaining, as well as occupational
    safety and health standards in the Central American workplaces.

<!-- -->

-   **Promoting Investment:** The U.S. Department of Commerce led a
    high-level delegation to the region to explore business
    opportunities, which included more than 150 participants
    representing 64 U.S. companies from 22 states, the District of
    Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

<!-- -->

-   **Improving Food Security:** The U.S. Government has provided $112
    million in assistance for school feeding programs, improving food
    security for over 275,000 individuals in northern Central America.

<!-- -->

-   **Assisting Agricultural Workers:** The U.S. Government has
    leveraged an estimated $189 million from both the public and private
    sectors to increase productivity and incomes for more than 100,000
    agriculture industry producers participating in food security
    programs in Guatemala and Honduras.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Education:** The U.S. Government has reached more than
    465,000 youth through support for primary and secondary education in
    areas of high out-migration in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
    In addition, more than 2,400 youth in Guatemala and Honduras
    obtained new employment following U.S. Government-supported
    vocational training, with nearly 12,000 youth recently completing
    their training.

<!-- -->

-   **Providing Vaccines:** To assist people in the region in combating
    the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Government has delivered more than
    17 million vaccine doses free-of-cost, bilaterally and in
    partnership with COVAX, to countries in northern Central America.

<!-- -->

-   **Combatting Migrant Smuggling and Human Trafficking:** A task force
    announced by Vice President Harris in June 2021, Joint Task Force
    Alpha led by the Department of Justice, and other interagency
    efforts led by the Department of Homeland Security are generating
    concrete results in combatting migrant smuggling and preventing,
    disrupting, and dismantling human trafficking efforts.  These
    collective efforts have resulted in 74 U.S. convictions of members
    of human trafficking organizations, foreign government charges
    against more than 200 individuals, over 107,000 disruption
    activities, and over 7,800 arrests, bringing the swift hand of
    justice down on these criminal organizations.

<!-- -->

-   **Assisting Human Trafficking Victims:** Through the Department of
    State, the U.S. Government has provided services to 740 victims of
    human trafficking in Central American countries and Mexico. Services
    include healthcare, counseling, legal assistance, provision of
    shelter and education.

<!-- -->

-   **Combatting Corruption:** The Department of Justice Anti-Corruption
    Task Force, announced by Vice President Harris in June 2021, is
    working to combat corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras
    through case development, training, and capacity building.

<!-- -->

-   **Promoting Accountability for Corrupt Actors:** The U.S. Government
    has promoted accountability through publicly identifying over 150
    individuals responsible for undermining democracy or engaging in
    significant corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and
    Nicaragua, rendering them generally ineligible for visas to the
    United States, in part to prevent corrupt officials from spending
    their ill-gotten gains abroad. In addition, 18 individuals and
    entities in El Salvador and Guatemala have been sanctioned by the
    Department of the Treasury for their role in, among other things,
    human rights abuses and corruption. We will continue to use these
    and other tools, which to support rights and freedom for the people
    of Central America.

<!-- -->

-   **Protecting Civic Space:** Launched at the June 2022 Summit of the
    Americas in Los Angeles, the Voices Initiative is bringing
    like-minded partners in government, multilateral institutions, civil
    society, and the private sector together to protect, defend, and
    promote civic space in Central America.

<!-- -->

-   **Enhancing Transparency and Accountability:** U.S. programs in El
    Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have trained more than 5,000
    national and local government officials to implement internationally
    recognized transparency and accountability standards designed to
    combat corruption.

<!-- -->

-   **Training Civilian Police:** The U.S. Government has provided
    professionalization training for over 9,000 civilian police in
    Central America, including training on police protocols for
    attention to victims of gender-based and intrafamily violence.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting At-Risk Youth:** The U.S. Government has reached more
    than 50,000 at-risk youth in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras
    with violence prevention services and supported over 180,000 at-risk
    youth in these countries to strengthen their ability to resist gang
    recruitment. 

<!-- -->

-   **Reducing Gender-Based Violence:** The U.S. Agency for
    International Development (USAID) is helping El Salvador, Guatemala
    and Honduras reduce gender-based violence (GBV) through programs
    that range from prevention and education to survivor support and
    access to justice. In January 2023, the Department of State launched
    a $3 million project to combat GBV in six municipalities in northern
    Honduras with high areas of out-migration.

<!-- -->

-   **Assisting GBV Survivors and Protecting Children: **The U.S.
    Government, through USAID, provided services to more than 30,000
    survivors of GBV in Honduras and Guatemala and reached more than
    2,500 women, youth, and indigenous people in Guatemala with
    education and other activities designed to combat trafficking in
    persons.  In El Salvador, USAID is training more than 380 staff from
    67 organizations to help improve the country’s child protection
    services.

<!-- -->

-   **Empowering Local Partners:** Through the U.S. Government’s
    five-year, $300 million *Centroamérica Local* initiative—to foster
    locally led development by providing assistance directly to local
    partners working to address drivers of migration—USAID is expanding
    its outreach to local organizations, including indigenous and
    women-led organizations and directly supporting more than 20 local
    partners in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

<!-- -->

-   **Providing Robust Humanitarian Assistance:** Complementing our
    investments under the Root Causes Strategy, the U.S. Government also
    provided nearly $420 million in humanitarian assistance to Central
    America, for life-saving assistance, including food, protection, and
    shelter, to the region’s most vulnerable and hardest-to-reach
    people.
