President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Andrzej Duda of
Poland in Warsaw. On the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s
brutal invasion of Ukraine, the leaders reflected on their shared
efforts to support Ukraine, impose consequences on Russia, and
strengthen NATO. President Biden praised the generous support of the
people of Poland for welcoming over 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees into
their communities. In addition, the leaders discussed their countries’
growing cooperation in the energy sector, including civil nuclear
energy, our strong bilateral defense relationship, and the importance of
the democratic values that underpin the transatlantic alliance.
