title: "Leaders Applaud the President\u2019s State of the Union\_Address"
---
 
Tuesday, the President was strong and energetic in his State of the
Union address. He spoke clearly and directly to the American people
about the progress we’ve made over the past two years and his agenda for
the future. And, he said clearly that we need to finish the job.

He talked about his efforts to tackle inflation, give families more
breathing room, and combat junk fees that cost families millions.

In stark contrast to Congressional Republicans’ heckling and jeers, the
President was optimistic about the future and called on Republicans to
work with Democrats to deliver for families, instead of engage in
endless partisan warfare. 

*See below for what bipartisan leaders across a federal, state and local
level are saying about President Biden’s State of the Union address:*

tonight was a great success… After tonight’s speech, it’s clear that
under President Biden’s leadership, our nation is rising to new heights
as we work towards building a brighter and more equitable future for all
Americans.”
