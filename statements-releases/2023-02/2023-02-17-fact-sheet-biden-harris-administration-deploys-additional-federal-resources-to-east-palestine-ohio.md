title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Deploys Additional Federal Resources\
  \ to East Palestine,\_Ohio"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration has mobilized a robust, multi-agency
effort to support the people of East Palestine, Ohio.  
  
Within hours of the Norfolk Southern train derailment, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) deployed a team to East Palestine to support
state and local emergency and environmental response efforts. The
Department of Transportation (DOT) also arrived on scene to investigate
what led to the derailment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) has been closely coordinating with the emergency operations
center, Ohio Emergency Management Agency, and Federal partners.  
  
As President Biden told Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Pennsylvania
Governor Josh Shapiro soon after the derailment, the Federal Government
stands ready to provide any additional federal assistance the states may
need. Today, in response to Governor DeWine’s and the Ohio congressional
delegation’s request on February 16 for additional federal public health
support, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they are deploying a
team of medical personnel and toxicologists to conduct public health
testing and assessments. The team will support Federal, state, and local
officials already on the ground to evaluate individuals who were exposed
or potentially exposed to chemicals and help ensure timely
communications to the public.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting the people of
East Palestine every step of the way, and holding Norfolk Southern
accountable. Each Federal agency is playing its unique role in this
task, including:  
  
**Environmental Protection Agency*  
***  
EPA personnel arrived on site before dawn on February 4 to support state
and local officials who are leading the emergency response efforts.
There are dozens of EPA personnel on the ground, including multiple EPA
on-scene coordinators, agency scientists, and regional teams, that are
tasked with:

-   **Monitoring Air Quality.** The EPA is continuously monitoring air
    quality using state-of-art equipment. The EPA has also deployed
    mobile detection equipment and stationary equipment for detection of
    a wide range of compounds, including volatile organic compounds
    (VOCs), phosgene and hydrogen chloride.
-   **Screening Homes for Contaminants.** The EPA has assisted with the
    indoor air monitoring of 500 homes under a voluntary screening
    program offered to residents, and no detections of vinyl chloride or
    hydrogen chloride were identified above levels of concern. EPA is
    continuing to offer screening to residents within the evacuation
    zone.
-   **Securing Norfolk Southern Commitment to Cover Clean Up Costs.** On
    February 10, the EPA issued a letter to Norfolk Southern requiring
    the railroad to document the release of hazardous contaminants. The
    letter also outlines cleanup actions at the site and EPA’s authority
    under the law to hold them accountable.
-   **Holding Norfolk Southern Accountable for Clean Up.** The EPA is
    coordinating the oversight of Norfolk Southern’s soil remediation of
    the derailment site. The remediation includes testing of the soils
    within and immediately surrounding the impacted areas. Results of
    the testing are evaluated by EPA and OH EPA to determine a strategy
    to ensure the site is cleaned up to meet federal and state
    regulations.
-   **Helping Ensure Water is Safe to Drink.** EPA is assisting state
    and local agencies to test surface and ground water to ensure
    drinking water is safe. This includes surface water testing to
    monitor downstream impacts on the Ohio River.

**National Transportation Safety Board and Department of
Transportation**

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), an independent federal
agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation
accident in the U.S. and significant accidents in other modes of
transportation—including railroad, highway, marine, and pipelines, and
Department of Transportation arrived on site within hours of the
derailment. The NTSB is leading the investigation into the cause of the
derailment with Department of Transportation personnel supporting. Once
the investigation is complete, the Federal Government will use all
available and appropriate authorities to further ensure accountability
and improve rail safety. Ongoing actions include:

-   **Investigating the Cause of the Derailment.** The National
    Transportation Safety Board has been on site since within hours of
    the derailment to determine what caused the derailment. NTSB plans
    to submit preliminary findings report within weeks, and a final
    report that will lay out what caused the derailment. The Federal
    Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Pipeline and Hazardous
    Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) within DOT are also on site
    supporting the NTSB’s investigation.
-   **Ensuring Compliance with Rail Safety Regulations.** FRA is working
    to determine Norfolk Southern’s compliance with rail safety
    regulations. When DOT gets the results from the NTSB investigation
    about the cause of the derailment, as well as the analysis from the
    FRA on rail safety compliance, DOT will take actions as needed that
    ensure accountability and improve safety.
-   **Creating a safer rail system.** DOT is working on numerous fronts
    to improve rail safety, including managing over $4 billion in
    discretionary grant programs designed to improve rail safety and
    eliminate at-grade rail crossings. DOT also provides training and
    resources for local first responders who deal with hazardous
    materials incidents. DOT is also working on rulemakings to improve
    rail safety including proposing a rule that would require a minimum
    of a two-person train crew size for safety reasons, a major priority
    for rail workers. DOT conducts research to improve the design of
    rail cars that carry hazardous materials. DOT is also developing a
    Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that will require railroads to provide
    real-time information on the contents of tank cars to authorized
    emergency response officials responding to or investigating an
    incident involving the transportation of hazardous materials by
    rail.  

**Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention**  
  
In response to Governor DeWine’s request on February 16 for additional
federal public health support, HHS and the CDC are deploying a team of
medical personnel and toxicologists to conduct public health testing and
assessments. The team will include a medical toxicologist and the Agency
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Region 5 lead to
support EPA and state health department efforts. ATSDR protects
communities from harmful health effects related to exposure to natural
and man-made hazardous substances and will send a team to interview
people in the derailment area and conduct an Assessment of Chemical
Exposure investigation.  
  
Since the derailment, HHS has been providing technical assistance to
state and Federal partners on emergency response, emergency management,
and scientific assessments of chemicals including risk communication.
This has included participating in daily state-led emergency
coordination calls to provide expert advice and analysis.  
  
**Federal Emergency Management Agency**  
  
FEMA is in constant contact with the emergency operations center in East
Palestine, as well as the Ohio Emergency Management Agency and Federal
partners. EPA has secured Norfolk Southern’s commitment to cover all
cleanup costs.
