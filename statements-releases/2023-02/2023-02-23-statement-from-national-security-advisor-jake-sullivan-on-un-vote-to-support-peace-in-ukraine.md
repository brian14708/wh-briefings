title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on UN Vote To Support\
  \ Peace in\_Ukraine"
---
 
Nearly one year after Russia launched its brutal and unprovoked invasion
of Ukraine, 141 countries — from every continent and every corner of the
world — issued a powerful call for a comprehensive, just, and lasting
peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the UN Charter. By
overwhelmingly voting in favor of the UN General Assembly resolution
today, these nations stood firmly in support of the rules-based
international order, and spoke with one voice to demand Russia’s full,
immediate, and unconditional withdrawal from all of Ukraine’s
territory. A year into this conflict, the international community
remains steadfast in upholding our shared values, including the
principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity that
are the foundation of the UN Charter, and accountability for violations
of international law, including Russia’s war of aggression. Today’s vote
was an overwhelming demonstration of support for Ukraine — and a clear
defense or freedom for people everywhere.
