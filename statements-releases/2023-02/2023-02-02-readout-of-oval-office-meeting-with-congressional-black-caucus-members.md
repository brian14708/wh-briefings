title: "Readout of Oval Office Meeting with Congressional Black Caucus\_Members"
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hosted
members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) in the Oval Office to
discuss shared priorities, including the George Floyd Justice in
Policing Act and the path forward on police reform in Congress.

Members of the Congressional Black Caucus were vital partners in
advancing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act through the House in
the last session of Congress. When Senate Republicans blocked the
legislation from reaching the President’s desk, President Biden worked
with the CBC to take sweeping executive action at the federal level to
advance police reform.

In today’s meeting, the discussion focused on important reforms that
have already been implemented as a result of the President’s action,
including the banning of chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and
requiring the use of body cameras at the federal level, and what more
needs to be done by Congress.

The President and Vice President made clear that no executive action can
substitute for federal legislation, and the necessary changes at the
state and local level will require Congress to act.

President Biden and Vice President Harris remain committed to doing
everything in their power to achieve meaningful police reform in
Congress.

**The meeting participants included:**

-   Rep. Steven Horsford (NV-04), Congressional Black Caucus Chair

-   Senator Raphael Warnock (GA)
