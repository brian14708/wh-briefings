**Statement from President Joe Biden on Nigeria’s Upcoming Election**

I commend yesterday’s peace accord in Nigeria, signed by the political
parties and candidates running in Nigeria’s presidential election on
February 25.  By signing this pledge, the parties and candidates have
committed to accept the results of the election, as announced by the
Independent National Electoral Commission, and to support a peaceful
transition of power.  
   
Elections are a fundamental part of a functioning democracy, and all
Nigerians deserve this chance to choose their future — freely and
fairly.  While the United States does not support any single candidate
or party, we strongly support a peaceful and transparent process that
reflects the will of the people of Nigeria.  On election day, I
encourage all Nigerians — no matter their religion, region, or ethnicity
—to exercise this fundamental freedom and make their voices heard —
including young voters, many of whom may be heading to the ballot box
for the first time.  
   
The United States stands with the Nigerian people as they chart a path
toward a more democratic, prosperous, and secure future.  I appreciate
President Buhari’s firm commitment that the will of the people will be
respected.  And in the coming days, I encourage voters to remain
peaceful and patient as their ballots are tallied, and urge the
political parties and candidates to live up to their pledge.
