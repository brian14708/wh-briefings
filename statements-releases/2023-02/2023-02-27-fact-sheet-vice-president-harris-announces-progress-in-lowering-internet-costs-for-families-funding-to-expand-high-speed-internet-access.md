title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Progress in Lowering Internet\
  \ Costs for Families, Funding to Expand High Speed Internet\_Access"
---
 
*Over 16 million households now saving $500 million per month, thanks to
the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)*  
   
*Vice President announces over $175 million for Minority Serving
institutions to connect more young Americans with affordable, high-speed
internet*  
 

High-speed internet has become an essential tool to access education,
healthcare, and work. Still, too many are left without high-speed
internet because of lacking infrastructure, costs or the lack of skills
to utilize the technology. This is particularly notable in communities
of color, rural communities and among older Americans where the lack of
affordable, reliable high-speed internet is compounding economic, health
and other disparities.  
   
That’s why President Biden and Vice President Harris worked with
Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to include a record $65 billion
in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand “Internet for All” — so
that everyone in America has access to reliable and affordable
high-speed internet. The Administration also secured critical funding
for affordable high-speed internet in the American Rescue Plan and
general appropriations laws. The Administration’s efforts are centered
around three principles—access, affordability and equity.  Across the
laws, Internet for All programs will build high-speed internet
infrastructure, teach digital skills, and provide necessary technology
to ensure that everyone in America has the access and skills they need
to fully participate in today’s society.   
   
Today in South Carolina, Vice President Harris is highlighting the
impact of these investments to date, while announcing new milestones in
the effort to increase access to affordable, reliable, high-speed
internet and close the digital divide including:  
 

-   The Affordable Connectivity Program’s (ACP) enrollment is now up 40%
    since President Biden and Vice President Harris launched
    GetInternet.gov;
-   Consumers are now saving over $500M per month as a result of the
    ACP;
-   The Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and
    Information Administration (NTIA) is announcing more than $175
    million to 61 Minority Serving Institutions for internet access,
    equipment, and training; and,
-   NTIA is committing to an intentional HBCU engagement strategy to
    ensure these institutions find applicable resources to connect their
    campuses and communities.

   
**<u>Lowering Costs</u>**  
   
Approximately 1 in 5 Americans who do not use the internet cite cost as
the key factor.  These consumers are more likely to have school aged
kids, make under $25,000 per year and identify as a person of color. 
Since so much of our society has moved online, this discrepancy can
continue to exacerbate other inequalities. The Affordable Connectivity
Program is designed to help close this divide.  
   
The Affordable Connectivity Program, authorized by the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, is a key part of the Administration’s [Internet for
All](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=6db270d234&e=0ca263633c)
initiative and the largest internet affordability program in our
nation’s history. Experts estimate that as many as [48 million
households](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=3f77e88081&e=0ca263633c)—or
nearly 40% of households in the country—qualify for the ACP.  
   
The Affordable Connectivity Program, administered by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), provides eligible households up to
$30/month (or $75/month on qualifying Tribal lands) off internet bills,
as well as a one-time discount of up to $100 off a laptop, desktop
computer or tablet. To further lower costs, in May 2022, President Biden
and Vice President Harris announced commitments from internet service
providers across the country to offer high-speed plans that are fully
covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program—meaning millions of
working families can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime.
They simultaneously launched
[GetInternet.gov](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=88bf9e45ed&e=0ca263633c)—a
one-stop shop to check eligibility and sign up.  
   
In July 2022, the Vice President made a call to action to states and
federal agencies to help spread the word about the Affordable
Connectivity Program.  This call to action led to tens of millions of
text messages, emails, letters and flyers sent directly to consumers to
inform them about this opportunity.    
   
Today, Vice President Harris is announcing another milestone in this
program.**  The Affordable Connectivity Program is now reaching over 16
million households, saving Americans over half-a-billion dollars per
month.**  This is a 40% increase since the announcement of
[GetInternet.gov](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=4e000cb9ec&e=0ca263633c).  
   
**<u>Centering Equity in Access</u>**  
   
For consumers who do not cite affordability as an impediment to access
there could be other factors such as, a shortage of modern
infrastructure in their area, unavailability of devices or a lack of
support to gain digital skills.  That’s why the Biden-Harris
Administration’s “Internet for All” initiative is taking a holistic
approach to closing the digital divide.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration believes that a strong economy is an
equitable economy and today’s economy is online. Closing the digital
divide will allow Americans to access the resources they need and
strengthen the U.S. economy to compete in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.  
 

-   **American Rescue Plan:** For over 20 years, now we have had a
    digital divide in this country – and the pandemic further
    accentuated the problem. President Biden responded with the American
    Rescue Plan to provide the immediate support communities needed to
    increase access during the pandemic. Nationally, the American Rescue
    Plan has provided more than $25 billion for high-speed internet
    infrastructure and adoption. 
-   **Bipartisan Infrastructure Law:** Last summer, every state and
    territory signed-on to the “Internet for All” initiative, agreeing
    to participate in the Digital Equity and Broadband, Equity, Access
    and Deployment (BEAD) programs funded through President Biden’s
    [Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=2480eaca7d&e=0ca263633c)
    and implemented by the Department of Commerce’s National
    Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). NTIA is on
    track to announce allocations for the BEAD program by June
    30<sup>th</sup> 2023. This program is the largest single tranche of
    funding and will provide nearly $42 billion nationwide.

   
To ensure funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is utilized to
connect those who need it most, the Biden-Harris Administration recently
announced funding for **$53 million in state planning funds for digital
equity**.  With this investment, every state, DC and Puerto Rico will
produce a digital equity plan to enhance adoption and use of the
internet across [covered
populations](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=96f5059c49&e=0ca263633c)
in their state.  These plans are intended to support the creation of
community-centric solutions, including partnerships with community
organizations and anchor institutions.  
   
Today’s announcement helps kick-off this work, **providing over $175
million to 61 Minority Serving Institutions.**  These grants funded
through the Department of Commerce’s [Connecting Minority Communities
Pilot
Program](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=16c0ef00ed&e=0ca263633c)
will help schools fund enhancements to high-speed internet
infrastructure, purchase equipment, devices and software, and provide
digital skills training and upskilling for IT staff. Minority Serving
Institutions serve as centers of academic excellence all across the
country and serve as a catalyst to develop leaders for our nation. 
Today’s, announcement is an investment in those students.    
   
To ensure that HBCU’s are fully included and utilized in the process to
expand affordable high-speed internet across the country, the
Biden-Harris Administration is committing to an **intentional HBCU
engagement strategy**. This strategy recognizes that while these
institutions are critical anchors that deliver outsized impacts, they
often reside in communities that have long faced a disproportionate lack
of access.  This commitment will provide each HBCU with direct contact
to a Federal Program Officer within their state that will help these
institutions find applicable resources to execute their own programs,
participate in the state-wide high-speed internet and digital equity
planning programs, and help facilitate the promotion of the ACP on
campus and within their communities.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration’s [Internet for All
Initiative](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=c4ed154e63&e=0ca263633c)
will ensure that every American has access to reliable and affordable
high-speed internet. For more information about how the Biden-Harris
