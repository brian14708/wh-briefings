title: "Readout of White\_House State Legislative Convening on Paid\_Leave"
---
 
Ahead of the 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave
Act, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
Gender Policy Council, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the
President and Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental
Affairs, convened state legislators on the frontlines of advancing paid
family and medical leave in their respective states. White House senior
staff and officials from the Department of Labor, including the Women’s
Bureau, also participated.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration continues to support a national paid
family and medical leave program for families across the country and
applauds states that have made significant progress in advancing paid
leave. Currently, 11 states and the District of Columbia have passed
paid family and medical leave laws.  
  
Thanks to elected leaders and advocates, several states are prioritizing
paid family and medical leave legislation this session, including
Minnesota, where House Speaker Melissa Hortman and Senate Majority
Leader Kari Dziedzic are making this effort a top priority. In 2020, the
Vermont legislature passed paid family and medical leave legislation,
only to see the bill vetoed. This session, legislative leaders are ready
to push again for working families.  
  
White House officials thanked the legislators for their leadership and
affirmed the Administration’s support and partnership in advancing paid
family and medical leave throughout the country.   
  
Participating state legislative leaders included:

-   Illinois Representative Sonya Harper
-   Maine Representative Kristen Cloutier
-   Maine Senator Mattie Daughtry
-   Michigan Representative Brenda Carter
-   Michigan Representative Helena Scott
-   Michigan Senator Erika Geiss
-   Minnesota Senator Alice Mann
-   New Mexico Representative Linda Serrato
-   Pennsylvania Representative Jen O’Mara
-   Pennsylvania Representative Liz Fiedler
-   Vermont Representative Emilie Kornheiser
