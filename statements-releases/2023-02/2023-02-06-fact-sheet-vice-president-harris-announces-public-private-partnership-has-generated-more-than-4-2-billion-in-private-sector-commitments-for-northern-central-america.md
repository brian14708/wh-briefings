*More than $950 million announced today will create economic opportunity
in the region, help address root causes of migration.*

Vice President Kamala Harris and the Partnership for Central America
today announced more than $950 million in new private sector commitments
in response to her Call to Action for Northern Central America, bringing
the overall total to more than $4.2 billion since May 2021.  These
investments will help address the root causes of migration by creating
economic opportunity in the region.  The Partnership for Central
America, which was launched with Vice President Harris in May 2021, has
played a crucial role in mobilizing these new commitments.  As part of
this public-private partnership, approximately 47 companies and
organizations are collaborating across financial services, textiles and
apparel, agriculture, technology, telecommunications and nonprofit
sectors to strengthen the region’s economic security. These investments
are creating jobs, connecting people to the digital economy, expanding
access to financing for small businesses, providing training and
education for youth and workers, and improving economic livelihoods for
people in the region.  
   
As part of her role leading U.S. government efforts to address the root
causes of migration from northern Central America, in May 2021, the Vice
President launched the Call to Action for businesses and social
enterprises to make significant commitments to promote economic
opportunity for people in the region.  This is in support of the U.S.
Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration, which the Vice
President launched in July 2021.
