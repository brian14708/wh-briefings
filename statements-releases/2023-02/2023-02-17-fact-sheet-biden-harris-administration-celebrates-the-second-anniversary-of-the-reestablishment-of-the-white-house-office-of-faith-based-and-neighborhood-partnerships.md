title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Celebrates the Second Anniversary\
  \ of the Reestablishment of the White\_House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood\_\
  Partnerships"
---
 
Two years ago this week, President Biden signed an executive order
reestablishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood
Partnerships (the “Partnerships Office”). The  mission of this office is
to serve people in need by collaborating with interested faith-based and
community organizations. The Partnerships Office is an essential part of
the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to bring people of all
backgrounds and beliefs together to meet our challenges, build a more
perfect union, and restore the soul of our country.  
  
The Partnerships Office works with agency Centers for Faith-Based and
Neighborhood Partnerships (“agency Centers”) at the Departments of
[Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/ocr/eia/fbnp),
[Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/bureaus-and-offices/os/faith-based-and-neighborhood-partnerships),
[Education,](https://sites.ed.gov/cfbnp/) [Health and Human
Services](https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/partnerships/index.html),
[Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/faith), [Housing and Urban
Development](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/faith_based), and
[Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/cfbnp/); the [U.S. Agency for
International
Development](https://www.usaid.gov/local-faith-and-transformative-partnerships);
the [Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/); and staff at
[AmeriCorps](https://www.americorps.gov/partner/partnerships), the
[Environmental Protection
Agency](http://www.energystar.gov/congregations), the [Department of
Labor](https://www.dol.gov/), and [the Department of
Transportation.](https://www.transportation.gov/) Over the past year,
this team has collaborated with a wide range of faith-based and
neighborhood organizations to advance shared priorities such as
safeguarding the right to practice faith without fear; expanding
opportunity, especially for disadvantaged or underserved communities;
responding to disasters; helping people struggling with mental health
and substance use problems; improving maternal and child health;
addressing hunger and nutrition; welcoming refugees; protecting the
environment; and assisting with preparedness, response, and recovery
from COVID-19.  
  
Administration achievements that promote these priorities include:  
  
**Safeguarding the right to practice faith without fear and other
aspects of religious freedom**

-   Hosted the first-ever White House [United We Stand
    Summit](https://unitedwestand.gov/) on countering hate-motivated
    violence, including attacks on houses of worship, in September 2022.
    Faith and community leaders played prominent roles at this event,
    including by leading the program’s opening moment of silence,
    serving as panelists and moderators at the event, receiving
    [honors](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/15/fact-sheet-the-united-we-stand-summit-taking-action-to-prevent-and-address-hate-motivated-violence-and-foster-unity/)
    for their bridge-building work across the country, and launching new
    bridge-building efforts. For example, Interfaith America, the YMCA,
    and Habitat for Humanity, launched *A Nation of Bridge Builders*, a
    new partnership that is training 10,000 Americans to be bridge
    builders in their neighborhoods and hosting over 1,000
    bridge-building events in over 300 communities.

-   On December 12, 2022, President Biden
    [announced](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/12/statement-from-white-house-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-inter-agency-group-to-counter-antisemitism/)
    the establishment of a new interagency policy committee (IPC), led
    by Domestic Policy Council and National Security Council staff, to
    increase and better coordinate our efforts to counter antisemitism,
    Islamophobia, and related forms of discrimination and bias in our
    country. As its first order of business, the President directed the
    IPC to develop a national strategy to counter antisemitism. Earlier
    in December 2022, Second Gentleman of the United States Douglas
    Emhoff, Ambassador Susan Rice, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, and
    Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt held a roundtable meeting with diverse
    Jewish stakeholders on the alarming spike in antisemitism in the
    United States.
-   Through the Protecting Places of Worship Interagency Policy
    Committee (IPC), coordinated efforts to support the safety and
    security of places of worship. On the tenth anniversary of the
    heinous attack on the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, the IPC
    announced an initial set of steps [to protect places of worship and
    congregants](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/05/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-action-to-protect-places-of-worship/),

    which provides support for increasing the physical security of
    nonprofit organizations, including houses of worship and other
    religious affiliated entities. In his fiscal year 2023 budget

    related to protecting houses of worship, preparedness, and enhanced
    coordination with the faith community.

    to highlight ways faith and community leaders can get involved in
    addressing concerns about maternal and child health. Before, during,
    and after childbirth, [women in our country are
    dying](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F06%2FMaternal-Health-Blueprint.pdf&data=05%7C01%7CQue.English%40hhs.gov%7C84c849747bc14dd34b2b08db045d5354%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C638108571094389144%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=E3yPnSEPgGMed8Qi0NmIrt3eiE4lB2Lb01IS12TeHhw%3D&reserved=0)
    at a higher rate from pregnancy-related causes than in any other
    developed nation. That problem is particularly pronounced for many
    women from Black, Native, and rural communities.
-   Hosted a series of webinars on [workplace protections for new and
    expecting
    mothers](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/events/08102022/working-mothers-what-expect-your-employer-when-youre-expecting).
    Workers, worker advocates, employers, and other stakeholders were
    provided with information on federal laws that protect pregnant
    workers from discrimination, provide time off for the birth or
    adoption of a child, and ensure nursing workers can take breaks to
    pump breast milk while at work.
-   Included community and faith-based organizations in the first [White
    House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and
    Health](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhealth.gov%2Four-work%2Fnutrition-physical-activity%2Fwhite-house-conference-hunger-nutrition-and-health%2Fconference-details&data=05%7C01%7C%7C186ee6b722ac4330f38708db0ae5bf1f%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638115754090194040%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=V4bF1fcv7RZLgH44rp7hvKeHOEaH77GVa7hkjL0ty3U%3D&reserved=0)
    in over 50 years and in the development and implementation of the
    [National
    Strategy](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F09%2FWhite-House-National-Strategy-on-Hunger-Nutrition-and-Health-FINAL.pdf&data=05%7C01%7C%7C186ee6b722ac4330f38708db0ae5bf1f%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638115754090194040%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=DzrUa9lQf3lnN7r%2FzDOo8BglAlB37%2F0klizjm83Hn%2FA%3D&reserved=0)
    on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. Feedback from these stakeholders
    has assisted in informing new school meal investments, food package
    rules for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
    Infants, and Children program, and expanding nutrition services in
    Medicare and Medicaid, all of which will provide robust food and
    nutrition security outcomes for children and families across the
    country.
-   Moved to make kosher and halal foods more available to nutrition
    assistance customers, including by engaging with faith institutions,
    food banks, and other external stakeholders. Published a [Federal
    Register
    Notice](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalregister.gov%2Fdocuments%2F2022%2F10%2F28%2F2022-23513%2Fbarriers-facing-small-firms-and-businesses-providing-halal-kosher-and-organic-products-in-commodity&data=05%7C01%7C%7C0db941dbabec434ce8ae08db0b84c531%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638116437087856061%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=TNafaM%2FNdYyMtYIO0LzUCU460S3U0vjruOiVJBppjEw%3D&reserved=0)
    seeking input addressing the barriers faced by small and
    disadvantaged businesses, including businesses selling kosher and
    halal foods, and worked with USDA’s Commodity Procurement Program to
    ensure that such businesses could become approved vendors, which
    would increase kosher and halal products in National Nutrition
    Programs.

**Welcoming refugees, including Ukrainians and Afghan allies, and new
Americans**

-   Supported the launch of the [Welcome
    Corps](https://welcomecorps.org/) by connecting faith and community
    leaders with this new service opportunity for Americans to welcome
    refugees seeking freedom and safety and, in turn, make a difference
    in their own communities. Together, sponsor groups welcome refugee
    newcomers by securing and preparing initial housing, greeting
    refugee newcomers at the airport, enrolling children in school, and
    helping adults find employment.
-   In coordination with [Operation Allies
    Welcome](https://www.dhs.gov/allieswelcome), continued [a webinar
    series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLboghAh_6lzM7AGqQSyPdZBUJcjT3LJg8) for
    faith and neighborhood organizations on supporting the resettlement
    of Afghan allies in the United States. Hosted [webinars focusing on
    partnerships with local education agencies in resettlement
    efforts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSXuq_LeFLA&list=PLboghAh_6lzM7AGqQSyPdZBUJcjT3LJg8&index=5)
    and [helping Afghan allies participate in business
    development.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdSU4nfcEaM&list=PLboghAh_6lzM7AGqQSyPdZBUJcjT3LJg8&index=6) Also,
    [AmeriCorps
    NCCC](https://americorps.gov/serve/americorps/americorps-nccc/life-americorps-nccc)
    has worked with local partners to support nineteen projects in ten
    states that help Afghan families resettle in the United States.
    Teams have assisted more than 6,500 Afghan allies at mass care
    facilities and sorted through more than 122,000 pounds of donations.
    Those interested in supporting the resettlement of Afghan allies can
    go to [Welcome.us](https://welcome.us/) to learn more about how to
    get involved.
-   Partnered with community and faith leaders in support of [Uniting
    for Ukraine](https://www.dhs.gov/ukraine), an innovative approach to
    provide a safe and orderly process for displaced Ukrainians who have
    been impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to come to the United
    States with the support of a sponsor. Also, President Biden sent
    Easter greetings to Ukrainian American Christians, giving thanks for
    the extraordinary unity and resolve we are seeing around the world
    in support of Ukrainians and promising to continue to stand with the
    people of a free and democratic Ukraine.
-   Connected leaders of secular and religious nonprofit organizations
    with the [Task Force on New
    Americans](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/02/executive-order-restoring-faith-in-our-legal-immigration-systems-and-strengthening-integration-and-inclusion-efforts-for-new-americans/),
    a body that coordinates the federal government’s efforts to ensure
    that lawfully present immigrants, including refugees, receive the
    support they need to fully participate in and contribute to our
    country and their communities. The Task Force is working to catalyze
    state and local integration and inclusion efforts and continues to
    engage with diverse stakeholders to develop a welcoming and
    integration action plan for the President. 

**Protecting the environment**

-   Expanded efforts to integrate [climate change
    adaptation](https://www.americorps.gov/about/what-we-do/climate),
    mitigation, and resilience across AmeriCorps programming. Efforts
    support community-based organizations that reduce greenhouse gas
    emissions, conserve lands and waters, and adapt to the changing
    climate. This expansion builds on 2021 efforts, where 16,000
    AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Senior volunteers improved more
    than 400,000 acres of parks and public lands; treated more than
    14,500 miles of trails or rivers; weatherized or retrofitted more
    than 7,000 homes or public structures; protected or restored nearly
    1,000 structures after natural disasters; and provided environmental
    stewardship education and training to more than 200,000 Americans.
-   Made it easier and more efficient for congregations to reduce
    pollution, including by launching a new webpage featuring [18 EPA
    programs with tools and resources for
    congregations](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/resources_topic/epa_small_business_congregation_resources),
    updating the [ENERGY STAR Action Workbook for
    Congregations](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/energy_star_action_workbook_congregations),
    and [facilitating webinars with nonprofit
    partners](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/resources_audience/congregations)
    on Inflation Reduction Act-funded grants through the [Efficiency
    Materials Pilot Program for
    Nonprofits](https://www.energy.gov/scep/energy-efficiency-materials-pilot-program-nonprofits).
-   [Convened over 400 faith and community
    leaders](https://www.usda.gov/ocr/eia/fbnp/past-events) to foster
    dialogue and partnerships on climate smart agriculture, climate
    smart commodities, and ways to help historically underserved
    communities.

**Promoting protection and recovery from COVID-19**

-   As part of a “Year of Action” working with civil society on COVID-19
    response efforts, USAID awarded $1.5 million in technical support
    and capacity-strengthening services to three USAID Missions to
    implement activities that engage and strengthen the capacity of
    local faith-based and community organizations to assist in COVID-19
    response.
-   Connected faith and community-based organizations with two
    Biden-Harris Administration initiatives to promote academic recovery
    in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis: The [National Partnership for
    Student
    Success](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/05/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-national-effort-to-support-student-success/)
    (a public-private partnership with AmeriCorps and the Department of
    Education) to recruit, screen, train, support, and engage an
    additional 250,000 caring adults in roles serving as tutors,
    mentors, student success coaches, wraparound service coordinators,
    and post-secondary transition coaches; and the [Engage Every Student
    Initiative](https://www.ed.gov/ost?src=rn), which is working to
    ensure that every student who wants a spot in a high-quality
    out-of-school-time program has one.
-   In spring 2022, [Public Health
    AmeriCorps](https://www.americorps.gov/newsroom/press-release/americorps-cdc-award-more-60-million-public-health-americorps-programs-part)
    invested in 82 programs across the country to support COVID-19
    pandemic recovery and meet the public health needs of local
    communities. As of January 2023, more than 1,100 Public Health
    AmeriCorps members are providing much-needed capacity and support in
    local public health settings and advancing more equitable health
    outcomes for historically and currently underserved
    communities. AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers
    [provided COVID-19 pandemic related
    assistance](https://www.americorps.gov/newsroom/americorps-announces-new-grant-covid-19-recovery-efforts)
    to more than 12.3 million Americans, supporting vaccination, contact
    tracing, testing, and wellness checks, among other public health
    services. In addition, these programs assisted food banks and
    meal-delivery programs and helped students stay on track through
    services such as virtual teaching, tutoring, and mentoring.
-   Over the last year, AmeriCorps has invested in thousands of
    nonprofit, faith, and community-based organizations across the
    nation addressing COVID-19 pandemic response, economic opportunity,
    and environmental conservation, among other critical needs. This
    includes a [$580 million
    investment](https://www.americorps.gov/newsroom/americorps-awards-more-580-million-state-national-service-programs)
    through the AmeriCorps State and National program, the largest
    investment in agency history supported by AmeriCorps’ historic $1
    billion American Rescue Plan investment from the Biden-Harris
    Administration.
