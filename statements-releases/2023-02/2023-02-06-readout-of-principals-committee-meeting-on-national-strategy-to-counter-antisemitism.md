title: "Readout of Principals Committee Meeting on National Strategy to Counter\_\
  Antisemitism"
---
 
Today, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan
Rice, and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall convened a
Principals Committee Meeting of the Interagency Group to Counter
Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and Related Forms of Discrimination and
Bias. The group’s first order of business is to develop a national
strategy to counter antisemitism.  
   
President Biden has made rooting out antisemitism an urgent priority of
his Administration. Antisemitism harms not only Jewish Americans; it
hurts all Americans. Today’s meeting focused on the recent spike in
antisemitism, potential steps the Biden-Harris Administration can take
to address antisemitism — including ideas for action that the federal
government and other stakeholders can pursue to counter antisemitism in
the U.S. — and a plan of action for developing the national strategy.
Second Gentleman Emhoff shared learnings from his recent trip to Poland
and Germany, including global efforts to combat antisemitism. He
underscored the need for a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to
tackle antisemitism and all forms of hatred in the U.S.  
   
Separately, the working group also has begun hosting listening sessions
with external stakeholders and experts to help inform the national
strategy to counter antisemitism. The goal is to hear directly from a
wide range of stakeholders, including the Jewish community, civil rights
and faith leaders, civil society, the private sector and others on how
to counter antisemitism as a threat both to the Jewish community and all
Americans.
