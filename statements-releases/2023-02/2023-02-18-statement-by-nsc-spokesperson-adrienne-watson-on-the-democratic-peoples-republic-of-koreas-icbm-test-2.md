The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea’s (DPRK) Intercontinental ballistic missile test. This launch is
a flagrant violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. While
U.S. INDOPACOM has assessed it did not pose an immediate threat to U.S.
personnel, or territory, or to our allies, this launch needlessly raises
tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region.
It only demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize
its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs
over the well-being of its people. We urge all countries to condemn
these violations and call on the DPRK to cease its destabilizing actions
and engage in serious dialogue. The national security team is closely
coordinating with our allies and partners. The United States will take
all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland
and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
