title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on U.S. Nomination of Ajay Banga to Lead\
  \ World\_Bank"

Ajay Banga will be a transformative World Bank President as the
institution works to deliver on its core development goals and address
pressing global challenges, including climate change. Since I was
elected Vice President, Ajay and I have worked closely together on a new
model of public-private partnership designed to address the root causes
of migration in Northern Central America. Through that partnership,
nearly 50 businesses and organizations have mobilized to generate more
than $4.2 billion in commitments that will create opportunity and hope
for people in the region. Ajay has brought great insight, energy, and
persistence to the challenges of promoting economic development and
tackling the root causes of migration.
