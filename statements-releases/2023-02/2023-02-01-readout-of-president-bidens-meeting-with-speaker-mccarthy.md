title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with Speaker\_McCarthy"
---
 
As part of a series of meetings with congressional leaders, President
Biden hosted Speaker McCarthy in the Oval Office this afternoon, where
they had a frank and straightforward dialogue.  
   
They covered a range of issues and President Biden underscored that he
is eager to continue working across the aisle in good faith, after
passing historic bipartisan laws during his first two years in office.  
   
President Biden made clear that, as every other leader in both parties
in Congress has affirmed, it is their shared duty not to allow an
unprecedented and economically catastrophic default. The United States
Constitution is explicit about this obligation, and the American people
expect Congress to meet it in the same way all of his predecessors have.
It is not negotiable or conditional.  
   
The President welcomes a separate discussion with congressional leaders
about how to reduce the deficit and control the national debt while
continuing to grow the economy. This conversation should build on the
President’s leadership in delivering a record $1.7 trillion in deficit
reduction in his first two years in office.  
   
The President and the Speaker agreed to continue the conversation.
