Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Munich, Germany February

one-year anniversary of Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of
Ukraine, the Vice President’s engagements in Munich will demonstrate
Transatlantic unity and resolve; U.S. global leadership; and our
enduring commitment to support Ukraine. In addition to delivering a
speech as part of the conference, the Vice President will meet with
foreign leaders and continue our intensive diplomatic engagement with
allies and partners regarding the war in Ukraine as well as other
regional and global issues.
