title: "Readout of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s Meeting with Historically\
  \ Black College and University\_Presidents"
---
 
Today, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake
Sullivan met with 18 leaders of Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to discuss a range of issues, including
partnerships to advance national security, recruitment of graduates from
their campuses for national security careers, and campus security. This
was the first ever engagement with HBCU leaders by a national security
advisor.  

HBCU presidents shared their desire to expand partnerships with Federal
agencies to support groundbreaking research and improve curriculums to
meet national security needs.  HBCU presidents discussed ongoing work
connected to critical national security topics including data science,
cybersecurity, artificial intelligence & machine learning,
nano-technology, energy systems, and international affairs.  HBCU
presidents also shared their commitment to work with the White House and
Federal agencies to update their curriculums in criminal justice
programs and humanities programs to include topics on security studies
and factors that can contribute to mobilization to violence.  

HBCU presidents also spoke about security challenges facing their
institutions, most notably the challenges and concerns associated with
recent bomb threats against HBCUs. Mr. Sullivan discussed existing U.S.
Government resources available to campuses to help to bolster their
preparedness and resilience against both physical and cyber-attacks,
including the [HBCU Bomb Threat Resource
Guide](https://sites.ed.gov/whhbcu/files/2022/03/3.16.22-HBCU-Bomb-Threat-Resource-Guide-Final.pdf),
[Stop Ransomware Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/resources),
and [SHIELDS Up Resource Guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up). 

During the conversation, Mr. Sullivan also spoke to HBCU leaders about
existing efforts to recruit talent from HBCUs and other minority-serving
institutions, including through work President Biden directed in his
[White House Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy and
National Security Workforce, Institutions, and
Partnerships](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/memorandum-revitalizing-americas-foreign-policy-and-national-security-workforce-institutions-and-partnerships/). 
Additionally, Mr. Sullivan listened to feedback on how to expand the
talent pipeline for national security and foreign policy fields.  He
articulated how the Administration is addressing some of the challenges
that can prevent students from entering national security professions,
including steps such as improving hiring timelines; expanding paid
internships and student loan repayment; and broadening fellowships.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting the vital
mission of HBCUs. Through the American Rescue Plan, grant funding, and
by forgiving capital improvement debt of many these institutions,
President Biden has already committed nearly $6 billion in support.
