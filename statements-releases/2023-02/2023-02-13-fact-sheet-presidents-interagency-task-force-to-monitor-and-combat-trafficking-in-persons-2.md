title: "FACT SHEET: President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat\
  \ Trafficking in\_Persons"
---
 
Today, the President’s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat
Trafficking in Persons (PITF) met for the second time in the
Biden-Harris Administration.  A member of the U.S. Advisory Council on
Human Trafficking also joined the meeting and spoke about the Council’s
2022 report, which includes insights and recommendations for how the
Federal Government can strengthen its policy and programming efforts
that reflect the expertise of those with lived experience of human
trafficking.  In addition, the PITF meeting focused on efforts thus far
and in the coming year to implement the updated National Action Plan,
released on December 3, 2021, which builds upon the core components of
the Federal Government’s commitment to ending human trafficking.   
The Federal Government’s anti-trafficking efforts—to include
implementing the [National Action Plan to Combat Human
Trafficking](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/National-Action-Plan-to-Combat-Human-Trafficking.pdf)—are
coordinated by the PITF, a cabinet-level entity created by the
Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000.   
  
Because human trafficking disproportionately impacts communities of
color, women and girls, LGBTQI+ individuals, migrants, and others from
historically marginalized and underserved communities, the National
Action Plan seeks to link anti-trafficking strategies to the
Biden-Harris Administration’s broader efforts to advance equity and
support for underserved communities.  The plan reflects the
Administration’s commitment to gender and racial equity, workers’
rights, preventing and addressing forced labor in global supply chains,
and ensuring safe, orderly, and humane migration.  
  
Specifically, the PITF agencies are focused on the following
initiatives, rooted in a shared commitment to exercise trauma- and
survivor-informed approaches and centered around the foundational
pillars of U.S. and global anti-trafficking efforts: prevention,
protection, prosecution, and partnerships:

***<u>Prevention</u>***

-   In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will
    increase efforts with tribal leaders and Indigenous community
    organizations to address the intersections of human trafficking and
    missing and murdered indigenous persons and focus the HHS Look
    Beneath the Surface Campaign to partner with organizations in
    directly reaching child and youth populations at highest risk for
    human trafficking.  
     
-   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will enhance and expand
    its counter-forced labor efforts. DHS will strengthen engagement
    with the private sector, including by publishing additional
    information on importer compliance, as the Department continues to
    enforce the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFPLA).  DHS will
    also develop comprehensive labor-trafficking training to better
    equip its criminal investigators with the expertise and tools they
    need to hold perpetrators accountable and identify and assist
    victims.  
     
-   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is developing new
    materials on human trafficking for its Youth@Work program, a
    national education and outreach campaign to promote equal employment
    opportunity for America’s next generation of workers.  
     
-   The Department of State (State) recently launched two multi-phase,
    long-term programs to effect behavioral change toward child forced
    begging and domestic work.  Through each multi-year phase, these
    programs will research the issues, engage with local communities,
    and pilot evidence-based interventions beginning in Liberia, Niger,
    and Nigeria.  
     
-   The Department of Defense (DOD) is developing a DOD Instruction to
    prevent the procurement of resale goods produced by force or child
    labor.  The instruction will enable Military Resale Entities to have
    consistent processes to reasonably ensure that resale goods are not
    produced with forced or child labor.  
     
-   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the
    Department of Commerce are co-leading interagency efforts to counter
    human trafficking, specifically in seafood supply chains.  This
    involves collaboration among those working on civil-military
    cooperation and the U.S. Coast Guard to identify indicators of
    forced labor during boarding inspections, along with relevant
    follow-up procedures when such indicators are present.  
     
-   In 2023, the Department of Education will continue to offer webinars
    and other helpful resources to for administrators, teachers,
    specialized instructional support personnel, parents, caregivers,
    and students that address and help combat human trafficking.  
     
-   As part of the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) commitment to
    the whole-of-government National Action Plan, its Federal Motor
    Carrier Safety Administration will continue requiring every state to
    permanently ban drivers convicted of trafficking from operating
    commercial vehicles.

***<u>Prosecution</u>***

-   Department of Labor (DOL) investigators are ramping up their
    referrals of labor trafficking cases for further investigations by
    authorized federal, state, and/or local law enforcement agencies.
     In addition to providing its investigators awareness and referral
    training and stepping up engagement with local human trafficking
    task forces, DOL will help increase federal forced labor
    prosecutions by providing its expertise on labor exploitation and
    child labor in the Federal Enforcement Work Group.  
     
-   DOL continues to work diligently to ensure that all trafficking
    victims in the United States receive the back wages they are
    entitled to under the law.  In the coming year, DOL will assist DOJ
    by providing information and training materials about its role in
    and processes for calculating forfeiture and restitution in both
    forced labor and sex trafficking cases.  
     
-   Throughout the coming year, DOJ’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit
    will continue to lead the interagency Forced Labor Initiative
    launched last year in partnership with the FBI, DHS, State’s DSS,
    and DOL.  Through this Initiative, an interagency Steering Group
    collaborates to assess forced labor threats; initiate investigations
    and prosecutions in relevant Districts; and provide specialized
    expertise and strategic guidance to advance District-level efforts
    to detect, investigate, and prosecute labor trafficking.  
     
-   This past year, State’s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) completed
    several forced labor investigations involving domestic workers of
    accredited foreign diplomats.  In the coming year, DSS will focus on
    complex transnational cases targeting sex trafficking organizations
    and forced labor associated with guest worker programs.  In
    addition, DSS’s Victims’ Resource Advocacy Program (VRAP) supported
    dozens of identified trafficking victims with services and plans to
    continue wrap-around support so victims are mentally and physically
    available to contribute to investigations, if they wish to do so.

***<u>Partnerships</u>***

-   In 2023, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations (USUN) will use its
    status as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council to
    advance anti-trafficking priorities.  USUN will look for
    opportunities to encourage the United Nations and member states to
    support and implement trauma-informed and survivor-led initiatives.
     USUN also will seek to highlight the importance of strengthening
    identification of and services for victims from underserved and
    marginalized populations and addressing forced labor in supply
    chains.  
     
-   In keeping with our commitments made in the Los Angeles Declaration
    on Migration and Protection, the United States and Mexico signed an
    historic agreement on labor mobility and the protection of
    participants in temporary foreign worker programs on the heels of
    last month’s North American Leaders’ Summit.  Through this
    agreement, we identified starting points for increasing coordinated
    efforts to protect the rights and equal employment of temporary
    workers throughout recruitment, job duration, and return home.  
     
-   Similarly, under the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and
    Protection, the United States is leading a multilateral policy
    action group to combat human smuggling and human trafficking.  Other
    participating countries include Argentina, El Salvador, Colombia,
    Guatemala, Paraguay, Panama, and Guyana.  
     
-   In 2023, DOL’s Employment and Training Administration’s National
    Monitor Advocate will partner with the National Farmworker Jobs
    Program and other partners to provide training on processing
    complaints regarding the suspected trafficking of agricultural
    workers, and will meet with stakeholders about improving employment
    and training services, including supportive services, for victims
    and survivors.
-   Through international fora such as the Financial Action Task Force
    (FATF) and the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units (Egmont
    Group), the Department of the Treasury continues to lead efforts
    with international partners to strengthen anti-money laundering and
    understanding of human trafficking, enhance global standards to
    combat illicit finance, exchange information to identify and disrupt
    networks, and include law enforcement and interagency partners in
    its efforts.  
     
-   In line with the National Action Plan, State continues exploring how
    it can further incorporate trauma- and survivor-informed approaches
    into its anti-trafficking work through its engagement with the U.S.
    Advisory Council on Human Trafficking and State’s Human Trafficking
    Expert Consultant Network (the Network), which comprises individuals
    with lived experience of human trafficking and other subject matter
    experts.  In 2022, State partnered with the Network on several key
    products, most notably to draft the 2022 Trafficking in Persons
    (TIP) Report introduction on survivor engagement.  For the 2023 TIP
    Report, the Network is advising on ethical storytelling practices so
    State can accurately illustrate to readers the many forms of human
    trafficking while protecting the privacy and dignity of victims and
    survivors.    
     
-   Through its long-standing partnership with the labor rights
    non-governmental organization (NGO) Verité, State will develop a new
    process that its acquisitions workforce can use to screen
    high-volume State contracts and determine if there are high risks of
    human trafficking within that contract’s supply chain.  This new
    process will enhance how State works with bidders and contractors in
    preventing and remediating human trafficking risks.  
     
-   Through the Global Labor Program-New Frontiers in Advancing Labor
    Rights, USAID will continue to lead its global efforts to combat
    human trafficking by addressing root causes, researching migration
    dynamics to better understand and prevent trafficking, and giving
    more voice and protections to the most vulnerable workers in several
    dozen countries across regions. USAID awarded a third and final
    award in August 2022 to Solidarity Center to complement its suite of
    next-generation programming.  This new $50 million, five-year
    program, with opportunities for buy-in up to $85 million, will run
    through 2027.  
     
-   HHS launched a public-private partnership to prevent human
    trafficking in the acquisition of healthcare and public health goods
    and services.  The partnership brings together survivors,
    researchers, acquisition professionals, suppliers, worker rights
    organizations, and policy subject matter experts to strengthen this
    sector of the United States’ critical infrastructure.  
     
-   DOT will continue working with transportation stakeholders and the
    over 550 transportation leaders who have signed a pledge to train
    and raise awareness among more than 1.3 million employees across all
    modes of transportation.  
     
-   The Department of the Interior and DOJ’s Not Invisible Act
    Commission (NIAC) is continuing its work to draft final
    recommendations to combat the Missing and Murdered Indigenous
    Peoples (MMIP) crisis through its six subcommittees, which are each
    focused on specific public safety and justice issues, including
    addressing human trafficking.  In the coming months, the NIAC will
    host in-person hearings to gather public comments for inclusion in
    their final report to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland,
    Attorney General Merrick Garland, and the U.S. Congress.  The NIAC
    is a cross-jurisdictional joint committee composed of law
    enforcement, tribal leaders, federal partners, service providers,
    family members of missing and murdered individuals, and survivors.
