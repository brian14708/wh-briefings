title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Black Americans and Communities Across the\_Country"
---
 
Over the past two years, President Biden has worked to advance racial
equity and ensure the promise of America for Black Americans and all
communities across the country. From increasing access to homeownership
and rooting our discrimination in the housing market to promoting
entrepreneurship, from reducing child poverty to historic lows to
expanding access to quality affordable healthcare, from advancing voting
rights and police accountability to ensuring equal access to a good
education, the Biden-Harris Administration is ensuring that all African
American families and communities can live with dignity, safety, and
respect and enjoy true equal opportunity.  

**Economic Opportunity for Black Families and Communities.** By signing
into law the historic American Rescue Plan (ARP),  Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and implementing
robust regulatory reform, President Biden has led [the most equitable
economic recovery on
record](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-report-advancing-equity-through-the-american-rescue-plan/),
creating more than 12 million jobs since coming to office and helping
create new economic opportunities for African Americans, including
Black-owned businesses, and made long overdue investments in Black
communities. The President’s economic agenda has led to historically low
unemployment, including among Black Americans.

The Biden-Harris Administration’s vital policies and programs include: 

-   **Lowering Energy Costs and Creating Economic Opportunities Through
    the Inflation Reduction Act.** By signing the Inflation Reduction
    Act, President Biden is delivering on his promise to build an
    economy that works for working families, including Black families.
    President Biden and Congressional Democrats successfully fought to
    pass this historic legislation to help all Americans, including
    African Americans, who have been at the frontline of climate change,
    by lowering costs, advancing environmental justice while building a
    cleaner future, and growing the economy from the bottom up and the
    middle out by creating good-paying, union jobs across the country.
    The IRA will also lower the deficit and ask the ultra-wealthy and
    corporations to pay their fair share. No one earning under $400,000
    per year will pay a penny more in taxes. It’s also the most
    aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate crisis.  
    -   **Making Home Efficiency Upgrades More Affordable.** Households
        can save up to 30% with tax credits for efficient heating and
        cooling equipment that will save them hundreds of dollars on
        utility bills. Households can also save up to 30% with tax
        credits for home construction projects on windows, doors,
        insulation, or other weatherization measures that prevent energy
        from escaping homes. When families need to replace or upgrade
        stoves, ovens, or other home appliances, they can receive direct
        rebates when buying more energy efficient and electric
        appliances that can lower future utility bills by at least $350
        per year. Families in affordable housing units will benefit from
        resources to support projects that boost efficiency, improve
        indoor air quality, make clean energy or electrification
        upgrades, or strengthen their climate resilience.
    -   **Creating Economic Opportunities and Good Paying Jobs.** The
        IRA spurs solar project development in environmental justice
        communities by providing a 20% bonus credit for solar projects
        on federally-subsidized affordable housing projects and a 10%
        bonus credit for solar projects in low-income communities. It
        also creates a new Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator
        that will seed state and local clean energy financing
        institutions, support the deployment of distributed
        zero-emission technologies like heat-pumps and community solar
        and EV charging, while prioritizing over 50% of its investments
        in disadvantaged communities. The IRA expands clean energy tax
        credits for wind, solar, nuclear, clean hydrogen, clean fuels,
        and carbon capture including a bonus credit for businesses that
        pay workers a prevailing wage and hire using registered
        apprenticeship programs – so that the clean energy we use
        creates good-paying jobs.
    -   **Providing Relief to Farmers.** The Inflation Reduction Act
        includes $5.3 billion that will provide relief to tens of
        thousands of farmers. Of that money, $3.1 billion will help
        distressed borrowers pay off their farm debts without ultimately
        taking the land or making the farmer ineligible for future
        assistance. An additional $2.2 billion will go to farmers who
        have suffered discrimination by USDA farm programs.    
-   **Making Critical Investments in Black Families & Communities in the
    American Rescue Plan.** When President Biden signed the American
    Rescue Plan (ARP) into law, it provided a lifeline to millions of
    families who were struggling from the economic fallout of the
    pandemic.  
    -   **Historic Expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) – cutting
        child poverty to record lows for Black children.** ARP provided
        cash relief directly to low- and middle-income Americans, and
        cut Black child poverty by more than half in 2021.  The expanded
        Child Tax Credit provided a critical lifeline to millions of
        Black families during the nation’s recovery from the economic
        crisis created by the pandemic, and the President continues to
        urge Congress to extend this life-changing tax relief. In
        addition, the ARP increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
        Program (SNAP) benefits by 15% through September 2021. Beginning
        on October 1, 2021, USDA’s Thrifty Food Plan update increased
        SNAP benefits by $36.30 per person per month.  
    -   **Supporting Child Care Providers and Reducing Child Care Costs
        for Black Families.** Black families are nearly two times more
        likely than white parents to have to quit, turn down, or make a
        major change in their job due to child care disruptions. The
        American Rescue Plan provided a $39 billion lifeline to help
        child care providers stay open and compensate early childhood
        educators, as they provide safe and healthy environments for
        children and help parents work. States have already delivered
        American Rescue Plan stabilization grants to more [than 200,000
        child care
        providers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-funds-provided-a-critical-lifeline-to-200000-child-care-providers-helping-millions-of-families-to-work/),
        1 in 5 of whom are Black, serving as many as 9.5 million
        children and their families. In most states, [providers in 98%
        of persistent poverty counties received aid and more than half
        of the providers receiving funds were operating in the most
        racially diverse counties in the
        country](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-funds-provided-a-critical-lifeline-to-200000-child-care-providers-helping-millions-of-families-to-work/).
        One [survey](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.naeyc.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fwysiwyg%2Fuser-98%2Fnaeyc_ece_field_survey_february2022.pdf&data=05%7C01%7CRuth.Friedman%40acf.hhs.gov%7C68b0d1c6968b4915c22b08da4fe1dc13%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C637910128735916374%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=oRvZWvVB6wMpkM5RtLGePBraGyuhc6Hi0fFU0YqqIKI%3D&reserved=0) finds
        that 92% of providers receiving funds relied on them
        to help stay open and nearly half used them to repay debt
        incurred during the pandemic. Many states also used funds to
        help boost compensation of the child care workforce, which is
        disproportionately led by Black women. The ARP also helped lower
        child care costs for all families, including Black families,
        including by expanding the Child and Dependent Care Tax
        Credit—allowing a median income family with two kids under age
        13 to receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses,
        compared with a maximum of $1,200 previously.
    -   **The American Rescue Plan tripled the EITC for 17 million
        workers without dependent children.** The American Rescue Plan
        nearly tripled the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without
        dependent children for 2021 from $540 to $1,500 and extended the
        credit to younger and older workers. This was the first increase
        in the credit in real terms since 1993, and especially impacted
        front-line workers, including cashiers and retail salespeople,
        cooks and food prep workers, and childcare workers.
    -   **Helping Black Americans Stay in their Homes.** President
        Biden’s American Rescue Plan has helped Americans, including
        Black Americans, stay in their homes by providing emergency
        rental assistance. Over 8 million households were served by
        Emergency Rental Assistance. As of June 2022, Black Americans
        were the largest group that received this help, representing
        more than 41% of aid recipients.  The Administration implemented
        a series of measures that protected homeowners from foreclosure,
        including a foreclosure moratorium, increased options for
        mortgage payment forbearance, enhanced loan modifications to
        resolve delinquencies.  In addition, the ARP is helping
        struggling homeowners catch up with their mortgage payments and
        utility costs through the Homeowner Assistance Fund. As a result
        of these protections, foreclosure filings in 2021 were at a
        historic low with 29% fewer filings than in 2020 and 95% below
        the 2010 peak experienced in the previous economic downturn
        during the Great Recession. In addition, the ARP provided $10
        billion in funding for families and individuals who are
        recovering from or at risk of homelessness.
    -   **Extending a Lifeline to Struggling Small Businesses and
        Expanding Access to Capital.** Through the American Rescue Plan
        and the equitable implementation of emergency relief programs,
        President Biden and Vice President Harris have fostered the most
        equitable economic recovery on record. Over the last two years,
        Americans have applied to start 10.5 million new businesses,
        making 2021 and 2022 the strongest two years on record for new
        business applications, and with new business creation especially
        strong among entrepreneurs of color. The American Rescue Plan
        provided emergency grants, lending, and investment to hard-hit
        small businesses – including Black businesses – so they can
        rehire and retain workers and purchase the health and sanitation
        equipment they need to keep workers safe. This includes the new
        $10 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative, which will
        provide growth capital to early-stage companies and main street
        small businesses in economically disadvantaged areas, including
        minority-owned businesses.
    -   **Investing in Equitable Workforce Training.** The President is
        committed to creating pathways to the middle class, especially
        for people from underserved communities, by expanding
        skills-based hiring and increasing access to Registered
        Apprenticeship and workforce training. States, localities,
        community colleges, and community-based organizations have
        leveraged $40 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to
        deliver training, expand career paths, encourage more Registered
        Apprenticeships, provide retention and hiring bonuses in
        critical industries, and power efforts to help underserved
        Americans and those who face barriers to employment secure good
        jobs. In 2022, the Department of Labor awarded $121 million in
        grants to expand, diversify, and improve access to Registered
        Apprenticeships for underserved communities. The agency is also
        awarding $95 million help people in marginalized and
        underrepresented populations overcome barriers to career and
        technical education programs they need to connect with quality
        jobs.
-   **Ensuring Black Homeowners Get Full Value for their Homes.** In
    March 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration’s Interagency Task Force
    on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) released the PAVE
    Action Plan, which represents the most wide-ranging set of reforms
    ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process.
    Federal agencies are taking action on bias across all stages of the
    valuation process. For example, in January 2023, the Department of
    Housing and Urban Development proposed new guidance to make it
    easier and quicker for prospective borrowers applying for
    FHA-insured loans to request a Reconsideration of Value on a
    property if the initial valuation is lower than expected or there is
    indication of illegal bias.
-   **Protecting Black Americans’ Access to Housing by Combating Housing
    Discrimination.** Following President Biden’s Presidential
    Memorandum directing his Administration to address racial
    discrimination in the housing market, in January 2023, HUD published
    a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to fulfill obligations under the
    Fair Housing Act to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing. This rule
    will help overcome patterns of segregation and to hold state,
    localities, and public housing agencies that receive federal funds
    accountable for ensuring that underserved communities have equitable
    access to affordable housing opportunities.
-   **New Actions to Protect Renters and Promote Rental Affordability.**
    In January 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new
    actions to increase fairness in the rental market and further
    principles of fair housing. This includes actions to identify
    practices that may unfairly prevent applicants and tenants from
    accessing or staying in housing such as the use of tenant background
    checks, the use of algorithms in tenant screenings, and how an
    applicant’s source of income factors into housing decisions. These
    actions align with a new [Blueprint for a Renters Bill of
    Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-House-Blueprint-for-a-Renters-Bill-of-Rights-1.pdf).
    The Blueprint lays out a set of principles to drive action by the
    federal government, state and local partners, and the private sector
    to strengthen tenant protections and encourage rental affordability.
-   **Leveraging Federal Procurement to Narrow the Racial Wealth Gap for
    Black Entrepreneurs and Families.** Federal procurement is one of
    our most powerful tools to advance equity and build wealth in
    underserved communities, but only around 10% of federal agencies’
    total eligible contracting dollars typically go to small
    disadvantaged businesses, a category under federal law that includes
    Black-owned businesses. Recognizing the importance of using the
    government’s purchasing power to advance opportunity and equity, the
    Biden-Harris Administration has launched an all-of-government effort
    to expand contracting opportunities for underserved small
    businesses, including Black-owned businesses.  President Biden has
    set a goal of increasing the share of federal contracting dollars to
    small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by 2025— projected to
    translate to an additional $100 billion to minority-owned
    businesses, and helping more Americans realize their entrepreneurial
    dreams. In December 2021, the
    Administration [announced](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=3914654cd1&e=cf669202c8) 
    reforms to the federal procurement process to help meet the
    President’s ambitious target and deliver new opportunities for
    Black-owned and other small disadvantaged businesses.
-   **Advancing Equitable Employment Outcomes and Boosting Wages for
    Black Federal Workers.** On June 25, 2021, President Biden signed an
    Executive Order on Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and
    Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce. This Executive Order
    launched a whole-of-government initiative to cultivate a federal
    workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation and that
    advances equitable employment opportunities for workers from
    underserved communities. In September 2022, the Administration
    established a Chief Diversity Officers Executive Council to help
    implement and sustain efforts to advance DEIA across the federal
    workforce. Further, the President has taken a series of executive
    actions leading to a $15 minimum wage for employees of federal
    contractors and federal employees. These actions impacted more than
    370,000 workers in 2022 alone, including Black workers who
    disproportionately make up this population, helping to address
    longstanding wage disparities.
-   **Reversing Decades of Disinvestment Through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law.** For years, politicians have talked about
    investing in our national infrastructure, but up until now they have
    failed to follow through. The lack of investment has fallen most
    heavily on Black communities and other underserved communities. The
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will: replace lead pipes; increase
    access to training and good-quality jobs; expand affordable
    high-speed internet, reliable public transit, and clean drinking
    water; reconnect Black neighborhoods divided by legacy highway
    infrastructure; and provide other resources to finally give Black
    communities a fair shot at the American Dream.  
      
    During the 20<sup>th</sup> century, federally funded infrastructure
    projects too often segregated and harmed low-income communities,
    especially predominantly Black neighborhoods. Construction of the
    federal highway system in particular cut off once thriving Black
    communities from resources and opportunity.  
    -   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law launched a new Reconnecting
        Communities program, which will invest $1 billion to help
        reconnect communities that were previously cut off from economic
        opportunities by transportation infrastructure. In addition, the
        Inflation Reduction Act includes $3 billion for the Neighborhood
        Access and Equity Grant Program to help advance transportation
        projects in disadvantaged or underserved communities. Over the
        past year, DOT has awarded grants to multiple projects to
        reconnect communities including an interstate capping project in
        Atlanta, a greenway project in St. Louis, and the I-375 Detroit
        Community Reconnection Project.
    -   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law permanently authorized the
        Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) for the first time
        since its inception and elevated the agency head to the position
        of Under Secretary, granting the agency expanded power to
        support Black- and other minority-owned businesses. Don Cravins
        – former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of
        the National Urban League – was unanimously confirmed by the
        Senate this August to serve in this post.
    -   EPA announced in 2022 that it  has already allocated  [$2.9
        billion](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=f840c7c7b9&e=cf669202c8) in
        Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for lead service line
        replacement— the first allocation of $15 billion over five years
        dedicated to lead service line replacement. States can also
        leverage expanded eligibilities under the EPA’s Drinking Water
        State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) to spend up to $11.7 billion in
        additional DWSRF funds on lead service line replacement, plus
        funds from the American Rescue Plan to work towards the
        Administration’s goal of replacing 100% of the lead pipes and
        service lines. EPA will encourage states to use these funds to
        advance proactive lead line replacement programs with a
        particular focus on disadvantaged communities, including Black
        communities. Moving forward, EPA will continue to encourage
        states to prioritize communities with the highest lead levels
        and those with environmental justice concerns.
    -   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is the largest ever investment
        in tackling legacy pollution in American history by: cleaning up
        Superfund and Brownfield sites; reclaiming abandoned mine land;
        and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. More than one in four
        Black Americans live within 3 miles of a [Superfund
        site](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=406ac95a00&e=cf669202c8) –
        a higher percentage than for Americans overall.
-   **Assisting Black Land Owners in Resolving Title Issues.** An
    estimated 60% of Black-owned land in the South is heirs’
    property—property that passes through inheritance without a will and
    that, as a result, has historically rendered owners ineligible for
    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including lending.
    In July 2021, the USDA rolled out the Heirs’ Property Relending
    Program, which primarily aids underserved communities, including
    Black Americans. The new program provides funds to assist heirs in
    resolving ownership and succession issues on farmland with multiple
    owners.
-   **Dismantling Barriers to Accessing USDA Programs and Services.** In
    February 2022, USDA launched an Equity Commission Advisory Committee
    using ARP funds. The Equity Commission Advisory Committee advises
    the Secretary of Agriculture by identifying USDA programs, policies,
    systems, structures, and practices that contribute to barriers to
    inclusion or access, systemic discrimination, or exacerbate or
    perpetuate racial, economic, health, and social disparities. USDA is
    also investing $550 million in ARP funds for projects benefiting
    underserved agricultural producers and minority serving institutions
    that create career development opportunities for next generation
    leaders.  
-   **Launched an initiative to cut “junk” fees.** In September 2022,
    the President announced an initiative to reduce or eliminate hidden
    fees, charges, and add-ons for everything from banking services to
    cable and internet bills to airline and concert tickets. While the
    extra costs of junk fees affect everyone, many fees
    disproportionately impact lower-income households and people of
    color. Agencies have already taken a number of steps; for example
    CFPB has proposed a rule to slash excessive credit card late fees by
    an estimated $9 million per year, and has issued guidance to ban
    surprise overdraft fees and depositor (or “bounced check”) fees.

**Lowering Health Care Costs and Improving Health Outcomes for Black
Communities. **President Biden is committed to keeping health care costs
down for individuals and families and improving access to health care to
address disparities in Black communities. These policies and programs
include:

-   **Lowering Health Care Costs and Expanding Coverage.** Millions of
    lower- and middle-income Black families enrolled in health insurance
    marketplaces saw their premiums lowered or eliminated as a result of
    the ARP and will continue to benefit from provisions included in the
    Inflation Reduction Act. After substantially increasing Affordable
    Care Act Marketplace outreach and education, and with the American
    Rescue Plan’s enhanced and expanded premium tax credits, from 2020
    to 2022 there was an increase of 400,000 Black Americans enrolled in
    ACA coverage – a 49% increase.  
    -   Almost [3.9 million Black
        people](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/) were
        uninsured in 2019 before President Biden took office and
        over [570,000 Black
        people](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/taking-a-closer-look-at-characteristics-of-people-in-the-coverage-gap/) fell
        into the Medicaid “coverage gap” and were locked out of coverage
        because their state refused to expand Medicaid under the ACA.
        The Administration’s efforts to expand access to coverage has
        driven the uninsured rate to historic lows, with more than 3.6
        million people gaining coverage during last year’s recording
        breaking 16.3 million ACA enrollment period.  
        -   The Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower monthly premiums
            – more than three quarters of uninsured Black Americans had
            access to a plan with a monthly premium of $50 or less and
            about two thirds could find a plan for $0-premium plan in
            2021.
        -   By continuing the improvements made through ARP, the
            Inflation Reduction Act keeps free or low-cost health
            insurance available. [Over half a million more Black
            Americans](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/What%20If%20the%20American%20Rescue%20Plan%20Act%20Premium%20Tax%20Credits%20Expire.pdf) will
            have health insurance coverage in 2023, compared to without
            the IRA.
        -   As outlined in his February 2023 State of the Union address,
            the President is calling on Congress to make permanent the
            improved ACA tax credits that lower health care premiums for
            millions of Americans and to close the Medicaid coverage
            gap.  
-   **Lowering Prescription Drug Costs.** Among adults 65 and older,
    Black Medicare beneficiaries were roughly 1.5 times as likely as
    White beneficiaries to have trouble affording medications, and about
    2 times as likely to not fill needed prescriptions due to cost. The
    President’s prescription drug law caps the amount that seniors will
    have to pay for insulin at $35 per monthly prescription; as noted in
    his State of the Union address, the President calls on Congress to
    extend this commonsense, life-saving protection to all Americans,
    not just people with Medicare. This law also caps the amount that
    seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs they buy at the
    pharmacy at $2,000 a year and will further lower prescription drug
    costs for seniors by allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of
    high-cost drugs and requiring drug manufacturers to pay Medicare a
    rebate when they raise prices faster than inflation.
-   **Saving Americans $3,000 on hearing aids.** In October 2022,
    over-the-counter hearing aids hit the shelves following a rule from
    the Food and Drug Administration. Now, millions of Americans can buy
    hearing aids for low to moderate hearing loss without a prescription
    or exam. This is anticipated to save Americans as much as $3,000 per
    pair, providing more breathing room for the estimated 30 million
    Americans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.
-   **Protecting Black Maternal Health.** The Administration is also
    committed to protecting Black moms and improving maternal health
    outcomes, including addressing the unacceptably high rates of
    maternal mortality and morbidity that disproportionately impact
    Black mothers and families.  
      
    In June 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration’s [Blueprint for
    Addressing the Maternal Health
    Crisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Maternal-Health-Blueprint.pdf)
    was released to ensure a whole-of-government approach to combatting
    maternal mortality and morbidity through several key initiatives:  
    -   The Administration has approved requests from 35 states and DC
        to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage from 60 days to 12 months
        The Administration continues to encourage all states to take up
        this option so women can get the care they need to stay healthy.
    -   In December 2021, Vice President
        Harris [issued](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=42a57fd1ee&e=cf669202c8) a
        nationwide call to action to both public and private sectors to
        improve health outcomes for Black mothers and their children. As
        part of this call to action, HHS announced it would create a new
        “Birthing Friendly” hospital designation. This is the first-ever
        publicly reported, public-facing hospital designation on the
        quality and safety of maternity care. Already more than 25
        health plans have committed to displaying it in their provider
        directories, ensuring that more than 150 million Americans will
        have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their
        birth options for care.
    -   The Bipartisan year-end omnibus that the President signed in
        December 2022 advances many key pieces of the Blueprint,
        including: making permanent the state option to extend
        postpartum coverage from 60 days to 12 months; supporting and
        expanding maternal mental health screening programs, bolstering
        the maternal mental health hotline, and establishing a maternal
        mental health task force; reauthorizing and increasing funding
        for the Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting
        Program, which serves families at risk for poor maternal and
        child health outcomes; adding new workplace protections for
        pregnant and nursing workers; and supporting expansion of
        Maternal Mortality Review Committees and Perinatal Quality
        Collaboratives to all 50 states and territories.
        -   A More Diverse Maternal Care Workforce: Federal agencies
            will invest more in hiring, training, and deploying more
            physicians, certified nurse midwives, doulas, and community
            health workers to support women during pregnancy, delivery,
            and postpartum. The federal government will work to ensure
            these providers come from diverse communities and
            backgrounds.
        -   Better Access to Doulas and Midwives: The Administration
            will work with states to expand access to doulas and
            midwives, and encourage insurance companies to cover their
            services.  
-   **Protecting Public Health.** Climate change disproportionately
    impacts low-income communities and communities of color. Through the
    Inflation Reduction Act, the law will create Environmental Justice
    Block Grants, a $3 billion program to invest in community-led
    solutions, and another dedicated program to tackle pollution in port
    communities – where air pollution is especially dense and deadly. It
    will also fund programs to reduce outdoor and indoor air pollution,
    including for fenceline monitoring and screening near industrial
    facilities, clean energy retrofits in public housing, air quality
    sensors in disadvantaged communities, new and upgraded
    multipollutant monitoring sites, and monitoring and mitigation of
    methane and wood heater emissions. These grants will also help
    protect our children with investments to monitor and reduce
    pollution at public schools in disadvantaged communities.
-   **Hosting the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and
    Health.** The Biden-Harris Administration hosted the first
    conference on hunger, nutrition, and health in more than 50 years
    and released a National Strategy to end hunger and reduce
    diet-related diseases and disparities by 2030. The National Strategy
    outlines actions the federal government will take and includes calls
    on other sectors to drive solutions to achieve the President’s goal.
    This includes: creating a pathway for free, healthy school meals for
    all; expanding coverage of nutrition and obesity counseling in
    Medicare and Medicaid; extending the Child Tax Credit—which the
    President called on Congress to do during his State of the Union
    address—and ending the federal prohibition on SNAP benefits for
    formerly incarcerated individuals, which disproportionately impacts
    Black Americans. It also includes strategies to diversify the
    nutrition workforce, such as HHS partnering with HBCUs to recruit
    and train more Black nutrition professionals. The White House
    Conference galvanized stakeholders around the National Strategy and
    spurred over $8 billion in commitments from the public- and
    private-sectors.
-   **Proposing Rules to Significantly Reduce Tobacco-Related Disease
    and Death.** Cigarette smoking causes about 30% of all cancer deaths
    in the U.S. and is the leading cause of preventable death. In April
    2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced [two proposed
    rules](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-proposes-rules-prohibiting-menthol-cigarettes-and-flavored-cigars-prevent-youth-initiation) to
    ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. Studies estimate that
    banning menthol cigarettes could prevent as many as 654,000 deaths
    in the US – up to 238,000 among African Americans – over the next 40
    years. Banning flavored cigars – which are used by over half a
    million youth in the US – will help reduce nicotine dependence and
    improve health outcomes long-term. The Administration is also
    working to help people avoid smoking in the first place and support
    Americans who want to quit.  
-   **Improving the quality of home- and community-based services (HCBS)
    and promoting equity for Black older adults and individuals with
    disabilities.** Medicaid’s home- and community-based services (HCBS)
    provide support to older adults and individuals with disabilities
    who may need assistance with daily activities. Over 7 million people
    receive HCBS. However, research has shown that Black HCBS
    beneficiaries are less likely to receive case management services,
    equipment, technology, environmental modification services, and
    nursing services. In July 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
    Services (CMS) released the first-ever HCBS quality measure set to
    promote both consistent quality measurement within and across state
    Medicaid HCBS programs. CMS is encouraging states to adopt the
    measure set to improve the quality of HCBS but also as a critical
    step to promoting health equity in that it can help states identify
    racial, ethnic, and other disparities in quality, experience of
    care, and outcomes among the millions of people receiving long-term
    services and supports.
-   **Promoting equitable disability determinations.** Although African
    American people make up just 12% of the United States population,
    they make up about 35% of people with kidney failure.  In 2022, the
    Social Security Administration ended the agency’s use of a
    race-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (or eGFR) to measure
    kidney impairment, which was leading to the misdiagnosis of kidney
    impairment as less severe for many African Americans. Adjudicators
    will now use a single eGFR for all claimants regardless of race.
    This change in policy conforms with scientific advancements and
    recommendations from the medical community and kidney patients.
-   **Building the Pipeline of Black Health Care Providers.** The
    Administration made a historic $1.5 billion investment to help grow
    and diversify the nation’s health care workforce, and bolster
    equitable health care in the communities that need it most during
    the COVID-19 pandemic and in the years to come. This funding is
    supporting the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and
    Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs. These
    programs address workforce shortages and health disparities by
    providing scholarship and loan repayment funding for health care
    students and professionals, in exchange for a service commitment in
    hard-hit and high-risk communities.  With funding from the American
    Rescue Plan, the investment supports over 22,700 providers—the
    largest field strength in history for these programs and a record
    number of skilled doctors, dentists, nurses, and behavioral health
    providers committed to working in underserved communities during a
    moment when we need them the most. Only about 5% of physicians in
    the United States identify as Black despite the fact that Black
    Americans account for 12% of the nation’s total population; over 13%
    of physicians serving through the National Health Service Corps
    identify as Black. SAMHSA will also announce new funding to support
    efforts to recruit future mental health professionals from
    Historically Black Colleges and Universities and to expand the
    Minority Fellowship Program to support more Black Americans joining
    the mental health workforce.
-   **Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.** President Biden
    released a new National HIV/AIDS Strategy to provide the framework
    and direction for the Administration’s policies, research, programs,
    and planning through 2025 and lead us toward ending the HIV epidemic
    in the United States by 2030. Black people made up 42% of new HIV
    diagnoses in 2019 and 2020, while representing 12% of the total U.S.
    population. The new National HIV/AIDS Strategy incorporates the
    latest data on HIV incidence, prevalence and trends; expands the
    focus on addressing the social determinants of health that influence
    an individual’s HIV risk or outcomes; encourages reform of state HIV
    criminalization laws; adds a new focus on opportunities to engage
    the private sector in novel and important ways in the nation’s work
    to end the HIV epidemic.
-   **Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response.** The ARP provided $160
    billion for the vaccines, tests, personal protective equipment, and
    public health workforce needed to address the spread of COVID-19, an
    investment that is helping to drive down racial disparities in
    prevention and care. Due to the ARP and the President’s commitment
    to center equity in our vaccination effort, multiple studies show
    that the gap in COVID-19 vaccination rates in Black adults compared
    to White and Latino adults has closed. Data as of December 2022 show
    that 90% of Black adults, 88% of Latinos and 86% of White adults
    have received at least one shot, compared to 56%, 57%, and 65%,
    respectively, in May 2021.  
    -   In January 2021, President Biden signed an [Executive
        Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=03fb5b89f7&e=cf669202c8) on
        Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery, creating a
        COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to provide specific
        recommendations to the President for mitigating the health
        inequities caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and
        for preventing such inequities in the future. The Task force
        transmitted its final report to the White House Office of the
        COVID-19 Response in November 2021, including recommendations on
        addressing interpersonal stress linked to racism, the pandemic’s
        mental health impact on communities of color, and access to and
        trust in vaccines, testing, and therapeutics.  By the end of
        2021, the Administration had begun action on over 80% of the
        Task Force recommendations, and remains committed to engaging
        these recommendations within the historic initiatives and
        programs built to promote and sustain equity across the federal
        government. In 2023, the Administration continues to ensure our
        progress on COVID-19 equity is reflected and embedded in U.S.
        health policy more broadly. 

The Administration built channels to increase access in our hardest-hit,
highest-risk communities with funding from the American Rescue Plan.
President Biden centered equity in his historic vaccine effort, going
into communities to close the racial vaccination gap to make sure all
Black Americans — no matter where they live, no matter what their
circumstance has access to vaccines:

-   **Offering updated COVID-19 vaccines for free at tens of thousands
    of trusted locations, with convenient appointment and walk-in
    hours.** The Administration has secured over 270 million doses of
    the updated COVID-19 vaccines, which are made available to the
    American people for free at tens of thousands of convenient
    locations nationwide, including pharmacies, doctor’s offices, health
    centers, and state and local health departments. Americans can visit
    Vaccines.gov to find locations near them, with the updated vaccines.
      And the Administration remains committed to maximizing continued
    access to COVID-19 vaccines beyond the end of the federal Public
    Health Emergency.
-   **Engaging community organizations to reach people with trusted
    information on the new, updated COVID-19 vaccines.** Building on the
    successful efforts that have gotten over 650 million shots in arms
    since January 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services is
    engaging national, regional, and local community-based
    organizations, and houses of worship, including those with strong
    reach among racial and ethnic minority communities, to host
    community health expos and vaccine drives in cities. Over 50% of
    vaccines administered at the federally-run community vaccination
    centers went to Black Americans and other people of color, and more
    than 75% of people vaccinated at Community Health Centers are people
    of color. This continued collaboration will help meet people where
    they are, and foster conversations with trusted members of their
    communities.
-   **Expanding crisis response and access to treatment. ** Our country
    faces an unprecedented mental health crisis among people of all
    ages. Two out of five adults report symptoms of anxiety or
    depression. And, Black and brown communities are disproportionately
    undertreated – even as their burden of mental illness has continued
    to rise. Ensuring timely access to crisis intervention saves
    lives.  
    -   In July, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and
        the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) [successfully
        transitioned to the new easy to remember number
        9-8-8](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/policy-value-based-care/news/21280395/hhs-releases-data-on-transition-to-988-suicide-and-crisis-lifeline),
        making it easier for individuals in crisis to access life-saving
        crisis counseling. The Biden Administration has invested $500
        million – a 20-fold increase in federal support from the prior
        administration – to help states with the transition and launch
        of the program and growth of local crisis-center capacity.

**Promoting Mental Health for Black Youth.** Studies have documented
that over the past decade rates of mental illness and substance use
disorder have increased among Black youth 12-17 years of age. Studies
have also shown that Black children under 13 years are twice as likely
to die by suicide than White peers. In March 2022, and in support of the
President’s strategy for tackling the mental health crisis, the
Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health
announced $3 million in funding for up to 8 awards to evaluate the
effectiveness of general health and wellness policies for improving
Black youth mental health. These awards complement the ongoing work
within the SAMHSA funded [African American Behavioral Health Center of
Excellence](https://africanamericanbehavioralhealth.org/about/about-us.aspx),
which provides resources and tools to promote greater equity and
effectiveness in behavioral health services for African Americans.

**Tackling the Mental Health Crisis.** Over the last year, the
Administration invested critical resources to provide mental health and
substance use supports to Americans, including by expanding Certified
Community Behavioral Health Clinics, investing unprecedented resources
in the 988 suicide prevention hotline, and taking steps to help address
the harms of social media on youth. The President has called for
additional actions to support youth, including by:

-   **Protecting kids online.** There is compelling and growing evidence
    that social media and other tech platforms can be harmful to mental
    health, wellbeing and development. Children, adolescents, and teens
    are especially vulnerable to such harm. Far too often, the platforms
    do not enforce their own terms of service with respect to minors who
    use their products and services. Children are also subject to the
    platforms’ excessive data collection vacuum, which they use to
    deliver sensational and harmful content and troves of paid
    advertising. Children also suffer from bullying, harassment, abuse,
    and even sexual exploitation by other users online. And platforms
    use manipulative design techniques embedded in their products to
    promote addictive and compulsive use by young people in the name of
    “user engagement” – all to generate more revenue. Platforms and
    other interactive digital service providers should be required to
    prioritize the privacy and wellbeing of young people above profit
    and revenue in their product design, including safety by design
    standards and practices for online platforms, products, and
    services. The President is calling for bipartisan support to ban
    targeted advertising online for children and young people and enact
    strong protections for their privacy, health and safety online.
-   **Promoting youth resilience.** While rates of anxiety, depression,
    and self-harm among youth have been on the rise over the past
    several years, there are also remarkable stories of hope and
    resilience. To help foster innovation in promoting resilience, HHS
    will launch a new Children and Youth Resilience Prize Challenge,
    awarding a total of $750,000 in a new pilot program. 
-   **Investing in youth mental health.** President Biden signed into
    law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which makes unprecedented
    investment in youth mental health and supports school-based health
    services. This law is providing critical support to expand
    culturally competent, trauma informed services and prevent violence
    – vital steps which can reduce the likelihood of mental health
    problems in Black youth. The Biden Administration also encouraged
    states to better address youth mental health for those with Medicaid
    coverage.

**Understanding health related social needs for Black populations.** For
many Black Americans, the social situations in which they live impair
their ability to lead healthy lives. Few affordable housing options,
difficulty accessing reliable transportation, a lack of nutritious foods
to buy, and numerous other social factors impact the health of
communities, some of which disproportionately affect Black communities.
In order to better understand the impact of social circumstances on
health, the National Institutes of Health invested over $3.4 billion in
social determinants of health research and training including funding
over 38 research projects to understand the impact of structural racism
and discrimination on minority health. This research will inform new
initiatives to improve the lives of Black Americans.

**Reducing the Burden of Medical Debt on Black Americans.** Black
households are more likely to hold medical debt than white households.
Following the Vice President’s April 2022 announcement on the
Administration’s actions to reduce the burden of medical debt and
increase consumer protections, medical debt was eased for many
Americans. This week, the Administration announced that it is continuing
its efforts in this space by relieving certain veterans’ medical debt;
reducing the role of medical debt in lending decisions; helping more
Americans sign up for health insurance; and working to create a more
fair and transparent health care system for consumers by implementing
the No Surprises Act and advancing hospital price transparency so
patients know the upfront price of hospital services.

**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity in K-12 Schools and an
Education Beyond High School. **President Biden has delivered the
support necessary to enable every school to return to full-time,
in-person instruction and ensure student success by accelerating
academic recovery and addressing the mental health needs of students.
President Biden has also made college more affordable, provided college
students with supports for completion, and helped federal student loan
borrowers as they recover from the pandemic. He has also worked to
ensure equitable access to high-quality education for Black students.
These policies and programs include:

-   **Historic Investments to Safely Reopen Schools and Address the
    Needs of Students.** The American Rescue Plan provided $130 billion
    to help elementary and secondary schools safely reopen and address
    the academic, social and emotional and mental health needs of all
    students, with funding set-aside to address the needs of students
    disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including Black
    students. In addition to funding the implementation of COVID-19
    protocols, these funds are being used to provide tutors, establish
    and expand summer and after-school programming, and provide a wide
    range of supports that address the needs of Black students. It is
    the largest one-time investment in public education. These funds are
    also being used to hire counselors and social workers. Compared with
    the pre-pandemic period, the number of school social workers is up
    36%, the number of school counselors is up 11%, and the number of
    school nurses is up 28%.  This particularly benefits Black students
    [due to higher student-to-counselor and student-to-psychologist
    ratios at schools that enroll a majority of students of color,
    compared to schools that enroll a majority of white
    students](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019020.pdf).
-   **Protecting Students from Funding Cuts.** The American Rescue
    Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief program
    includes a first of its kind maintenance of equity requirement to
    ensure that high-poverty school districts and schools are protected
    in the event of state or local education funding cuts. The
    Department of Education has provided resources and technical
    assistance to states and school districts as they implement this new
    requirement. This will ensure that school districts and schools
    serving a large share of students from low-income backgrounds will
    not experience disproportionate cuts, and that school districts with
    the highest poverty levels do not experience decreases in state
    per-pupil funding below their pre-pandemic level.
-   **Increasing Funding for Schools in Low-Income Communities.** The
    President secured a 5% increase for the Title I grants in the most
    recent FY23 omnibus. Title I grants assist more than half of our
    Nation’s public schools in their efforts to raise student
    achievement, particularly for students attending high-poverty
    schools to meet college and career-ready state academic standards.
-   **Supporting the Holistic Needs of Students.** Meeting the needs of
    the whole child is essential to help students grow academically and
    improve their well-being. That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration
    has supported the adoption of community school models across the
    country. Community schools meet the unique needs of the
    neighborhoods they serve by leveraging local non-profit, private
    sector, and public partnerships to bring wraparound services into
    school buildings, such as mental health supports, dental services,
    and assistance with shelter and nutrition. They operate with the
    assistance of school staff who coordinate with school
    administrators, stakeholders, and local organizations to deliver
    these services to students, their families, and members of the
    community. In the most recent bipartisan funding bill, the President
    secured $150 million for the Full-Service Community Schools program,
    making the program twice as large as last year and five times as
    large as when President Biden came into office.
-   **Helping Working Families Afford Child Care.** The high cost of
    child care continues to make it hard for parents – especially women
    — to work outside the home and provide for their families.
    Difficulty in finding high-quality, affordable child care leads some
    parents to drop out of the labor force entirely, some to reduce
    their work hours, and others to turn down a promotion. When a parent
    drops out of the workforce, reduces hours, or takes a lower-paying
    job early in their careers—even temporarily—there are lifetime
    consequences on earnings, savings, and retirement.  As part of the
    end-of-year omnibus, the Administration secured a 30% increase in
    funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which will
    more families afford child care and access better child care
    options. 40% of children benefiting from this program are come from
    Black families. The new law also made significant investments in
    programs Head Start, which disproportionately serves Black children
    and families. Greater availability and affordability of high-quality
    early care and education will help women with young children to
    enter and stay in the workforce.
-   **Providing Support to Borrowers.** President Biden believes that a
    post-high school education should be a ticket to a middle-class
    life, but for too many Black Americans, the cost of borrowing for
    college is a lifelong burden that deprives them of that opportunity.
    In August 2022, President Biden announced a plan that:  
    -   **Provides one-time debt relief to low- and middle-income
        borrowers to make sure financial harms related to the pandemic
        don’t leave borrowers worse off with respect to their loans.**
        President Biden’s one-time debt relief plan provides up to
        $20,000 in debt relief to Pell Grant recipients with loans held
        by the Department of Education, and up to $10,000 in debt relief
        to non-Pell Grant recipients. Borrowers are eligible for this
        relief if their individual income is less than $125,000
        ($250,000 for married couples). More than 70% of Black
        undergraduate borrowers are Pell Grant recipients and Black
        borrowers are twice as likely to have received Pell Grants
        compared to their white peers. No one in the top 5% of incomes
        will benefit from this action. By targeting relief to borrowers
        with the highest economic need, the Administration’s actions are
        likely to have the effect of helping narrow the racial wealth
        gap. While litigation is currently preventing the Administration
        from providing this debt relief, the Administration remains
        confident that the program is legal. In the less than four weeks
        that the application was available, 26 million people either
        applied for debt relief or had already provided sufficient
        information to the Department of Education to be deemed eligible
        for relief. Over 16 million of those borrowers’ applications
        were fully approved by the Department and sent to loan
        servicers.  
    -   **Makes the student loan system more manageable for current and
        future borrowers.** These steps include:
        -   Cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans.
            The Department of Education is proposing an income-driven
            repayment plan that protects more low-income borrowers from
            making any payments and caps monthly payments for
            undergraduate loans at 5% of a borrower’s discretionary
            income—half of the rate that borrowers must pay now under
            most existing plans. This means that the average annual
            student loan payment will be lowered by more than $1,000 for
            both current and future borrowers.
        -   Fixing the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)
            program by ensuring that borrowers who have worked at a
            nonprofit, in the military, or in federal, state, Tribal, or
            local government, receive appropriate credit toward loan
            forgiveness. These regulatory changes build on temporary
            changes the Department of Education made to PSLF, under
            which roughly 360,000 public servants received more than $24
            billion in loan forgiveness.
        -   Ensuring targeted student loan forgiveness programs work. To
            date, the Department of Education has approved a total of
            $48 billion in relief to nearly 2 million student loan
            borrowers who were defrauded by their college, enrolled in a
            college that abruptly closed, are permanently disabled and
            unable to work, and borrowers who serve our country through
            government or non-profit work.
-   **Protecting future students and taxpayers by reducing the cost of
    college and holding schools accountable when they hike up
    prices. **The President championed the largest increase to Pell
    Grants in the last decade – a combined increase of $900 to the
    maximum award for students over the last two years – and has a plan
    to double the maximum Pell Grant by 2029 to nearly $13,000. To
    further reduce the cost of college, the President will continue to
    fight to make community college free. Meanwhile, colleges have an
    obligation to keep prices reasonable and ensure borrowers get value
    for their investments, not debt they cannot afford. This
    Administration has already taken key steps to strengthen
    accountability, including in areas where the previous Administration
    weakened rules such as holding career colleges accountable for
    leaving their students with mountains of debt that they cannot
    repay.
-   **Providing Historic Support for Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities (HBCUs).** The Biden-Harris Administration has
    delivered nearly $6 billion cumulative investment through the
    Department of Education to support HBCUs, including:  
    -   The ARP and other pandemic relief programs have provided
        approximately $3.7 billion to HBCUs since President Biden took
        office. An estimated. 450,0000 HBCU students have received
        emergency financial aid grants through this funding since the
        start of 2021.
    -   In April 2021, the Department of Education provided
        approximately $1.6 billion in institutional debt relief to 45
        HBCUs, including 13 public institutions and 32 private
        institutions.
    -   In July and August of 2021, the Department of Education awarded
        more than $500 million in grant funding to HBCUs for academic
        capacity-building and fiscal stability.
    -   The Department of Education has awarded over $1.4 million
        through Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project
        SERV) grants to eight HBCUs that experienced bomb threats.  
-   **Re-establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing
    Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for
    Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).** In September
    2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order re-establishing the
    White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence,
    and Economic Opportunity for HBCUs, which has created a
    government-wide approach to support the needs of HBCUs and the
    communities they serve and eliminate systemic barriers impeding HBCU
    participation in Federal programs.  The Initiative helps to
    strengthen the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality
    education for students, increase opportunities for these
    institutions to participate in and benefit from Federal programs,
    and ensure that HBCUs can continue to be engines of opportunity.
-   **Re-establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing
    Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Black
    Americans.** In October 2021, President Biden signed an Executive
    Order reestablishing and expanding the White House Initiative on
    Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity
    for Black Americans. The Initiative works to strengthen the Nation
    by improving educational outcomes for Black Americans of all ages,
    and to help ensure that all African Americans receive an education
    that properly prepares them for college and productive careers. The
    Initiative manages a cross-agency effort to improve student
    achievement and advance educational equity and economic opportunity
    for African American and Black students, families, and communities.

**Appointing and Confirming a Historic Number of Black Women to the
Bench.** President Biden is committed to ensuring that the judiciary is
filled with highly qualified individuals who bring both personal and
professional diversity to the bench. Since January 2021, President Biden
has nominated a total of 154 individuals for federal judgeships, 48 of
whom are African American, and 15 individuals for local judgeships in
Washington, D.C., 6 of whom are African American. In April 2022, Ketanji
Brown Jackson was confirmed by the United States Senate as Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court, the first Black woman to ever serve on the
Court. Of the 100 individuals who have been confirmed to positions on
federal courts, 33 are African American.

**Signed the Respect for Marriage Act.** In December 2022, President
Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law, which requires that
interracial marriages and same-sex marriage must be recognized as legal
in every state in the nation. The is a vital step towards advancing the
civil rights of all Americans.

**Launching a Whole-Of-Government Initiative to Advance Equity and
Justice for Underserved Communities, Including Black Communities.** On
his first day in office, President Biden signed the historic Executive
Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities
Through the Federal Government. The President’s Order emphasized the
enormous human costs of systemic racism, persistent poverty, and other
disparities, and directed the Federal Government to advance an ambitious
whole-of-government equity agenda that matches the scale of the
challenges we face as a country and the opportunities we have to build a
more perfect union. Over the last two years, the Biden-Harris
Administration has championed racial equity and advanced equal
opportunity for underserved communities. During the President’s first
year in office, 90 federal agencies across the federal government,
including all Cabinet-level agencies as well as over 50 independent
agencies, conducted equity assessments of 3-5 of their agency’s
high-impact services for the American people, to uncover where systemic
barriers to access may exist. Using those findings, agencies developed
Equity Action Plans for addressing—and achieving—equity in their mission
delivery for all Americans. Equity Action Plans were required to include
accountability mechanisms and to identify success metrics and key
milestones toward progress.

To strengthen the federal government’s equity mandate, on February 16,
2023, President Biden signed a second Executive Order on equity that
directs the federal government to continue the work to make the promise
of America real for every American including communities of color,
Tribal communities, rural communities, LGBTQI+ individuals, people with
disabilities, women and girls, and communities impacted by persistent
poverty. This second equity Executive Order requires agencies to
designate senior leaders accountable for implementing the equity
mandate; directs agencies to produce Equity Action Plans annually and
report to the public on their progress; requires agencies to improve the
quality, frequency, and accessibility of their community engagement;
formalizes the President’s goal of increasing the share of federal
contracting dollars awarded to small disadvantaged business by 50
percent by 2025; directs agencies to spur economic growth in rural areas
and advance more equitable urban development; instructs agencies to
consider bolstering the capacity of their civil rights offices and
focusing their efforts on emerging threats like algorithmic
discrimination in automated technology; directs the White House Office
of Management and Budget to support agencies’ Equity Action Plans and
invest in underserved communities each year through the formulation of
the President’s budget; and further promotes data equity and
transparency.

**Making the promise of equal justice a reality for all.**  President
Biden is committed to doing everything he can to make our communities
safer, including by advancing effective, accountable policing. Our
criminal justice system must protect the public and ensure fair and
impartial justice for all. These are mutually reinforcing, not
competing, goals. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to
advance effective, accountable policing, build trust, and improve public
safety so that we make the promise of equal justice under the law a
reality for all. President Biden believes that it is time that we
acknowledge the legacy of systemic racism in our criminal justice system
and work together to eliminate the racial disparities that endure to
this day. Doing so serves all Americans.

-   **Reforming Federal Marijuana Laws to Promote Equity and Fairness in
    the Justice System.** The President took bold action to address our
    failed approach to marijuana. The criminalization of marijuana
    possession has upended too many lives—for conduct that is now legal
    in many states. While white, Black, and brown people use marijuana
    at similar rates, Black and brown people are disproportionately
    arrested, prosecuted and convicted for it. In October 2022, the
    President announced a full, unconditional, and categorical pardon
    for prior federal and D.C. offenses of simple possession of
    marijuana. This pardon lifts barriers to housing, employment, and
    educational opportunities for thousands of people with those prior
    convictions. The President also called on every state governor to
    follow his lead, as most marijuana prosecutions take place at the
    state and local level. And because this Administration is guided by
    science and evidence, he called on the Department of Health and
    Human Services and the Department of Justice to expeditiously review
    how marijuana is scheduled under federal law.

-   **Re-issuing the Call for Congress to Pass the George Floyd Justice
    in Policing Act.** The President has repeatedly called for Congress
    to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, including in his
    February 2023 State of the Union, to advance accountability,
    transparency, and public trust in law enforcement. Real change at
    the state and local level requires Congressional action.
-   **Making Federal Policing the Gold Standard of Effectiveness and
    Accountability.** After Senate Republicans blocked passage of the
    George Floyd Justice in Policing Act last year – even though law
    enforcement groups supported a deal – President Biden signed a
    historic Executive Order to advance effective, accountable policing
    and strengthen public safety. The order requires federal law
    enforcement agencies to: ban chokeholds; restrict no-knock warrants;
    mandate the use of body-worn cameras; implement stronger use of
    force policies, including with the duty to intervene and duty to
    render medical aid; provide de-escalation training; submit officer
    misconduct records into a new national database; and restrict the
    transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement agencies,
    among other things. While the President cannot mandate changes at
    the state and local level, the order incentivizes state and local
    reforms through grantmaking, new accreditation standards, and
    training and technical assistance. The Administration is actively
    implementing the order. For example, agencies have already
    prohibited chokeholds and restricted no-knock entries, updated their
    use of force-policies, and prohibited the transfer of military-grade
    weapons and equipment to local law enforcement agencies.
-   **Justice Department Action to Ensure Accountability and Encourage
    Reform.** In just two years, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has
    opened eight pattern-or-practice investigations of law enforcement
    agencies for systemic misconduct and rescinded a Trump-era memo that
    inhibited the use of consent decrees, an important tool to reform
    troubled police departments. DOJ also restored and improved the
    voluntary Collaborative Reform program, providing technical
    assistance to police departments that ask for help to reform their
    practices and build trust, and has awarded millions of dollars in
    grants for de-escalation and anti-bias training.
-   **Improving Prosecutorial Guidance to Prevent Unduly Harsh
    Sentencing.** The DOJ withdrew guidance issued in the previous
    Administration that required prosecutors to always charge the
    harshest sentences, replacing it with guidance that restored
    discretion to make decisions about charging, plea agreements, and
    advocacy at sentencing based on an individualized assessment of
    relevant facts.
-   ** Prioritizing Action to End Racial Disparities in Cocaine
    Sentencing.** As President Biden first advocated in 2007, he
    continues to call on Congress to end once and for all the racially
    discriminatory crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity and make
    the change fully retroactive. This step would provide immediate
    sentencing relief to the 10,000 individuals, more than 90% of whom
    are Black, currently serving time in federal prison pursuant to the
    crack/powder disparity. The Administration has urged the swift
    passage of the EQUAL Act. As an initial step, in December 2022 the
    Attorney General issued guidance to federal prosecutors on steps
    they should take to promote the equivalent treatment of crack and
    powder cocaine offenses—but Congress still needs to act.
-   **Implementing an Executive Order Limiting Use of Private
    Prisons.** The President ordered DOJ not to renew contracts for
    privately-operated criminal detention facilities, covering the
    Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). To date,
    over 8,000 people have been moved out of privately owned or operated
    facilities.
-   **Initiating a whole-of-government effort to promote reform of the
    criminal justice system.**  The President’s Policing EO also
    established a new interagency Alternatives and Reentry Committee to
    develop a strategic plan with recommendations on how to safely
    reduce unnecessary criminal justice system interactions, improve
    rehabilitation, and support successful reentry while addressing
    existing disparities in the federal, state, local, Tribal, and
    territorial juvenile and criminal justice systems.
-   **Supporting Second Chances.** In April 2022, in honor of Second
    Chance Month, the
    President [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-expands-second-chance-opportunities-for-formerly-incarcerated-persons/) grants
    of clemency to 78 individuals, along with a series of [over 20
    actions from a dozen federal
    agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-expands-second-chance-opportunities-for-formerly-incarcerated-persons/) to
    support returning citizens.   
    -   To expand employment opportunities, the Administration is also
        leveraging historic investments in infrastructure to promote the
        hiring of formerly incarcerated persons, using over $5 billion
        in grant programs in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
        prioritize grantees who hire formerly incarcerated persons and
        other historically marginalized groups.
    -   The Department of Justice and Department of Labor announced a
        first-of-its-kind collaboration to invest $145 million over
        FY22-23 to provide job skills training and intensive
        individualized employment and reentry plans for people
        incarcerated in select Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities to
        enhance their successful return to their communities. 
    -   To protect equal housing opportunity, the Department of Housing
        and Urban Development is undertaking a comprehensive review to
        identify changes to its programs to ensure that they
        appropriately include individuals with arrest and conviction
        records.
    -   To expand educational opportunities, the Department of Education
        expanded its Second Chance Pell Program, which provides Pell
        Grants to incarcerated students, to 73 schools that will educate
        thousands of additional students. This raises the total number
        of participating schools to 200 and will help the Department
        prepare for the full expansion of Pell Grant eligibility to
        incarcerated students in July 2023.
    -   The Department of Labor also opened solicitations for $140
        million in new grant funding for justice-involved youth and
        adults.
    -   The Department of Health and Human Services is starting the
        process to establish a Special Enrollment Period for Medicare
        for people who miss their enrollment periods while incarcerated,
        which will reduce coverage gaps and penalties for people
        returning home from prison.
    -   To support veterans, a new collaboration among the Social
        Security Administration, Bureau of Prisons, and the Department
        of Veterans Affairs will automate information-sharing among
        these agencies, accelerating the restoration of benefits and
        reducing red tape for returning veterans.

**Advancing Public Safety for Black Communities.** Violence is not
impacting all of us equally. We know that Black and brown communities
bear the most significant share of the harm. Black boys and young men
ages 15-34 make up 2% of the population, but are 37% of homicide
victims. Homicide is the leading cause of death for Black men under the
age of 44, and has been for years. It is the second leading cause of
death for young Latino men. The homicide rate for Black women and Native
American women is twice the rate for women overall. Half of gun
homicides in the United States remain unsolved, and victims of non-fatal
shootings too often lack the support they need to recover. Cases
involving Black and brown victims go unsolved at substantially higher
rates than those involving white victims—leaving their families and
communities with no justice and little support. The cost of gun violence
is not only the lost lives and physical injuries, it is also the lasting
trauma that impacts survivors, families, and communities. This violence
also interrupts education, leads to disinvestment in the communities
that need it the most, and has cascading consequences for our national
economy to the tune of $280 billion in lost economic opportunity per
year. The President continues to call on Congress to take action to end
this gun violence public safety and public health epidemic. But he knows
we cannot afford to wait a single day while lives are being taken, which
is why he has taken more action to reduce gun violence than any other
President at this point in their Administration. These policies and
programs include:

-   **Enacting the First Significant Gun Safety Law in 30 years.** In
    June 2022, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities
    Act into law. It includes actions he has long called for and that
    will save lives, including funding crisis intervention like red flag
    laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to
    themselves and to others; finally closing what’s known as the
    “boyfriend loophole” so if you assault your girlfriend or boyfriend
    you cannot buy or own a gun; requiring young people aged 18-21 to
    undergo enhanced background checks; making gun trafficking and straw
    purchases distinct federal crimes; clarifying who needs to register
    as a federally licensed gun dealer and run background checks before
    selling a gun; providing historic funding to address the youth
    mental health crisis in this country, especially the trauma
    experienced by survivors of gun violence; and investing in
    anti-violence programs to work directly with people who are most
    likely to commit gun crimes or become victims of gun crimes.
    President Biden continues to call on Congress act, including by
    banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and requiring
    background checks for all gun sales.
-   **Additional Funding to Prevent and Fight Crime.** The President’s
    Safer America Plan requests new funding to recruit, train, and hire
    police officers consistent with the standards in the President’s
    Executive Order to advance safe, effective, accountable, community
    policing in order to enhance public trust and public safety; and to
    invest in crime prevention and a fairer criminal justice, including
    by investing $20 billion in services that address the root causes of
    crime and by incentivizing the reform of laws that increase
    incarceration without redressing public safety.
-   **Keeping Especially Dangerous Weapons and Repeat Shooters Off Our
    Streets.** The Justice Department issued a final rule to rein in the
    proliferation of ghost guns, which are un-serialized, privately made
    firearms that are increasingly being recovered at crime scenes. The
    Department is also more strictly regulating stabilizing braces that
    attach to pistols and essentially turn these weapons into
    short-barreled rifles. The Attorney General directed every U.S.
    Attorney’s Office nationwide to increase resources dedicated to
    district-specific violent crime strategies.
-   **Keeping Dangerous Weapons Out of Dangerous Hands.** The Justice
    Department published model extreme risk protection order legislation
    to make it easier for states that want to adopt these red flag laws
    to do so. The Justice Department also issued a series of reforms:
    the first two volumes of its new, comprehensive report on firearms
    commerce and trafficking; new policy to underscore zero tolerance
    for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms
    dealers that put public safety at risk; and the launch of five new
    law enforcement strike forces focused on addressing significant
    firearms trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York,
    Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C.
-   **Tackling and Preventing Violence Crime through Community Violence
    Intervention (CVI) Programs.** Black boys and young men ages 15-34
    make up 2% of the population but are 37% of homicide victims, and
    homicide is the leading cause of death for Black men under the age
    of 45. Until this Administration, however, CVI programs like
    violence interrupters and hospital-based programs, which are
    demonstrated to reduce violence by up to 60%, have been badly
    underfunded. Under President Biden, the Treasury Department and
    Education Department issued guidance stating that CVI programs are
    eligible uses of American Rescue Plan funds—both the $350 billion in
    aid to state, Tribal, and local governments and the $122 billion to
    school districts. The Administration pivoted 26 existing grant
    programs across five agencies to support CVI.  President Biden
    secured a total of $100 million for the first-ever dedicated CVI
    funding in each of Fiscal Years 2022 and 2023, through the
    Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the appropriations process. The
    President continues to advocate Congress for $5 billion in dedicated
    funding for CVI programs. These historic funds, along with new
    funding to support accountable, community-oriented policing, would
    help curtail the epidemic of gun violence that hits Black
    communities hardest. 
-   **Addressing Domestic Violent Extremism.** President Biden directed
    the U.S. government to assess the threat of domestic violent
    extremism in the United States. In January, Secretary of the
    Department of Defense (DOD) Lloyd J. Austin III ordered a DOD-wide
    stand down to discuss the problem of extremism in the ranks, and in
    April he established a countering extremism working group, directing
    DOD officials to review and update the definition of extremism
    contained in [DOD Instruction
    1325.06](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=ed5a029c91&e=cf669202c8),
    and calling on the services to update transition instructions to
    prevent those leaving the military from being recruited by extremist
    groups. In March 2021, the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence released the unclassified executive summary of the
    comprehensive assessment acknowledging that enduring domestic
    violent extremism motivations stem from biases against minority
    populations. In April 2021, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
    Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ordered an internal review to root out
    white supremacy and extremism within DHS.
-   **United We Stand Summit.** The Biden-Harris Administration hosted
    the United We Stand Summit to counter the corrosive effects of
    hate-fueled violence on our democracy and public safety. The Summit
    featured survivors and leaders from communities impacted by
    hate-fueled violence, including the mass shootings in Buffalo and at
    the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. The Administration
    announced a historic package of new actions the federal government,
    civic communities, faith communities, and business leaders will take
    to address hate-fueled violence and advance national unity. These
    included the establishment of the White House Initiative on
    Hate-Motivated Violence to strengthen interagency coordination,
    leverage federal research and resources, and enhance engagement in
    preventing and responding to hate-motivated violence, as well as the
    mobilization of over $1 billion in new investments to increase
    support for programs that build bridges among Americans of different
    backgrounds to foster unity. Bipartisan former White House officials
    also launched Dignity.us, a Citizens’ Initiative to Address
    Hate-Fueled Violence in America, to foster dialogue in communities
    across the country and identify solutions to address hate-fueled
    violence.
-   **Expanding Access to Justice.** To expand the promise of equal
    justice under law, the President issued a Presidential Memorandum in
    May 2021
    that [asked](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=32f2f54d32&e=cf669202c8) the
    Attorney General to consider expanding the Department of Justice’s
    access to justice work and that reinvigorated the White House Legal
    Aid Interagency Roundtable to prioritize and expand access to legal
    services and federal programs in criminal and civil legal
    proceedings. In October 2021, the Attorney General announced the
    reestablishment of the Office for Access to Justice as a standalone
    component within the Justice Department dedicated to improving the
    federal government’s understanding of and capacity to address the
    most urgent legal needs of communities across America. In May 2022,
    the Attorney General announced the office’s Director and its efforts
    to address the housing and eviction crisis, ensure equal access to
    justice for veterans and service members, and reduce and remove
    barriers to successful reentry for previously incarcerated
    individuals.

**Protecting the Sacred Right to Vote.** These policies and programs
include:

-   **Implementing the Executive Order Promoting Access to Voter
    Registration and Voting.** On the 2021 anniversary of Bloody Sunday,
    President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=1d4d1ebc06&e=cf669202c8) to
    leverage the resources of the federal government to provide
    information about the election process and increased access to voter
    registration opportunities. Agencies across the federal government
    have [announced
    steps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-report-on-native-american-voting-rights/) they
    are taking to respond to the President’s call for an
    all-of-government action to enhance the ability of all eligible
    Americans to participate in our democracy, including the Centers for
    Medicare & Medicaid
    Services’ [commitment](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=280f4a922c&e=cf669202c8) to
    make it easier for consumers using HealthCare.gov to connect to
    voter registration services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs’
    commitment to a pilot project seeking to have VA Medical Centers
    formally designated as voter registration agencies in six states.  
-   **Pressing for Legislation to Protect the Right to Vote.** President
    Biden recognizes the anti-democratic impact of state attacks on
    voting and judicial decisions gutting the Voting Rights Act and has
    repeatedly and forcefully called on  Congress to pass essential
    legislation,  including the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act
    and the Freedom to Vote Act.  And when a minority of Senators
    representing a minority of Americans blocked these historic voting
    rights bills from getting even a debate, President Biden called for
    a change in the Senate rules to defend our democracy. 
-   **Ensuring Compliance with Voting Rights Laws.** The Department of
    Justice has taken strong action to help protect the right to vote,
    including doubling the number of voting rights attorneys, taking
    steps to ensure compliance with voting rights statutes, launching a
    task force to combat the increase of threats against election
    officials and election workers, and issuing guidance on (1) the
    civil and criminal statutes that apply to post-election audits, (2)
    methods of voting, including early voting and voting by mail, (3)
    the vote-dilution protections that apply to all jurisdictions under
    Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as they engage in redistricting,
    and (4) the state voting rules that apply after criminal
    convictions.
-   **Protecting our democracy.** The President signed into law the
    bipartisan Electoral Reform Count Act, which establishes clear
    guidelines for our system of certifying and counting electoral votes
    for President and Vice President, to preserve the will of the people
    and to protect against the type of attempts to overturn our
    elections that led to the January 6 insurrection.

**Restoring Fairness and Humanity to Our Immigration System.** 
President Biden is committed to reforming our immigration system,
promoting racial equity in our immigration policies, and providing legal
protections for Black noncitizens who call this country home.

-   **Revoking the Discriminatory Muslim and African Ban.** On his first
    day in office, President Biden signed a Proclamation revoking the
    previous administration’s discriminatory Muslim and African Ban, a
    policy that was rooted in racial and religious animus and
    xenophobia.  
-   **Expanding Existing Lawful Pathways for Haitian Family
    Reunification.** The Obama-Biden Administration created the Haitian
    Family Reunification Parole (HFRP) Program in 2014, allowing U.S.
    citizens and permanent residents to apply for parole on behalf of
    family members in Haiti who have approved immigrant visa
    petitions. The prior administration announced its intention to
    terminate this program and discontinued processing under it in
    2019. The Biden-Harris Administration restored the HFRP Program, as
    well as reinvigorated immigrant visa processing for Haitian
    nationals to help Haitian-American families reunify in our country.
-   **Creating New Lawful Pathways to the United States for Haitian
    Nationals.** In January 2023, the Biden Administration announced it
    would expand a sponsorship-based parole process already in place for
    Venezuelans to include nationals from Haiti, Nicaragua, and Cuba.
    Under this process, up to 30,000 individuals per month from these
    four countries, who have an eligible sponsor and pass vetting and
    background checks, can come to the United States for a period of two
    years and receive work authorization.
-   **Extending, Re-designating, or Designating Cameroon, Ethiopia,
    Haiti, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan for Temporary Protected
    Status (TPS).** The Administration extended legal protections to
    nationals of these countries who have lived in the United States for
    years.  TPS is a form of immigration relief available to noncitizens
    in the United States who cannot return home due to dangerous
    conditions in their countries; it enables those individuals to live
    with their families and work in our communities lawfully without
    fear of removal.
-   **Promoting Naturalization.** President Biden is committed to making
    the naturalization process more accessible for eligible noncitizens,
    directing the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
    and the Secretary of State to improve naturalization processing,
    identify and remove barriers to naturalization, and reduce backlogs
    for naturalization applications. To advance these goals, the
    President established an Interagency Working Group, which developed
    the Interagency Strategy to Promote Naturalization. In Fiscal Year
    (FY) 2022, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) reduced
    the naturalization application backlog by 62 percent and welcomed
    more than 1 million new U.S. citizens to this country, the highest
    number of naturalized citizens in nearly 15 years. USCIS also
    awarded nearly $20 million in grants to 66 organizations to provide
    citizenship preparation resources, support, and information to
    immigrants and immigrant-serving organizations.
-   **Promoting Integration and Inclusion for New Americans.** To ensure
    that lawfully-present new immigrants and refugees receive the
    support they need to fully participate in and contribute to our
    country and their communities, the President established the Task
    Force on New Americans. The Task Force on New Americans is
    coordinating the federal government’s efforts to welcome and support
    immigrants, including refugees, catalyzing State and local
    integration and inclusion efforts, and developing recommendations on
    new policy options and strategies to promote immigrant integration
    and inclusion.
-   **Supporting Immigrant Veterans.** The Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA) has partnered with DHS to provide needed care and
    services to deported veterans, including timely and accurate
    information on immigration services. In addition, DHS established an
    online center to consolidate federal resources for immigrant
    veterans, which includes a portal for deported veterans to request
    permission to return to the United States or access VA benefits to
    which they may be entitled. To date, DHS and the VA have worked to
    facilitate the return of 65 deported veterans to the United States
    through the joint Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative
    (IMMVI).
-   **Supporting Comprehensive Immigration Reform
    Legislation.**  President Biden remains committed to passing
    broad-based legislation to finally reform our broken immigration
    system and provide a pathway to citizenship to millions of
    undocumented individuals, including Black noncitizens. 

**Strengthening Partnerships Across the Diaspora.** The Administration
is working to strengthen partnerships and collaboration that foster
greater global economic and social mobility.

-   In December 2022, President Biden hosted the **U.S.-Africa
    LeadersSummit** to highlight the U.S. commitment to expanding and
    deepening our partnership with African countries, institutions, and
    people. President Biden and Vice President Harris announced new
    initiatives that will empower African institutions and citizens to:
    reaffirm our resolve to work collaboratively with African
    governments, businesses, and publics to strengthen people-to-people
    ties, ensure more inclusive and responsive global institutions,
    build a strong and sustainable global economy, foster new technology
    and innovation, strengthen health systems and prepare for the next
    pandemic, tackle the food security and climate crises, support
    democracy and human rights, and advance peace and security.
-   **Launch of the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate
    Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030)**.  PACC 2030 is the Biden-Harris
    Administration’s new initiative involving fresh commitments to — and
    integration of — climate adaptation and resilience and clean energy
    programs across the Caribbean region. The Caribbean is on the front
    lines of the climate crisis, including sea level rise that threatens
    low-lying islands and exacerbates storm surge associated with
    hurricanes. PACC 2030 establishes a framework to elevate U.S.
    cooperation with Caribbean countries to support climate adaptation
    and strengthen energy security, while building the resilience of
    critical infrastructure and local economies to the climate crisis. 
    PACC 2030 will serve as the U.S. government’s primary mechanism for
    regional climate adaptation and resilience and energy cooperation
    through 2030, as we work toward meeting the long-term goals of the
    Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
