Enough.   
   
We are 48 days into the year and our nation has already suffered at
least 73 mass shootings. Thoughts and prayers aren’t enough. Gun
violence is an epidemic and Congress must act now.  
  
Jill and I are mourning for the six killed in today’s violence in Tate
County, Mississippi — as we have for far too many Americans. We grieve
with their families and with Americans nationwide as gun violence claims
yet more lives. We are also praying for the recovery of those injured in
this horrendous attack, and for survivors who will carry both grief and
trauma with them for the rest of their lives.  
  
Federal law enforcement is in close touch with state and local
authorities, and I’ve directed that all federal support be made
available.  
  
We need—need—commonsense gun law reforms. That includes requiring
background checks on all gun sales, banning assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines, fully closing the boyfriend loophole to keep
guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, requiring safe storage of
guns, and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers who knowingly put
weapons of war on our streets.  
  
These are commonsense steps that Congress could take right now and save
lives. We owe action to American communities being torn apart by gun
violence.
