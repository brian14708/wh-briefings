title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Signs Executive Order to Strengthen Racial Equity\
  \ and Support for Underserved Communities Across the Federal\_Government"
---
 
On his first day in office, President Biden signed Executive Order
13985, *Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities
Through the Federal Government*. That Order emphasized the enormous
human costs of systemic racism and persistent poverty, and provided a
powerful and unprecedented mandate for all federal agencies to launch a
whole-of-government approach to equity. Over the past two years,
agencies have taken historic steps toward ensuring that federal programs
are serving the American people in an equitable and just manner and
supporting communities that have been locked out of opportunity. Through
the implementation of landmark legislation and historic executive
action, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to make real the
promise of America for everyone—including rural communities, communities
of color, Tribal communities, LGBTQI+ individuals, people with
disabilities, women and girls, and communities impacted by persistent
poverty.  
  
Despite the meaningful progress that the Biden-Harris Administration has
made, the reality is that underserved communities—many of whom have
endured generations of discrimination and disinvestment—still confront
unacceptable barriers to equal opportunity and the American Dream.  It
is imperative that we reject the narrow, cramped view of American
opportunity as a zero-sum game. When any segment of society is denied
the full promise of America, our entire Nation is held back. But when we
lift each other up, we are all lifted up. As the President has said:
“Advancing equity is not a one-year project. It’s a generational
commitment.”    
  
To strengthen the federal government’s ability to address the barriers
that underserved communities continue to face, today, President Biden
signed a new Executive Order, *[Further Advancing Racial Equity and
Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal
Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/)*.
This second Order reaffirms the Administration’s commitment to deliver
equity and build an America in which all can participate, prosper, and
reach their full potential.  
  
The Executive Order:

-   **Launches a new annual process to strengthen racial equity and
    support for underserved communities.** Building on the initial
    Equity Action Plans developed under Executive Order 13985, this
    Executive Order directs agencies to produce an annual public Equity
    Action Plan that will assess and include actions to address the
    barriers underserved communities may face in accessing and
    benefitting from the agency’s policies, programs, and activities.
-   **Empowers Federal equity leaders.** The Executive Order strengthens
    requirements for agencies to build and resource Agency Equity Teams
    and designate senior leaders accountable for implementing the
    President’s equity mandate. In line with the President’s commitment
    to [advancing gender equity and equality at home and
    abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/)
    and the President’s commitment to [advancing environmental
    justice](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/),
    [equality for LGBTQI+
    individuals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/15/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-historic-executive-order-advancing-lgbtqi-equality-during-pride-month/),
    and other equity work streams, this Executive Order fosters greater
    collaboration and accountability, and streamlines agencies’
    reporting of progress and planning in order to advance equity in
    support of all those who face overlapping discrimination and bias.
-   **Strengthens community partnerships and engagement.** Too often,
    underserved communities face significant hurdles and a legacy of
    exclusion in engaging with federal agencies and providing input on
    the very federal policies and programs that impact them. The
    Executive Order requires agencies to improve the quality, frequency,
    and accessibility of their community engagement, and to consult with
    impacted communities as each agency develops its Equity Action Plan,
    funding opportunities, budget proposals, and regulations.
-   **Invests in underserved communities.** The Executive Order directs
    the Office of Management and Budget to support implementation of the
    annual agency Equity Action Plans through the President’s budget
    request to Congress. The Executive Order also formalizes the
    President’s goal of increasing the share of federal contracting
    dollars awarded to small disadvantaged business (SDBs) by 50 percent
    by 2025, and instructs agencies to expand procurement opportunities
    for small disadvantaged businesses through grants from the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and other
    investments and programs that flow through states and local
    entities.
-   **Improves economic opportunity in rural and urban communities.**
    The Executive Order directs agencies to spur economic growth in
    rural areas and advance more equitable urban development by ensuring
    that federal resources contribute to building wealth and opportunity
    in these communities through locally-led development.
-   **Addresses emerging civil rights risks.** The Executive Order
    instructs agencies to focus their civil rights authorities and
    offices on emerging threats, such as algorithmic discrimination in
    automated technology; improve accessibility for people with
    disabilities; improve language access services; and consider
    opportunities to bolster the capacity of their civil rights offices.
    It further directs agencies to ensure that their own use of
    artificial intelligence and automated systems also advances equity.
-   **Promotes data equity and transparency.** The Interagency Working
    Group on Equitable Data created by the day one Executive Order has
    been institutionalized at the National Science and Technology
    Council. This Executive Order directs the body to facilitate better
    collection, analysis, and use of demographic data to advance equity,
    and to regularly report on progress to the White House and the
    American public.

Since the release of their [Equity Action
Plans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/equity/) in April 2022, federal
agencies continue to take ambitious action to expand federal investment
in and support for underserved communities. For instance, the following
are some recent actions to advance equity:

-   The **Department of Agriculture** is administering $3.1 billion in
    Inflation Reduction Act funding to distressed USDA farm loan
    borrowers and is expediting assistance for those whose agricultural
    operations are at financial risk. The Department will also provide
    $2.2 billion in assistance to farmers who have experienced
    discrimination in USDA’s farm lending programs.
-   The **Department of Housing and Urban Development** is administering
    $2.8 billion in competitive funding to homeless services
    organizations across the country for wrap-around services and
    housing programs for people experiencing homelessness. To combat the
    long history of discrimination in housing, the Department has
    proposed a new “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing” rule to help
    overcome patterns of segregation and to hold state, localities, and
    public housing agencies that receive federal funds accountable for
    ensuring that underserved communities have equitable access to
    affordable housing opportunities.
-   The **Department of Transportation** issued proposed rules to
    modernize the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise and Airport
    Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program regulations to
    help further level the playing field for small disadvantaged
    businesses, including Black and brown owned businesses. The
    Department also adopted a set of Disability Policy Priorities to
    guide efforts to ensure people with disabilities can move freely,
    fairly, safely, affordably, and spontaneously through every part of
    our transportation system and released the Airline Passengers with
    Disabilities Bill of Rights to empower travelers to understand their
    rights and help the travel industry uphold those rights.
-   The **Department of the Treasury** established the Treasury Advisory
    Committee on Racial Equity to provide information, advice, and
    recommendations to the Department on matters related to the
    advancement of racial equity, particularly aspects of the domestic
    economy that have directly and indirectly resulted in unfavorable
    conditions for communities of color. The Committee is addressing
    topics like financial inclusion, access to capital, housing
    stability, federal supplier diversity, and economic development. The
    agency also created a new Office of Tribal and Native Affairs to
    work across its portfolio on issues related to Tribal nations, and
    intends to work with Congress to ensure this office is adequately
    resourced to carry out its mission.
-   The **National Aeronautics and Space Administration** launched a
    Science Mission Directorate Bridge Program to foster partnerships
    between the agency and Historically Black Colleges and Universities
    (HBCUs), Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), Tribal Colleges and
    Universities (TCUs), community colleges, and very high
    research-intensive universities. The program focuses on providing
    students with paid research and engineering opportunities to support
    the transition of undergraduate students into graduate programs
    and/or employment with NASA and in the broader science and
    engineering fields; it supports capacity-building efforts at partner
    institutions that are historically under-resourced in the NASA
    research and engineering enterprise.
-   The **Department of State** and the **U.S. Agency for International
    Development** released the *2022 U.S. Strategy to Prevent and
    Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally*, directing U.S. foreign
    policy and assistance to address the factors that increase the risks
    of gender-based violence and undermine access to services and
    safety, particularly for the most marginalized groups, and enhance
    the U.S. Government’s partnerships to prevent and respond to
    gender-based violence.
-   The **Department of Veterans Affairs** is engaging in robust
    outreach to veterans, including those who are not already in the VA
    system, particularly veterans in underserved communities, to ensure
    that they receive information on potential eligibility through the
    PACT Act, the largest expansion of veteran health care and benefits
    in decades. In addition to having hosted more than 125 PACT Act
    ‘Week of Action’ events across the country and Puerto Rico, VA is
    developing a National Rural Recruitment and Hiring Plan for health
    care professionals to better reach under-resourced communities;
    exploring efforts to increase the workforce in rural and underserved
    areas to provide PACT Act benefits; and spearheading targeted social
    media outreach and events to foster awareness of PACT Act benefits
    among women and minority veterans.
-   The **Department of Defense** awarded $27 million to HBCUs to
    conduct research in defense critical technology areas, including
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, cyber security, and
    autonomy. This investment will enhance the capacity of the HBCUs to
    participate more fully in the Department’s research programs and
    activities, while also elevating their own research rankings among
    other universities and improving potential access to federal
    research funding, philanthropic donations, and other funding
    sources. Additionally, the Department selected Howard University as
    the first HBCU to lead a University Affiliated Research Center with
    a five-year $90 million contract.
-   The **Department of the Interior** announced $2.7 million in funding
    to support Tribes’ planning activities for the installation or
    expansion of broadband internet, which will improve the quality of
    life, spur economic development and commercial activity, create
    opportunities for self-employment, enhance educational resources and
    remote learning opportunities, and meet emergency and law
    enforcement needs in Native American communities.
-   The **Council on Environmental Quality** and **Office of Management
    and Budget** are coordinating the Justice40 Initiative, which is
    transforming hundreds of federal programs to deliver 40 percent of
    the overall benefits of climate, clean energy, affordable and
    sustainable housing, clean water, and other federal investments to
    disadvantaged communities. The Climate and Economic Justice
    Screening Tool measures burdens such as legacy pollution and
    projected climate risk to identify 27,251 geographically-defined
    disadvantaged communities across the U.S. that can benefit from the
    Justice40 Initiative.
-   The President took bold action to address our failed approach to
    marijuana. The criminalization of marijuana possession has upended
    too many lives—for conduct that is now legal in many states. While
    white, Black, and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black
    and brown people are disproportionately arrested, prosecuted and
    convicted for it. In October 2022, the President announced a full,
    unconditional, and categorical pardon for prior federal and D.C.
    offenses of simple possession of marijuana. This pardon lifts
    barriers to housing, employment, and educational opportunities for
    thousands of people with those prior convictions. The President also
    called on every state governor to follow his lead, as most marijuana
    prosecutions take place at the state and local level. And because
    this Administration is guided by science and evidence, he called on
    the **Department of Health and Human Services** and the **Department
    of Justice** to expeditiously review how marijuana is scheduled
    under federal law.
-   The **White House Office of Science and Technology Policy** also
    released the first-ever federal Evidence Agenda on LGBTQI+ Equity, a
    roadmap that federal agencies will use to ensure they are collecting
    the data and building the evidence they need to improve the lives of
    LGBTQI+ Americans.
-   The White House hosted the second Tribal Nations Summit of this
    Administration to help foster Nation-to-Nation relationships and
    provide Tribal leaders with an opportunity to engage directly with
    senior Administration officials. The President signed a new
    Presidential Memorandum on Uniform Standards for Tribal
    Consultation, establishing uniform standards to be implemented
    across all federal agencies regarding how Tribal consultations are
    conducted. In the FY23 omnibus funding law, the Administration also
    secured—for the first time in history— advance appropriations for
    the **Indian Health Service**, which will ensure a more predictable
    funding stream and improve health outcomes across Indian Country.
