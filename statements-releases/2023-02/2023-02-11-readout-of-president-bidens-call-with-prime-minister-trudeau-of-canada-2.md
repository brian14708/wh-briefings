title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with Prime Minister Trudeau of\_Canada"
---
 
Earlier today, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau on the
unidentified, unmanned object in North American air space. The object
was closely tracked and monitored by North American Aerospace Defense
Command (NORAD) over the last 24 hours and the President has been
continually briefed by his national security team since the object was
detected. Out of an abundance of caution and at the recommendation of
their militaries, President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau authorized
it to be taken down. President Biden authorized US fighter aircraft
assigned to NORAD to conduct the operation and a US F-22 shot down the
object in Canadian territory in close coordination with Canadian
authorities. The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the
object in order to determine more details on its purpose or
origin. President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau commended NORAD’s and
U.S. Northern Command’s strong and effective partnership and agreed to
continue their close coordination to detect, track, and defend our
airspace.
