title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on\_Nomination of Julie Su for Secretary\
  \ of the Department of\_Labor"

Julie Su is a longtime advocate for workers—first in my home state of
California, and now as a leader in the Biden-Harris Administration. She
understands that the future of our economy depends on building a
well-trained and inclusive workforce. I look forward to continuing to
work with Julie, who will help fulfill our pledge to be the most
pro-worker Administration in history as our country’s next Secretary of
Labor.  
   
Marty Walsh is a true champion of America’s workers. Over the past two
years, Secretary Walsh and I have traveled the nation to meet with
workers at union halls, training centers, and job sites. We have worked
together as Chair and Vice-Chair of the White House Task Force on Worker
Organizing and Empowerment. I have seen Secretary Walsh when the cameras
are on, and when they are off. And he is always fighting for the rights
and dignity of America’s workers. I am grateful to Marty for his service
to our Administration and our country, and for his friendship.
