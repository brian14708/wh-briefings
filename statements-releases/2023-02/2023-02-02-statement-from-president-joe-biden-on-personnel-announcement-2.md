title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Personnel\_Announcement"

When I took office, we faced high unemployment, an economy in crisis,
and main streets shuttered across the country. I knew we needed to not
just get families back to work and businesses re-opened, we needed to
rebuild our economy so no one was left behind.

For the past two years, I have relied on Brian Deese to help me do just
that. Brian has a unique ability to translate complex policy challenges
into concrete actions that improve the lives of American people. He has
helped steer my economic vision into reality, and managed the transition
of our historic economic recovery to steady and stable growth.

Brian’s work was critical to the passage of the most significant
economic agenda in generations: the American Rescue Plan, which brought
our economy back from the brink; the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the
most significant investment in our nation’s infrastructure in
generations; the CHIPs and Science Act, which ensures we make more
high-end technology here at home so we can outcompete the world; and the
Inflation Reduction Act, which is giving millions of families breathing
room, investing in clean energy manufacturing, and addressing the
climate crisis.

I am grateful to his wife Kara and his children Adeline and Clark for
letting us borrow Brian. I know well what it must have been like to say
goodbye to him for the regular long commute to Washington, and I know
they’re excited to welcome him home.
