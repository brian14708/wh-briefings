title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Five Years Since\_Parkland"
---
 
Five years ago today, a gunman took the lives of 14 students and three
educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida,
leaving yet another community and dozens of families irreparably
shattered, and inspiring young people to stand up for stronger gun
laws.  
   
In the years since, more communities have been impacted by gun violence,
but we have also made progress on gun safety laws. I brought together
Democrats and Republicans to pass the first significant gun safety law
in nearly 30 years, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.  
   
Today, the U.S. Justice Department is taking another important step to
implement that law, awarding more than $231 million for 49 states and
territories to create and implement crisis intervention projects like
“red flag” programs, mental health and substance use treatment courts,
and veterans’ treatment courts. This funding will reduce gun violence
and save lives.  
   
I have long championed “red flag” laws, also known as extreme risk
protection orders, which could potentially have stopped shooters in
Parkland and other tragedies. These laws allow family members, health
care providers, school officials, and law enforcement officers to seek a
court determination that a person is a danger to themselves or others,
and then temporarily prevent that person from accessing a firearm.  
   
Red flag laws, however, only save lives if community members effectively
use this tool. Today’s announcement gives states funding to educate the
public about extreme risk protection orders and train law enforcement
and other officials regarding this intervention.  
   
While today’s announcement will make communities safer, we have more
work to do. I once again call on Congress to enact commonsense gun law
reforms, including requiring background checks on all gun sales, banning
assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and eliminating immunity
for gun manufacturers who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets.
We owe it to all those we’ve lost and to all those left behind to grieve
to continue to act.
