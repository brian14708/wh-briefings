title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Air India\u2019s Historic Purchase\
  \ of Boeing\_Aircraft"
---
 
The United States can and will lead the world in manufacturing. I am
proud to announce today the purchase of over 200 American-made aircraft
through a historic agreement between Air India and Boeing. This purchase
will support over one million American jobs across 44 states, and many
will not require a four-year college degree. This announcement also
reflects the strength of the U.S.-India economic partnership. Together
with Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to deepening our partnership
even further as we continue to confront shared global
challenges—creating a more secure and prosperous future for all of our
citizens.
