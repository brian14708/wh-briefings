title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Retirement of Senator Dianne\_\
  Feinstein"
---
 
Many know the history-making career of Senator Dianne Feinstein. As the
first woman to serve as mayor of San Francisco, and now as the
longest-tenured woman ever to serve in the U.S. Senate, she has
dedicated her life to public service and to the people of our beloved
California.  Representing California in the Senate alongside Senator
Feinstein, I had the opportunity to witness her enduring commitment to
our constituents and our country.  
 

Senator Feinstein led San Francisco through a moment of crisis following
the tragic assassinations of George Moscone and Harvey Milk and then
spent the rest of her career fighting to prevent gun violence, including
her critical work to pass the Assault Weapons Ban in 1994. She has
fought for the rights of LGBTQI+ Americans for decades. She has worked
tirelessly to protect California’s public lands, and I have been proud
to work with her to address wildfires and drought across the state. And
as Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, she helped keep Americans
safe while upholding and defending the values we hold dear as
Americans.  
 

Senator Feinstein is one of the greatest public servants that California
and our Nation has ever known. She entered politics and joined the
Senate at a time when there were few other women, and she has since
inspired so many other women leaders to run for office and to serve in
Congress. I look forward to continuing to work together for the
remainder of her term.
