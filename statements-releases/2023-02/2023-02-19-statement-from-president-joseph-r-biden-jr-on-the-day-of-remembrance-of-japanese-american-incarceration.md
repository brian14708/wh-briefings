  \ Japanese American\_Incarceration"

When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066,
eighty-one years ago today, it ushered in one of the most shameful
periods in American history. The wrongful incarceration of 120,000
Americans of Japanese descent tore families apart. Men, women, and
children were forced to abandon their homes, their jobs, their
communities, their businesses, and their way of life. They were sent to
inhumane concentration camps simply because of their heritage. And in a
tragic miscarriage of justice, the Supreme Court upheld these immoral
and unconstitutional policies.

Despite losing liberty, security, and the fundamental freedoms that
rightfully belonged to them, 33,000 Japanese Americans volunteered or
were drafted for service in the U.S. military during World War II. While
their own families were behind barbed wires, Japanese Americans fought
in defense of the nation’s freedom with valor and courage.

The incarceration of Japanese Americans reminds us what happens when
racism, fear, and xenophobia go unchecked. As we battle for the soul of
our nation, we continue to combat the corrosive effects of hate on our
democracy and the intergenerational trauma resulting from it. We
reaffirm the Federal Government’s formal apology to Japanese Americans
for the suffering inflicted by these policies. And we commit to Nidoto
Nai Yoni – to “Let It Not Happen Again.”
