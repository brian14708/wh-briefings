For decades, the U.S. exported jobs and imported products, while other
countries surpassed us in critical sectors like clean energy,
semiconductors, and biotechnology. Thanks to President Biden’s economic
plan – including his American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act – that is
changing. Since the President took office in 2021, companies have
invested over $4 billion in manufacturing across Wisconsin. These
investments are increasing the productivity, competitiveness, and
resilience of both Wisconsin and our nation’s economy. And they’re
creating good-paying jobs, including union jobs and jobs that don’t
require a college degree.  
  
**<u>Manufacturing the Future in Wisconsin:</u>**  
Thanks to the President’s economic plan, private companies have
committed to invest over $4 billion in Wisconsin since 2021. The state’s
economy is now a more attractive place for companies around the world to
invest and expand, creating good-paying jobs in the critical industries
and supply chains of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Just in Wisconsin:
**Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals** has invested in its first fully dedicated
drug manufacturing facility, outside of Madison, that will employ 250
new workers. **Georgia-Pacific** has committed to a major expansion of
its Green Bay paper-related production facility, bringing on 100 new
employees and hiring over 500 construction workers. And **Alliant
Energy** announced it will build utility scale battery storage
facilities at solar farms across south-central Wisconsin using union
workers.

The President is also making sure workers have the skills and resources
they need to capitalize on these new opportunities. For example, his
investments have equipped Wisconsin’s Workforce Innovation Grant program
with $128 million, funding nearly 30 organizations across every
Wisconsin county to address regional workforce challenges, including
through career and skills training, childcare, entrepreneurship, health
services, housing, and transportation.

**<u>Rebuilding Infrastructure and Investing in Wisconsin’s
Communities:</u>**  
Thanks to President Biden’s economic plan, about $2.9 billion in federal
funding has already been announced for infrastructure projects across
Wisconsin. That includes over $2.1 billion for better transportation –
roads, bridges, and roadway safety – as well as about $150 million in
investments for better access to clean water. Already, infrastructure
funding has provided over 300,000 Wisconsin households with more
affordable high-speed internet service. Some project spotlights include:

-   **The City of Racine** received Federal Transit Authority funding to
    replace diesel buses with battery electric buses, improving air
    quality and growing the clean energy economy.  
-   **The Port of Green Bay** received a Federal Maritime Administration
    grant to redevelop a former power plant site into a new port
    terminal, including clearing the existing coal pile site.  
-   **Wisconsin Department of Transportation** received an $80 million
    award to replace the existing I-39/90/94 Wisconsin River Bridge in
    Columbia County with two new bridge spans dedicated to serve traffic
    in both directions as well as two overcrossing bridges on county
    roads – a critical route for the economic hubs of Madison,
    Milwaukee, and Chicago.  
-   EPA announced $1 billion to cleanup and restore the **Great Lakes’**
    most environmentally degraded sites across Indiana, Illinois,
    Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. This funding will secure
    clean water and a better environment for Americans in the Great
    Lakes region.

**<u>Getting Wisconsin Back to Work and Supporting Wisconsin’s Small
Businesses</u>:**  
Two years ago, the Wisconsin unemployment rate was 4.7% and nearly 30%
of Wisconsin’s small businesses were permanently closing. Today,
Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is down to 3.2%, while the number of new
Wisconsin business filings have hit new records, with nearly 118,000
jobs created and 130,000 new businesses filed in the state over the past
two years. Emergency relief from the Biden-Harris Administration helped
to keep open over 2,000 restaurants and bars and over 7,000 child care
programs across Wisconsin.  
  
**<u>Giving Wisconsin Families More Breathing Room</u>:**  
Thanks to President Biden’s economic plan, Wisconsinites will save money
on their health care premiums and prescription drugs, which will result
in better health outcomes and greater financial security for families.
In fact, over 1.1 million Wisconsinites with Medicare will benefit from
a range of new provisions, including a $2,000 yearly cap on
out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, a $35 monthly cap per insulin
prescription, and free vaccines. Additionally, over 220,000 individuals
in Wisconsin signed up for health insurance through the ACA Marketplaces
during the Open Enrollment Period for 2023 and will benefit from up to
thousands of dollars per year in savings from lower health care
premiums.
