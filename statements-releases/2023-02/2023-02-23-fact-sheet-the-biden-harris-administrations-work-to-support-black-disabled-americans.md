title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Work to Support Black\
  \ Disabled\_Americans"
---
 
Black Americans with disabilities are deserving of dignity, respect, and
equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Black History Month
celebrates the resilience and talents of Black people, including Black
disabled people. This country was founded upon the idea that all people
are created equal and should be treated equally. However, it is
important to acknowledge that racism and ableism together are
longstanding barriers to the full participation and independence of
Black people with disabilities. America has made significant progress,
but there is more work to do to become an inclusive, accessible, and
equitable nation.

From the outset, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic
action to advance equity through Executive Orders, administrative
actions, and the provision of funding and resources. Across the whole of
the federal government, agencies are examining their policies and
programs for disparities that have made it difficult for Black Americans
and people with disabilities to thrive in their communities – at work,
at school, and at home. The Administration has delivered real change and
will continue to work towards equitable outcomes and opportunities for
Black disabled Americans.

-    **Apprenticeship.** Registered Apprenticeship is an
    industry-driven, high quality career pathway for employers to
    develop and prepare their future workforce, and individuals to
    obtain paid work experience, classroom instruction, and a portable,
    nationally-recognized credential. The number of apprenticeships has
    grown 70% since 2007. In October 2022, as part of its Partnership on
    Inclusive Apprenticeships initiative, the Department of Labor (DOL)
    launched an Inclusive Apprenticeship Assessment of Historically
    Black Colleges and Universities (HCBUs) to gain insights from
    diverse HBCU stakeholders on their current understanding of
    apprenticeship and how to create and expand apprenticeship programs,
    particularly for Black Americans with disabilities.

-   **Financial Empowerment.** According to US Census Bureau data, the
    highest poverty rate for Black people with disabilities is at 36%,
    the highest among any group.  One third of Black households with a
    household member with a disability spend more than 50% of household
    income on housing. In response, DOL developed a
    [toolkit](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/secure-your-financial-future)
    and held webinars focused on financially empowering Black disabled
    Americans and people with disabilities from other underserved
    communities.

<!-- -->

-   **Understanding the role of Black disabled workers in the economy.**
    In August 2022, DOL hosted an event on *Expanding Inclusive and
    Accessible Apprenticeships for Black Americans with Disabilities in
    High Growth, High Demand Fields* to better understand and address
    gaps in equity specific to Black Americans. The event gave
    participants from diverse industries and backgrounds the chance to
    discuss policies and practices that can help drive the career
    advancement of Black Americans with disabilities in high-growth,
    high-demand fields. Following up on this, in 2023, DOL researchers
    are studying the contributions of Black workers with disabilities in
    skilled trades such as construction, installation, maintenance and
    repair, production, transportation and material moving. The data
    that researchers glean will inform the design and outreach of DOL
    policies and programs to better serve Black workers with
    disabilities.

-   **Promoting equitable disability determinations.** Although African
    American people make up just 12% of the United States population,
    they make up about 35% of people with kidney failure.  In 2022, the
    Social Security Administration (SSA) ended the agency’s use of a
    race-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (or eGFR) to measure
    kidney impairment, which was leading to the misdiagnosis of kidney
    impairment as less severe for many African Americans. Adjudicators
    will now use a single eGFR for all claimants regardless of race.
    This change in policy conforms with scientific advancements and
    recommendations from the medical community and kidney patients.

<!-- -->

-   **Identifying inequities in Social Security programs.** Since 1987,
    there has been a decline in race and ethnicity data in Social
    Security records. SSA is working to improve its data collection to
    help determine whether different groups are underrepresented in
    Social Security programs, provide insight into which programs are
    particularly important to different communities, and examine whether
    there are differences in benefit levels based on race and ethnicity.
    In 2022, SSA compiled and published research and statistics
    detailing the demographic makeup of SSA program populations. In
    addition, SSA made their [Racial Equity Research, Statistics, and
    Data
    Resources](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/about/racial-equity-resources.html)
    available to the public.

-   **Implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL): Prevention
    and elimination of digital discrimination.** The Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC) created a [Task
    Force](https://www.fcc.gov/task-force-prevent-digital-discrimination)
    to oversee development of rules and policies to combat digital
    discrimination and to promote equal access to broadband throughout
    the United States. The FCC is considering expanding the definition
    of “equal access” under BIL to promote greater adoption and use of
    high-speed broadband, especially among populations experiencing a
    range of inequalities based a protected characteristic, or various
    attributes or social determinants that limit their full digital
    engagement. To facilitate this, in December 2022, the FCC published
    a [Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking](https://www.fcc.gov/fcc-announces-comment-due-dates-preventing-digital-discrimination-nprm)
    (NPRM) seeking comments on whether to adopt
    [recommendations](https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/cedc-digital-discrimination-report-110722.pdf)
    that address age, disability, and level of English proficiency. In
    addition, the FCC proposes to revise its informal consumer complaint
    process to accept complaints of digital discrimination.

-   **Addressing disproportionate use of school discipline on Black
    students with disabilities.** Data has shown that while Black
    students are only 17.7% of students with disabilities served under
    the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), they
    represent 30.5% of the in-school suspensions, 35.7% of the
    out-of-school suspensions, and 39% of the expulsions in K-12 public
    schools. These disparities are widespread regardless of the type of
    disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public
    school attended. In July 2022, the Department of Education released
    comprehensive [guidance on IDEA’s discipline
    provisions](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/new-guidance-helps-schools-support-students-with-disabilities-and-avoid-discriminatory-use-of-discipline/)
    and a second [guidance on the protections from discriminatory
    discipline](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/504-discipline-guidance.pdf)
    under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. These resources are
    intended to help public elementary and secondary schools meet the
    needs of students with disabilities and avoid the use of
    exclusionary discipline.

-   **Supporting Black children with disabilities and their families.**
    The Department of Education provides funding to states under IDEA
    Part C—the Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities—to
    coordinate and deliver early intervention services for infants and
    toddlers ages birth to 2 with disabilities and their families.
    Evidence has shown that historically, [Black families and their
    children have been underserved by Part
    C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138901/). Expanding
    equitable access to high-quality early childhood supports and
    education is a priority for the Biden-Harris Administration. The
    Department has invested $4 million in training programs at HBCUs,
    Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions
    to increase the number of early intervention providers in
    communities of color.  The Department has also established a new
    technical assistance center that will support states in implementing
    evidence-based strategies for conducting outreach to families
    typically underserved by Part C programs, such as by employing
    culturally and linguistically responsive practices. On December
    14<sup>th</sup>, 2022, the Office of Special Education Programs
    hosted a digital event to announce and provide an overview of new
    resource guides to help States increase access to early intervention
    services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their
    families. IDEA Part C has strong evidence of improving outcomes for
    children and improving equity by encouraging states to increase
    access for Black children and their families.

-   **Strengthening nondiscrimination in health care.**The Department of
    Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil Rights issued a
    [proposed rule to strengthen nondiscrimination in health care on the
    basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, and age
    under the Affordable Care
    Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-16217/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-and-activities). 
    The NPRM recognizes that people with disabilities — and especially
    people with disabilities who are members of racial and ethnic groups
    that have historically faced discrimination and structural
    disadvantages in the United States — experience disproportionately
    poor health status.  The proposed rule ensures there are legal
    protections in a diversity of health programs and activities. ****

-   **Measuring the quality of home- and community-based services (HCBS)
    and promoting equity for Black older adults and individuals with
    disabilities.** Medicaid’s HCBS provide support to older adults and
    individuals with disabilities who may need assistance with daily
    activities. Over 7 million people receive HCBS. However, research
    has shown that Black HCBS users are less likely to receive case
    management services, equipment, technology, environmental
    modification services, and nursing services. In July 2022, the
    Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released the
    first-ever HCBS quality measure set to promote both consistent
    quality measurement within and across state Medicaid HCBS programs.
    CMS is encouraging states to adopt the measure set to improve the
    quality of HCBS. This is a critical step to promoting health equity,
    as it can help states identify racial, ethnic, and other disparities
    in quality, experience of care, and outcomes among the millions of
    people receiving long-term services and supports.

-   **Enforcing the integration mandate of the Americans with
    Disabilities Act.** In June 2021, the Department of Justice issued a
    findings letter concluding that Maine failed to provide behavioral
    health services to children in the most integrated setting
    appropriate to their needs, unnecessarily relying on segregated
    settings to provide these services, in violation of the Americans
    with Disabilities Act.  In addition, the letter noted a study that
    highlighted the disproportionate number of children with
    disabilities in juvenile detention in Maine and indicated that youth
    of color experience worse outcomes in Maine’s juvenile justice
    system.  As one example, the study found that Black children are
    detained at eight times their share of the population and are
    committed or sentenced to juvenile detention at five times their
    share of the population.

-   **Improving Equity in Entrepreneurship.** In September 2022, HHS
    began funding a [research grant at Langston
    University](https://search.naric.com/research/redesign_record.cfm?search=1&type=all&criteria=langston%20equity&phrase=no&rec=3981),
    a land grant HBCU focused on reducing employment disparities for
    Black people with disabilities and other multiply marginalized
    disabled people. A focus of the project’s studies will examine
    entrepreneurial outcomes of a new innovative model that supports
    Black adults with disabilities and other multiply marginalized
    entrepreneurs with disabilities to create small businesses that lead
    to self-employment and close the wealth gap.
-   **Protecting Black Americans’ access to housing by combating housing
    discrimination.** Following President Biden’s Presidential
    Memorandum directing his Administration to address racial
    discrimination in the housing market, the Department of Housing and
    Urban Development published an NPRM in January 2023 to fulfill
    obligations under the Fair Housing Act to Affirmatively Further Fair
    Housing. This rule will help overcome patterns of segregation and to
    hold state, localities, and public housing agencies that receive
    federal funds accountable for ensuring that underserved communities
    have equitable access to affordable housing opportunities.
