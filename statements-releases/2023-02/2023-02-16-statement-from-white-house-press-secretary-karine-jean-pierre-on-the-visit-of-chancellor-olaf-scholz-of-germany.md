title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Visit\
  \ of Chancellor Olaf Scholz of\_Germany"
---
 
President Biden looks forward to welcoming Chancellor Olaf Scholz of
Germany to the White House on Friday, March 3, 2023.  The Chancellor’s
visit is an opportunity to reaffirm the deep bonds of friendship between
the United States and our NATO Ally Germany.  At the one-year mark of
Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, the leaders will discuss our
ongoing efforts to support Ukraine, impose costs on Russia for its
aggression, and strengthen transatlantic security.  They will also
review our continued cooperation on a range of regional and global
security issues, including working together on shared challenges posed
by China and our cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.
