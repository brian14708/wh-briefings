On Wednesday, in celebration of Black History Month, the White House
Office of Public Engagement hosted a listening session with over 70
Black venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) stakeholders titled
Bolstering the U.S. Economy by Closing the Racial Wealth Gap. The
discussion was moderated by Under Secretary Don Cravins from the
Minority Business Development Agency, which was permanently authorized
under President Biden’s leadership, granting the agency expanded power
to support Black-and other minority-owned businesses.

available to stakeholders that promote economic growth in the Black
community. Stakeholders shared the ways in which the cultivation of a

wealth creation.

implemented legislation, developed programs, and appropriated funds to
deliver equitable outcomes and opportunities for Black Americans.
