title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Launches Next Phase of Public-Private Partnership\
  \ for Northern Central\_America"
---
 
In May 2021, Vice President Harris
[launched](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=d3f9f266f4&e=0ca263633c)
a Call to Action for Northern Central America that challenged U.S.
corporations to invest and create economic opportunity in El Salvador,
Guatemala, and Honduras.  To date, the Call to Action and the
Partnership for Central America (PCA) have galvanized more than $4.2
billion in private sector commitments to create economic opportunity in
northern Central America.  
   
To build on the momentum generated under this successful initiative,
today Vice President Harris and PCA launched the next chapter by
announcing “Central America Forward.”  Consistent with the broader goals
of the [U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of
Migration](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=141540cd52&e=0ca263633c),
Central America Forward is a framework that goes beyond addressing the
economic drivers of migration. It incorporates a focus on good
governance and labor rights into this public-private partnership, key
priorities under the Strategy that are also essential in ensuring the
success of our private sector partners.  
   
Central America Forward exemplifies the U.S. government’s commitment to
encouraging private sector investments. It builds on the programming
being deployed under each pillar of the Root Causes Strategy,
effectively combining Call to Action commitments with dedicated U.S.
government programming and resources to facilitate investment-led
growth.  
   
The framework includes a series of new U.S. government commitments to
complement and support private sector investments.  
 

-   A new **U.S. Government Northern Central America Investment
    Facilitation Team**, which will support clean energy infrastructure
    development, facilitate private sector operations, and promote
    sustainable economic development in the region.

<!-- -->

-   Increased access to **U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation (DFC) financing for private sector-led projects** in
    Northern Central America, with a focus on enhancing economic
    opportunities for underserved communities where financing can have
    the highest development and migration reduction impacts.

<!-- -->

-   USAID **workforce development programs to train youth in skills
    demanded by the private sector** and provide for the workforce
    development needs of the future.

<!-- -->

-   The **Central America Service Corps**, announced in June 2022, which
    will provide young people in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras
    with paid community service opportunities, mentorship, and a path to
    future employment.

<!-- -->

-   A **“Good Governance, Good Jobs” Declaration** outlining U.S.
    government and PCA commitments to combat corruption and protect
    labor rights in the region.

<!-- -->

-   A **Business-Enabling Environment Action Plan,** which will leverage
    new private sector investments to promote anti-corruption, good
    governance, and labor compliance while fostering a healthy
    investment climate.

<!-- -->

-   New **worker-driven Corporate Social Responsibility tools and
    targeted approaches** to address the needs of the most vulnerable
    populations, with a focus on empowering women via the [“In Her
    Hands”](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=68e47a6ca0&e=0ca263633c)
    initiative.

   
In addition, as part of the implementation of this Framework, the
Partnership for Central America has identified the following goals:  
 

-   **Job Creation & Sustainable Income:** Create and secure jobs for 1
    million individuals by 2032.

    75,000 individuals across the region by 2027 to prepare them for
    employment.
