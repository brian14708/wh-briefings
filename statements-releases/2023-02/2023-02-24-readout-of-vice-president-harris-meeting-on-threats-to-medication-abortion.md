title: "Readout of Vice President Harris\u2019 Meeting on\_Threats to\_Medication\_\
  Abortion"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened a meeting at the White
House with leading medical experts and reproductive rights leaders to
discuss protecting reproductive health care. The Vice President
addressed the importance of access to medication abortion, which is
currently subject to litigation and accounts for more than half of all
abortions in the United States—and is commonly used for miscarriage
management. 

During the meeting, the participants discussed the devastating
impact of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade on
women’s health and how attacks on medication abortion
exacerbate difficulties accessingcare. They emphasized
the long-standing safety and efficacy record of medication abortion and
the need to safeguard access to this critical medication. Participants
also discussed the chilling effect that state abortion restrictions are
having on health care providers giving basic care to their patients. 

The Vice President noted how attempts to undermine access to medication
abortion not only threaten our public health system but also
threaten fundamental freedoms. The participants discussed how challenges
to the FDA’s authority to determine the safety of drugs could undermine
public confidence in the continued availability of other approved
medications.

Throughout the conversation, the participants discussed the importance
of coalition building in the fight for reproductive freedom. The Vice
President thanked the participants for
their dedication to providing reproductive care to patients and
their leadership in fighting to protect the ability for people to make
decisions about their own bodies.
