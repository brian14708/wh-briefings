title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Retirement of Senator Dianne\_Feinstein"
---
 
Senator Dianne Feinstein was elected in 1992 – dubbed the Year of the
Woman in part because of her victory. Often the only woman in the room,
she was determined to lift America up, and through her intellect,
empathy, character, and drive, to make this country everything it could
be.   
   
As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I knew I wanted Dianne to
serve alongside me, with her proven track record of standing up for
people’s rights and fighting to make their lives better. She agreed to
join the Committee, and the nation was better for it.  
   
Through force of will, she led the fight to get the assault weapons ban
passed. Like so many who have been touched by gun violence, that victory
was personal for her. She is a passionate defender of civil liberties
and a strong voice for national security policies that keep us safe
while honoring our values. A lifelong Californian, she has worked
tirelessly to protect our environment for future generations.  
   
Over the three decades I’ve known her, Dianne and her late husband
Richard became dear friends to Jill and me. I’ve served with more U.S.
Senators than just about anyone. I can honestly say that Dianne
Feinstein is one of the very best. I look forward to continuing to work
with her as she serves out her term.
