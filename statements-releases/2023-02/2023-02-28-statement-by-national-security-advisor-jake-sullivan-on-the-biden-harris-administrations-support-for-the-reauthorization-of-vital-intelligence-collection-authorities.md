title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Biden-\u2060Harris\
  \ Administration\u2019s Support for the Reauthorization of Vital Intelligence Collection\_\
  Authorities"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration strongly supports the reauthorization by
Congress of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
(FISA), a vital intelligence collection authority, which the Attorney
General and the Director of National Intelligence conveyed today in a
joint letter to congressional leadership.  Section 702 has proven a
cornerstone of U.S. national security. This authority is an invaluable
tool that continues to protect Americans every day and is crucial to
ensuring that U.S. defense, intelligence, and law enforcement agencies
can respond to threats from the People’s Republic of China, Russia,
nefarious cyber actors, terrorists, and those who seek to harm our
critical infrastructure.  
   
Reauthorization of Section 702 and other expiring FISA provisions is a
top priority for the Administration. I have asked Principal Deputy
National Security Advisor Jon Finer to coordinate the reauthorization
effort for the White House, in close partnership with the Department of
Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and other
federal partners, as we engage constructively with the Congress to
preserve this essential tool for protecting the United States.
