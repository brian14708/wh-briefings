title: "FACT SHEET:\_New Data Show the American Rescue Plan and Other Pandemic Relief\
  \ Funds Have Helped 18 Million College\_Students"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that an estimated 18
million<sup>\[1\]</sup>  students have received direct financial aid
since the start of 2021 thanks to the Higher Education Emergency Relief
Fund (HEERF), which was dramatically expanded by President Biden in the
American Rescue Plan (ARP). Today’s announcement and a
[report](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/heerf-2021-annual-performance-report.pdf)
from the Department of Education (Department) show that tens of billions
of dollars—accounting for roughly half of all funds provided by ARP and
earlier pandemic legislation—went directly to aiding students in the
form of emergency financial aid grants and the discharge of unpaid
student account balances. First Lady Jill Biden, Secretary of Education
Miguel Cardona, and American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling
highlighted today’s news on a call with Delaware State President Tony
Allen and students who benefited directly from HEERF funds. During the
call, participants discussed how these funds allowed millions of
students to avoid dropping out during the pandemic, helped them to
afford the costs of college, and helped meet their basic needs like
food, housing, transportation, and child care. By supporting college
persistence and completion, this assistance is also contributing to a
stronger post-pandemic workforce.

In March of 2021, President Biden signed the ARP, which included the
largest round of HEERF investments in the program’s history. HEERF funds
are aimed at protecting college students from hardships as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today’s announcement highlights new data from the Department that
includes the following:

-   **18 million college students received direct financial aid since
    the start of 2021:** Emergency aid grants provided by HEERF could be
    used to support any expense related to a student’s cost of
    attendance, including food, housing, mental health, and child care.
    **In 2021 alone, institutions of higher education (institutions)
    provided $19.5 billion in emergency aid grants to nearly 13 million
    students. Nearly half of all students who were enrolled at
    HEERF-participating institutions received HEERF-funded emergency
    grants in 2021.**
-   **6 million community college students received direct financial
    aid:** The Department projects that 6 million community college
    students have received an emergency aid grant since the start
    of 2021. In 2021 alone, roughly 3.5 million community college
    students received an emergency aid grant, representing nearly half
    of all community college students enrolled that year.
-   **450,000 students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities
    (HBCUs) received direct financial aid:** All 101 HBCUs received
    support through HEERF to provide relief for their students—reaching
    a projected total of 450,0000 students with emergency financial aid
    grants since the start of 2021. This includes more than 290,000
    students in 2021 alone. Additionally, in 2021, over three-quarters
    (77 percent) of HBCUs used HEERF funds to discharge unpaid student
    balances.
-   **Nearly 8 million students at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs)
    received direct financial aid:** Since the start of 2021, the
    Department projects that nearly 8 million students at MSIs received
    emergency aid grants as a result of HEERF support.
-   **24,000 students at Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs)
    received direct financial aid:** The Department projects that 24,000
    students at TCUs have directly benefited from HEERF emergency aid
    grants since the start of 2021. In 2021 alone, nearly 70 percent of
    students at TCUs received an emergency aid grant, reaching more than
    14,000 students.
-   **In 2021, 94 percent of community colleges, and 90 percent of
    institutions overall, report that HEERF assisted them in keeping
    students enrolled who were at risk of dropping out by providing
    financial support.**
-   **ARP and other pandemic higher education aid were
    well-targeted—with 80 percent of Pell Grant recipients receiving
    direct aid:** While half of all students are estimated to have
    received emergency aid grants from HEERF in 2021, 80 percent of
    those receiving Pell Grants did. Pell Grant recipients and students
    enrolled at under-resourced institutions—including HBCUs, TCUs,
    MSIs, and institutions eligible for funds under the Strengthening
    Institutions Program (SIP)—were more likely to receive aid and
    typically received aid in higher amounts.
-   **Institutions used HEERF funding to boost retention and completion,
    address enrollment declines, and reengage students:** For example,
    over 1,400 institutions provided relief to students by discharging
    nearly $1.5 billion in unpaid balances in 2021 alone.

During the pandemic, Congress provided historic support for college
students and the institutions that support them—including nearly $40
billion through President Biden’s ARP. About 5,000 colleges and
universities received HEERF funding and were able to move quickly to
deliver needed assistance. By the end of 2022, these institutions had
expended more than 90 percent of all HEERF funding, including more than
80 percent of HEERF funding provided through ARP. On average, 50 percent
of the total HEERF funds have gone directly to students in the form of
emergency aid grants, helping them to continue their education amidst
challenges brought on by the pandemic.

Specifically, the Department’s [latest
data](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/heerf-2021-annual-performance-report.pdf)
on the impact of HEERF funds in 2021 show that:

-   **Institutions distributed $19.5 billion in emergency financial aid
    grants to 12.7 million students—including 80 percent of Pell Grant
    recipients**—through the portion of HEERF reserved for direct
    student aid in 2021.
    -   Approximately 2,000 institutions chose to provide an additional
        $1.7 billion in emergency financial aid grants through their
        HEERF institutional funds.
-   **Nine in 10 institutions reported that HEERF funds enabled them to
    keep students who were at risk of dropping out due to
    pandemic-related factors enrolled.** Additionally:
    -   Roughly seven in 10 institutions stated that HEERF enabled them
        to keep students enrolled by providing them with computers and
        internet access.
    -   Over 1,400 institutions provided nearly $1.5 billion on in
        assistance to students by discharging unpaid student balances.
-   **Nearly all community colleges, HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs say HEERF
    funds kept students from dropping out.**
    -   More than 94 percent of community colleges, HBCUs, TCUs, MSIs
        and SIP-eligible institutions stated that HEERF enabled their
        institutions to keep students enrolled who were at risk of
        dropping out by providing financial support.
    -   61 percent of HBCUs, TCUs, MSIs, and SIP-eligible institutions
        (1,026 institutions) spent $1.4 billion in institutional funds
        to provide for additional emergency financial aid grants in
        2021.
-   **HEERF funds were deployed quickly to aid students in need, with
    more than half spent in 2021 alone.**
    -   53 percent, or $39 billion, of total HEERF dollars were spent in
        2021, including roughly 40 percent or $15.8 billion of the HEERF
        funding provided under ARP.
    -   **To date, institutions have spent over 90 percent of their
        HEERF funds**—including 85 percent of total funds, and 97
        percent of student funds, provided under ARP.

The Administration is also releasing overviews of 2021 HEERF [data by
state](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/heerf-2021-state-by-state.pdf)
and for [community
colleges](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/communitycolleges-bythenumbers-final.pdf),
[HBCUs](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/hbcus-bythenumbers.pdf),
[TCUs](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/tccus-bythenumbers.pdf),
and
[MSIs](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/msis-bythenumbers.pdf).

HEERF is just one part of the Administration’s comprehensive approach to
help students and borrowers:

-   **In just the first two years of the Biden-Harris Administration,
    the Department discharged $48 billion in targeted relief to nearly 2
    million student loan borrowers**, including borrowers who were taken
    advantage of by their institutions and borrowers in public service. 
-   **In August, President Biden announced his Administration’s plan to
    provide up to $20,000 in one-time debt relief to more than 40
    million Americans, which will help borrowers most at risk of
    financial hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic avoid default
    or delinquency when the payment pause ends.** While the
    Administration is confident in its legal authority to carry out this
    debt relief program, it is currently blocked due to lawsuits brought
    on by opponents of the program. The Department of Justice will make
    the Administration’s case for one-time debt relief directly to the
    Supreme Court on February 28th.

<!-- -->

-   **Last month, the Department proposed an income-driven repayment
    plan that would cut payments on undergraduate loans in half and make
    sure no borrower has to choose between putting food on the table or
    paying an unaffordable student loan bill.**
-   **President Biden signed into law historic investments in the Pell
    Grant program—increasing the maximum award by $900 over the last two
    years.**

The Administration also continues to fight to make community college
free, so more Americans—regardless of their income or background—can
build the skills needed to obtain good jobs and support their families.
With historic investments in growing sectors such as manufacturing,
infrastructure, and clean energy through the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, all of
these efforts will increase affordable pathways for students to and
through educational institutions, particularly community colleges, into
next generation job opportunities.

\[1\] This includes the number of students reported to have received
funds in 2021 and the projected number of students who will receive
funds in 2022. To get the projected number, the Department used HEERF
spending data, including spending from student aid funds in 2022, the
percentage of institutional funds spent by institutions on additional
emergency aid grants, and the average student award. The projected
number may include students that received funds in both 2021 and 2022.
