From February 20<sup>th</sup> – 22<sup>nd</sup>, President Joseph R.
Biden, Jr. will travel to Poland. He will meet with President Andrzej
Duda of Poland to discuss our bilateral cooperation as well as our
collective efforts to support Ukraine and bolster NATO’s deterrence. He
will also meet with the leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a group of
our eastern flank NATO Allies, to reaffirm the United States’ unwavering
support for the security of the Alliance. In addition, President Biden
will deliver remarks ahead of the one year anniversary of Russia’s
brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, addressing how the United
States has rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine as they
defend their freedom and democracy, and how we will continue to stand
with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes.
