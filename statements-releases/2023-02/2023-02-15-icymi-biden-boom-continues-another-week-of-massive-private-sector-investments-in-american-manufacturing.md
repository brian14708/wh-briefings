title: "ICYMI: Biden Boom Continues: Another Week of Massive Private Sector Investments\
  \ in American\_Manufacturing"
---
 
This week, we saw more evidence that an American manufacturing
boom—thanks to the President’s economic agenda—continues to take hold
all across the country.

1.  **Boeing** announced one of the largest orders in the company’s
    history: a purchase of over 200 aircraft through an agreement
    between Air India and Boeing valued at $34 billion at list price.
    The purchase will support over one million American jobs across 44
    states, and many of those jobs won’t require a four year degree.
2.  **Ford** announced it will build a $3.5 billion factory in Marshall,
    Michigan that will employ at least 2,500 workers to make advanced
    batteries for electric vehicles.
3.  **Texas Instruments** announced it would build a new, $11 billion
    semiconductor plant in Lehi, Utah. manufacturing in Utah.

These investments—which build on the hundreds of billions of dollars in
private investment announced since President Biden took office—will lead
to good-paying jobs that American can raise a family on, the
revitalization of entire communities that have often been left behind,
and America leading the world again in the industries that drive the
future.

As President Biden often asks, “Where is it written that the United
States of America can’t be the manufacturing capital of the world?”

President Joe Biden on Tuesday termed Air India’s $34 billion order for
220 Boeing planes as a “historic” deal that will support his agenda with
one million US jobs and promote its lead in technology.

He linked the orders to his domestic plans to create good jobs for the
working class, noting that many of the one million jobs “will not
require a four-year college degree” and will be spread across 44 states.

Biden has been pushing for creating better-paying industrial jobs for
the working class beaten down by such works going overseas, mainly to
China, as well as boosting manufacturing in the US.

Ford Motor Co. plans to build a $3.5 billion factory in Michigan that
would employ at least 2,500 people to make lower-cost batteries for a
variety of new and existing electric vehicles.

The plant, to be built on land being readied for industrial development
about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Detroit, would start making
batteries in 2026. It would crank out enough batteries to supply 400,000
vehicles per year, Ford said.

\[Tomi Kilgore, 2/15/23\]

Texas Instruments Inc. said Wednesday it will build a second
300-millimeter semiconductor wafer fabrication plant in Lehi, Utah, as
part of the chip maker’s $11 billion investment in the state. Once the
second fab is completed, it will be combined with the one that is
already there, and will eventually operate as one fab.

The new fab will create about 800 additional Texas Instruments jobs, and
likely “thousands” of indirect jobs. “With the anticipated growth of
semiconductors in electronics, particularly in industrial and
automotive, and the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, there is no
better time to further invest in our internal manufacturing capacity,”
said Haviv Ilan, who will be the company’s chief executive officer
effective April 1.
