  \ Meeting and\_Communique"
---
 
We welcome the meeting held today in Aqaba, Jordan, between senior
officials of Israel, the Palestinian Authority (PA), Jordan, Egypt, and
the United States. This was the first meeting of its kind in years, and
resulted in the [Aqaba
Communiqué](https://www.state.gov/aqaba-joint-communique/), with
commitments by the Government of Israel and the PA to de-escalate and
prevent further violence. The two sides also affirmed their commitment
to all previous agreements between them, and to work towards a just and
lasting peace. We recognize that this meeting was a starting point and
that there is much work to do over the coming weeks and months to build
a stable and prosperous future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.
Implementation will be critical.

The President extends his personal thanks to His Majesty, King Abdullah
II, for convening this historic gathering, and for the personal efforts
of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi over recent weeks to establish the
conditions for its success. The United States will continue to remain
actively engaged in this format with all parties over the coming weeks,
including through a follow up engagement next month in Sharm El Sheikh,
Egypt.
