title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Black Speakers of the\_House"
---
 
Today, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and
Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and
Ambassador Susan Rice, Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy
Advisor, met with the historic five Black Speakers of the House from
state legislatures across the country: Speaker Chris Welch of Illinois,
Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross of Maine, Speaker Adrienne Jones of Maryland,
Speaker Joe Tate of Michigan, and Speaker Carl Heastie of New York.  
  
During the meeting, the Speakers discussed the critical work they are
doing in partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration to deliver for
working families in their states and outlined priorities for enhanced
collaboration. From expanding economic opportunity, including lowering
costs and expanding housing access and affordability, to advancing
voting rights, gun violence prevention, criminal justice reform, and
reproductive rights, Administration and state leaders are aligned on an
ambitious policy agenda.  
  
The White House officials thanked the Speakers for their leadership and
congratulated them on their historic elections. President Biden has
ushered in some of the most significant federal legislation in decades,
including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction
Act, American Rescue Plan Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the PACT Act
the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,
the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, the Electoral
Count Reform Act, and the Respect for Marriage Act. The White House
officials reiterated the importance of federal-state partnership to
implement many of the critical provisions in these bills, as well as the
importance of state leadership in advancing policies that Congress
cannot or will not advance. Â
