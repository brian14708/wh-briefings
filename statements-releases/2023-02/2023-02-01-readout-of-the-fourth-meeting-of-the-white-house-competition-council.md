title: "Readout of the Fourth Meeting of the White\_House Competition\_Council"
---
 
This afternoon, the President convened the White House Competition
Council to discuss the significant progress made toward lowering costs
for the American people thanks to his Executive Order on Promoting
Competition in the American Economy. The Council also discussed plans
for further action in the coming weeks, months, and years. The
Competition Council drives the Administration’s whole-of-government
effort to restore competition and coordinate progress on the Executive
Order’s 72 initiatives, delivering concrete benefits of increased
competition to America’s consumers, workers, farmers, and small
businesses.  
   
The President commended Council members for taking up his [call to
action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2022/10/26/the-presidents-initiative-on-junk-fees-and-related-pricing-practices/)
to address exorbitant junk fees in a variety of industries, announced
new steps by his Administration, and urged more action to address these
hidden, surprise fees that hit the most vulnerable Americans the
hardest. Today’s announcements include:

-   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) [released a proposed
    rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/)
    that would lower the amount credit card companies can charge in late
    fees. Currently, 18 out of 20 major credit card issuers charge the
    maximum late fee allowed, which is $30 for the first late payment
    and $41 for a subsequent late payment. The proposed rule would lower
    that fee to less than $10 for a majority of credit cards. The CFPB
    estimates that this proposed rule, if made final, could save
    Americans $9 billion in fees.  
-   The President called on Congress to take action to address some of
    the most persistent and unfair fees that Americans face by passing a
    [Junk Fee Prevention
    Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-highlights-new-progress-on-his-competition-agenda/),
    which would:  
    -   Crack down on excessive online concert, sporting event, and
        other entertainment ticket fees.
    -   Ban airline fees for family members to sit with young children.
    -   Eliminate exorbitant early termination fees for TV, phone, and
        internet service.
    -   Ban surprise resort and destination fees.

The Council members used the rest of the meeting to discuss strategic
priorities for the first half of the year and additional actions
expected in the coming months, including how the Council can continue to
institutionalize the President’s competition agenda in each agency and
deliver cost saving measures for Americans.
