  Airspace"

The United States welcomes the Sultanate of Oman’s decision to open its
airspace to all civilian planes, including those flying to and from
Israel. This historic step completes a process begun last year, during
President Biden’s visit to the Middle East region, when Saudi Arabia
similarly opened its airspace to all civilian planes. Oman’s
announcement promotes President Biden’s vision of a more integrated,
stable, and prosperous Middle East region, which is vital for the
security and prosperity of the American people and our regional
partners. For the first time in history, passengers flying to and from
Israel will now be able to travel on direct routes between Israel, Asia,
and points in between. The United States was pleased to support these
efforts through months of quiet diplomatic engagement. We are
particularly grateful for the long-standing partnership with Oman and
the leadership of Sultan Haitham bin Tariq.
