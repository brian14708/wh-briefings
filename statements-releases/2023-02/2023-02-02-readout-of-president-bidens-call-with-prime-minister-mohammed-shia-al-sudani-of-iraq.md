President Joe Biden spoke today with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’

regional developments.  The President reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to
the Strategic Framework Agreement with Iraq and commended the Prime
Minister’s efforts to strengthen Iraq’s sovereignty and independence. 
The leaders discussed the Prime Minister’s economic agenda and plans to
ensure that Iraq’s economy is delivering for the Iraqi people, policies
the U.S. is prepared to fully endorse.  The President welcomed the
upcoming visit by Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein and an
accompanying delegation next week to Washington to further discuss these
programs.  The two leaders recommitted to ensuring that ISIS can never
again threaten the Iraqi people or regional and international security. 
The President took the opportunity of His Majesty King Abdullah of

strategic infrastructure projects.  The President and Prime Minister
agreed to stay in close collaboration over the coming months.
