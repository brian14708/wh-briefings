title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on 100th Judicial\_Confirmation"
---
 
As a former chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, strengthening the
federal judiciary with extraordinarily qualified judges who are devoted
to our Constitution and the rule of law has been among my proudest work
in office.  
   
I’m especially proud that the nominees I have put forward—and the Senate
has confirmed—represent the diversity that is one of our best assets as
a nation, and that our shared work has broken so many barriers in just 2
years.   
   
Yesterday, for example, the Senate confirmed Cindy Chung to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit; in addition to previously
serving as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania,
she will be the first AA and NHPI judge to serve on this circuit court. 
Today, the Senate confirmed Judge Gina Mendez-Miro, who currently serves
on the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals, to serve on the U.S. District Court
for the District of Puerto Rico; she will be the first openly LGBTQI+
judge to serve on that court.  
   
We have made important progress in ensuring that the federal judiciary
not only looks more like the nation as a whole, but also includes judges
from professional backgrounds that have been historically
underrepresented on the bench. To that end, I have appointed more
federal circuit judges with experience as public defenders than all
prior presidents combined.  Seventy-six percent of the Article III
judges confirmed during my Administration have been women, and 68% have
been people of color.  I was proud to nominate Justice Ketanji Brown
Jackson as the first Black woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, and
I am also proud to have confirmed 12 Black women to serve on federal
circuit courts—more than all other Presidents combined.  
   
Since long before the inauguration, I directed my team to make judicial
confirmations a leading priority of this administration, and they acted
quickly to begin consultations with Senators from both parties about how
we could be as productive as possible. And we certainly have been
productive.  
   
This is a profound moment, and I want to thank Leader Schumer, Chair
Durbin, and Senators on both sides of the aisle for working in good
faith to reach this milestone for our country.
