title: "FACT SHEET: White\_House Highlights Infrastructure Progress in Every Corner\
  \ of the Country, Updates State-by-State Fact\_Sheets"
---
 
Over one year ago, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law – a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s infrastructure
and competitiveness. While “infrastructure week” was a punchline under
his predecessor, President Biden is delivering an “infrastructure
decade” that is producing real results to change people’s lives for the
better, creating good-paying jobs, and boosting American manufacturing.

In his first State of the Union Address in 2022, President Biden
highlighted how our historic federal investments in infrastructure would
create a visible impact in the lives of American families by committing
to start repair on 65,000 miles of roads and 1,500 bridges. The
President also committed to making rapid progress across every facet of
the law. 

Since the last State of the Union, the Administration has surpassed
those [ambitious
goals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-actions-to-address-the-needs-of-people-with-disabilities-and-older-adults-in-response-to-and-recovery-from-covid-19-2/).
This includes launching over 3,700 bridge repair and replacement
projects across the country, beginning repair of over 69,000 miles of
roadway, awarding funds for over 3,000 new clean transit and school
buses, increasing enrollment in the Affordable Connectivity Program to
over 16 million households, and approving state plans for water funding,
EV charging networks and high-speed internet deployment.  

Overall, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents historic progress,
as the largest and most significant investment in:

-   Rebuilding our roads and bridges since President Eisenhower’s
    Interstate Highway System;  
-   Public transit in American history and an historic investment to
    make public transportation accessible;  
-   Passenger rail since Amtrak’s inception, 50 years ago;  
-   Clean water infrastructure;  
-   Affordable, high-speed internet;  
-   Tackling legacy pollution and advancing environmental justice;  
-   Upgrading the power grid to transmit more clean energy and withstand
    extreme weather;  
-   Increasing our infrastructure’s resilience against the impacts of
    climate change, extreme weather events, and cyber-attacks;  
-   Replacing dirty diesel buses with clean, electric buses across
    school bus and transit fleets; and,  
-   A national network of EV chargers in the United States and largest
    investment in domestic manufacturing of batteries and the critical
    minerals that power them.

These once-in-a-generation investments are positioning the United States
to win the 21st century. That is why the Biden-Harris Administration has
been laser-focused on implementing the law.

-   To date, the Administration has announced **nearly $200 billion in
    funding and over 20,000 projects or awards**, which are highlighted
    in a [new map showcasing all projects and funding awards in all 50
    states](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/maps-of-progress/) and
    territories. These awards and projects touch **over 4,500
    communities**.   
-   In recent weeks, the President has announced awards for [regionally
    or nationally-significant
    projects](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/31/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-funding-for-major-transportation-projects-funded-by-bipartisan-infrastructure-law/)
    including over $2 billion to upgrade some our nation’s most
    economically significant bridges and over $1.2 billion in Mega
    grants. These infrastructure investments will create good-paying
    jobs – including union jobs and jobs that do not require a college
    degree. The projects will grow the economy, strengthen supply
    chains, improve mobility for residents, and make our transportation
    systems safer for all users.  To highlight that progress, the White
    House unveiled an illustrative map of signature projects on
    build.gov.   
-   The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to making the funding
    opportunities from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law both accessible
    and transparent, so communities across America know what to apply
    for, who to contact, and how to get ready to rebuild. Our goal is to
    help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments navigate,
    access, and deploy infrastructure resources that will build a better
    America. As such, the White House today released an updated
    [calendar of notices of funding
    opportunity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/nofos-to-know/)
    expected throughout the year.  
-   Today, the White House Infrastructure Implementation Team also
    released [new state-by-state fact
    sheets](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/state-fact-sheets/) which
    outline the progress in all 50 states, DC and the territories as of
    January 13, 2023.
