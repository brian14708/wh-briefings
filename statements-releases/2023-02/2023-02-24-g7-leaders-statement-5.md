title: "G7 Leaders\u2019 Statement"
---
 
-   At the one-year mark of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, we, the
    Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met with Ukraine’s President
    Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine
    for as long as it takes. Russia’s heinous attacks over the last 365
    days have laid bare the cruelty of the ongoing aggression. We
    condemn Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war,
    disregard for the Charter of the United Nations (UN) and
    indifference to the impacts that its war is having on people
    worldwide. We salute the heroism of the Ukrainian people in their
    brave resistance. We commit to intensifying our diplomatic,
    financial and military support for Ukraine, to increasing the costs
    to Russia and those supporting its war effort, and to continuing to
    counter the negative impacts of the war on the rest of the world,
    particularly on the most vulnerable people.
-   Russia started this war and Russia can end this war. We call on
    Russia to stop its ongoing aggression and to immediately, completely
    and unconditionally withdraw its troops from the entire
    internationally recognized territory of Ukraine. In the past year
    Russian forces have killed thousands of Ukrainians, caused millions
    to flee, and forcibly deported many thousands of Ukrainians,
    including children, to Russia. Russia has destroyed hospitals,
    schools, and energy and critical infrastructure, and left historic
    cities in ruins. In areas liberated from Russian forces, there is
    evidence of mass graves, sexual violence, torture and other
    atrocities. We strongly condemn all of Russia’s outrageous acts.
    Amidst Russia’s assault, Ukrainians are more united, proud and
    determined than ever.
-   Russia’s war against Ukraine is also an attack on the fundamental
    principles of sovereignty of nations, territorial integrity of
    states and respect for human rights. We remain united and resolute
    in our support of the UN Charter. We reiterate our unequivocal
    condemnation and firm rejection of the attempted illegal annexation
    by Russia of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson
    regions. As in the case of Crimea and Sevastopol, we will never
    recognize these illegal annexation attempts.
-   We reiterate that Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is
    unacceptable, and any use of chemical, biological, radiological or
    nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. We
    recall the consensus achieved in Bali of all G20 members, including
    Russia, that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is
    inadmissible. We also recall the importance of the 77-year record of
    non-use of nuclear weapons. We deeply regret Russia’s decision to
    suspend the implementation of the new START treaty. We express our
    gravest concern over Russia’s continued occupation and control over
    the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. The situation can only be
    resolved by complete withdrawal of Russian troops and equipment from
    the premises. We support the International Atomic Energy Agency’s
    (IAEA) efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security in Ukraine,
    including through the continuous presence of IAEA experts and the
    cessation of all combat operations in and around the plant and
    surrounding infrastructure.
-   We welcome the resolution A/ES-11/L.7 titled “Principles of the
    Charter of the United Nations underlying a comprehensive, just and
    lasting peace in Ukraine” resolution which was adopted with the
    broad support of the international community at the Emergency
    Special Session of the UN General Assembly yesterday. We remain
    committed to diplomacy and welcome and support President Zelenskyy’s
    earnest efforts to promote a comprehensive, just and lasting peace
    in line with the UN Charter by outlining basic principles in his
    Peace Formula. With a view to a viable post-war peace settlement, we
    remain ready to reach arrangements together with Ukraine as well as
    interested countries and institutions on sustained security and
    other commitments to help Ukraine defend itself, secure its free and
    democratic future, and deter future Russian aggression.
-   We remain committed to coordinating efforts to meet Ukraine’s
    pressing military and defence equipment needs, with an immediate
    focus on air defence systems and capabilities, as well as necessary
    munitions and tanks.
-   Building on the results achieved during the international conference
    held in Paris on 13 December, we also reaffirm our commitment to
    provide additional humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people,
    assistance to support Ukraine’s energy sector, and other assistance
    in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, including to ensure access to
    healthcare including mental health. We welcome the establishment of
    the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform to help advance
    Ukraine’s reform agenda, promote private sector led sustainable
    growth, and ensure close coordination among international donors to
    deliver assistance in a coherent, transparent and accountable
    manner.
-   We will continue to help maintain Ukraine’s economic and financial
    stability, including addressing urgent short-term economic needs. In
    this context, we welcome the progress made by our Finance Ministers
    to increase our budget and economic support to 39 billion US dollars
    for 2023 and look forward to additional commitments. We ask Finance
    Ministers to continue engagement with the International Monetary
    Fund (IMF) and Ukraine to deliver an ambitious program by the end of
    March 2023 and to continue working together, with the IMF and others
    for necessary budget support to Ukraine throughout and beyond 2023.
-   We support Ukraine’s reconstruction efforts, including the recovery
    of infrastructure destroyed by Russia’s aggression. It is essential
    that this process continues to involve a wide range of actors,
    including Ukrainian subnational entities and civil society,
    international financial institutions and organizations, and the
    private sector. The Ukraine Recovery Conference to be held in London
    in June this year will offer a venue for Ukraine, international
    partners, private sector and civil society to further promote
    momentum behind Ukraine’s recovery. At the same time, we will
    continue to support the determination of Ukraine to build a society
    free from corruption. We support the Ukrainian government’s efforts
    to advance necessary institution-building in line with Ukraine’s
    European path, including in the judicial sector and promotion of the
    rule of law by empowering the independent Ukrainian anti-corruption
    institutions. In this regard, we reiterate our full confidence in
    the role of the G7 Ambassadors Group in supporting the
    implementation of the reform agenda.
-   We reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the unprecedented and
    coordinated sanctions and other economic measures the G7 and partner
    countries have taken to date to further counter Russia’s capacity to
    wage its illegal aggression. We remain committed to presenting a
    united front through the imposition of new coordinated economic
    actions against Russia in the days and weeks ahead. Specifically, we
    are taking the following new measures, consistent with our
    respective legal authorities and processes and international law:  
      
    (i) We will maintain, fully implement and expand the economic
    measures we have already imposed, including by preventing and
    responding to evasion and circumvention through the establishment of
    an Enforcement Coordination Mechanism to bolster compliance and
    enforcement of our measures and deny Russia the benefits of G7
    economies. We call on third-countries or other international actors
    who seek to evade or undermine our measures to cease providing
    material support to Russia’s war, or face severe costs. To deter
    this activity around the world, we are taking actions against
    third-country actors materially supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine.
    We also commit to further aligning measures, such as transit or
    services bans, including to prevent Russian circumvention.  
      
    (ii) We are committed to preventing Russia from finding new ways to
    acquire advanced materials, technology, and military and industrial
    equipment from our jurisdictions that it can use to develop its
    industrial sectors and further its violations of international law.
    To this end, we will adopt further measures to prevent Russia from
    accessing inputs that support its military and manufacturing
    sectors, including, among others, industrial machinery, tools,
    construction equipment, and other technology Russia is exploiting to
    rebuild its war machine.  
      
    (iii) We will continue to reduce Russia’s revenue to finance its
    illegal aggression by taking appropriate steps to limit Russia’s
    energy revenue and future extractive capabilities, building on the
    measures we have taken so far, including export bans and the price
    cap for seaborne Russian-origin crude oil and refined oil products.
    We commit to taking action in a way that mitigates spillover effects
    for energy security, in particular for the most vulnerable and
    affected countries.  
      
    (iv) Given the significant revenues that Russia extracts from the
    export of diamonds, we will work collectively on further measures on
    Russian diamonds, including rough and polished ones, working closely
    to engage key partners.  
      
    (v) We are taking additional measures in relation to Russia’s
    financial sector to further undermine Russia’s capacity to wage its
    illegal aggression. While coordinating to preserve financial
    channels for essential transactions, we will target additional
    Russian financial institutions to prevent circumvention of our
    measures.  
      
    (vi) We continue to impose targeted sanctions, including on those
    responsible for war crimes or human rights violations and abuses,
    exercising illegitimate authority in Ukraine, or who otherwise are
    profiting from the war.
-   We will continue our efforts to ensure Russia pays for Ukraine’s
    long-term reconstruction. Russia bears full responsibility for the
    war and the damage it has caused, including to Ukraine’s critical
    infrastructure. We collectively reaffirm the need for an
    international mechanism to register the damages Russia has
    inflicted. We are determined, consistent with our respective legal
    systems, that Russia’s sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will
    remain immobilized until there is a resolution to the conflict that
    addresses Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and integrity.
    Any resolution to the conflict must ensure Russia pays for the
    damage it has caused. We will work with partners beyond the G7 which
    hold those Russian sovereign assets to build the broadest coalition
    possible to advance these objectives.
-   We are united in our determination to hold President Putin and those
    responsible to account, consistent with international law. We
    support investigations by the Prosecutor of the International
    Criminal Court, the Prosecutor-General of Ukraine, and other
    national prosecutors who are able to establish jurisdiction under
    national law. In this regard, we support exploring efforts to
    develop an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of
    aggression against Ukraine (ICPA) which is linked to the existing
    Joint Investigation Team supported by Eurojust.
-   We deplore that many countries in the world have been severely
    affected by the repercussions of Russia’s war of aggression.
    Russia’s weaponisation of food has caused global economic hardship
    and a rise in global food prices, increasing the cost of living of
    people, compounding the economic vulnerabilities of developing
    countries, and exacerbating already dire humanitarian crises and
    food insecurity around the world. We reiterate the G7’s united will
    to continue to provide rapid assistance, including food-related aid,
    to countries in need and affected populations and we will continue
    to design our restrictive measures to shield such populations from
    unintended consequences by ensuring food and fertilisers are carved
    out. We will continue to support food security and the availability
    and sustainable use of fertilisers to vulnerable countries in need
    of assistance and welcome the related work undertaken by the UN
    World Food Programme (WFP) and other relevant agencies. We recognize
    the importance of the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes, President
    Zelenskyy’s Grain from Ukraine Initiative and the UN and Türkiye-
    brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI). In this context, we
    stress the importance of the automatic extension of the BSGI by 18
    March and its expansion.
-   We also express our profound sympathy for all those affected by the
    horrifying earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. We stand in solidarity
    with the people of Türkiye and Syria and pledge our continued
    support to tackling the consequences of this catastrophe. It is
    vital that humanitarian aid reaches all those who require it as
    efficiently as possible. We welcome the expansion of cross- border
    aid for an initial period of three months, and underscore that the
    humanitarian needs of those in northwest Syria should continue to be
    met. We also welcome the EU initiative to host a donor conference in
    support of the people in Türkiye and Syria in March.
-   Above all, our solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine,
    in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the
    international order based on the rule of law.
