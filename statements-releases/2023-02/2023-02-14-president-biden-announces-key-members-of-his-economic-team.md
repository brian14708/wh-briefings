***Statement from President Biden:***  
  
“Cecilia Rouse and Brian Deese are trusted advisors that I have relied
on to help craft my economic agenda, and our country owes them a debt of
gratitude for their service. As they transition out of the White House,
I am pleased to announce new leaders who will continue to deliver on my
economic vision and help finish the job.  
  
Lael, one of the country’s leading macroeconomists, brings an
extraordinary depth of domestic and international economic expertise,
having previously served at CEA, NEC, the Treasury Department and the
Federal Reserve. She is a trusted veteran across our economic
institutions, and understands how the economy affects everyday people.  
  
Jared is a brilliant thinker and one of my closest and longest-serving
economic advisers. He is an expert on worker empowerment and a
worker-centric economic policy, which has long been the heart of my
economic vision. A former social worker, Jared was in the foxhole with
me while I was Vice President, and he understands that a job is about
far more than a paycheck, it’s about the dignity of work.    
  
Along with Bharat, Heather, Joelle and other key members of my White
House economic team, Lael and Jared will help bring a seriousness of
purpose to the task of building a strong, inclusive, and more resilient
economy for the future. Over the past two years, my economic strategy
has delivered historic results for the American people. This team will
be committed to implementing that strategy, while managing the
transition of our historic economic recovery to steady and stable
growth. They will work tirelessly to ensure every American enjoys a fair
return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead, and that our
businesses can thrive and outcompete the rest of the world. Let’s finish
the job.”
