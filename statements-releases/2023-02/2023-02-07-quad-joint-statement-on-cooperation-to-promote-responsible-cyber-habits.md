title: "Quad Joint Statement on Cooperation to Promote Responsible Cyber\_Habits"
---
 
We the Quad partners of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States
are launching a public campaign to improve cyber security across our
nations: the *Quad Cyber Challenge*. We are inviting Internet-users
across the Indo-Pacific and beyond to join the
[Challenge](https://www.cyberchallenge.tech/) and pledge to practice
safe and responsible cyber habits. The Challenge reflects our continuing
Quad efforts to strengthen individuals’ and communities’ cyber security
awareness and action, as well as to foster a more secure and resilient
cyber ecosystem to benefit economies and users everywhere.  
   
Internet-users worldwide are targets of cybercrime and other malicious
cyber threats that can cost trillions of dollars each year and
compromise sensitive, personal data. Many cyber attacks can be guarded
against by simple preventive measures. Together, Internet users and
providers can take small steps to significantly improve cybersecurity
and cyber safety. These steps include routinely installing security
updates, enabling enhanced identity checks through multi-factor
authentication, utilizing stronger and regularly changing passphrases,
and knowing how to identify common online scams, like phishing.  
   
The Challenge provides resources, such as basic cybersecurity
information and training, for all users – from corporations to education
institutions, small businesses, and individuals from grade school
students to the elderly, and will culminate in events during the week of
April 10th. The Quad partners are working to ensure everyone has access
to the resources needed to make informed decisions while online and
using smart devices. Learn what you and your organization can do to
foster a more safe, secure, and resilient cyberspace so that we can
collectively be better protected from cyber threats.
