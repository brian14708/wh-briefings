---
 
**WASHINGTON, D.C.** –  First Lady Jill Biden will welcome guests to
join her in the viewing box for President Biden’s State of the Union
Address on Tuesday, February 7, 2023. Each of these individuals were
invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be
addressed by the President in his speech, or they embody the
Biden-Harris Administration’s policies at work for the American people.
The Second Gentleman, Mr. Douglas Emhoff, will also join the First Lady
in the viewing box.     
   
In recognition of sustained U.S. support for Ukraine nearly a year after
Russia launched its unprovoked attack, the First Lady has again invited
the **Ambassador of Ukraine, Oksana Markarova**, to join her as a guest
for the State of the Union.   
   
The following individuals, listed in alphabetical order, will be seated
in the box with the First Lady and Second Gentleman:   
   
**Maurice and Kandice Barron (New York, New York)**  
The Barrons’ three-year old daughter, Ava, is a survivor of a rare form
of pediatric cancer. Mr. Barron penned a letter to the President to
express gratitude for the Bidens’ commitment to the Cancer Moonshot
initiative and share their experience as parents and caregivers of a
child with cancer. In 2022, Ava’s doctors gave the Barrons good news by
officially declaring her in remission. Their family’s story is one of
hope and possibility, inspiring us to continue working towards a future
where we end cancer as we know it.  
   
**Lynette Bonar (Tuba City, Arizona)**  
Bonar is an enrolled member of Navajo Nation. She was a sergeant and
former medic in the U.S. Army. She spent 19 years providing clinical
care as a Registered Nurse and Executive at the Tuba City Regional
Health Care Corporation, including eight years as Chief Executive
Officer. In 2019, Dr. Biden joined Bonar to celebrate the opening of the
Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation’s Specialty Care Center which
was the first cancer center opened on a Native American reservation,
bringing cancer treatment and other oncology services to the Navajo,
Hopi, and San Juan Southern Paiute tribal members who previously had to
travel great distances to receive care.   
   
**Bono (Dublin, Ireland)**  
The lead singer of U2, Bono is a groundbreaking activist in the fight
against HIV/AIDS and extreme poverty.  Working in concert with other
activists, he played a pivotal role building public and bipartisan
political support for the creation of PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief), a program announced by President Bush in his State of
the Union twenty years ago, and championed by then-Senator Biden. 
PEPFAR is credited with revolutionizing the provision of life-saving HIV
medications in poorer countries and saving 25 million lives worldwide.
Bono is the cofounder of the nonpartisan ONE Campaign, which works with
governments to fight poverty and preventable disease, and (RED), which
has raised more than $700 million from businesses to fight HIV/AIDS in
Africa.  
   
**Deanna Branch (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)**  
Branch shared her family’s experiences with lead exposure with Vice
President Harris in Milwaukee in 2022 and at the White House in 2023.
Branch is working to build a lead safe environment for her community
after her son Aidan battled lead poisoning as a result of unsafe levels
of lead in their drinking water and home. She and her two sons had to
move out of the house that they loved because it was no longer a safe
environment to raise a family. Through historic levels of funding from
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan, and using
additional tools across federal, state, and local governments, the
Biden-Harris Administration is working to replace all lead service lines
in America in the next decade.   
   
**Kristin Christensen and Avarie Kollmar (Seattle, Washington)**  
Christensen is a mother of three and a caregiver to her husband who was
medically retired from the Navy due to combat-related injuries. In 2021,
she was appointed as a Fellow with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation where
she and her daughter, Avarie, advocate for military and veteran children
in caregiving homes, known as “Hidden Helpers.” Christensen and Avarie
share their stories to help others to identify as caregivers, seek out
support, and know they are not alone. Christensen also works with local
and state officials to support caregivers through the Dole Foundation’s
Hidden Heroes Cities and Counties Program. In 2022, Christensen and
Kollmar shared their experiences with the First Lady during a *Joining
Forces* event in support of Hidden Helpers.  *Joining Forces* is the
First Lady’s White House initiative to support military and veteran
families, survivors, and caregivers.   
   
**Ruth Cohen (Rockville, Maryland)**  
Cohen is a survivor of the Holocaust and a volunteer at the United
States Holocaust Memorial Museum. During the Nazi regime, Cohen and her
family were forced from their home, and Cohen was later sent to
Auschwitz-Birkenau. Cohen was liberated in 1945 and immigrated to the
United States three years later. In 2022, Vice President Harris and
Second Gentleman Emhoff met Cohen prior to International Holocaust
Remembrance Day to raise awareness about the history and dangers of
antisemitism. Cohen is a special guest of Second Gentleman Douglas
Emhoff.   
                                                                                             
**Mitzi Colin Lopez (West Chester, Pennsylvania)**  
At just three years old, Colin Lopez’s parents brought her to the United
States from Mexico.  She grew up only knowing the United States as her
home. As a DREAMer, she applied for and received Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2015, and has since graduated Summa Cum
Laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from West Chester
University of Pennsylvania. She is an advocate for comprehensive
immigration reform and in 2021, Colin Lopez met the President to share
her experiences as a DACA recipient.   
   
**Maurice “Dion” Dykes (Knoxville, Tennessee)**  
Dykes is currently training to fulfill his dream of becoming a teacher
through a teacher Registered Apprenticeship program, one of the pathways
supported by Tennessee’s Grow Your Own strategic efforts. Approved by
the U.S. Department of Labor in 2022 with support from the American
Rescue Plan, Tennessee’s teacher Registered Apprenticeship programs have
helped the state establish no-cost pathways to the teaching profession.
Dykes spent the first 25 years of his career working in graphic design.
In 2022, the First Lady met Dykes during a visit to Sarah Moore Greene
Magnet Academy to highlight ways states and school districts are
recruiting and preparing qualified educators for the classroom.  
   
**Kate Foley (Arlington Heights, Illinois) **  
Foley is a 10<sup>th</sup> grade computer-integrated manufacturing
student at Rolling Meadows High School in Illinois High School District
214, a public high school that prepares students for future careers
through partnerships with the local community college, work-based
learning opportunities with employers, and career advising programs.
Foley hopes to pursue a career as a biomedical engineer using the
knowledge learned through her engineering classes started as a high
school student. In 2022, the First Lady met Foley during a visit to
Rolling Meadows High School to highlight the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to strengthening our economy and building
pathways from high school to good-paying jobs, through career-connected
learning.    
   
**Darlene Gaffney (North Charleston, South Carolina)**  
Gaffney was diagnosed with Stage 2 Breast Cancer in March 2015. A cancer
survivor, she joined Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church’s Cancer
Support Ministry because she wanted to use her own experience to educate
others in her church and community about the importance of early
detection and getting recommended cancer screenings.  In 2021, the First
Lady met with Gaffney at Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC)
Hollings Cancer Center during a visit to promote breast cancer
awareness. In February 2022, the President and First Lady reignited the
Cancer Moonshot initiative, setting ambitious goals to end cancer as we
know it.   
   
**Doug Griffin (Newton, New Hampshire)**  
Griffin lost his 20-year-old daughter, Courtney, in 2014 to a fentanyl
overdose. Now, Griffin is turning his loss into action by supporting
other families like his affected by addiction, raising awareness about
the stigma associated with addiction, and calling for better access to
substance use disorder treatment services. In 2021, Griffin penned a
letter to the President and First Lady to share his family’s painful
journey. Addressing stigma associated with addiction, raising awareness
about the dangers of fentanyl, going after drug traffickers’ profits
fueling the production of synthetic opioids, and dramatically expanding
access treatment for substance use disorders are key focuses of
President Biden’s National Drug Control Strategy – a whole-of-government
approach to beat the overdose epidemic.  
   
**Saria Gwin-Maye (Cincinnati, Ohio)**  
Gwin-Maye is as an ironworker and member of Ironworkers Local 44 in
Cincinnati, Ohio. In 2023, she introduced the President at the Brent
Spence Bridge in Covington, Kentucky, which is receiving a major
investment thanks to the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Ironworkers like Gwin-Maye, and other union workers will get the
opportunity to do work repairing Brent Spence Bridge and on other
significant projects nationwide as a result of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law.  
   
**Jacki Liszak (Fort Myers, Florida)**  
Liszak is the President and CEO of the Fort Myers Beach Chamber of
Commerce and is an elected Fire Commissioner for the Fort Myers Beach
Fire Control District. She and her husband also own and operate small
businesses in the area. In 2022, the President and First Lady met Liszak
when they surveyed the storm damage from Hurricane Ian. The President’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act are lowering
energy costs and making communities like Fort Myers more resilient to
extreme weather events through record funding to strengthen and
weatherize our nation’s power grid, roads, bridges, homes, public water
systems and more.  
   
**Harry Miller (Upper-Arlington, Ohio)**  
Miller is a senior in mechanical engineering and a former football
player for The Ohio State University. In 2022, he announced he would no
longer continue to be a student-athlete to prioritize his mental health
and has since become an advocate for mental health and emotional
wellness.  President Biden has named tackling the mental health crisis a
key pillar of his Unity Agenda, laying out a strategy to
transform how mental health is understood, perceived, accessed, treated,
and integrated – in and out of health care settings. Since taking
office, the Biden-Harris Administration has significantly increased
federal government investments in mental health support for Americans
across the country.   
   
**Gina and Heidi Nortonsmith (Northampton, Massachusetts)**  
The Nortonsmiths’ advocacy work as plaintiffs in *Goodridge vs. MA Dept.
of Public Health* led to their state becoming the first in the nation to
legalize same-sex marriage. They celebrated this victory by getting
married on the first day that same-sex marriage licenses were issued in
Massachusetts in 2004. In 2022, the Nortonsmiths introduced the
President at the Respect for Marriage Act celebration on the South Lawn
of the White House.  
   
**Paul Pelosi (San Francisco, California)**  
Pelosi is a businessman, father, and husband of Speaker Emerita of the
House Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Pelosi was violently attacked by an intruder in
their California home in the fall of 2022. The attack reportedly was
politically motivated, with the intruder’s alleged intent to harm and
kidnap the former Speaker. According to court filings, the intruder
confronted Mr. Pelosi, asking “Where’s Nancy?,” a similar chant of those
responsible for the January 6th Capitol insurrection.  
   
**Paul Sarzoza (Phoenix, Arizona)**  
Sarzoza is a small business owner, serving as the President and CEO of
Verde, a cleaning and facilities services company. His biggest customer
is TSMC, a semiconductor manufacturing company, which is expanding
because of the President’s CHIPS and Science Act.  To keep up with the
increased demand for his company’s services, Sarzoza plans to hire
150-200 employees in the next year. The growth of Sarzoza’s business
demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administration’s economic plan at
work.    
   
**Brandon Tsay (San Marino, California)**  
Tsay demonstrated remarkable courage when he disarmed the shooter
responsible for the mass shooting at the Monterey Park Lunar New
Year celebrations, ensuring his violent rage would not take more lives
at the nearby Lai Lai Ballroom & Studio, which is owned by the Tsay
family. Tsay is credited with preventing the gunman, who had killed 11
people and injured 10 others, from carrying out a second attack in
Alhambra.    
   
**RowVaughn and Rodney Wells (Memphis, Tennessee)**  
RowVaughn and Rodney Wells are the mother and stepfather of Tyre
Nichols, a 29-year old unarmed Black man who was severely beaten by
multiple police officers during an alleged traffic stop in Memphis,
Tennessee. Nichols was hospitalized afterwards and died three days later
as a result of his injuries. President Biden has made clear that we must
take action to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again. In
addition to signing an executive order last year, the President
continues to call on Congress to send the George Floyd Justice in
Policing Act to his desk.  
   
**Amanda and Josh Zurawski (Austin, Texas)**  
Amanda was 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke. She and her husband
Josh were devastated, as they had been trying for a baby for over a
year.  Her doctors were unable to intervene to help her because they
were concerned that providing the treatment she needed would violate the
Texas abortion ban, which prohibits abortion care unless a woman’s life
is in danger.  She was sent home with instructions to come back if she
developed signs of a life-threatening infection, which she did, three
days later. Zurawski developed sepsis and nearly died because of the
delay in receiving treatment. She continues to suffer from medical
complications due to the delay.
