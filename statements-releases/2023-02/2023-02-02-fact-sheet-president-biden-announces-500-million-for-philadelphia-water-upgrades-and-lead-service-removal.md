*President and Vice President Highlight National Progress Replacing Lead
Pipes & Delivering Clean Water Thanks to Bipartisan Infrastructure Law*

Continuing the Biden-Harris Administration’s focus on implementing its
economic agenda to deliver real results for the American people,
President Biden and Vice President Harris are traveling to Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, to highlight progress made improving water infrastructure
and replacing lead pipes. Through historic levels of funding from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, American Rescue Plan, and annual
appropriations, and using regulatory tools across federal, state, and
local government, the Administration is working to replace all lead
service lines in America in the next decade. The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law invests nearly $50 billion in clean water, with at
least $15 billion set aside at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
for loans and grants to states to remove lead service lines.

At the event in Philadelphia, the President will announce:

-   The City of Philadelphia is slated to receive $160 million from the
    Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s first of five years of Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law water funding to help upgrade water facilities
    and replace over 19 miles of lead service lines. To date, $240
    million has been awarded to Pennsylvania to provide clean and safe
    water across the state and improve water and wastewater
    infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law;
-   A $340 million Water Infrastructure and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan
    from EPA for the City of Philadelphia to upgrade its water system,
    including the first $19 million in financing that will help
    modernize critical infrastructure by replacing approximately 160
    lead service lines and 13 miles of watermains; and,
-   10 communities across Pennsylvania will participate in EPA’s new
    “[Lead Service Line Replacement
    Accelerators](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-new-initiative-accelerate-lead-pipe-replacement-protect-underserved-0)”
    program announced last Friday at the White House, which will  drive
    faster progress on removing lead service lines. Through the LSLR
    Accelerators initiative, EPA will provide hands-on support to guide
    communities through the process of lead service line removals, from
    start to finish, including developing lead service line replacement
    plans, conducting inventories to identify lead pipes, increasing
    community outreach and education efforts, and supporting
    applications for Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding.

The massive investments in water improvements will also create new good
paying jobs, including jobs that do not require a college degree.

**<u>Progress Removing Lead Service Lines</u>**

Since taking office, the Administration has moved aggressively to
accelerate the replacement of lead service lines across the country,
funding the removal of over 100,000 lead service lines.  That number
will increase significantly with $1.2 billion now approved for 23 states
for lead service line identification and replacement as a result of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The 2022 allocation was the first of five
years of nearly $15 billion in dedicated EPA funding for lead service
lines that states will receive through the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law. Because of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, there is dedicated
funding to remove lead service lines and new prioritization for
disadvantaged communities to benefit from this investment.  
  
Last week, at a White House Summit on Accelerating Lead Pipe Replacement
hosted by Vice President Harris, the Biden-Harris Administration
announced new actions and progress to deliver clean drinking water,
replace lead pipes, and remediate lead paint to protect children and
communities across America.  In addition to EPA’s Accelerators, the Vice
President announced a new Get the Lead Out Partnership comprised of over
100 state and local officials, water utilities, labor unions, and other
nongovernmental organizations who have committed to advance and
accelerate lead pipe replacement, including the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The Vice President also sent a letter to Governors across
the country calling on them to join the new partnership, deploy the
federal funding available in their state, and ensure investments reach
overburdened and underserved communities.

Other recent Administration actions to address lead include:

-   EPA released guidance that will help communities and water utilities
    identify lead pipes that connect drinking water service to homes and
    other buildings by developing and maintaining service line
    inventories, support notifications to consumers served by lead
    pipes, and provide states with information on oversight and
    reporting to EPA.
-   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated the
    Blood Lead Reference Value (BLRV) to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter of
    blood based on the most recent National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey data, resulting over the past year, 21 states
    have changed their laws or policies to provide case management or
    other services to children with blood lead levels higher than the
    updated BLRV of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter. As a result of this
    action, more children are receiving early intervention to prevent
    additional lead exposure and its associated harms.
-   EPA has taken several steps in the process of proposing the Lead and
    Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI).
-   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is in the
    process of implementing its Lead Safe Housing Rule that eliminates
    or mitigates lead-based paint hazards through its housing
    rehabilitation assistance.

**<u>Infrastructure Progress Across Pennsylvania</u>**
