In the aftermath of the earthquakes on February 6, President Joseph R.
Biden, Jr. authorized an immediate U.S. response and directed the heads
of federal agencies to rapidly mobilize to assist the Government of
Türkiye and humanitarian partners in Syria.  
  
Across the U.S. government, officials expressed their condolences to the
people of Türkiye and Syria as well as their desire to support the
humanitarian response. In the hours following the earthquakes,
[President Biden called President

to convey the readiness of the U.S. government to provide any and all
needed assistance to our NATO Ally Türkiye. Secretary Tony Blinken,
Secretary Lloyd Austin, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
engaged their Turkish counterparts, and USAID Administrator Samantha
Power spoke with the head of the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the
White Helmets. First Lady Jill Biden sent a personal note of condolence
to First Lady Emine Erdogan, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
visited the Turkish Embassy to express condolences to the Turkish
Ambassador and sign the official condolences book. U.S. officials have
remained in regular coordination with their Turkish counterparts, with
UN agencies, and with partners in Syria on how we can best support their
efforts. Finally, the U.S. government affirmed to the Syrian mission to
the UN that our humanitarian assistance is available to all Syrians, no
matter where they live, and that we are ready to provide additional
support.  
  
**Life-saving efforts by the U.S. in the impacted region:**

-   Yesterday, the U.S. announced it will provide $85 million in
    life-saving assistance to provide shelter to the displaced, as well
    as food, medicine and other desperately needed aid.
-   USAID deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the
    earthquake region, which includes experienced emergency managers,
    construction riggers, hazardous materials technicians, licensed
    engineers and emergency medicine physicians, logisticians,
    paramedics, planners, search-and-rescue specialists, and
    search-and-rescue dogs with handlers.
-   With transportation support from the Department of Defense, two
    USAID urban search and rescue teams, composed of 159 members and 12
    rescue dogs, quickly deployed from the U.S. to support Turkish
    search and rescue efforts.
-   To date, the U.S. has deployed approximately 170,000 pounds of
    specialized tools and equipment—including hydraulic concrete
    breaking equipment, saws, torches, and drills, along with advanced
    medical equipment to assist with search and rescue operations in
    Türkiye.
-   The Commander of U.S. European Command has directed the Commander of
    U.S. Naval Forces Europe to coordinate U.S. military assistance
    efforts.
-   U.S. Black Hawk helicopters are supporting airlift operations from
    Incirlik Airbase in Türkiye, transporting rescue personnel to sites
    that are most needed for rescue operations and difficult to access
    given the extent of the destruction. 
-   U.S.-funded humanitarian partners are providing assistance
    throughout all areas of Syria, including health services, shelter
    support, food assistance, and access to water, sanitation, and
    hygiene. Those partners include the White Helmets, who have pulled
    more than 1,000 survivors from the rubble and U.S.-supported Syrian
    medics who have been treating survivors across Idlib, Aleppo, and
    other affected areas.
-   U.S. officials have worked with Turkish authorities to ensure
    operations can resume at Bab al-Hawa crossing, a critical lifeline
    for UN-provided cross-border assistance into northwestern Syria.
-   Yesterday, to underscore that U.S. sanctions will not prevent or
    inhibit providing humanitarian assistance in Syria, the Department
    of the Treasury issued a broad General License to provide additional
    authorizations for disaster relief assistance to the Syrian people.
    This license will be in effect for six months. U.S. humanitarian
    assistance is delivered directly to the Syrian people, no matter
    where they live.

**Support available to U.S. Citizens in Türkiye:**

-   U.S. Consular Affairs staff in Türkiye and the United States are
    working tirelessly to provide consular assistance to American
    victims their families, and any U.S. citizens in the affected areas.
-   Individuals in need of immediate, local emergency assistance in
    Türkiye should call Turkish authorities using the phone number 112. 
    U.S. citizens impacted by the earthquake should contact the U.S.
    Embassy Ankara. 
-   Information is available to U.S. citizens in the area through
    alerts, the U.S. embassy and consulate websites, and
    travel.state.gov.

The Biden-Harris Administration commends the outpouring of support from
around the world. USAID’s Center for International Disaster Information
(CIDI) has a
[list](https://www.cidi.org/disaster-responses/turkiye-earthquake/) of
vetted organizations responding to this crisis.
