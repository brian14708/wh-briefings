Today, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and White
House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, Stefanie Feldman, Deputy
Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the Domestic Policy
Advisor, and Rosie Hidalgo, Special Assistant to the President and
Senior Advisor on Gender-Based Violence, convened a meeting with state
legislative leaders on Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws.
Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws – also referred to as “red
flag” laws – allow family members, law enforcement, or other responsible
individuals to petition for a court order temporarily barring people in
crisis from accessing firearms if they present a danger to themselves or
others. This meeting follows a

White House leaders hosted on ERPO legislation in August 2022, as well
as a meeting with Attorneys General in 2021 on this issue.  
  
Last year, President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act – the most significant gun violence prevention
legislation in more than 30 years. The law includes $750 million for
states to implement crisis interventions such as ERPOs, fulfilling the
President’s repeated call for this funding. Last week, the Department of
Justice
[announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-over-200-million-investments-state-crisis-intervention)
an investment of over $231 million through 49 grant awards to states,
territories, and the District of Columbia to fund the creation and
implementation of ERPO programs,  state crisis intervention court
proceedings, and related gun violence reduction initiatives.  
  
While 19 states currently have ERPO laws in place, several other states
are considering ERPO legislation this session, including Michigan and
Minnesota. Many states across the country are also seeking to strengthen
and expand their existing ERPO laws, such as Colorado, Vermont, and
Florida.  
  
During the meeting, legislative leaders discussed the critical
importance of ERPO legislation to improve the safety of their
communities, as well as best practices for implementation of these laws.
Senior White House officials thanked the legislators for their
leadership and reaffirmed the Administration’s partnership in supporting
the passage and implementation of ERPO laws.   
  
State legislative leaders attending today’s meeting included:

-   Colorado State Representative Mike Weissman
-   Florida State Senator Lori Berman
-   Illinois State Representative Maura Hirschauer
-   Michigan State Representative Kelly Breen
-   Michigan State Representative Ranjeev Puri
-   Michigan State Senator Rosemary Bayer
