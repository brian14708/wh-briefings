The United States is profoundly concerned by the reports of today’s
destructive earthquake in Turkiye and Syria. We stand ready to provide
any and all needed assistance. President Biden has directed USAID and
other federal government partners to assess U.S. response options to
help those most affected. We will continue to closely monitor the
situation in coordination with the Government of Turkiye.
