Today, Vice President Kamala Harris joined a meeting with National
Security Advisor to the Vice President Dr. Phil Gordon, Chief Economic
Advisor to the Vice President Michael Pyle, and business leaders who
have invested in northern Central America under the Vice President’s
Call to Action.  Launched in May 2021, the Vice President’s initiative
has mobilized over $1.2 billion in private sector investment for
northern Central America and is a key pillar of the U.S. government’s
comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of migration from the
region.  Vice President Harris expressed her gratitude to the group for
their leadership and for the success of the public-private partnership.
She highlighted U.S. government efforts to support their investments in
the region and address the drivers of migration, including by combatting
corruption and improving governance and security. The Vice President and
other attendees agreed to continue to work to deepen investments in the
region.
