title: "Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of\
  \ the Senate, on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to the\
  \ Stabilization of\_Iraq"
---
 
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of
Iraq declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003 — as modified in
scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order
13290 of March 20, 2003, Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003,
Executive Order 13350 of July 29, 2004, Executive Order 13364 of
November 29, 2004, Executive Order 13438 of July 17, 2007, and Executive
Order 13668 of May 27, 2014 — is to continue in effect beyond May 22,
2022.

Obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and
maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of
political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq continue to
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and
foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that
it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 13303 with respect to the stabilization of Iraq.

                               Sincerely, 

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
