President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of
Japan today, to advance cooperation on a range of bilateral, regional,
and global issues. The President commended Prime Minister Kishida’s
leadership in responding to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and his
determination to strengthen Japan’s defense capabilities, noting that a
strong U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in
Indo-Pacific region. The two leaders committed to work closely together
to address security challenges, including the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) nuclear and ballistic missile programs and
China’s increasingly coercive behavior that runs counter to
international law. They agreed to deepen cooperation in areas such as
emerging technologies, supply chain security, and clean energy.
