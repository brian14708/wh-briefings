President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Magdalena
Andersson of Sweden and President Sauli Niinistö of Finland and warmly
welcomed their applications for NATO membership, which will strengthen
our collective security.  At this historic moment for both Finland and
Sweden, the President underscored his commitment to support both
countries as they seek formal NATO accession, including by working with
NATO Allies and Congress to welcome them into the Alliance as quickly as
possible.  The leaders also discussed their ongoing cooperation on
shared global challenges, and their commitment to continued strong
support for Ukraine.
