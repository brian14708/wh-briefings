title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Releases Permitting Action Plan\
  \ to Accelerate and Deliver Infrastructure Projects On Time, On Task, and On\_Budget"
---
 
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making a once-in-a-generation
investment in America’s infrastructure and competitiveness that will
create good-paying union jobs, grow our economy, invest in communities,
combat climate change, and help lower costs for families.  
  
To make the most of these historic investments and ensure infrastructure
projects are delivered on time and on budget, the Biden-Harris
Administration is releasing a new [Permitting Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Biden-Harris-Permitting-Action-Plan.pdf)
to strengthen and accelerate Federal permitting and environmental
reviews by fully leveraging existing permitting authorities, as well as
new provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  
  
The Action Plan outlines the Administration’s strategy for ensuring that
Federal environmental reviews and permitting processes are effective,
efficient, and transparent, guided by the best available science to
promote positive environmental and community outcomes, and shaped by
early and meaningful public engagement. Taken together, these new steps
will help strengthen supply chains, lower costs for families, grow our
clean energy economy, revitalize communities across the country, support
good-paying jobs, and deliver infrastructure investments on task, on
time, and on budget without unnecessary bureaucratic delay.   
  
Long overdue improvements to our nation’s ports, airports, rail, and
roads will help ease inflationary pressures, create conditions for
businesses to thrive, and strengthen supply chains – which will
ultimately lower costs for families. Building new clean energy
generation and transmission projects will improve access to affordable
clean energy that powers homes and businesses at lower costs.
Responsible and sustainable domestic sourcing of critical minerals and
materials will power our clean energy economy and reduce reliance on
unreliable foreign supply chains. And delivering clean residential water
supplies, high-speed internet, healthy forests and open space to all
Americans, especially those historically underserved, is critical to
make us stronger.  
  
The Action Plan is the latest example of the Administration taking
action to swiftly deliver the benefits of infrastructure investment to
the American people through well-designed projects that support the
President’s ambitious climate and clean energy goals. Putting the Action
Plan into place will result in better permitting outcomes, enhanced
predictability for project sponsors, and increased accountability across
Federal agencies to execute efficiently and effectively.  
  
The Permitting Action Plan is built on five key elements that will help
ensure the timely and effective delivery of crucial upgrades to
America’s infrastructure.  
  
***Accelerating Smart Permitting through Early Cross-Agency
Coordination***

Ensuring early coordination and effective communication across Federal
agencies is critical for moving infrastructure projects forward
efficiently and on-time. Under the Permitting Action Plan, the
Administration will:

-   Leverage the interagency Federal Permitting Improvement Steering
    Council’s expanded authorities under the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law to improve coordination among agencies, help avoid and resolve
    potential conflicts and bottlenecks, identify and share best
    practices, and accelerate information sharing and troubleshooting;  
-   Convene sector-specific teams of experts to facilitate interagency
    coordination on siting, permitting, supply chain, and related
    issues, and promote efficient and timely reviews;  
-   Leverage the Department of Transportation’s Interagency
    Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center to help facilitate
    environmental review and permitting for Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law-funded transportation projects by developing guidance, sharing
    best practices, coordinating reviews, tracking project milestones
    and outcomes, and exploring innovative approaches;  
-   Develop and prepare new approaches to permitting and environmental
    review that help address common issues, eliminate duplication, and
    site and design projects in a way that reduces resource conflicts
    and incorporates a climate-smart approach; and  
-   Work to reform outdated permitting laws and regulations, such as the
    Mining Law of 1872, to establish stronger environmental,
    sustainability, safety, Tribal consultation, and community
    engagement standards. 

***Establishing Clear Timeline Goals and Tracking Key Project
Information***  
  
Communities and project proponents all benefit from having clear
information about the schedules, key milestones and deadlines, and
public comment opportunities for the environmental review and permitting
of major projects. Timeline goals and up-to-date information increase
accountability, encourage efficiency, enable greater public
participation in project decisions, and build greater trust in
government. Under the Permitting Action Plan, agencies will:

-   Create permitting schedules with clear timeline goals that are both
    ambitious and realistic, contain relevant milestones, and meet all
    requirements in applicable law to complete environmental review and
    permitting in a sound and timely manner;  
-   Increase transparency and accountability by tracking key project
    information, including timetables and milestones, on the [Federal
    Permitting Dashboard](https://www.permits.performance.gov/); and  
-   Identify the lead Federal agency that will be responsible for
    working with other agencies in the permitting processes to develop
    and implement coordination plans, interagency agreements, or other
    tools designed to ensure sustained and effective coordination and
    accountability.

***Engaging in Early and Meaningful Outreach with States, Tribal
Nations, Territories, and Local Communities***  
  
Proactive, early, and ongoing engagement with the public, including
disadvantaged, underserved, or overburdened communities, and State,
Tribal, local, and territorial partners is fundamental to delivering
timely projects that serve the needs and priorities of communities
across the country. As part of a robust engagement strategy, which will
help inform agencies’ decision-making, agencies will:

-   Consult with affected Tribal Nations as early as possible, in a
    sustained manner, and in a fashion that respects the
    Nation-to-Nation relationship;  
-   Proactively partner and coordinate with relevant State, territorial,
    and local governments as early as possible and in a sustained
    manner; and  
-   Review and update policies, procedures, and staffing to ensure that
    the public, including disadvantaged communities, has a meaningful
    opportunity to participate in decision-making.

***Improving Agency Responsiveness, Technical Assistance, and
Support***  
  
Providing responsive technical assistance and support helps project
sponsors, permit applicants, affected communities, Tribal communities,
and other stakeholders navigate the environmental review and permitting
process effectively and efficiently. To address this need, agencies
will:

-   Identify, share, or develop resources, trainings, and tools to help
    stakeholders navigate the environmental review and permitting
    process effectively and efficiently; and  
-   Review environmental review and permitting information collection
    requirements to help consolidate or simplify reporting requirements,
    and identify ways that information can be collected more
    efficiently.

***Using Agency Resources and Environmental Reviews to Improve
Impact***  
  
Timely, informative environmental reviews that are guided by the best
available science and help deliver positive environmental and community
impact require sufficient levels of skilled agency staff and effective
use of budgetary resources. Agencies should therefore:

-   Prioritize available resources to address workforce needs and
    implementation of the initiatives in this Action Plan;  
     
-   Use best practices for accelerated hiring and coordinating with
    other agencies to efficiently use existing resources, such as
    conducting collaborative field studies and funding liaison
    positions; and  
-   Use technology, data, and tools to efficiently and holistically
    assess environmental and community effects, including information on
    climate change effects, and identify ways to use new technology to
    collect, analyze, share, and publicly communicate relevant
    information.
