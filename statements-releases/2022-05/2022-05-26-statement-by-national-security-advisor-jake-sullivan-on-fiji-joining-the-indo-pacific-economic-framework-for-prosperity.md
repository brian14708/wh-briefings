title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Fiji Joining the Indo-Pacific\
  \ Economic Framework for\_Prosperity"
---
 
President Biden welcomes Fiji’s decision to join the Indo-Pacific
Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) as a founding member, the
14<sup>th</sup> nation and first in the Pacific Islands to do so. IPEF
now reflects the full regional diversity of the Indo-Pacific, with
members from Northeast and Southeast Asia, South Asia, Oceania, and the
Pacific Islands. Across geography, we are united in our commitment to a
free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. A close partner to the
United States and a leader in the region, Fiji will add vital value and
perspective to IPEF, including on our efforts to tackle the climate
crisis and build a clean economy that creates good paying jobs. The
future of the 21st century economy is going to be largely written in the
Indo-Pacific, and IPEF will help to drive sustainable growth for all our
economies. The United States thanks Prime Minister Bainimarama, and we
look forward to deepening our partnership for the benefit of our
countries, the Pacific Islands, and the Indo-Pacific.
