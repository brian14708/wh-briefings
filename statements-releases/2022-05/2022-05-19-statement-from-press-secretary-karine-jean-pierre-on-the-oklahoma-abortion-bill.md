title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Oklahoma Abortion\_\
  Bill"
---
 
The President believes that women have the fundamental right to make
their own reproductive health choices. *Roe* has been the law of the
land for almost 50 years, and basic fairness and the stability of our
law demand that it not be overturned.  Today’s action by the Oklahoma
legislature is the most extreme effort to undo these fundamental rights
we have seen to date.  In addition, it adopts Texas’ absurd plan to
allow private citizens to sue their neighbors for providing reproductive
health care and helping women to exercise their constitutional rights.

This is part of a growing effort by ultra MAGA officials across the
country to roll back the freedoms we should not take for granted in this
country.  They are starting with reproductive rights, but the American
people need to know that other fundamental rights, including the right
to contraception and marriage equality, are at risk.   

The President is committed to standing up for these constitutional
rights, and for protecting Americans’ fundamental freedoms.
