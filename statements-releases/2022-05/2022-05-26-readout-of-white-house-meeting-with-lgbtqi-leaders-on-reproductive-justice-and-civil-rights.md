Today, White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein and
White House Deputy Assistant to the President for Racial Justice and
Equity Chiraag Bains convened a meeting with national LGBTQI+ leaders on
protecting access to reproductive health care and protecting LGBTQI+
civil rights. Advocates discussed the importance of protecting access to
abortion for the LGBTQI+ community, and the need to protect critical and

Participants also highlighted the importance of the right to
reproductive decision-making and privacy, and the importance of
reproductive health care for LGBTQI+ people as they start families, and

reproductive health care and gender-affirming care.

Senior Administration officials highlighted the President’s unwavering
commitment to LGBTQI+ civil rights, reproductive rights, and
safeguarding LGBTQI+ couples and families.

Participants included representatives from:

-   Human Rights Campaign
-   National LGBTQ Task Force
