title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces Two Presidential Directives Advancing\
  \ Quantum\_Technologies"
---
 
Today, President Biden will sign two Presidential directives that will
advance national initiatives in quantum information science (QIS),
signaling the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to this critical
and emerging technology. Together, the two directives lay the groundwork
for continued American leadership in an enormously promising field of
science and technology, while mitigating the risks that quantum
computers pose to America’s national and economic security.

The United States has long been a global leader in the development of
new technologies, like QIS. QIS is a broad field of science and
engineering. Quantum computers, one of the many promising applications
of QIS, are not a replacement to traditional computers. Rather, they are
a fundamentally different kind of computer, with the ability to analyze
information in ways that traditional computers cannot. While QIS itself
is not new, recent breakthroughs in QIS have shown the potential to
drive innovations across the American economy, from energy to medicine,
through advancements in computation, networking and
sensing. Breakthroughs in QIS are poised to generate entirely new
industries, good-paying jobs, and economic opportunities for all
Americans.

President Biden will sign an Executive Order to foster these advances by
furthering the President’s commitment to promoting breakthroughs in
cutting-edge science and technology. It does so by enhancing the
[National Quantum Initiative](http://www.quantum.gov) Advisory
Committee, the Federal Government’s principal independent expert
advisory body for quantum information science and technology. The EO
places the advisory committee directly under the authority of the White
House, ensuring that the President, Congress, Federal departments and
agencies, and the general public receive the most current, accurate, and
relevant information on quantum information science and technology to
drive forward U.S. policymaking and advance our technological edge.

The President will also sign a National Security Memorandum outlining
the Administration’s plan to address the risks posed by quantum
computers to America’s cybersecurity. Research shows that at some point
in the not-too-distant future, when quantum computers reach a sufficient
size and level of sophistication, they will be capable of breaking much
of the cryptography that currently secures our digital communications on
the Internet. To address this risk, the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) will publish new quantum-resistant cryptographic
standards that can protect against these future attacks. However, the
process to transition America’s most vulnerable IT systems to these new
standards will take time, resources, and commitment. America must start
the lengthy process of updating our IT infrastructure today to protect
against this quantum computing threat tomorrow. NSM-X lays out a plan to
get us there. 

Specifically, the National Security Memorandum:

-   **Positions the United States to remain a global leader in
    technology development, and Quantum Information Science in
    particular.** The NSM directs Federal agencies to pursue a
    whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to harness the
    economic and scientific benefits of QIS for all Americans, as well
    as the security enhancements of new cryptographic systems. It sets
    forth a policy to promote quantum-relevant education programs and
    workforce development initiatives, emphasizes a coordinated approach
    to foundational scientific research, and encourages the
    strengthening of partnerships with industry, academic institutions,
    and allies and partners overseas.

<!-- -->

-   **Initiates collaboration between the Federal Government and the
    private sector.** It directs NIST to establish a “Migration to
    Post-Quantum Cryptography Project” at the National Cybersecurity
    Center of Excellence, as well as an open working group with industry
    to generate research on, and encourage widespread, equitable
    adoption of, quantum-resilient cryptographic standards and
    technologies.

<!-- -->

-   **Sets requirements for Federal agencies to update cryptographic
    systems.** Given the complexity, costs, and time required to fully
    transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic standards, the NSM
    provides a roadmap for agencies to inventory their IT systems, with
    a requirement to set and meet specific milestones. Doing so will
    help ensure that Federal agencies get the support they need to fully
    and effectively protect their networks from future exploitation.
-   **Protects United States technology**. The NSM recognizes the
    importance of protecting critical technology from theft and abuse.
    To this end, the NSM directs Federal agencies to develop
    comprehensive plans to safeguard American intellectual property,
    research and development, and other sensitive technology from
    acquisition by America’s adversaries, and to educate industry and
    academia on the threats they face. It encourages engagement with
    international partners to ensure a competitive and fair global
    marketplace that fosters innovation and continued growth in the
    field.
