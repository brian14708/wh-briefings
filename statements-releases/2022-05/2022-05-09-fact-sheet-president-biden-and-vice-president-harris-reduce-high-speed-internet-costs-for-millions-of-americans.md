*Biden-Harris Administration Secures Commitments from 20 Internet
Providers to Cut Prices and Increase Speeds*

High-speed internet service is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. But
too many families go without high-speed internet because of the cost or
have to cut back on other essentials to make their monthly internet
service payments. Lowering prices—including the cost of high-speed
internet service—is President Biden’s top priority. Today, President
Biden and Vice President Harris are announcing that they have secured
private sector commitments that will lower high-speed internet costs for
millions of American families.

As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the President and Vice
President worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Affordable
Connectivity Program (ACP), which allows tens of millions of American
households to reduce their internet service costs by up to $30/month (or
$75/month on Tribal lands). To ensure the most efficient use of those
public dollars and to deliver maximum cost savings to families, the
Biden-Harris Administration has secured commitments from 20 leading
internet providers—covering more than 80% of the U.S. population across
urban, suburban, and rural areas—to either increase speeds or cut
prices, making sure they all offer ACP-eligible households high-speed,
high-quality internet plans for no more than $30/month.

From large providers like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon serving dozens of
states, to smaller providers serving rural areas like Jackson Energy
Authority in Tennessee and Comporium in North Carolina, the commitments
will allow tens of millions of ACP-eligible households to receive
high-speed internet at no cost.

The Biden-Harris Administration is also launching a comprehensive effort
to make sure as many ACP-eligible households as possible take advantage
of this new program by:

-   **<u>Launching GetInternet.gov:</u>**
    [GetInternet.gov](http://www.GetInternet.gov) is a simple,
    easy-to-use website with details on how Americans can sign up for
    ACP and find participating internet providers in their area.  
-   **<u>Reaching out to eligible households through federal
    agencies:</u>** Households qualify for ACP based on their income or
    through their participation in one of several other federal
    programs, like Pell Grants, Medicaid, or Supplemental Security
    Income. Agencies that manage these programs will be coordinating an
    effort to reach out to households that qualify for ACP through
    programs they help administer. For example, the Social Security
    Administration will email all 1.6 million Supplemental Security
    Income recipients who have a “My Social Security” account, letting
    them know that they are eligible for the Affordable Connectivity
    Program.  
-   **<u>Partnering with states and cities:</u>** The Administration is
    partnering with states and cities to spread the word as well. For
    example, Michigan, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Mesa, Arizona, and
    New York City will text millions of eligible households.  
-   **<u>Collaborating with public interest organizations:</u>** Public
    interest organizations, including the United Way, Goodwill, Catholic
    Charities USA, and UnidosUS, will train their national networks to
    conduct direct enrollment and outreach. And Propel, a mission-driven
    financial technology company, will provide information via the
    Providers app to connect more than 5 million low-income families
    with the program. 

Today’s announcement is just one part of the President’s strategy for
lowering the cost of high-speed internet for all Americans. New

tens of billions of dollars for broadband infrastructure construction
will require providers to offer affordable internet options. New rules
will soon require providers to display a “[Broadband Nutrition
Label](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-acts-empower-broadband-consumers-through-transparency-0)”
that will make it easier to comparison shop for the best deal on
internet. The FCC has adopted rules to ban sweetheart deals between
internet providers and landlords that restrict the internet options
available to millions of Americans who live [in apartment
buildings](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-acts-increase-broadband-competition-apartment-buildings-0).
And the President’s [competition
agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/competition/) is focused on providing
Americans with more good options for internet service where they
live—driving down prices and increasing the quality of service.  
  
**<u>THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM (ACP)</u>**  
President Biden and Vice President Harris worked with Democrats and
Republicans to create the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)—the
largest high-speed internet affordability program in our nation’s
history. Experts estimate that [48 million
households](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/6272e30e12eafe18e06dec58/1651696399310/Broadband-Connectivity-Fact-Sheet-CPSP-2022.pdf)—or
nearly 40% of households in the country—qualify for the ACP either
because their income is at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level,
or because a member of the household meets one of the other criteria
below:

-   Participates in one of the following programs:
    -   Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known
        as Food Stamps
    -   Medicaid
    -   Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
        Children (WIC)
    -   Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
    -   Federal Public Housing Assistance (FPHA)
    -   Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit
    -   Free and Reduced-Price School Lunch Program or School Breakfast
        Program, including at U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
        Community Eligibility Provision schools
    -   Federal Pell Grant (received in the current award year)
    -   Lifeline
    -   Certain Tribal assistance programs, including Bureau of Indian
        Affairs General Assistance, Head Start (only households meeting
        the income qualifying standard), Tribal Temporary Assistance for
        Needy Families (Tribal TANF), and Food Distribution Program on
        Indian Reservations  
-   Meets the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband
    provider’s existing low-income internet program.

Under the terms of the ACP, an eligible household that signs up for the
program will receive a discount of up to $30/month on any internet
service plan a participating provider offers. Households on Tribal Lands
are eligible for a discount of up to $75/month. As of now, more than
1,300 internet service providers participate in the program, and more
than 11.5 million households have signed up to receive the ACP
benefit.  
  
**<u>NEW PRIVATE SECTOR COMMITMENTS</u>**  
To make the most of this program, the Biden-Harris Administration asked
participating internet service providers to either reduce prices and or
raise speeds to offer ACP-eligible households a high-speed internet plan
for no more than $30/month. For these purposes, the Administration views
a sufficiently high-speed plan as one that offers download speeds of at
least 100 Megabits per second everywhere that the provider’s
infrastructure is capable of it. That’s fast enough for a typical family
of four to work from home, do schoolwork, browse the web, and stream
high-definition shows and movies. In addition, the Administration asked
providers to offer such plans with no fees and no data caps.

For example, as part of this initiative, Verizon lowered the price for
its Fios service from $39.99/month to $30/month for a plan that delivers
download and upload speeds of at least 200 Megabits per second, and
Spectrum doubled the speed of the $30/month plan it makes available to
ACP participants from 50 to 100 Megabits per second (download).

Each of the following companies committed to offer all ACP-eligible
families at least one high-speed plan for $30/month or less, with no
additional fees and no data caps.

These companies serve urban, suburban, and rural communities across the
country. Collectively, they offer high-speed internet services in areas
in which over 80% of the U.S. population lives, including nearly 50% of
the rural population. The Biden-Harris Administration is grateful for
the efforts of these companies, and encourages additional internet
service providers to join this effort to close the digital divide by
offering high-speed, low-cost plans.
