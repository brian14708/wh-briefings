title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Unemployment Insurance\_Claims"
---
 
America is back to work.  The number of Americans who are forced to rely
on unemployment insurance programs for their support fell to its lowest
level in over 52 years. When I took office, there were nearly 20 million
Americans on unemployment insurance to feed their families and keep a
roof over their heads. Today, that number is about 1.3 million. That’s
millions of families moving from government support to earning a
paycheck. 

Today, the percentage of people receiving unemployment insurance fell
below 1 percent for the first time since 1969. This historic progress is
the result of my economic plan to grow the economy from the bottom up
and middle out.

Now, tackling inflation is my top economic priority. My plan to tackle
inflation is to lower the costs that families face and lower the federal
deficit, and we make progress on this every day.  The federal budget
deficit has already fallen by $1.5 trillion this year, and I have
proposed a plan to reduce it even more by ensuring large corporations
and the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes.  Congressional
Republicans have a different approach – their plan would raise taxes on
working families, and jeopardize programs like Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.
