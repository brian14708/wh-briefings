title: "Biden Administration Announces Second Operation Fly Formula\_Flight"
---
 
Today, the Department of Defense (DOD) has sourced a second flight to
fulfill the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s request for
Operation Fly Formula to transport Nestlé S.A. formula from Ramstein Air
Base in Germany to Washington Dulles International Airport. From there,
the formula will be transported to a Nestlé facility in Pennsylvania.
DOD is contracting with FedEx Express to transport the shipment via its
integrated air and ground network. The flight and trucking will take
place in the coming days. More details on timing will be announced when
available.

The Operation Fly Formula shipments will transport 114 pallets of Gerber
Good Start® Extensive HA infant formula. This is the remainder of the
equivalent of up to 1.5 million 8-ounce bottles of three
formulas—Alfamino® Infant, Alfamino® Junior, and Gerber Good Start®
Extensive HA—all of which are hypoallergenic formulas for children with
cow’s milk protein allergy. The first tranche of this shipment,
announced on May 19, arrived in the United States via DOD aircraft on
Sunday, May 22. These formulas have been prioritized because they serve
a critical medical purpose and are in short supply in the United States
because of the Abbott Sturgis plant closure.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, USDA and the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) are authorized to use DOD-contracted commercial
aircraft to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and
safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. In addition,
President Biden has directed his Administration to take a number of
other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula
for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering
into a consent agreement between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to reopen Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance
to allow major formula manufacturers to safely import formula that is
not currently being produced for the U.S. market.
