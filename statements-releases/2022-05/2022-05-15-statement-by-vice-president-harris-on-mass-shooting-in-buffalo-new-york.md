title: Statement by Vice President Harris on Mass Shooting in Buffalo, New York
---
 
Today our hearts are broken and we grieve for the victims of the
horrific act of gun violence in Buffalo and for their families and
friends.  The Second Gentleman and I are praying for all those who knew
and lost love ones.   
   
Law enforcement is proceeding with its investigation, but what is clear
is that we are seeing an epidemic of hate across our country that has
been evidenced by acts of violence and intolerance.  We must call it out
and condemn it. Racially-motivated hate crimes or acts of violent
extremism are harms against all of us, and we must do everything we can
to ensure that our communities are safe from such acts.
