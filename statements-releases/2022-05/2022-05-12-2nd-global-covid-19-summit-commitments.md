---
 
The second Global COVID-19 Summit, co-hosted by United States, Belize,
Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal, convened over partners and
organizations from around the world to accelerate collective efforts to
get shots into arms, enhance access to tests and treatments, protect the
health workforce, and finance and build health security for future
pandemics and other health crises.

**The Summit garnered new financial commitments totaling <u>$3.2
billion,</u> not yet announced, above and beyond pledges made to date in
2022.  This includes nearly $2.5 billion for COVID-19 and related
response activities and $712 million in new commitments toward a new
pandemic preparedness and global health security fund at the World Bank.
(Note: This builds on $250 million previously pledged for this fund.) We
encourage partners to join, as much more is needed to control COVID-19
and build better health security.**

    National Immunization Day campaigns are available to accelerate
    vaccine coverage in multiple regions with at-risk populations in
    high-risk countries.  With Rotary’s 1.4 million members worldwide,
    and over 55,000 African members, our health infrastructure, and
    relationships with local and national government health departments
    remain active. Rotary can quickly mobilize, as strategy, structure,
    accountability, and funding become available.

    Foundation**](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/)**:** The
    Rockefeller Foundation’s Global Vaccination Initiative commits USD
    55 million to support country-led efforts to fully vaccinate 90% of
    the most at-risk populations in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the
    Caribbean. Funding will support programs to increase vaccine demand
    – access, trust, and information – while leveraging data from
    trusted, credible sources to strengthen health systems to meet the
    needs of the most vulnerable.

-   [**Sabin Vaccine Institute**](https://www.sabin.org/)**: ** Commits
    $9 million through its Global Immunization program in 2022 to better
    understand and address vaccine delivery, acceptance and demand
    barriers in LMICs; bolster collaboration among immunization
    professionals; foster action to address barriers in universal
    vaccination development; and better apply epidemiology to maximize
    vaccine rollout effectiveness. Sabin commits to fostering the action
    of 3,000+ close-to-community professionals delivering vaccinations
    in LMICs – including health workers, program managers, researchers
    and journalists.

-   [**Seed Global Health**](https://seedglobalhealth.org/)**: **
    Research estimates that for every $1 allocated to vaccine
    production, $5 is needed for delivery, with majority cost being
    associated with health worker training, support, and protection.
    Establishing integrated health worker networks from the last mile to
    the facility is critical to enabling access to vaccinations. .  Seed
    Global Health commits to partnering with governments to train and
    deploy the health workers required to put shots in arms while
    supporting counter-misinformation campaigns to reduce vaccine
    hesitancy.  Health workers deliver every element of pandemic
    response and preparedness. Commits to scale our direct work in
    training and care to sustain essential services to an additional 3
    million people; to protect education to strengthen the pipeline of
    health workers; to respond to emergencies on the frontlines,
    modeling new methodologies of diagnosis and care; and to align and
    mobilize the political commitment and resources to support health
    workers and save more lives. Health workers are the backbone of
    resilient health systems and pathway to economic recovery and global
    health security.  Commits to mobilize a social contract for health
    workers, to galvanize action beyond applause. Centered on core
    principles that provide the evidence-based rationale, framework and
    accountability, this compact will mobilize and align investments,
    policies, and programming around long- term country-led planning, to
    scale-up and protect fit-for-purpose health workforces in service to
    the world.

-   [**The Task Force for Global Health**](https://www.taskforce.org/):
    Will partner with countries to strengthen immunization programs and
    field epidemiology training. Through Hepatitis, Polio and Neglected
    Tropical Diseases programs, we’ll support COVID-19 efforts for the
    most vulnerable. We’ll distribute [medical
    supplies/equipment](https://taskforce.org/equipping-clinical-care-facilities%e2%80%8b/)
    and support public health worker mental health and resilience. We’ll
    convene thought leaders to envision building upon COVID-related
    investments for sustainable systems. We’ll advance the scientific
    understanding of rare adverse events after COVID-19 vaccinations,
    advancing evidence-based decision-making.

    In partnership with Afrigen Biologics and Labotec, we are providing
    cutting-edge technology and personalized capacity building to enable
    production of the first locally designed and constructed COVID
    vaccine for Africa. Our support for this WHO-coordinated,
    end-to-end, sustainable mRNA vaccine production hub includes
    facility design and bacteria cultivation tools to support DNA
    plasmid creation, as well as investing in time and expertise to
    transfer technical knowledge and support so scientists and
    healthcare leaders can create their own future.  As part of our
    Mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner
    and safer, we have a responsibility to provide access to COVID-19
    diagnostic solutions that reach every population, community and
    individual, regardless of geography or socioeconomic circumstance. 
    We will continue to provide low price, high-quality diagnostic
    solutions to Governments, United Nations and other global partners
    because testing is the cornerstone of a continuum of care and
    treatment of COVID-19 globally. We recognize the importance of
    building upon lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and will
    continue to collaborate with Governments, the United Nations and
    other global partners to create resilient systems to better prevent,
    detect and respond to the next emerging pathogen.  This includes
    helping to create federated, open pathogen surveillance systems,
