title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Shontel Brown\u2019s Primary Victory in\_\
  Ohio"

Shontel Brown’s primary victory last night was an important step forward
toward building a better Ohio and a better America. I was proud to
endorse Shontel in her primary bid for re-election because she has been
a strong leader in Congress and a partner in the work to cut costs and
create jobs. She is focused on solutions that will matter most to Middle
Class and working families, such as passing legislation like the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. I’m proud of Shontel and her demonstrated
record of fighting for the people of Ohio, and I thank her for her
continued work in service to the American people.
