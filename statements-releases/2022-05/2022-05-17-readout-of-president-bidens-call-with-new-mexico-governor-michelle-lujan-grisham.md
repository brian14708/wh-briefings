President Biden called New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham today
to discuss the wildfires that have burned hundreds of thousands of acres
across the State, resulted in the evacuation of tens of thousands, and
destroyed hundreds of homes.  Governor Lujan Grisham underscored the
impacts of the fires on New Mexico communities and the need for ongoing
partnership with the Federal Government as New Mexico recovers and
rebuilds from some of the most devastating wildfires on record in the
State.  The President reaffirmed that the people of New Mexico will have
the full support of the Federal Government, and that every effort will
be made to provide immediate help to people in the impacted communities
and support the State throughout its recovery.  The President expressed
his gratitude to all of the first responders, firefighters, and other
federal, state, and local personnel who are battling the blazes and have
come to the aid of those who have been impacted by the fires.
