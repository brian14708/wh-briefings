The United States Supreme Court has now confirmed that the draft opinion
that would overturn *Roe v. Wade* is genuine.

*Roe* ensures a womanâ€™s right to choose to have an abortion. It also, at
its root, protects the fundamental right to privacy. What is clear is
that opponents of *Roe* want to punish women and take away their rights
to make decisions about their own bodies. Republican legislators in
states across the country are weaponizing the use of the law against
women.

The rights of all Americans are at risk. If the right to privacy is
weakened, every person could face a future in which the government can
potentially interfere in the personal decisions you make about your
life. This is the time to fight for women and for our country with
everything we have.
