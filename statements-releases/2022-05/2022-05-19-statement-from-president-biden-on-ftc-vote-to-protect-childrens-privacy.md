title: "Statement from President\_Biden on FTC Vote to Protect Children\u2019s\_Privacy"
---
 
In the State of the Union I said that it is time to strengthen privacy
protections, ban targeted advertising to children and demand tech
companies stop collecting personal data on our children.  I want to
commend the Federal Trade Commission for unanimously taking a big step
in that direction today.    When children and parents access online
educational products, they shouldn’t be forced to accept tracking and
surveillance to do so.   The FTC is making it clear that such
requirements would violate the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act,
and that the agency will be cracking down on companies that persist in
exploiting our children to make money.
