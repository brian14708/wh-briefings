title: "FACT SHEET: Biden Administration Announces Launch of First Federally-Supported\
  \ Test to Treat\_Site"
---
 
On his first day in office, President Biden mobilized an unprecedented,
comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic—standing up a historic
vaccination program that has gotten 220 million Americans fully
vaccinated and over 100 million people boosted, and investing in other
lifesaving tools, including COVID-19 therapeutics.  
  
One of the most effective treatments in our nation’s medicine cabinet is
Paxlovid, an oral antiviral pill, which reduces the risk of
hospitalization or death by about 90 percent. Since Paxlovid was first
authorized in December 2021, the Administration has moved quickly to
ensure that these treatments are widely available and that health care
providers and patients know about their availability and efficacy. These
efforts include a Test-to-Treat initiative to help make it easier for
people to quickly access oral antiviral treatments in one convenient
location. There are now more than 2,500 Test-to-Treat locations across
the country at local pharmacies and community health centers—up from
2,200 a month ago.  
  
The Administration’s actions to date have resulted in tremendous
progress: We have dramatically increased the number of people benefiting
from oral antivirals in the last seven weeks, from about 27,000
prescriptions filled each week to more than 182,000 last week—a more
than six-fold increase. We have also doubled the number of sites where
Paxlovid is available nationally.  
  
Because of the work the Biden Administration has done on vaccines,
boosters, treatments, and more, COVID-19 deaths are down 90 percent from
when the President took office—even as cases rise in parts of the
country. The tools that the Administration has made widely available to
the American people are working to prevent serious illness, to keep
people out of the hospital, and to save lives.  
  
The tools we have now mean that we can prevent most COVID deaths. The
Administration remains laser-focused on making sure that these
lifesaving tools are widely available to every American who needs them.
To that end, today, the Administration is announcing the launch of the
first federally-supported Test-to-Treat site, with more planned in the
coming weeks.  
  
**Today’s announcement includes:**

-   **Launching the first federally-supported Test-to-Treat site in
    Rhode Island:** Today, Rhode Island will officially launch the
    nation’s first federally-supported Test-to-Treat site at a clinic in
    Providence. Federal reimbursement will now allow individuals who
    test positive for COVID-19 at the clinic to immediately receive an
    assessment from a medical provider and get oral antiviral
    treatments—if prescribed—all in one convenient location that serves
    some of the state’s highest-risk and hardest-hit populations. The
    clinic also currently offers vaccination, meaning that federal
    support will help enhance this site into being a true one-stop shop
    for individuals to protect themselves and their communities from
    COVID-19.
-   **Deploying clinical personnel to support state-run Test-to-Treat
    sites in Minnesota:** In the coming days, the Administration will
    deploy clinical personnel to support staffing across several of
    Minnesota’s state-run testing sites, transforming them into
    Test-to-Treat sites that will co-locate testing, an assessment from
    a medical provider, and oral antiviral treatments. This direct
    federal support will allow Minnesota to expand the capacity and
    reach of Test-to-Treat, making these lifesaving oral antiviral
    treatments more widely available statewide.
-   **Launching additional federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites in
    the coming weeks:** The Administration will open federally-supported
    Test-to-Treat sites in New York and Illinois in the coming weeks,
    and is working with other regions like Massachusetts and New York
    City to enhance existing state-led efforts to increase access to
    oral antivirals like Paxlovid.

**Today’s announcements build on the significant actions the
Administration has taken over the past several weeks to increase access
to oral antivirals and boost health care provider and patient awareness,
including:**

-   **Doubling the number of places where oral antivirals are
    available:** In late April, the Administration acted to make it
    easier for local pharmacies to order oral antivirals directly from
    the federal government. As a result, oral antivirals are now
    available at almost 40,000 convenient locations nationwide—up from
    roughly 20,000 a month ago. This means nearly 90 percent of
    Americans now live within 5 miles of a place where they can pick up
    their prescriptions for oral antivirals, including local pharmacies,
    hospitals, urgent care centers, community health centers, rural
    health clinics, Veterans Affairs clinics, and Department of Defense
    Medical Treatment Facilities.
-   **Ensuring equitable access to oral antivirals:** In line with the
    Administration’s unwavering commitment to equity, 40 percent of the
    pharmacy sites that now have oral antivirals available are located
    in communities with the highest levels of social vulnerability. To
    ensure both equitable geographic placement and equitable
    administration to vulnerable populations, we have also called on all
    sites dispensing oral antivirals to collect robust demographic data
    on individuals receiving prescriptions for COVID-19 therapeutics.
    This demographic data will improve our ability to identify—in real
    time—any gaps in access and work to promptly alleviate those gaps.
-   **Expanding the number of Test-to-Treat sites in communities and
    their reach:** Over the past several weeks, the Administration has
    worked with its federal pharmacy and community health center
    partners to expand the footprint of Test-to-Treat sites in
    communities and to enhance overall patient experience. This means
    that it is even easier for people to make appointments and to access
    treatments. There are now more than 2,500 Test-to-Treat locations
    across the country at local pharmacies and community health
    centers—up from 2,200 a month ago. These Test-to-Treat sites provide
    people streamlined access to COVID-19 tests, health care provider
    visits, and if they need it, prescriptions for oral antivirals. In
    addition, Americans can now find many health care providers on the
    [Test-to-Treat
    locator](https://covid-19-test-to-treat-locator-dhhs.hub.arcgis.com/)
    that supports telehealth visits to determine if oral antivirals are
    appropriate. Walgreens has made antiviral treatments available in
    all of its rural and high Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)
    locations, and CVS and Kroger have added telehealth-based provider
    visits to help people get a prescription quickly.
-   **Supporting health care providers with additional guidance:** In
    the last month, federal health agencies have issued updated guidance
    to help health care providers stay up to date on the latest science
    and navigate drug-drug interactions and contraindications. The
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued two Health
    Alert Notifications highlighting available COVID-19 treatments,
    particularly Paxlovid. The National Institutes of Health  has
    updated its [treatment
    guidelines](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ritonavir-boosted-nirmatrelvir--paxlovid-/)
    with more info to help providers understand drug-drug interactions.
    And, the Food and Drug Administration  issued a
    [FAQ](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-updates-paxlovid-health-care-providers)
    and created an [eligibility screening
    checklist](https://www.fda.gov/media/158165/download) to help
    providers get this treatment to all patients that need it.
-   **Providing more resources for the immunocompromised:** The
    Administration continues to prioritize protections for
    immunocompromised individuals. This includes ensuring that
    immunocompromised individuals have free and easy access to
    additional booster shots, and making pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs
    like Evusheld widely available and free to help those with
    moderately and severely compromised immune systems mount an adequate
    immune response to COVID-19. As part of the Administration’s ongoing
    commitment, we continue to ensure immunocompromised individuals have
    easy access to the best and latest information on federal websites
    about vaccines and Evusheld, including highlighting this information
    on covid.gov. Additionally, the Administration continues to engage
    provider organizations representing clinicians that care for the
    majority of immunocompromised patients to make sure that they are
    doing everything they can to ensure that all patients who would
    benefit from Evusheld are informed and offered the opportunity to
    receive the treatment.
