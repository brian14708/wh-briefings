title: "Joint Statement Between the United\_States and the European Commission on\
  \ European Energy\_Security"

Russia has demonstrated that it is an unreliable supplier of energy to
Europe through unjustified and unacceptable actions such as cutting off
electricity and natural gas to Finland, halting natural gas exports to
Poland and Bulgaria, and threatening similar actions against other
European nations. The United States and the European Commission condemn
Russia’s use of energy blackmail and reaffirm our commitment to
strengthening Europe’s energy security.

Across Europe, from the Nordics to the Balkans, efforts are underway to
diversify supplies and reduce dependence on Russian gas.  Since 2020,
Finland has been interconnected to Estonia via the Balticonnector, a
project supported by the European Commission, which increases security
of supply for Finland and the region. Furthermore, on May 1, the
Poland-Lithuania Gas Interconnector started its commercial operation
which reinforces optionality and resilience of the whole Baltic gas
market and was also supported through the Connecting Europe Facility of
the European Commission. 

The European Commission and the United States understand the urgency of
taking decisive action to reduce energy imports from Russia. Together,
we are partnering to address these challenges under our joint Task Force
on Energy Security announced by Presidents Biden and von der Leyen on
March 25.  Through the Task Force we will continue working to diversify
Europe’s supply of natural gas while we accelerate the deployment of
energy efficiency and smart technologies in European homes and
businesses, electrify heating, and ramp-up clean energy output to reduce
demand for fossil fuels altogether.  

As an important step towards realizing the goals of the Task Force, the
European Commission and the United States welcome Finland’s contract to
lease a floating LNG import terminal from a U.S. provider that will be
operational before the end of this year.
