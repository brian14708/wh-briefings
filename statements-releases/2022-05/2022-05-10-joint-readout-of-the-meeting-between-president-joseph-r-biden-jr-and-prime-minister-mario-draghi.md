President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States and Prime Minister
Mario Draghi of Italy met today at the White House. The leaders
reaffirmed the strong and broad U.S.-Italian partnership reflected in
the deep and enduring ties between our people and our countries, of
which our alliance through NATO and the U.S. partnership with the EU are
critical components. They discussed recent developments in Russia’s
unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine. They underscored their
continued commitment to pursuing peace by supporting Ukraine and
imposing costs on Russia. In the face of the global economic challenges
created by Russia’s actions, they discussed measures aimed at fostering
food security and reshaping global energy markets. They committed to
maintaining their work together on global crises from COVID-19 to
climate change, as well as to continuing their cooperation on shared
foreign policy challenges, including China and Libya. The leaders looked
forward to further discussions at the G-7 Summit and NATO Summit in
June.
