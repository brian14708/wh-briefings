President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Kyriakos
Mitsotakis of Greece.  The President congratulated the Prime Minister on
201 years of Greek independence. The leaders underscored that the
relationship between the United States and Greece is stronger than ever,
and noted the enduring people-to-people bonds that have helped define
our bilateral ties for more than two centuries. They reviewed our strong
and growing defense partnership, our shared democratic values, and our
commitment to further expand bilateral trade and investment. They
discussed developments in Ukraine, including our strong support for
efforts to impose costs on Russia for its unprovoked aggression, and
pledged to continue backing the people and government of Ukraine. They
also discussed developments in the eastern Mediterranean, as well as our
common efforts to confront global challenges, including energy security,
climate change, and threats to democracy.
