title: "Biden Administration Approves First Operation Fly Formula\_Mission"
---
 
Today, the Department of Defense (DOD) is sourcing the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA)’s request for Operation Fly Formula to transport
Nestlé S.A. formula from Zurich, Switzerland to Plainfield, Indiana. DOD
is actively working the request to identify commercial aircraft.

The Operation Fly Formula shipments will transport the equivalent of up
to 1.5 million 8-ounce bottles of three formulas—Alfamino® Infant,
Alfamino® Junior, and Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA—all of which are
hypoallergenic formulas for children with cow’s milk protein allergy.
These formulas have been prioritized because they serve a critical
medical purpose and are in short supply in the United States because of
the Abbott Sturgis plant closure. These shipments will include
approximately 246 pallets.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, USDA and the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) are authorized to use DOD-contracted commercial
aircraft to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and
safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. In addition,
President Biden has directed his Administration to take a number of
other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula
for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering
into a consent agreement between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to reopen Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance
to allow major formula manufacturers to safely import formula that is
not currently being produced for the U.S. market.
