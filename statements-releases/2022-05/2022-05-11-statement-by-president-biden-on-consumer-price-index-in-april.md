While it is heartening to see that annual inflation moderated in April,
the fact remains that inflation is unacceptably high. As I said
yesterday, inflation is a challenge for families across the country and
bringing it down is my top economic priority. 

This starts with the Federal Reserve, which plays a primary role in
fighting inflation in our country. I thank the Senate for confirming Dr.
Lisa Cook to the Board of Governors last night, and urge the Senate to
confirm my remaining nominees without delay. While I will never
interfere with the Fed’s independence, I believe we have built a strong
economy and a strong labor market, and I agree with what Chairman Powell
said last week that the number one threat to that strength – is
inflation. I am confident the Fed will do its job with that in mind.   

Beyond the Fed, my inflation plan is focused on lowering the costs that
families face and lowering the federal deficit. Already this week, my
Administration has announced new steps in partnership with the private
sector to lower the price of high speed internet for tens of millions of
Americans. And, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the
federal budget deficit in the first seven months of this fiscal year
fell by $1.5 trillion—putting us on track for the most deficit reduction
in any year on record. The CBO also confirmed that the budget deficit so
far this year is lower than it was during the same period in 2019,
before the pandemic began.  Today, I am traveling to Illinois to speak
with farmers about more we can do to lower their costs and help
them produce more, lowering the price of food for Americans and around
the world. All of this is progress, but the fight against global supply
chain issues related to the pandemic and Putin’s price hike will
continue every day. 

Congressional Republicans talk about inflation, but their only plan is
to raise taxes on working families, taking even more money out of their
pockets.  If they are serious about inflation, they should send me the
bipartisan innovation bill to bolster our supply chains and make more in
America, along with legislation that cuts costs and the cuts the
deficit, reducing families’ prescription drug and utility bills and
restoring fairness to our tax code. We’ve made enormous progress in
getting our economy back on track, and these measures would help us
sustain this progress and bring prices down for families.
