National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with Dr.
Ibrahim Kalin, Spokesperson and Chief Advisor to the President of
Turkey. They discussed their ongoing support for Ukraine in the face of
Russia’s continued aggression, as well as their respective efforts to
enable Ukrainian agricultural exports to reach global markets. Mr.
Sullivan expressed support for Turkey’s continued direct talks with
Sweden and Finland to resolve concerns over their applications for NATO
membership, which the U.S. strongly supports. He also reiterated the
importance of refraining from escalation in Syria to preserve existing
ceasefire lines and avoid any further destabilization. Finally, Mr.
Sullivan urged continued dialogue and diplomacy to resolve any
disagreements in the eastern Mediterranean region.
