  s Price Hike,\_Make Food More Affordable, and Lower Costs for\_Farmers"

Pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and Putin’s Price Hike are
increasing the price of food for working families here at home and
leading to shortages of food in countries across the globe. Today,
President Biden will visit a family farm to announce actions his
administration is taking to support American farmers, reduce food
prices, and feed the world. 

Putin’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine has cut off a critical source of
wheat, corn, barley, oilseeds, and cooking oil. It has also disrupted
global supply chains for fertilizer, which farmers depend on to maximize
yields. These and other actions, combined with the ongoing
pandemic-related disruptions to global supply chains, have put pressure
on food prices, with global food prices increasing nearly 13 percent
following Putin’s invasion.

America’s farmers are the breadbasket of democracy and are already
playing a critical role in the fight against Putin’s Price Hike. During
President Biden’s first year in office, American agricultural exports
shattered all previous records, reaching a combined $177 billion,
generating an estimated $378 billion in total economic output, and
supporting 1.3 million jobs here in the United States.

Last month, the President mobilized American farmers to fuel America
when he announced that his Administration would allow E15
gasoline—gasoline that uses a 15 percent ethanol blend—to be sold this
summer. Today, the President is announcing new actions to give farmers
the tools and resources they need to boost production, lower food prices
and feed the world. As the world’s second largest exporter of wheat and
soybeans, these actions will help grow new markets for American-grown
food, supporting jobs in rural communities across America. Specifically,
the Biden-Harris Administration will:

-   **Increase the number of counties eligible for double cropping
    insurance.** Double cropping allows farmers to plant a second crop
    on the same land in the same year, helping boost production without
    relying on farmers to substitute crops or cultivate new land. But it
    is not free from risk and some farmers who practice double cropping
    cannot obtain crop insurance.  The Biden-Harris Administration is
    seeking to expand insurance for double cropping to as many as 681
    additional counties, bringing the total number of counties where
    this practice qualifies for crop insurance to as many as 1,935, so
    more American farmers have the financial security they need to start
    or expand double cropping.   
-   **Cut costs for farmers by increasing technical assistance for
    technology-driven “precision agriculture” and other nutrient
    management tools. **Precision agriculture is a farm management
    system that allows farmers to use technology to target application
    of inputs to soil and plant needs, resulting in less fertilizer
    usage without reducing yields, saving farmers money over time and
    extending the usefulness of critical products in short supply
    worldwide. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has planning and cost
    sharing assistance programs available to help American farmers with
    nutrient management. The Biden-Harris Administration is working to
    boost outreach to farmers, streamline the application process, and
    prioritize application approvals to expand access to these critical
    programs.   
-   **Double funding for domestic fertilizer production. **Fertilizer
    prices have more than doubled since last year, due in part to supply
    chain disruptions created and exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of
    Ukraine, including rising energy costs. Today, President Biden is
    announcing that he is doubling his initial $250 million investment
    in domestic fertilizer production to $500 million to lower costs and
    boost availability for farmers, so they can obtain the inputs they
    need at prices they can afford to maximize yields.
