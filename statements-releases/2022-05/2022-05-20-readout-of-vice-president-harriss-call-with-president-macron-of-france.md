Vice President Kamala Harris today spoke with President Emmanuel Macron
of France. The Vice President reiterated her strong support for the
close alliance between the United States and France, and congratulated
the President on his recent re-election. Vice President Harris and
President Macron discussed their determination to continue to support
the people of Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified
invasion, as well as the global food and security challenges exacerbated
by the conflict. In the aftermath of the horrific mass shooting in
Buffalo, New York, they discussed the importance of combatting the
epidemic of hate, violence, and racism in both countries and around the
world.
