title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Senate Passage of Ukraine\_Supplemental"
---
 
I applaud the Congress for sending a clear bipartisan message to the
world that the people of the United States stand together with the brave
people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom. The
resources that I requested will allow us to send even more weapons and
ammunition to Ukraine, replenish our own stockpile, and support U.S.
troops stationed on NATO territory. And, I want to thank Leader Schumer,
Speaker Pelosi, Leader McConnell, and Leader McCarthy for moving this
bill quickly to ensure there is no lapse in funding for these important
needs. Together with the contributions of our Allies and partners, we
will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing
to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further
strengthen Ukraine — both on the battlefield and at the negotiating
table.

We have provided a historic amount of security assistance to Ukraine to
date, and my Administration will continue to expedite the delivery of
additional weapons and equipment for which Congress has provided
authority.  And today, I am announcing another package of security
assistance that will provide additional artillery, radars, and other
equipment to Ukraine, which they are already using so effectively on the
battlefield. These weapons and equipment will go directly to the front
lines of freedom in Ukraine, and reiterate our strong support for the
brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country against Russia’s
ongoing aggression.
