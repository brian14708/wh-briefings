title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Senate Vote on the Women\u2019s Health\
  \ Protection\_Act"
---
 
Once again – as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court –
Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection
Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health
care. This failure to act comes at a time when women’s constitutional
rights are under unprecedented attack – and it runs counter to the will
of the majority of American people.  
  
Republicans in Congress – not one of whom voted for this bill – have
chosen to stand in the way of Americans’ rights to make the most
personal decisions about their own bodies, families and lives.     
  
To protect the right to choose, voters need to elect more pro-choice
senators this November, and return a pro-choice majority to the House.
If they do, Congress can pass this bill in January, and put it on my
desk, so I can sign it into law.  
  
The protections that the Women’s Health Protection Act would ensure are
essential to the health, safety, and progress of our nation.  While this
legislation did not pass today, my Administration will not stop fighting
to protect access to women’s reproductive care. We will continue to
defend women’s constitutional rights to make private reproductive
choices as recognized in *Roe v. Wade* nearly half a century ago, and my
Administration will continue to explore the measures and tools at our
disposal to do just that.
