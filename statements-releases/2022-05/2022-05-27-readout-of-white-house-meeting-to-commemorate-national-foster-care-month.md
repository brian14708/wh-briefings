title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting to Commemorate National Foster Care\_Month"
---
 
Yesterday, the White House commemorated National Foster Care Month with
a roundtable highlighting seven young people with lived experience in
the child welfare system. The meeting was convened by Assistant
Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families January
Contreras, White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling,
White House Office of Management and Budget Associate Director for
Education, Income Maintenance and Labor Sherry Lachman, Deputy Assistant
to the President for Racial Justice and Equity Chiraag Bains, Deputy
Assistant to the President for Economic Mobility Carmel Martin, and
Domestic Policy Advisor to Vice President Harris Rohini Kosoglu. The
participants came to the White House from Florida, Kentucky, Maine, New
Jersey, New York, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.

Participants discussed the importance of increased mental health
services and trauma support for children in the child welfare system,
the importance of kinship care, sibling connections, peer mentorship,
and culturally competent placement, the need for continued resources for
foster youth as they transition out of care, and the link between the
child welfare system and the criminal justice system. Participants noted
the disproportionate impact of the child welfare system on children of
color, especially Black and Native youth, and on LGBTQI+ youth.

Administration officials highlighted the President and Vice President’s
commitment to child welfare reforms, including the $10 billion increase
in funding proposed in the President’s fiscal year 2023 Budget, which
includes investments to support prevention and kinship care, expand
support for youth aging out of foster care, and reduce reliance on
congregate care. Administration officials also highlighted the
President’s whole-of-government commitment to equity, strategy to
address the national mental health crisis, and resources available to
foster youth and transition-aged youth through the American Rescue Plan.
