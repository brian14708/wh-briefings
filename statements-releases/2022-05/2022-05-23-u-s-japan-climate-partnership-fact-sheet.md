Recognizing that the path to energy security runs through clean energy,
the United States and Japan intend to build on their cooperation to
increase climate ambition, including through decarbonization and clean
energy, and continue to lead on their respective domestic climate
efforts and on accelerating international climate action. The two sides
intend to reinforce bilateral cooperation in the priority areas below to
achieve their 2050 net zero goals and their aligned 2030 nationally
determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, alongside
promoting a global trajectory consistent with keeping global temperature
increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach. 

The two sides intend to further cooperate and accelerate respective
action by: 

-   Exchanging views regarding respective domestic planning for, and
    implementation of, policies to achieve their respective 2030 NDCs
    under the Paris Agreement and 2050 net zero emission goals;
-    Working to, in line with their respective climate finance pledges,
    continue contributing to fully delivering on the goal of developed
    countries to jointly mobilize $100 billion in climate finance as
    soon as possible, in line with the Climate Finance Delivery Plan,
    including enhancing action on the ten principles for collective
    actions identified therein;
-   Advancing efforts to make financial flows consistent with the global
    achievement of net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050,
    with deep emission reductions in the 2020s and climate-resilient
    development;
-   Working to ensure there is no new direct government support for
    unabated international coal-fired power generation and to rapidly
    scale-up technologies and policies that further accelerate the
    transition away from unabated coal capacity to an overwhelmingly
    decarbonized power system in the 2030s, consistent with our 2030
    NDCs and net zero commitments, while ensuring stable energy supply;
-   Advancing rapid decarbonization of on-road transport, including by
    working to achieve a significant market share for zero-emission
    vehicles in the light duty sector by 2030, by reducing emissions
    from medium and heavy-duty vehicles and by promoting innovation for
    various technologies;
-   Enhancing cooperation bilaterally and through multilateral fora to
    address climate-related financial risks and opportunities, including
    by promoting consistent and comparable mandatory disclosure of
    climate-related information that is decision-useful for investors;
-   Continuing to enhance efforts and cooperation in innovation and
    advanced technology deployment, including in such areas as renewable
    energy, energy storage (such as batteries and long-duration energy
    storage technologies), smart grids, building electrification, energy
    efficiency, clean hydrogen, clean ammonia, carbon capture
    utilization and storage/carbon recycling, industrial
    decarbonization, and advanced nuclear power, including small modular
    reactors; and advancing collaboration under the U.S.-Japan Clean
    Energy and Energy Security Initiative (CEESI), including several new
    bilateral task forces for accelerating offshore wind, geothermal
    energy technologies and nuclear power; 
-   Collaborating in the First Movers Coalition (FMC), where the United
    States welcomes Japan as a government partner and steering board
    member, and recognizing that Japan’s participation in the First
    Movers Coalition, a flagship initiative launched at COP26 to drive
    demand for green innovation across hard-to-abate sectors, will help
    elevate the role of Japanese companies in these efforts, align
    public investment and demand with green innovation in FMC sectors,
    and provide supportive policies to help scale up supply to meet FMC
    demand signals;
-   Collaborating to accelerate the deployment of heat pumps in our
    respective domestic markets and globally to displace fuel burned in
    buildings and advance energy security and climate goals through
    electrification of space and water heating in buildings, for example
    through support for manufacturing, training, and promotion;
-   Advancing collaboration to accelerate subnational action including
    under the Global Subnational Zero Carbon Promotion Initiative by
    continuing the Zero Carbon City International Forum, sharing best
    practices and considering opportunities for collaborative actions in
    third countries;
-   Coordinating closely on our diplomatic efforts toward all major
    economies’ taking bold actions in the 2020s to keep a 1.5 degree
    Celsius limit on warming within reach, including through the Major
    Economies Forum and the G20; 
-   Enhancing collaboration on the implementation of Article 6 of the
    Paris Agreement, including through capacity building activities on
    high integrity carbon markets by sharing best practices and lessons
    learned;
-   Pursuing opportunities to cooperate on fully utilizing existing
    nuclear power, and to advance innovative nuclear power technologies,
    including strengthening industrial partnerships and deepening
    successful capacity building cooperation in third countries under
    the Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small
    Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program;
-   Enhancing cooperation to address methane emissions globally,
    recognizing the importance of the Global Methane Pledge and rapid
    global action to address methane; and by implementing domestic
    methane emission reduction based on respective national plans, and
    encouraging those countries that do not have such plans to develop
    them, and to pursue opportunities to provide financial and technical
    assistance to assist third countries to meet their methane reduction
    targets; and the U.S., as one of the largest producers and Japan, as
    one of the largest consumers, intend to take action to reduce
    methane emissions from production and consumption. Japan intends to
    share knowledge and information on technology to reduce methane
    emission through a Quad roundtable event focused on the oil and gas
    sector;
-   Working to accelerate deployment of offshore wind installations,
    both at home and in third countries, and seeking partnerships to
    scale financing, improve policy conditions, and undertake relevant
    technical work, recognizing the U.S. goal to deploy 30 gigawatts
    (GW) of offshore wind by 2030, and Japan’s goal to deploy 10 GW of
    offshore wind by 2030;
-   Securing resilient and diverse supply chains of critical minerals to
    support energy security and the clean energy transition;
-   Collaborating on greening government initiatives with the aim of
    using the procurement power of our respective national governments
    to achieve ambitious goals, including procuring carbon-free
    electricity, acquiring zero-emission light-duty vehicles,
    constructing net-zero emission buildings, and upgrading lighting to
    high-efficiency lighting, contributing to net-zero emissions by 2050
    through greening overall national government operations;
-   Building on established deep cooperation on the decarbonization of
    the shipping sector to promote the demonstration, deployment, and
    adoption of low- and zero- emission lifecycle fuels and technologies
    for shipping, recognizing that decarbonizing the shipping sector is
    essential to transitioning to a clean energy economy; advancing
    ocean-based climate actions such as green shipping corridors and
    supply for zero-emission shipping;
-   Cooperating to accelerate the transition to decarbonized and
    lower-methane economies in third countries, particularly in the
    Indo-Pacific, including through:   
      
    The Japan-U.S. Clean Energy Partnership (JUCEP), which advances the
    deployment of renewable energy and decarbonization technologies in
    the Indo-Pacific through partnerships with the private sector, and;
    The Japan-U.S. Mekong Power Partnership, or JUMPP, which supports
    the Mekong’s energy security while encouraging greater regional
    power trade, renewable energy integration, and power market
    development.
