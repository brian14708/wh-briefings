This week, our nation lost an American hero and I lost a dear friend in
Norman Mineta. Earlier today, I signed a bill to name the United States
Department of Transportation headquarters in his honor, along with the
late William T. Coleman, Jr.

As a boy during World War II, Norm and his family were cruelly confined
in the Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming during America’s
shameful period of Japanese Incarceration.  Undaunted — and eternally
hopeful — Norm was motivated by this early injustice to pursue a life of
service.  He was determined to ensure that the nation he loved lived up
to its defining promise of liberty, equality, and justice for all — and
he worked with grace and dignity to bring us closer to those ideals.

Norm will always be remembered for the many barriers he broke.  He was
the first Asian American to serve as Mayor of a major city — his beloved
hometown of San Jose — as well as the first Asian American to serve in
the Cabinet.  Over two decades in the House of Representatives, Norm was
a force of purpose and progress.  He was the first chair of the
Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and led passage of the
landmark Civil Liberties Act of 1988 — legislation that, at long last,
acknowledged and remunerated families like his own who had been
incarcerated in camps during World War II.

But beyond his remarkable lifetime of accomplishments, I will remember
Norm for his steadfast commitment to a belief he held dear: that America
can accomplish anything when we come together.  It is no accident that
Norm was entrusted to lead Cabinet departments under both Democratic and
Republican presidents — nor that some of his closest friendships in
Congress were with members across the political spectrum.  Norm treated
everybody he met with equal dignity, and earned the respect of all who
knew him.

Our thoughts are with Norm’s wife, Deni, his four children, his 11
grandchildren, and generations of constituents and staff who were
inspired by the power of his example and who followed his lead in
serving this nation.

May God bless Norman Mineta.
