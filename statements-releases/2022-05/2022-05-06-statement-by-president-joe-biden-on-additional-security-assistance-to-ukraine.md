title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Additional Security Assistance to\_Ukraine"
---
 
Today, the United States is continuing our strong support for the brave
people of Ukraine as they defend their country against Russia’s ongoing
aggression. I am announcing another package of security assistance that
will provide additional artillery munitions, radars, and other equipment
to Ukraine.

The United States has provided a historic amount of security assistance
to Ukraine at rapid speed. We are sending the weapons and equipment that
Congress has authorized directly to the front lines of freedom in
Ukraine. U.S. support, together with the contributions of our Allies and
partners, has been critical in helping Ukraine win the battle of Kyiv
and hinder Putin’s war aims in Ukraine.

With today’s announcement, my Administration has nearly exhausted
funding that can be used to send security assistance through drawdown
authorities for Ukraine. For Ukraine to succeed in this next phase of
war its international partners, including the U.S., must continue to
demonstrate our unity and our resolve to keep the weapons and ammunition
flowing to Ukraine, without interruption. Congress should quickly
provide the requested funding to strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield
and at the negotiating table.
