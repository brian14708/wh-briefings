title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Virtual Meetings with Retailers and Infant\
  \ Formula\_Manufacturers"

Today, President Joe Biden spoke with the leadership of Walmart and
Target, and the infant formula manufacturers Reckitt and Gerber to
receive an update on actions the companies are taking to address the
shortage of infant formula caused by a voluntary recall of infant
powdered formula by Abbott and the subsequent closure of its
manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan.

The manufacturers and retailers thanked the President for the actions
his administration has taken—including those by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture—that has enabled
them to serve the families in need, including low income mothers and
children who are most vulnerable.

The President discussed Reckitt and Gerber’s efforts to increase
production—which have made up for much of the loss of production by
Abbott—and pledged to work closely with them to identify ways the
Administration can help, on top of the actions being announced today.
Both companies stated that they are operating 24/7 with Gerber,
increasing the amount of their infant formula available to consumers by
approximately 50% in March and April. Reckitt is supplying more than 30%
more product year to date.

The conversation with the CEOs of Walmart and Target focused on how
retailers are working to stock shelves. The CEOs discussed state
specific disparities and the President asked what more his team can do
to help move product and get more product to communities in need. These
calls build off the work the Administration has done since February to
increase the supply of infant formula.
