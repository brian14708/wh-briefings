National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with Prime
Minister Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia. They underscored their strong
commitment to continue supporting Ukraine in response to Russia’s

Croatia’s efforts to help neighboring countries diversify their energy

liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Krk. They also exchanged views
on stability in the Western Balkans.
