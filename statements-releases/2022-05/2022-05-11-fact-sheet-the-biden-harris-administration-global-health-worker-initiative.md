*This pandemic has spotlighted the critical role and bravery of health
and care workers. That’s why I’ve asked my Administration to develop a
global health workforce plan, to accelerate our contributions to the
Sustainable Development Agenda and investments in health and care
workers.*

*President Joseph R. Biden, April 7, 2022*

Strategic and sustained investments in the global health workforce are
key to catalyzing the U.S. Government’s efforts to achieve the 2030
Sustainable Development Agenda. The COVID-19 pandemic has further
exacerbated the estimated global shortage of 18 million health workers
by 2030.  With growing health demands from new and emerging pathogens,
aging populations, climate shocks, and increasing conflict and
migration, the ever-increasing demand for health workers needs greater
coordinated attention and action. A comprehensive, trained, protected,
well-equipped, and supported workforce is foundational to expanding
equitable access to public health services and health care across the
globe.  Investments in health workers not only improve health outcomes,
they create jobs and career pathways and economic development by
strengthening human capital as part of the care economy.  Funding
advancements for the health workforce will accelerate ending the
COVID-19 pandemic, stimulate economic recovery, and support critical
components of President Biden’s values-driven global infrastructure
initiative announced at the 2021 G7 Summit by strengthening global
health systems, expanding national and regional capacity, including
manufacturing of essential medical products.  These investments will
also build on commitments made by global partners at the 2nd Global
COVID-19 Summit co-hosted by the United States to accelerate combatting
COVID-19 and advancing future preparedness.  
  
Currently, U.S. Government programs such as the U.S. President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the U.S. President’s Malaria
Initiative (PMI), and U.S. bilateral global health security partnerships
in support of the Global Health Security Agenda, contribute
approximately $1.56 billion annually to support the health workforce
across the globe. Further, the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Budget
prioritizes advancing investments across health programs to strengthen
health systems and the global health workforce and support. Notably, the
President’s Budget includes an additional $1 billion for this new Global
Health Worker Initiative to support and protect the global health
workforce as part of the Administration’s increased prioritization and
investments in health workforce. This funding, if provided by Congress,
would be directed through the U.S. Department of State and the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID) and coordinated with
others in the U.S. government.   
  
The Global Health Worker Initiative expands and defines “health workers”
broadly to include a multidisciplinary workforce including clinicians,
community health and care workers, and public health professionals. It
provides a framework to guide and organize the U.S. Government’s
investments and strengthen coordination with key partners including G7
and G20 countries, multilateral and regional organizations, and the
private sector. While global in focus, this effort complements President
Biden’s efforts to support the domestic health workforce.  
  
From the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States
has demonstrated renewed leadership in global health through action and
smart, targeted investments. The United States will continue to advance
global health priorities and build upon existing efforts aligned to the
following four pillars of focus under the Global Health Worker
Initiative:  
  
**PROTECTING HEALTH WORKERS**  
  
Through global health programs, the U.S Government will advance work to
ensure health workers across facilities and communities have prioritized
access to vaccinations \[and treatment\], personal protective equipment
(PPE), and services to support their physical and mental health and
well-being and better protection and safeguards from violence and
attacks on health facilities, including in conflict and humanitarian
settings.   

-   **Accelerate coordinated efforts to protect health workers fighting
    COVID-19.** The COVID-19 Global Action Plan (GAP), announced by
    Secretary Blinken on February 14, 2022, has six lines of effort to
    help end the acute phase of the pandemic, including a dedicated
    effort specifically to support health workers. The GAP aims to
    galvanize partner countries and international organizations to
    decrease risks posed by COVID-19 by increasing vaccine and treatment
    availability, encouraging vaccine uptake, addressing workplace
    safety, and health worker training.    
-   **Provide tools and resources for health workers responding to
    COVID-19 while ensuring delivery of primary health
    services.** Ongoing U.S. Government programming is adapting to
    account for the pandemic. For example, PMI trains health workers to
    efficiently and effectively diagnose and treat malaria in the
    context of COVID-19, including educating patients to avoid risk of
    transmission and where to access COVID-19 and malaria treatment
    services.  PEPFAR-funded health workers have ensured delivery of
    essential HIV prevention and treatment services while responding to
    the pandemic, by leveraging over 100,000 health workers to support
    COVID-19 needs across more than 40 countries. PEPFAR is also focused
    on reducing the risk of health worker burnout and longer-term mental
    health effects by providing support, including time off for
    self-care, recuperation, and family’s needs; and advancing access to
    mental health services. Additionally, the U.S. Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention (CDC), at the Department of Health and Human
    Services (HHS), is working to improve local and regional healthcare
    personnel safety and infection prevention and control in more than
    15 countries across four continents. These efforts involve
    healthcare worker surveillance to quickly detect infections;
    facility-based comprehensive safety assessments and quality
    improvement initiatives; infectious disease detection and response;
    training, supervision, and regional communities of practice; and
    technical engagement with Ministries of Health to ensure
    implementation consistent with global norms.    
-   **Supporting health workers in conflict settings.** In Ukraine,
    USAID is supporting the Ministry of Health and National Health
    Service of Ukraine to develop an incentive system to attract,
    retain, and equitably distribute health care workers in war-impacted
    regions, using both financial and non-financial incentives so that
    local authorities will be better able to hire health care workers to
    fill critical shortages.  To address the significant mental health
    strains of COVID-19 and the subsequent Russian invasion, USAID is
    also supporting the scale-up of mental health counseling services
    for conflict-affected populations, including health workers.

**  
EXPAND THE GLOBAL HEALTH WORKFORCE AND ACCELERATE ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT**  
  
The U.S Government will continue efforts to create career pathways and
expand paid employment opportunities for a more diverse and gender
equitable workforce in the public and private health sectors, better
equipping healthcare and community health workers, to meet local
population health needs including provision of patient-centered services
at the primary health care level. These efforts will further build local
and regional institutional capacity to manage and support a global
health workforce that is adequately prepared and aligned to respond to
routine and emergency surge capacity needs. 

-   **Promote fair and timely pay for all health workers.** Through our
    global health programs, including PEPFAR and PMI, we will continue
    to promote fair and timely compensation for health workers.  PEPFAR
    will continue to align its financial support for over 330,000 health
    workers, a $1 billion annual investment, helping achieve HIV
    epidemic control in over 40 countries. Similarly, PMI recently
    updated their policies to allow the use of PMI funds to provide
    salaries or stipends to community health workers in settings where
    payment to them is in line with government policy.   
-   **Develop a multidisciplinary Global Health Security
    workforce.** Achieving global health security requires a
    multi-sectoral approach that incorporates an understanding of the
    linkages among human, animal, and environmental health– a “One
    Health” approach. As part of the U.S. Government’s Global Health
    Security programs, USAID is investing up to $85 million over five
    years to create a “next generation” health workforce. In 2021, USAID
    worked with more than 110 universities in 17 countries across Africa
    and Southeast Asia to train more than 18,000 current and future
    health workers for more effective disease surveillance and control.
    CDC has partnered with five leading international organizations to
    develop the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme (GLLP).  The GLLP
    is a comprehensive One Health-based training program for human and
    animal health laboratories. The GLLP is currently implemented in
    over 20 countries in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the Middle
    East. In addition, the CDC Field Epidemiology Training Program
    (FETP) is recognized worldwide as an effective means to strengthen
    countries’ capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health
    threats through enhanced surveillance, epidemiology, and outbreak
    response functions. CDC works with partner countries to establish
    FETPs and to train epidemiologists across all levels of a country’s
    health system. To date, FETP has been implemented in more than 80
    countries around the globe with more than 20,000 graduates with many
    FETP graduates becoming leaders and managers in  Ministries of
    Health or national public health institutes.  These activities
    accelerate progress of the United States Global Health Security
    Strategy, and will continue to help our partners build country-level
    capacities in line with their World Health Organization  Joint
    External Evaluations, National Action Plans for Health Security, and
    other tools the strengthen compliance with the International Health
    Regulations (IHR 2005).  
-   **Collaborate with local partners and country governments to build a
    sustainable health workforce.** As part of localization efforts,
    USAID is advancing work with local partners to strengthen human
    resources planning, management, and oversight to overcome health
    worker shortfalls. Increasing direct partnerships with host country
    government entities is essential to improving sustainability of
    health systems. For example, USAID, through a $10 million
    Government-to-Government (G2G) investment, is working with the
    Government of Malawi to fill critical health workforce financing
    gaps and strengthen health systems.  Part of the Malawi G2G
    programming agreement includes a phased transition of these health
    workforces to Malawi Government financing, with immediate provision
    of critical health services while building systems to sustain those
    health workers beyond USAID funding.  
     
-   **Optimize the health workers to support global COVID-19 vaccination
    efforts.** The Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), a
    whole-of-government effort to turn vaccines in vials into
    vaccinations in arms around the world, builds on existing U.S.
    Government efforts with total cumulative commitments of more than
    $1.7 billion, helping over 100 countries prepare to receive and
    administer COVID-19 vaccines with surge funding and support to 11
    countries (Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Nigeria,
    Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). Through Global
    VAX, the U.S. Government is providing financial and technical
    assistance to engage and train additional health workers for
    vaccination efforts, including vaccine delivery, community
    engagement, record keeping, local micro-planning, and cold chain
    maintenance. 

**ADVANCE EQUITY AND INCLUSION**  
  
President Biden’s commitment to advancing equity and inclusion goes
beyond our borders. The U.S Government will carry forward his commitment
globally to address numerous barriers, including gender, ethnic/racial,
geographic, age, and others, particularly among the community health
workforce, to build a more diverse cohort of health worker graduates and
leaders that reflects inclusivity, is better-equipped to serve local
populations and provide patient-centered care including at the primary
health care level.

-   **Addressing the gender gap.** Recognizing that women represent 70
    percent of the global health workforce, the U.S. Government is
    increasing waged employment opportunities and leadership
    opportunities for women in the health workforce in alignment with
    the U.S. Government’s first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity
    and Equality with commitment to advance the full participation of
    all people- including women and girls- in the United States and
    around the world,  focus on building the global care economy and
    care infrastructure, and improve economic security and accelerate
    economic growth. This includes USAID’s development of recruitment
    strategies for employment of at-risk, vulnerable youth and women;
    partnership with the private sector; and supporting the
    professionalization of community health workers.  PEPFAR has
    invested more than $1.3 billion supporting nearly 2.5 million
    adolescent girls and young women through the Determined, Resilient,
    Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe (DREAMS) program in the last
    five years. The partnership supports adolescent girls and young
    women with socioeconomic opportunities, including employment in the
    health sector, as part of efforts aimed at reducing rates of HIV
    among adolescent girls and young women in the highest HIV burden
    countries.  
-   **Health workers reflect the populations they serve**. It is
    critical that countries recruit and retain a diverse health
    workforce to help meet the needs of those populations.  PEPFAR has
    partnered with Historically Black Colleges and Universities through
    Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), at HHS, to
    provide opportunities for adolescent girls and young women, who are
    at high risk for early sexual debut and HIV, to receive training as
    community health workers and be employed to provide essential health
    services to their home communities in areas where there are critical
    shortages of health care workers. This work has started in Malawi.  
-   **Diversifying the global health research workforce.** The National
    Institutes of Health (NIH), part of HHS, is the largest funder of
    health research in the world, and is building an inclusive, diverse,
    and global scientific workforce conducting research in Federal
    government laboratories. In addition, the NIH Fogarty International
    Center (FIC) has an exclusive international mission and
    responsibility for foreign research coordination that includes a
    focus on building research capacity in low- and middle-income
    countries (LMICs) by providing training and research support through
    a variety of programs to address emerging global health needs. Much
    of FIC’s resources are dedicated to building research capacity in
    LMICs.  Since 1989, more than 7,500 individuals from over 130
    countries have trained through FIC programs.  
-   **Reaching rural and remote populations**. Across the globe, Peace
    Corps staff and Volunteers continue to work alongside existing
    health service providers and community health workers in difficult
    to reach rural and “last mile” communities and provide training of
    health workers to support vaccination, community engagement, disease
    prevention measures, surveillance activities, referral facilitation,
    and social and behavioral change to promote delivery of improved
    quality health services delivery.  

**DRIVE AND INVEST IN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AND INNOVATION**  
  
The U.S Government will further harness innovation and expand digital
technologies that equip health workers with the ability to provide more
efficient, quality-integrated service delivery, including telehealth
services that can extend the reach of health services from facilities
and into communities, including the most marginalized populations. The
use of digital platforms will be expanded to improve the availability
and routine use of quality health workforce data to inform decisions
about workforce planning and operations, including performance
management and consistent remuneration, and also expand the use of
digital tools. 

-   **Digital health as a tool to advance primary health care.** USAID’s
    Vision for Action in Digital Health and Vision for Health System
    Strengthening 2030 together lay out a plan for how USAID can
    increase the responsible use of digital technologies to accelerate
    programming in the health sector in strategic coordination with
    partner countries. USAID is investing in integrated digital
    platforms to advance patient-centered care and support front-line
    health workers. Current investments include working to advance
    broad-based functionality and guide improvement of standardized
    digital health tools and systems used to support health workers in
    providing a set of essential patient-centered primary health care
    services.   
-   **Digital systems provide real time data to health workers. **PMI
    supports digital tools in partner countries to equip health workers
    with real-time data. PMI improves evidence-based decision making by
    strengthening data collection, management, analysis, and utilization
    at all levels of the health care delivery system. PMI has invested
    $8.5 million in Rwanda, Senegal, and Burkina Faso to strengthen
    integrated and equitable care by equipping community health workers
    with tools needed to be better-connected to other health workers,
    bring care to unreached populations, and improve access to near
    real-time data.  
-   **Technology to support data for decision making. ** PEPFAR invests
    nearly $22 million annually to support the development and use of
    human resource information systems and digital health platforms.
    These investments provide data for better understanding of the
    available health workforce and health worker utilization and an
    additional modality to ensure continuity of safe provision of
    services. These investments proved invaluable during the COVID-19
    pandemic with the employment of modified service delivery models
    including telehealth service.
