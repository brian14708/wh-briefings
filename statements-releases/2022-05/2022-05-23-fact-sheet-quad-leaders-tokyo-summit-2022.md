title: "FACT SHEET: Quad Leaders\u2019 Tokyo Summit\_2022"
---
 
*In Tokyo, President Biden, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of
Australia, Prime Minister Modi of India, and Prime Minister Kishida of
Japan will advance the Quad’s ambitious and diverse agenda, including
through a major new initiative to improve maritime domain awareness
across the Indo-Pacific.*

The leaders of the Quad nations—Australia, India, Japan, and the United
States—will meet on May 24, 2022 in Tokyo for the fourth time and the
second time in person. Established in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean
Tsunami to coordinate humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the
Quad has since become a leading regional partnership dedicated to
advancing a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific through
practical cooperation on diverse 21<sup>st</sup>-century challenges.
With six leader-level working groups—on COVID-19 Response and Global
Health Security, Climate, Critical and Emerging Technologies, Cyber,
Space, and Infrastructure—the Quad is building habits of cooperation
among our four countries that will support a more peaceful and
prosperous Indo-Pacific. President Biden and his fellow Quad leaders
welcome the following announcements from the Tokyo Summit:  
  
**The Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness  **  
  
At the Tokyo Summit, the Quad leaders will welcome a major maritime
initiative: **the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness
(IPMDA).** In close consultations with regional partners, IPMDA will
offer a near-real-time, integrated, and cost-effective maritime domain
awareness picture. This initiative will transform the ability of
partners in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean
region to fully monitor the waters on their shores and, in turn, to
uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific. Quad countries are committed to
contributing to the region’s maritime domain awareness—a fundamental
requirement for peace, stability, and prosperity—through an investment
in IPMDA over five years. The partnership will innovate upon existing
maritime domain awareness efforts, rapidly bringing emerging
technologies to bear for the greater good of the Indo-Pacific
community.  

-   IPMDA will build a **faster, wider, and more accurate maritime
    picture** of near-real-time activities in partners’ waters. This
    common operating picture will integrate three critical regions—**the
    Pacific Islands**, **Southeast Asia**, and **the Indian Ocean
    region**—in the Indo-Pacific. The benefits of this picture are vast:
    it will allow tracking of “dark shipping” and other tactical-level
    activities, such as rendezvous at sea, as well as improve partners’
    ability to respond to climate and humanitarian events and to protect
    their fisheries, which are vital to many Indo-Pacific economies.
    IPMDA will do so by:  
      
    **Harnessing commercially-available data** **using existing
    technologies**. Through a combination of Automatic Identification
    System and radio-frequency technologies, Quad partners can provide
    an unprecedented “common thread” of activities. Because of its
    commercial origin, this data will be unclassified, allowing the Quad
    to provide it to a wide range of partners who wish to benefit.  
      
    **Extending support for information-sharing across existing regional
    fusion centers**, such as the Information Fusion Center-Indian Ocean
    Region, based in India; the Information Fusion Center, based in
    Singapore; the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, based in the
    Solomon Islands, and the Pacific Fusion Center, based in Vanuatu,
    both of which receive support from Australia.  
-   Quad partners will begin immediate consultations on this opportunity
    with partners in the region. As the initiative proceeds, the Quad
    will identify future technologies of promise, allowing IPMDA to
    remain a cutting-edge partnership that promotes peace and stability
    throughout the region. 

**The Quad Fellowship**  
  
Quad leaders are proud to open applications for the **Quad Fellowship**,
which will sponsor 100 American, Australian, Indian, and Japanese
students to study in the United States each year for graduate degrees in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The
Quad Fellowship empowers exceptional STEM graduate students to advance
research and innovation throughout their careers with a lens of positive
social impact. It does so by providing scholarships, immersive and
inspiring events at the nexus of STEM and society, mentorship and
career-advancing programming, and cross-cultural exchange opportunities.

-   The Quad Fellowship **application** [**is
    live**](http://www.quadfellowship.org/apply) and will remain open
    until June 30, 2022. The first class of Quad Fellows will arrive on
    campus in autumn 2023.

**The Quad Vaccine Partnership and Global Health Security**  
  
The Quad is committed to maintaining its global leadership in responding
to the COVID-19 pandemic and bolstering global health security. To date,
Quad partners have collectively provided 257 million safe and effective
doses to the Indo-Pacific. Even as we continue to donate vaccines, we
will adapt our collective approaches to and prepare for new variants,
including by getting vaccines, tests, treatments, and other medical
products to those at highest risk.

-   The United States will provide **COVID-19 boosters and pediatric
    doses** to countries of greatest need, including in the
    Indo-Pacific.  
-   The **Biological E, Ltd facility in India** will continue to use
    expanded vaccine-manufacturing capacity as part of the Quad Vaccine
    Partnership. Our support is building sustainable manufacturing
    capacity, including for booster shots, which will yield long-term
    benefit in the fight against COVID-19 and future pandemics.   
-   The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and EXIM India
    decided to support a **$100 million facility**, which will bolster
    the Indian health care sector, including global capacity for
    COVID-19 countermeasures.

**Climate**  
  
The climate crisis is existential for each of our countries and for the
Indo-Pacific. The Pacific Islands are particularly vulnerable; as the
Pacific Island Forum’s Boe Declaration on Regional Security
[states](https://www.forumsec.org/2018/09/05/boe-declaration-on-regional-security/),
“climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods,
security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific.” After
inaugurating a **Climate Working Group** at our first-ever leader
summit, in March 2021, our four countries have meaningfully deepened and
regularized our cooperation on meeting the climate crisis. The Quad
leaders will launch further efforts on green shipping, energy supply
chains, disaster risk reduction, and the exchange of climate information
services.

-   The Quad will broaden and elevate our work to combat climate change
    by inaugurating two ministerials in the coming months. U.S.
    Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg plans to convene **Quad
    Transportation Ministers** and relevant stakeholders to accelerate
    the work of the Shipping Task Force, including progress toward
    developing Green Shipping Corridors among Quad countries. U.S.
    Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm plans to meet with **Quad
    Energy Ministers** to catalyze Quad efforts to deploy clean
    hydrogen, minimize methane emissions, and develop a 10-Year Clean
    Energy Supply Chain Plan.  
-   The Quad will cooperate on disaster risk reduction for extreme
    weather events, including through the **Coalition for Disaster
    Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)**, building on the Quad’s joint
    session on strengthening Indo-Pacific infrastructure and communities
    at the International CDRI conference.  
-   The **Quad Climate and Information Service Task Force**, dedicated
    to integrating and facilitating climate information services to the
    broader Indo-Pacific, will convene other Indo-Pacific countries at
    the September Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk
    Reduction in Brisbane, to share best practices and gauge user needs
    in the region.  
-   The Quad will advance the development of **clean hydrogen** and
    **clean ammonia** **fuels** and launch a series of roundtables on
    mitigating methane emissions across our liquified natural gas (LNG)
    sectors. The Quad will also cooperate to enhance capacity in the
    broader Indo-Pacific region to participate in high-integrity carbon
    markets.

**Critical and Emerging Technologies**  
  
Our four countries are committed to responsible innovation in critical
and emerging technologies. Since launching the **Critical and Emerging
Technologies Working Group** at the first-ever leader-level summit of
the Quad, in March 2021, Quad partners have mapped collective capacity
and vulnerabilities in global semiconductor supply chains, and launched
the *Common Statement of Principles on Critical Technology Supply
Chains*, which will provide a cooperative foundation for enhancing
supply-chain resilience in the region. At the same time, Quad partners
are exploring ways to collaborate on the deployment of open and secure
telecommunications technologies in the region, working with industry
through Open RAN Track 1.5 dialogues. 

-   Through a new **Memorandum of Cooperation on 5G Supplier
    Diversification and Open RAN**, the Quad will cooperate on technical
    exchanges and testbed activity to advance interoperability and
    telecommunications cybersecurity.  
-   The Quad has advanced technical-standards cooperation through the
    International Telecommunication Union’s Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector and will redouble its efforts through the new
    **International Standards Cooperation Network**, a mechanism for
    like-minded allies and partners to share information on
    technical-standards activities and to increase situational
    awareness, coordination, and influence in international critical and
    emerging technologies standards.  
-   To unlock opportunities in critical and emerging technologies
    through stronger engagement with the private sector, the Quad will
    convene industry partners to discuss business and investment issues.
    A **Quad Investors Network**, an independent consortium of investors
    that seeks to advance access to capital for critical and emerging
    technologies within and across the Quad, is being launched today.

**Cybersecurity**  
  
The **Quad Cybersecurity Partnership** seeks to build resilience across
our four countries in response to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and
cyber threats. Its areas of focus are critical-infrastructure
protection, led by Australia; supply-chain resilience and security, led
by India; workforce development and talent, led by Japan; and software
security standards, led by the United States. Its work is guided by
**new joint cyber principles** to improve cyber resilience in a rapidly
changing threat environment. These principles aim to prevent cyber
incidents, prepare national and international capabilities for potential
cyber incidents, and/or respond quickly and effectively to a cyber
incident, when or should one occur.

-   The Quad will strengthen information-sharing among Quad country
    **Computer Emergency Response Teams** (CERT), including exchanges on
    lessons learned and best practices.  
-   The Quad will improve software and Managed Service Provider (MSP)
    security by coordinating **cybersecurity standards** for Quad
    governments’ procurement of software.  
-   Quad partners will launch a **Cybersecurity Day campaign**, open to
    countries across the Indo-Pacific and beyond, as part of our
    continuing efforts to strengthen cybersecurity awareness and action.
    This program will provide basic cybersecurity information and
    training to the most vulnerable sectors of our countries and
    regions, including schoolchildren, small businesses, and the
    elderly. Quad partners will lead this campaign in partnership with
    industry, non-profits, academia, and communities to maximize its
    effectiveness and reach.

**Space**  
  
As leaders in space, Quad countries are strengthening cooperation and
pooling our collective expertise to exchange satellite data, enable
capacity-building, and consult on norms and guidelines.

-   Quad partners will strengthen their commitments to the free, full,
    and open **sharing of space-based civil Earth observation data,**
    and will jointly develop and promote the concept of Open Science in
    the region and globally.  
-   The United States will coordinate with Quad partners on its
    **cooperative civil Earth observation programs,** to include the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GLOBE and
    DEVELOP programs; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA) Community Satellite Processing Package (CSPP)
    and Satellite Proving Ground Flood Mapping Portal; as well as the
    U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Land Imaging Program.   
-   As extreme weather events become ever more common in the
    Indo-Pacific, Quad partners will convene technical experts to drive
    new cooperation and set the stage for additional **disaster
    mitigation** and **humanitarian assistance and disaster relief**
    workshops or training among Quad partners.   
-   The Quad partners intend to host a two-day workshop on
    implementation of the **Long-Term Sustainability (LTS) Guidelines
    for Indo-Pacific** countries focused on LTS implementation and on
    how LTS implementation can lead to positive changes in domestic
    policy, regulations, and outcomes.

**Infrastructure**  
  
To help meet the Indo-Pacific’s enormous infrastructure needs, Quad
leaders launched the **Quad Infrastructure Coordination Group**, which
will deepen collaboration and pursue complementary actions, including in
digital connectivity, transportation infrastructure, clean energy and
climate resilience.

-   In Tokyo, the Quad’s respective heads of development-financing
    agencies met to discuss enhanced engagement to address the
    infrastructure-financing gap in the region. This high-level
    effort—which includes Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and
    Trade and Export Finance Australia; India’s EXIM; Japan Bank for
    International Cooperation; and the U.S. International Development
    Finance Corporation—will coordinate our strategic approaches, among
    our countries and with the private sector, to leverage
    solutions-oriented tools that support investments in critical
    sectors such as healthcare, clean energy and climate, digital
    connectivity, sustainable infrastructure, and supply chains.

**Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief**  
  
The Quad was forged in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. In
recognition of that history and of present-day threats, the Quad
established a new humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR)
mechanism.  

-   Through the **Quad Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Mechanism**,
    Quad partners will be able to coordinate and mobilize our
    civilian-led disaster assistance efforts, with support from civil
    defense and military assets when needed, to respond to disasters in
    the Indo-Pacific. The Partnership provides a framework for Quad
    partners to coordinate on joint disaster responses and develop a
    greater understanding of their respective HADR operations. Quad
    partners may provide joint or coordinated assistance as requested by
    an affected state in the crisis-alert, crisis-response, or
    post-crisis-review phases of a disaster. Quad partners will also be
    able to work together to improve crisis preparedness and early
    warning.
