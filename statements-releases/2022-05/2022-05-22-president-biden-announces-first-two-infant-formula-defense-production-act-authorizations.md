title: "President\_Biden Announces First Two Infant Formula Defense Production Act\_\
  Authorizations"

***Secretary Becerra Authorized Priority Orders of Input for Infant
Formula***

The President is announcing the first two Defense Production Act (DPA)
authorizations for infant formula. U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary Xavier Becerra authorized the first two infant
formula priority orders today. The two infant formula manufacturers can
now begin to add legally binding language to their orders with suppliers
that will give them priority over other customers. Last week, the
President invoked the DPA to ensure that manufacturers have the
necessary ingredients to make safe, health infant formula here at home.

Earlier today, the President announced the second Operation Fly Formula
flight had been sourced for later this week. The flight will transport
114 pallets of Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA infant formula. This is
the remainder of the equivalent of up to 1.5 million 8-ounce bottles of
three formulas—Alfamino® Infant, Alfamino® Junior, and Gerber Good
Start® Extensive HA—all of which are hypoallergenic formulas for
children with cow’s milk protein allergy. The first tranche of this
shipment arrived in the United States on DOD aircraft earlier today.
These formulas have been prioritized because they serve a critical
medical purpose and are in short supply in the United States because of
the Abbott Sturgis plant closure.

Today’s infant formula priority orders are:

-   **Abbott Nutrition** can now receive priority orders of raw
    materials like sugar and corn syrup for infant formula. Constraints
    in global  supply chain for these materials mean that Abbott’s
    allotment/allocation of these materials have been limited to 75
    percent of its normal amount. By allowing Abbott to receive its full
    allotment of needed raw materials, it will be able to quickly
    increase production by one third over where it stands today.

<!-- -->

-   **Reckitt** (which owns Mead-Johnson) can now receive priority
    orders of consumables like single-use products like filters
    necessary to generate certain oils needed to produce infant formula.
    This will also allow Reckitt facilities to operate at maximum
    capacity.

The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to identify opportunities
to invoke the Defense Production Act and further increase infant formula
production to maximum capacity. The Biden-Harris Administration has been
working around the clock to increase production of infant formula and
keep store shelves stocked during the Abbott Nutrition voluntary recall.
