title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting\
  \ with Marc and Debra\_Tice"
---
 
President Biden met today with Marc and Debra Tice, the parents of
Austin Tice, who has spent almost a decade in captivity in Syria. During
their meeting, the President reiterated his commitment to continue to
work through all available avenues to secure Austin’s long overdue
return to his family. The President further emphasized that his
Administration will work relentlessly until Austin and other Americans
held hostage and wrongfully detained worldwide are safely at home with
their loved ones.

Today’s meeting built on multiple meetings and conversations between the
Tice family and the President’s national security team, which will
remain in regular contact with the Tices and other families of Americans
held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. We appreciate the bravery
and candor of families enduring these harrowing experiences, and we
remain committed to supporting them and, most importantly, reuniting
them with their loved ones.
