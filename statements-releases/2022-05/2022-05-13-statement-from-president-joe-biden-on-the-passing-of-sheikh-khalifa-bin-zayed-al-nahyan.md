title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed\_\
  Al\_Nahyan"

Jill and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of
His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan.  Sheikh Khalifa was a
true partner and friend of the United States throughout his decades-long
tenure as President of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Abu Dhabi,
and in his earlier role as Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.  On behalf of the
American people, I offer my condolences to Sheikh Khalifa’s family and
all Emiratis as they mourn this great loss. We will honor his memory by
continuing to strengthen the longstanding ties between the governments
and people of the United States and the United Arab Emirates.
