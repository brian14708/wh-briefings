National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met yesterday with Prime
Minister Albin Kurti of Kosovo. Mr. Sullivan thanked the Prime Minister
for Kosovo’s willingness to host Afghan evacuees. They exchanged views
on Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, including Kosovo’s
provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine and
imposition of sanctions against Russia. They also discussed stability in
the Western Balkans, with Mr. Sullivan expressing U.S. support for the
EU-facilitated Dialogue to reach a comprehensive normalization agreement
between Kosovo and Serbia and the need for further progress on key
outstanding issues. Mr. Sullivan welcomed plans by Kosovo to transition
away from its dependence on lignite coal to cleaner energy and to ensure
a stable supply of electricity.
