  \ Liaison Erika Moritsugu on the Passage of Legislation to Create a Pathway to Establish\
  \ the First National Asian Pacific American History and Culture\_Museum"

Today’s passage of the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a
National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture Act, is a
moment of great joy for our community and a wonderful addition to our
celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AA
and NHPI) Heritage Month. President Biden has made clear that the
diversity of cultures within the AA and NHPI community has strengthened
the fabric of our nation and today we are one step closer to creating a
physical place and a forum for AA and NHPI’s to see themselves
recognized as part of the American story. We thank leaders in the House
and Senate for getting this bill done, and the President looks forward
to signing it into law.
