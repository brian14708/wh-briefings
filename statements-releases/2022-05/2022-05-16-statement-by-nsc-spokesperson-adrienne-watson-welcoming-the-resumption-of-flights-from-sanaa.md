title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson Welcoming the Resumption of\
  \ Flights from\_Sana\u2019a"
---
 
The United States welcomes the resumption of direct flights between
Sana’a, Yemen and Amman, Jordan.  These are the first commercial flights
from Sana’a since 2016, and they demonstrate the ongoing benefits for
the Yemeni people from the UN-brokered truce that went into effect
nearly six weeks ago.  Yemen today is witnessing its calmest period
since the war began, and these flights are an important step in further
improving the lives and opportunities for the Yemeni people.  The United
States thanks Saudi Arabia for its leadership in helping to overcome
obstacles to the resumption of these flights.  We also thank the
Government of Jordan and the Republic of Yemen Government’s efforts in
finalizing the arrangements for what should be the first of regular
flights between these destinations.  The United States, led by the
efforts of Special Envoy Tim Lenderking, supports continued diplomatic
engagement between the parties and UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg’s
efforts to further improve freedom of movement inside Yemen, including
by opening roads in Taiz and other areas.  The United States remains
committed to supporting Yemen’s sovereignty, stability, security, and
prosperity through an inclusive, UN-led political process to assist the
Yemeni people in determining their country’s future.
