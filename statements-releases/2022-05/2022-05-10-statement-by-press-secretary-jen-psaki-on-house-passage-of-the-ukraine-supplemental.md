title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on House Passage of the Ukraine\_\
  Supplemental"
---
 
The House took a critical step today in sending a clear, bipartisan
message to Ukraine, to Russia, and to the world that the United States
stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy against
Russian aggression. We thank House leadership and members of the
Appropriations committee for working across the aisle to get this done,
and appreciate the strong bipartisan support for the President’s
proposal to provide much needed security, economic, humanitarian, and
food assistance to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world. 

Our assistance to date, together with the contributions of our Allies
and partners, has been critical in helping Ukrainians win the battle for
Kyiv and defend their freedoms. The additional resources included in
this bill will allow us to send more weapons, such as artillery, armored
vehicles, and ammunition, to Ukraine. And they will help us replenish
our stockpile and support U.S. troops on NATO territory. 

As the President said yesterday, we cannot afford any delay in this
vital effort. We look forward to continuing to work with Senate
leadership to get this bill to the President’s desk quickly and keep
assistance flowing to Ukraine without interruption.
