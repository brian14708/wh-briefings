title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Legislative Leaders on Reproductive\_\
  Rights"
---
 
Today, White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein and
White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Chavez Rodriguez
chaired a meeting with state legislative leaders on protecting access to
reproductive health care. This important discussion follows the passage
of proactive reproductive rights measures in at least 10 states so far
in the 2022 legislative session, including in California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon,
and Washington. These actions to protect and expand access to
reproductive health care stand in sharp contrast to a wave of abortion
bans and restrictions that have passed in states across the country.

State legislative leaders shared the steps they have taken so far to
protect access to abortion, as well as plans to further expand care, and
discussed ways the Administration can support state and local
efforts.Â Senior White House officials thanked the leaders for their
efforts and underscored their support for state action to strengthen
reproductive rights.

State legislative leaders included:

-   California Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins
-   California Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan
-   Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff
-   Illinois Senate President Don Harmon
-   Illinois Representative Anna Moeller
-   Illinois Senator Celina Villanueva
-   Illinois Senator Julie Morrison
-   Maryland Delegate Ariana Kelly
-   New York Senator Liz Krueger
-   Oregon Senate Majority Leader Rob Wagner
-   Oregon House Majority Leader Julie Fahey
-   Oregon Representative Andrea Valderrama
-   Oregon Senator Deb Patterson
-   Washington President Pro Tempore Karen Keiser
