title: "The Biden-\u2060Harris Inflation Plan:\_Lowering Costs and Lowering the\_\
  Deficit"
---
 
The United States is in a stronger economic position than any other
major advanced economy in the world. At the same time, inflation is too
high and is putting a strain on working families. The President’s top
economic priority is tackling inflation and reducing costs for American
families – so we can sustain this historic economic recovery in a way
that benefits all Americans.

President Biden has a plan to tackle inflation – by lowering costs that
families face and lowering the federal deficit by asking the large
corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share.
Congressional Republicans, led by Senator Rick Scott, have called for a
new minimum tax on the middle class – firefighters and teachers – that
would mean an average of almost $1,500 less in families’ pockets each
year. And, while part of President Biden’s plan to lower costs is to
strengthen Medicare by giving it the power to negotiate prescription
drug prices, the Congressional Republican plan would put Medicare – in
addition to Social Security, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and other
critical programs for American families – on the chopping block every
five years.

The President understands that the Federal Reserve is the institution
that plays a primary role in fighting inflation. The President has
nominated highly qualified individuals to lead the Fed, and is urging
the Senate to confirm all these individuals without delay. Beyond the
Federal Reserve, President Biden is taking short-, medium-, and
long-term actions to lower costs for families and lower the deficit:

***<span style="text-decoration: underline"><u>Lowering the Cost of Gas
and Energy and Achieving Energy
Independence</u>:</span>*** Congressional Republicans have put forward
no real plan to lower energy costs. While they point fingers, the
President is taking action:

-   **<u>Blunting the Impact of Putin’s Price Hike:</u>** Addressing
    Putin’s price hike at the pump by releasing 1 million barrels of oil
    per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next 6 months;
    rallying our allies to release an additional 60 million barrels of
    oil from other countries’ reserves; allowing E15 gasoline (which
    uses homegrown biofuels) to be sold this summer; and calling on
    Congress to make companies pay fees on idled wells and non-producing
    acres on Federal lands – so that companies that continue to sit on
    excess capacity will have to choose whether to start producing or
    pay a fee.
-   **<u>Lowering Energy Bills:</u>** Calling on Congress to pass clean
    energy and vehicle tax credits and investments that will reduce our
    dependence on reckless autocrats like Putin, save families an
    estimated $500 per year on their utility bills, and accelerate
    homegrown clean energy innovation – from producing more clean energy
    to bolstering our domestic supply chains that are critical for clean
    energy and clean transportation.
-   **<u>Building Real Energy Independence:</u>** Advancing the
    strongest ever fuel economy standards for cars and trucks to enable
    drivers to go farther on every gallon, while increasing options for
    families to make the switch to electric cars via historic investment
    in charging infrastructure and collaboration with autoworkers and
    automakers to set America on course to ensure one of every two cars
    sold in 2030 burns no fossil fuels.

***<u>Lowering Other Everyday Costs for American Families:</u>*** The
Congressional Republican plan would increase 75 million middle-class
families’ taxes by an average of nearly $1,500 this year alone, and
raise taxes on nearly half of small business owners, including 82
percent of those making less than $50,000 per year. President Biden
believes that instead of taking money out of middle-class families’
pockets, we should lower their costs, including in the following areas:

-   **<span style="text-decoration: underline">Lowering Prescription
    Drug and Health Care Costs:</span> **Saving hundreds of thousands of
    families hundreds of dollars per month by fixing the Affordable Care
    Act’s “family glitch,” which has made it impossible for many
    families to use the premium tax credit to purchase an affordable,
    high quality Marketplace plan; and calling on Congress to lower
    prescription drug costs and health care premiums, including allowing
    Medicare to negotiate drug prices, capping insulin costs, penalizing
    drug companies that raise prices faster than inflation, and making
    other needed reforms to lower prices.
-   **<u>Lowering Food Prices by Helping American Farmers Grow More, and
    Compete More Effectively</u>**<span
    style="text-decoration: underline">:</span> Calling for resources to
    help American farmers boost domestic food production in order to
    avert a potential global food crisis created by Russia’s unprovoked
    invasion of Ukraine; taking actions to crack down on illegal price
    fixing and enforce the antitrust laws in the meat and poultry
    processing sector; investing federal resources to create more
    competition in meat-processing; and providing over one billion
    dollars in relief to small businesses and agricultural workers hurt
    by COVID-19.
-   **<u>Lowering the Cost of Everyday Goods By Repairing Our
    Infrastructure, Supply Chains, and Manufacturing:</u>** Bringing
    together business, labor, federal and state governments to address
    supply chain bottlenecks at ports; helping more workers find
    good-paying jobs in the trucking industry; taking on unfair
    practices by global shipping companies; implementing the historic
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will mean goods move to market
    more quickly and cheaper; and fostering new investments in the
    United States for critical goods that drove up inflation during the
    pandemic, including by calling on Congress to pass the Bipartisan
    Innovation Act. 
-   **<u>Lowering the Cost of Child Care and Long-Term Care</u>**<span
    style="text-decoration: underline">**:**</span> Calling on Congress
    to invest in lowering the cost of child care and long-term care,
    saving families thousands of dollars per year. Child care is one of
    the biggest costs that families with young children face, and care
    investments will lower prices across the economy over time by making
    it easier for parents and others with care responsibilities to join
    the workforce and be more productive.
-   **<u>Lowering Housing Costs by Building More Homes</u><span
    style="text-decoration: underline">:</span> **Calling on Congress to
    invest in building more than 1 million affordable homes, including
    through a set of tax credits that have received bipartisan support;
    expanding and improving federal financing for the construction of
    new housing; and using existing federal funding to reward
    communities that eliminate needless barriers that prevent new
    housing from being built.

***<u>Reducing the Deficit by Asking Large Corporations and the
Wealthiest Americans to Pay Their Fair Share:</u>*** While the federal
budget deficit increased every year under President Trump – in part due
to a reckless and unpaid for $2 trillion tax cut benefitting the
wealthiest Americans and largest corporations –the deficit fell by $350
billion in President Biden’s first year in office because he prioritized
rebuilding the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And the
deficit is now on track to fall by another $1.5 trillion this year. This
matters to families because one of the main ways Congress and the
executive branch can act to lower price pressures is to reduce the
federal budget deficit. President Biden’s plan will make the wealthiest
Americans and largest corporations pay their fair share, including
through a new Billionaires’ Minimum Income Tax. By enacting reforms to
make corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share,
Congress can lower the deficit even more, while also lowering costs for
families.
