title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Issues Call for State and Local Leaders to Dedicate\
  \ More American Rescue Plan Funding to Make Our Communities Safer \u2013 And Deploy\
  \ These Dollars\_Quickly"
---
 
*President Biden also highlights $10 billion in American Rescue Plan
funding already committed to public safety and violence prevention and
praises those states, cities, and rural counties that have answered his
call to action.*

President Biden believes that Americans deserve to feel safe no matter
where they live, and he is committed to using every tool at his disposal
to fight violent crime. As the cornerstone of the [comprehensive gun
crime reduction
agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/) he
issued in June 2021, President Biden called on cities and states to
dedicate American Recue Plan state and local funding to proven
strategies that will make our communities safer – including by putting
more police officers on the beat for accountable community policing,
expanding evidence-based community violence intervention programs, and
preventing crime by making our neighborhoods stronger with more
educational and economic opportunities.  
  
Today, President Biden is announcing that $10 billion in American Rescue
Plan funds have been committed to public safety – including at least
$6.5 billion in State and Local funds committed by more than half of
states and more than 300 communities across the country, who have
answered the President’s call. Along with ongoing state and local
support from the Justice Department, American Rescue Plan investments
made 2021 among the largest single-year commitments of federal resources
for state and local law enforcement and public safety on record.  
  
This American Rescue Plan funding has been a vital lifeline to
communities around the country, who have been able to invest in public
safety at a time of tremendous state, local, and county budget
uncertainty because of the pandemic. Before the American Rescue Plan
passed, the Menino Survey found that 27% of mayors anticipated making
significant cuts to their police budgets and services.   
  
The American Rescue Plan has enabled these mayors and other state and
local leaders to shore up their budgets and invest in public safety.
Unfortunately, every Republican in Congress voted against the American
Rescue Plan public safety funding for cities and rural counties across
the country.  
  
While Congressional Republicans try to pull back this
funding, **President Biden is today renewing his call for communities to
invest more American Rescue Plan funding in strategies to make our
communities safer and to deploy as many dollars as possible before the
summer months when many communities historically experience a seasonal
increase in violent crime.** This renewed call to action comes as the
Treasury Department is releasing the second tranche of support for state
and local governments.   
  
**$10 Billion in Already Planned ARP Investments in Public Safety &
Violence Prevention as President Biden Calls for Increased Investment:**

-   **$6.5 billion in State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund investments
    over the past year**, by over 300 communities and more than half of
    states, including:  
    -   **$1 billion in bonuses for front-line public safety
        workers** to help recruit and retain these public servants.
    -   **Over $2 billion to prevent crime and ease the burden on
        police**, including community violence interventions, crisis
        responders, and substance use disorder and mental health
        services.
    -   **Nearly $1 billion to reduce domestic violence** with immediate
        crisis intervention, health supports and safety for victims of
        domestic violence
    -   **Over $350 million in job training** and other assistance to
        help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter
        society and provide at-risk teens and young adults with
        meaningful job opportunities in the summer and during the year
    -   **$450 million in public safety technology and equipment **–
        like new police cars, upgraded radio systems, body-worn cameras,
        and gunshot detection systems 
    -   **$600 million to help clear court backlogs and support victims
        of crime **  
-   **Over $1 billion** in proposed ARP investments in public safety
    have been documented this budget season. This understates the
    potential for new American Rescue Plan commitments to public safety.
    Indeed, for cities and counties, the numbers announced today reflect
    only the investments reported through 2021.   
-   **$1.2 billion Medicaid Mobile Crisis Intervention Services** –
    police departments are too often overburdened due to lack of crisis
    response support for people experiencing behavioral health crises.
    That’s why the American Rescue Plan included $1.2 billion to fund
    mobile crisis intervention units staffed with mental health
    professionals and trained peers.   
-   **$1 billion Family Violence Prevention and Services Program **to
    reduce domestic violence with immediate crisis intervention, health
    supports, and safety.

**Examples of How Specific Communities Are Leveraging American Rescue
Plan Funds to Shore Up Their Budgets and Make Our Communities Safer**

    community policing, and innovative community violence interruption
    strategies. **Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul, who is part of
    the White House’s Community Violence Intervention Collaborative,
    discussed the city’s major public safety investments, including $8
    million to replace patrol and other vehicles, $3.3 million to
    implement gun violence reduction strategies and increase community
    policing, and $1.8 million for technology investments such as
    automated license plate readers.  
-   **Toledo, Ohio: Funding training for a second cohort of new police
    recruits for the first time and plans for 100 new officers in the
    next few years. **Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz is leveraging ARP
    funds to not only avoid cutbacks and layoffs but used the additional
    resources to create a path to hiring 100 new police officers and
    invested $2.3 million in gun violence reduction strategies,
    including a violence interrupter program and other programs
    addressing root causes of violence, focused on neighborhoods with
    highest instances of gun violence. American Rescue Plan funds have
    allowed, for the first time ever, the city has funding to deploy not
    just one but two cohorts of new police officers, as it works to
    expand its police force. The city is also investing in gunshot
    detection technology and safety camera investments to tackle public
    safety issues.

    Wisconsin and the City of Milwaukee are helping with Community
    Violence Intervention, summer jobs, and workforce opportunities for
    at-risk individuals. From Governor Evers’ $100 million anti-violence
    strategy, Milwaukee is receiving funding for a public health
    approach to violence prevention, that integrates licensed mental
    health clinicians into Milwaukee’s 911 center, and provides job
    training at Milwaukee County House of Correction, while using the
    city’s own ARP funds to invest in summer jobs for up to 1,500 young
    people. 

**Appendix: 40+ Additional Examples of Cities, Counties, and States Are
Using American Rescue Plan Funding **  

-   **Allegheny County, PA** has invested $10 million to provide radio
    equipment to over 300 fire, EMS and police departments throughout

    support a recovery program designed as an alternative to jail for
    people who are experiencing a mental health crisis.  
-   **Atlanta, GA **has committed $7.5 million towards public safety and
    violence prevention initiatives, specifically community-based
    violence prevention programming. Atlanta will engage in street
    outreach and other holistic supportive services to actively
    remediate conflicts and prevent violence. The City plans to engage
    in the Cure Violence program model, an internationally renowned
    approach to violence prevention, leveraging disease control and
    behavioral health methods including conflict resolution,
    interrupting the transmission of retaliatory violence, and creating
    opportunities for community norms to change towards a nonviolence
    culture. Atlanta is also investing $2.5 million of these funds
    towards the purchase of additional cameras and license plate readers
    to enhance public safety technology.  
-   **Baltimore, MD** is investing $50 million over the next three years
    on a comprehensive violence prevention strategy, including community
