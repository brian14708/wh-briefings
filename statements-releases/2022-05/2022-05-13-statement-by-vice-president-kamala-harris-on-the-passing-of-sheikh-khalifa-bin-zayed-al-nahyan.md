The Second Gentleman and I send our condolences on the passing of His
Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Our thoughts are with his
family and with the people of the United Arab Emirates as they mourn
thisÂ loss. Under his leadership, the strong partnership between the
United States and the UAE has enhanced the security and prosperity of
the American and Emirati people, and we are grateful for our work
together across multiple Administrations. The legacy of this partnership
can be found in the deep bonds between our countries, which our
Administration will continue to strengthen.
