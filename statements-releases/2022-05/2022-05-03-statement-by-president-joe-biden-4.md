We do not know whether this draft is genuine, or whether it reflects the
final decision of the Court.   
   
With that critical caveat, I want to be clear on three points about the
cases before the Supreme Court.   
   
First, my administration argued strongly before the Court in defense of
*Roe v. Wade. *We said that *Roe* is based on “a long line of precedent
recognizing ‘the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty’…
against government interference with intensely personal decisions.” I
believe that a woman’s right to choose is fundamental, *Roe* has been
the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the
stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.  
   
Second, shortly after the enactment of Texas law SB 8 and other laws
restricting women’s reproductive rights, I directed my Gender Policy
Council and White House Counsel’s Office to prepare options for an
Administration response to the continued attack on abortion and
reproductive rights, under a variety of possible outcomes in the cases
pending before the Supreme Court. We will be ready when any ruling is
issued.  
   
Third, if the Court does overturn *Roe,* it will fall on our nation’s
elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right
to choose. And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this
November.  At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice Senators
and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that
codifies *Roe,* which I will work to pass and sign into law.
