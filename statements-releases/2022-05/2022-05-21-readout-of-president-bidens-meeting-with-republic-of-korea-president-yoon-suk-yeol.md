President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Yoon Suk Yeol of
the Republic of Korea (ROK) in Seoul. Both Leaders reaffirmed their

beyond the Korean Peninsula to take on global challenges, including
threats to the rules-based international order, such as Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine. The two Leaders committed to increase cooperation
on a broad range of priority issues including critical technologies,
economic and energy security, global health, and climate change. The
Presidents also discussed their shared belief in constitutional
democracy and the importance of respecting individual rights as well as
strengthening the regional security environment. They committed to
further strengthen deterrence and ensure close cooperation to address
the threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).
Both Leaders shared concerns about the rapid spread of COVID-19 within
the DPRK and expressed support for working with the international
community to provide assistance.
