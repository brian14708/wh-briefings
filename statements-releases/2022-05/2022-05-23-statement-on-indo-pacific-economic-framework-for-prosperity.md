title: "Statement on Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for\_Prosperity"
---
 
We, the United States, Australia, Brunei Darussalam, India, Indonesia,
Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand, and Vietnam of the Indo-Pacific region, acknowledge the
richness and the diversity of our vibrant regional economy. We share a
commitment to a free, open, fair, inclusive, interconnected, resilient,
secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region that has the potential to
achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth. We acknowledge our
economic policy interests in the region are intertwined, and deepening
economic engagement among partners is crucial for continued growth,
peace, and prosperity.  
   
We recognize the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the imperative of
working closely together to ensure that economic recovery and
advancement are grounded in resilience, sustainability, and
inclusivity.  The pandemic has also emphasized the importance of
strengthening economic competitiveness and cooperation and securing
critical supply chains, while stimulating job growth and improving
economic opportunities, including for our workers, women, medium- and
small-enterprises, and our societies’ most vulnerable groups.  
   
In the long term, economic competitiveness will be largely defined by
our ability to harness technology, promote innovation, participate in
the digital economy, justly transition energy systems and achieve energy
security, and tackle the climate crisis in a manner that produces
equitable, inclusive growth and improves socio-economic welfare.    
   
In order to prepare our economies for the future, we are launching the
process to establish the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for
Prosperity.  
   
This framework is intended to advance resilience, sustainability,
inclusiveness, economic growth, fairness, and competitiveness for our
economies.  Through this initiative, we aim to contribute to
cooperation, stability, prosperity, development, and peace within the
region.    
   
We invite participation from additional Indo-Pacific partners that share
our goals, interests, and ambitions for the region.  We are committed to
collaborating with our framework partners in a manner that acknowledges
the importance of technical assistance and capacity building, allows us
to maintain a flexible approach, and delivers tangible benefits for our
peoples.  
   
Today, we launch collective discussions toward future negotiations on
the following pillars.  Framework partners will be engaging in such
discussions on various ways to strengthen economic cooperation to
achieve these goals, and we invite other interested Indo-Pacific
partners to join us.  
   
**Trade:** We seek to build high-standard, inclusive, free, and fair
trade commitments and develop new and creative approaches in trade and
technology policy that advance a broad set of objectives that fuels
economic activity and investment, promotes sustainable and inclusive
economic growth, and benefits workers and consumers.  Our efforts
include, but are not limited to, cooperation in the digital economy.   
**   
Supply Chains:** We are committed to improving transparency, diversity,
security, and sustainability in our supply chains to make them more
resilient and well-integrated.  We seek to coordinate crisis response
measures; expand cooperation to better prepare for and mitigate the
effects of disruptions to better ensure business continuity; improve
logistical efficiency and support; and ensure access to key raw and
processed materials, semiconductors, critical minerals, and clean energy
technology.  
   
**Clean Energy, Decarbonization, and Infrastructure:** In line with our
Paris Agreement goals and efforts to support the livelihood of our
peoples and workers, we plan to accelerate the development and
deployment of clean energy technologies to decarbonize our economies and
build resilience to climate impacts.  This involves deepening
cooperation on technologies, on mobilizing finance, including
concessional finance, and on seeking ways to improve competitiveness and
enhance connectivity by supporting the development of sustainable and
durable infrastructure and by providing technical assistance.  
   
**Tax and Anti-Corruption:** We are committed to promoting fair
competition by enacting and enforcing effective and robust tax,
anti-money laundering, and anti-bribery regimes in line with existing
multilateral obligations, standards, and agreements to curb tax evasion
and corruption in the Indo-Pacific region. This involves sharing
expertise and seeking ways to support capacity building necessary to
advance accountable and transparent systems.  
   
We are continuing to identify additional areas of cooperation based on
consultations among partners to further our shared interests, with a
view to advancing regional economic connectivity and integration.  We
look forward to jointly creating conducive environments to boost flows
of commerce, trade, and investments amongst our economies, and to
enhancing standards and access to opportunities for our workers,
companies, and peoples in our combined markets.
