National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with
Romanian Presidential Security Advisor Ion Oprișor. They exchanged views
on Russia’s war against Ukraine. They underscored their continued
commitment to support Ukraine, impose costs on Russia, and reinforce
NATO’s Eastern Flank. Mr. Sullivan expressed appreciation for Romania’s
generous provision of humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians fleeing
Russian violence. He also conveyed U.S. support for Romania’s efforts to
further diversify its energy supplies away from Russian sources while
assisting neighbors like Moldova in doing the same.
