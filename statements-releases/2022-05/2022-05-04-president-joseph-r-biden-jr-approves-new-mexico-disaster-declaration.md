---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of New Mexico and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by wildfires and
straight-line winds beginning on April 5, 2022, and continuing.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Colfax, Lincoln, Mora, San Miguel, and
Valencia.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency protective measures (Category B),
limited to direct federal assistance and reimbursement for mass care
including evacuation and shelter support in the counties of Colfax,
Lincoln, Mora, San Miguel, and Valencia.

Lastly, Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for
hazard mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Sandra L. Eslinger as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.  

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional
counties may be designated for assistance after the assessments are
fully completed.

counties can begin applying for assistance tomorrow by registering
