title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on\_the Bipartisan Innovation Act\
  \ Conference Committee\_Meeting"

Congress took an important step today in formally beginning to reconcile
the bipartisan competitiveness legislation. As President Biden said this
week, fighting inflation is his top economic priority, and the
Bipartisan Innovation Act will help us get that done by promoting
domestic manufacturing and strengthening our supply chains. There is
common ground between the House and Senate bills, and it’s his hope that
conferees focus on what they agree on. The Administration continues to
provide assistance to the conferees and committees and will work hard to
support the conference in delivering a bill that Democrats and
Republicans can support.
