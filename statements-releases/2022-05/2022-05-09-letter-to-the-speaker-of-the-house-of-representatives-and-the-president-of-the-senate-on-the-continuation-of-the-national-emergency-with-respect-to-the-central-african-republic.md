title: "Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of\
  \ the Senate, on the\_Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to the\
  \ Central African\_Republic"

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the Central African
Republic declared in Executive Order 13667 of May 12, 2014, is to
continue in effect beyond May 12, 2022.  
  
The situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic has
been marked by a breakdown of law and order; intersectarian tension; the
pervasive, often forced recruitment and use of child soldiers; and
widespread violence and atrocities, including those committed by
Kremlin-linked and Yevgeniy Prigozhin-affiliated entities such as the
Wagner Group.  These dynamics threaten the peace, security, or stability
of the Central African Republic and the neighboring states, and
continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13667 with respect to the Central
African Republic.                                

Sincerely,   
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
