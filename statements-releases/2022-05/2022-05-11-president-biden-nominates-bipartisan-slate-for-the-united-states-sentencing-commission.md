title: "President\_Biden Nominates Bipartisan Slate for the United\_States Sentencing\_\
  Commission"
---
 
President Biden is announcing seven experienced and qualified nominees
for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a bipartisan independent agency
created during the Reagan Administration.  The Commission was created to
reduce sentencing disparities and promote transparency and
proportionality in criminal sentencing.

The Commission has lacked a quorum since 2019, which has prevented it
from doing critical business.  Today, President Biden is pleased to
announce the nominations of these individuals – a bipartisan slate
including the first Black chair of the organization – whose
confirmations would allow the Commission to conduct its important work.
