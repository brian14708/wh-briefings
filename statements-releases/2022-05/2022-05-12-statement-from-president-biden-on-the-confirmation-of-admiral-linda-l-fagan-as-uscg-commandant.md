  \ as USCG\_Commandant"

It is with deep pride that I congratulate Admiral Linda L. Fagan on her
confirmation by the Senate as Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.
Admiral Fagan is the Coast Guard’s first woman to hold the rank of
four-star admiral. Today, she again makes history not only as the first
woman to lead the Coast Guard—but also as the first woman Service Chief
of any U.S. military service. Admiral Fagan’s leadership, experience,
and integrity are second to none, and I know she will advance the Coast
Guard’s mission to ensure our nation’s maritime safety and security. 

My administration is committed to seeing more qualified women in senior
leadership and command roles; making sure women can succeed and thrive
throughout their military careers. Today, Admiral Fagan’s confirmation
as Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard signals to women and girls across
our nation they have a place in protecting their country at the highest
level.
