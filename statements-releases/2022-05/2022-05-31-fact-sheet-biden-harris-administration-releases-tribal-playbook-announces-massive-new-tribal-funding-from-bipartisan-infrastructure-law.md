title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Releases Tribal Playbook, Announces\
  \ Massive New Tribal Funding from Bipartisan Infrastructure\_Law"
---
 
Today, the White House released a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law [Tribal
Playbook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bipartisan-Infrastructure-Law-Tribal-Playbook-053122-.pdf)
to help Tribal governments unlock the benefits from the historic
investments in our nation’s infrastructure, including the more than $13
billion set aside in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for Indian
Country.  The Tribal Playbook, found at
[build.gov](/Users/AVRajan/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/DVACGF6D/build.gov),
builds on the release of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Guidebook and
provides Tribal communities with information on the more specific Tribal
funding available under the law, in addition to the hundreds of billions
available to Tribes on a competitive basis.  
  
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will send billions of
dollars to Indian Country to provide affordable high-speed internet,
safer roads and bridges, modern wastewater and sanitation systems, clean
drinking water, reliable and affordable electricity, and good paying
jobs in every Tribal community. As part of this effort, the Biden-Harris
Administration is also committed to working with Tribal communities to
help them access federal resources.

 “We are committed to ensuring Indian Country will benefit from this
once-in-a-generation investment,” said **Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor
& Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator.** “Building a better
America requires these funds to reach Tribal communities that have been
left behind for far too long.  The President sees you, and major
investments are on the way.”

This week, the Administration made progress in getting massive
sanitation and water investments moving through the Indian Health
Service and Environmental Protection Agency.   The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law appropriates $3.5 billion to the Indian Health
Service to build the infrastructure necessary to ensure a safe supply of
drinking water, reliable sewage systems, and solid waste disposal
facilities. The funding will promote high-quality health care and
disease prevention in Tribal communities. The first year, FY 2022, spend
plan is estimated at $700M and will be shared with Tribal communities
through a [Dear Tribal Leader Letter
today](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/05/31/ihs-allocates-700-million-dollars-from-president-bidens-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-to-improve-tribal-water-sanitation-systems.html).
EPA’s Office of Water will send another [$154 million this year to
Tribes for water
projects](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-and-epa-announce-actions-improve-drinking-water-and)
through its Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving Funds. This
funding will go to projects that replace lead pipes and address harmful
pollutants, among other eligible uses.     
  
To help coordinate these and other water and wastewater infrastructure
funds, EPA has revitalized the Tribal Infrastructure Task Force (ITF)
through a new Memorandum of Understanding between seven federal
agencies. Signatories include:

-   The U.S Department of Agriculture;
-   The Environmental Protection Agency; 
-   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development;
-   The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs;
-   The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation;
-   The Department of Health and Human Services, Indian Health Service;
    and
-   The Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention.

In addition, the Departments of Transportation and Energy will also
release funding for Tribal infrastructure that will increase road safety
and power unelectrified buildings. Today, DOE issued a Notice of Intent
for a [$15 million
investment](https://ie-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx#FoaId61c91716-9750-4c55-bca4-197fd1f8edb1)
to support powering unelectrified Tribal buildings.  Earlier this month,
the Department of Transportation announced [nearly $9
million](https://highways.dot.gov/sites/fhwa.dot.gov/files/images/FY21%20Tribal%20Transportation%20Program%20Safety%20Fund%20Awards_0.pdf)
for the Federal Highway Administration’s Tribal Transportation Safety
Program. Soon, they will announce the availability of an additional $120
million for the program over five years from Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law.

Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law six
months ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running
to deliver results. The Administration has made key progress towards
implementing the largest long-term investment in America’s
infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. More than $110
billion has been announced and allocated to states, Tribes, territories
and communities from formula and competitive programs for roads and
highways, bridges, ports, airports, electric vehicle charging stations,
water systems, high speed internet, and weatherization.  

Of that, the Administration has announced the following Tribal programs:

-   **Fulfilling Tribal Water Settlements: **The Department of the
    Interior announced [$1.7
    billion ](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/tribes-receive-17-billion-president-bidens-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-fulfill)to
    fulfill Indian Water Rights Settlements, which will break down
    barriers and help create conditions that improve water resources
    management by providing certainty as to the rights of all water
    users who are parties to the disputes.
-   **Powering Unelectrified Tribal Buildings:** In May, the Department
    of Energy announced a Notice of Intent for [$20
    million](https://www.energy.gov/indianenergy/articles/us-department-energy-set-announce-funding-opportunity-deploy-energy)
    in funding for Tribal nations to deploy energy infrastructure or
    integrated energy systems to provide power to Tribal buildings not
    connected to traditional centralized electric power grids.  
-   **Dam Safety Programs in Tribal Communities: **In mid-May, the
    Department of the Interior announced [$29
    million](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-investments-dam)
    from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for its Power, Irrigation,
    and Safety of Dams programs. This is the first allotment of
    approximately $150 million the BIL will invest over the next five
    years to address safety deficiencies at four BIA dams.  
-   **Tribal Water Systems:** The Department of the Interior
    announced [$10
    million](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-10-million-bipartisan-infrastructure-law) for
    tribal water systems and another [$10
    million ](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-investments)for
    irrigation and power in Indian Country.   
-   **Drought Resilience:** The Department of the Interior announced
    awards of [$420 million for rural water
    projects](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=902691252e&e=a280d5f75f) for
    drought resilience, and [$240 million for aging water
    infrastructure](https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/#/news-release/4205)
    through the Bureau of Reclamation. This investment in rural water
    systems includes work related to pipeline connections, construction
    of water treatment plants and intakes, pump systems, reservoir
    construction and other efforts to provide potable water to rural and
    Tribal communities. The Bureau of Reclamation also announced
    application periods for hundreds of millions of dollars in
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding opportunities for water
    infrastructure, some of which are still open.  Funding for the
    maintenance of aging infrastructure, and water recycling and
    desalination projects have been advertised, with more on the way
    during the rest of 2022.  
-   **Watershed Infrastructure Projects:** The U.S. Department of
    Agriculture (USDA) announced nearly [$600
    million](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=3313334b91&e=a280d5f75f) in
    funding for projects that improve or rehabilitate watersheds,
    rehabilitate dams, and improve flood prevention through its Natural
    Resource Conservation Service, including some in Tribal
    communities.  
-   **Tribal Climate Resilience: **The Department of the Interior
    announced [$46
    million](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-funding-build)
    in funding to Tribal communities to address the unique impacts of
    climate change in Indigenous communities.   
-   **Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund**:  NOAA announced [$100
    million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery
    Fund](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/grant/pacific-coastal-salmon-recovery-fund), including
    $34.4 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which
    supports conservation efforts in California, Oregon, Washington,
    Idaho, and Alaska and is essential to preventing the extinction of
    the 28 listed salmon and steelhead species on the West Coast.  The
    jobs and economic benefits of salmon restoration activities are
    largely realized in local and rural communities.  
-   **Great Lakes Restoration:** EPA announced [$1 billion over five
    years for the Great Lakes Restoration
    Initiative](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=d63566ed7c&e=a280d5f75f),
    including $200 million in FY2022, to accelerate progress in the
    clean-up and restoration of the Great Lakes’ most environmentally
    degraded sites, securing clean water and a better environment for
    millions of Americans in the Great Lakes region, including in Tribal
    communities.  
-   **Tribal Internet:** NTIA has made [34 awards totaling approximately
    $83
    million](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=5a9fc3ac26&e=a280d5f75f) in
    funding through the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program. These
    awards are part of the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government
    effort to connect everyone in America with affordable, reliable,
    high-speed internet.  The program, which is receiving an additional
    $2 billion in funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is
    directed to Tribal governments to be used for broadband deployment
    on Tribal lands, as well as for telehealth, distance learning,
    broadband affordability, and digital inclusion. 

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding builds off the
Administration’s historic investment in Tribal communities in the
American Rescue Plan, with $32 billion allocated to Tribal governments,
including $20 billion in State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds—a
historic financial level of support for over 580 Tribal governments and
the largest amount of funding to Tribal governments in ARP. To date,
Tribal governments have obligated funds to nearly 900 projects that
address the negative economic impacts of COVID and over 1,800 other
projects that are helping Indian Country recover and strengthen
capacity.
