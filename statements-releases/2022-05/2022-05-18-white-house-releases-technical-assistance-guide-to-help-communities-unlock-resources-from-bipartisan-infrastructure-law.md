*Administration Highlights New Capacity from Philanthropic, Nonprofit &
Labor Organizations to Help States and Cities Respond to
Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity*

Today, the White House released a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
[technical assistance
guide](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Infrastructure-Technical-Assistance-Guide_FINAL2.pdf)
to help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments navigate,
access, and deploy infrastructure resources that will build a better
America. The Biden Administration has identified over $700 million in
dedicated funding across more than 65 technical assistance programs. In
addition to highlighting federal government technical assistance, the
White House Infrastructure Implementation Team has engaged with a range
of external stakeholders including, philanthropic, labor and nonprofit
organizations, to highlight available nongovernmental resources and
create a pipeline to assist communities in quickly and equitably
accessing and deploying federal infrastructure funding.  
  
Over 90% of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s historic funding will be
deployed by non-federal partners. In the past, too many communities have
lacked the resources to apply for and deploy transformative
infrastructure opportunities. This
[guide](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Infrastructure-Technical-Assistance-Guide_FINAL2.pdf),
building on the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
Guidebook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BUILDING-A-BETTER-AMERICA_FINAL.pdf)
and [Rural Playbook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/rural/),
highlights programs that help communities navigate programs and
resources that can help them deliver infrastructure projects.  While
some of these programs offer hands-on and intensive planning and
delivery support for communities, others are more self-directed
resources and tools such as webinars and websites, or funding that can
support project planning.  
  
“This technical assistance guide is just one more way we’re working to
ensure state, local, Tribal and territorial governments have the tools
and resources they need to take advantage of investments in President
Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,” said **Mitch Landrieu, Senior
Advisor & Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator.** “Building a
better America requires that we leave no community behind. This guide
aims to pull together the many different technical assistance resources
available across the federal government that can help communities
deliver transformative infrastructure projects. We are also grateful to
the many philanthropic organizations who have stepped up to support
states and local communities in ensuring we do not leave any community
behind in this once-in-a-generation investment.”  
  
In response to the Administration’s external engagement efforts,
philanthropic, labor and nonprofit organizations have also committed new
resources to assist communities accessing and deploying federal
infrastructure funding, including:

-   Bloomberg Philanthropies, Emerson Collective, Ford Foundation, and
    the Kresge Foundation, are launching the [Local Infrastructure
    Hub](https://localinfrastructure.org/), a national program to ensure
    that all U.S. cities and towns can access federal infrastructure
    funding to drive local recovery, improve communities, and deliver
    results for residents. The $50 million commitment of support for
    local communities in collaboration with the U.S. Conference of
    Mayors, National League of Cities, and Results for America, will
    bring together leading experts and resources to help city leaders
    access and ambitiously leverage funding from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law to advance groundbreaking solutions to major
    challenges, especially narrowing racial wealth disparities and
    cutting the emissions that cause climate change.  
-   [Accelerator for America](https://www.acceleratorforamerica.org/) is
    providing technical assistance, in-kind support for strategic
    planning and grant writing, communications strategy, policy
    research, and guides to help local government and development
    leaders navigate the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and complementary
    funding opportunities.  Accelerator for America is working directly
    with 20 cities on infrastructure projects and expanding scope and
    reach regularly as cities prioritize local infrastructure projects,
    including workforce development initiatives and project delivery
    support.  
-   The Communities First Infrastructure Alliance is working with
    technical assistance providers, frontline communities and government
    leaders to build just, equitable, and more resilient
    communities. The Alliance is led by national equity-centered
    leadership groups and includes a national ecosystem of valued
    aligned partners committed to communities first. The Infrastructure
    Alliance members will work collectively to support communities with
    the resources, capacity and technical assistance required to
    actualize community-centered plans, projects, and visions to meet
    this moment for the movement.    
-   The recently launched What Works Plus (WW+) funding collaborative
    coordinates efforts across philanthropy, government, and nonprofit
    organizations to advance racial and economic equity through more
    just and climate resilient infrastructure investments. The
    collaborative is focused on partnerships that result in better
    outcomes for communities, workers, and entrepreneurs.  
-   [The Climate Jobs National Resource
    Center](https://www.cjnrc.org/) is assisting communities and states
    with workforce training, including building an equitable, inclusive
    renewable energy economy by investing in union apprenticeship and
    pre-apprenticeship programs. CJNRC will be working with labor-led
    climate jobs coalitions and unions in states to support a successful
    implementation effort by expanding and strengthening initiatives to
    increase access to union climate jobs for infrastructure workers in
    under-resourced communities on the frontlines of climate change. 

The Administration welcomes additional commitments from nongovernmental
stakeholders to support states and local communities access this
once-in-a-generation investment.   
  
Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law six
months ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running
to deliver results. [More than $110
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-hits-the-ground-running-to-build-a-better-america-six-months-into-infrastructure-implementation/)
has been announced and allocated to states and communities from formula
and competitive programs for roads and highways, bridges, ports,
airports, and water systems, with another nearly $100 billion in notices
of funding availability for competitive programs now underway. The
historic $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is rebuilding
crumbling roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes to provide clean
water, delivering cleaner energy, helping provide affordable, high-speed
internet to every family in America, and producing concrete results that
change people’s lives for the better.  As the Administration implements
the law, it is following through on President Biden’s commitment to
ensure investments advance equity and reach communities all across the
country – including rural communities, communities of color, and
disability communities – and strengthen the nation’s resilience to
climate change.
