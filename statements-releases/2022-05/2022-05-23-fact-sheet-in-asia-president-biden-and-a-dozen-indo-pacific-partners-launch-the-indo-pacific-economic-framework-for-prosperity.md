title: "FACT SHEET: In Asia, President\_Biden and a Dozen Indo-Pacific Partners Launch\
  \ the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for\_Prosperity"
---
 
*IPEF will strengthen our ties in this critical region to define the
coming decades for technological innovation and the global economy*  
   
*Framework will create a stronger, fairer, more resilient economy for
families, workers, and businesses in the United States and in the
Indo-Pacific region*

Today in Tokyo, Japan, President Biden launched the Indo-Pacific
Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) with a dozen initial partners:
Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Together, we represent 40% of world GDP.    
  
The United States is an Indo-Pacific economic power, and expanding U.S.
economic leadership in the region is good for American workers and
businesses — as well as for the people of the region. IPEF will enable
the United States and our allies to decide on rules of the road that
ensure American workers, small businesses, and ranchers can compete in
the Indo-Pacific. As the President has said, tackling inflation is a top
economic priority, and this framework will help lower costs by making
our supply chains more resilient in the long term, protecting us against
costly disruptions that lead to higher prices for consumers.  
  
U.S. foreign direct investment in the region totaled more than $969
billion in 2020 and has nearly doubled in the last decade, and we are
the leading exporter of services to the region, helping fuel regional
growth. Trade with the Indo-Pacific supports more than three million
American jobs and is the source of nearly $900 billion in foreign direct
investment in the United States. With 60 percent of the world’s
population, the Indo‑Pacific is projected to be the largest contributor
to global growth over the next 30 years.    
  
The United States and our partners in the region believe that much of
our success in the coming decades will depend on how well governments
harness innovation — especially the transformations afoot in the clean
energy, digital, and technology sectors — while fortifying our economies
against a range of threats, from fragile supply chains to corruption to
tax havens. The past models of economic engagement did not address these
challenges, leaving our workers, businesses, and consumers vulnerable.
The framework will focus on four key pillars to establish high-standard
commitments that will deepen our economic engagement in the region:

-   Connected Economy: On trade, we will engage comprehensively with our
    partners on a wide range of issues. We will pursue high-standard
    rules of the road in the digital economy, including standards on
    cross-border data flows and data localization. We will work with our
    partners to seize opportunities and address concerns in the digital
    economy, in order to ensure small and medium sized enterprises can
    benefit from the region’s rapidly growing e-commerce sector, while
    addressing issues is such as online privacy and discriminatory and
    unethical use of Artificial Intelligence. We will also seek strong
    labor and environment standards and corporate accountability
    provisions that promote a race to the top for workers through
    trade. 
-   Resilient Economy: We will seek first-of-their-kind supply chain
    commitments that better anticipate and prevent disruptions in supply
    chains to create a more resilient economy and guard against price
    spikes that increase costs for American families. We intend to do
    this by establishing an early warning system, mapping critical
    mineral supply chains, improving traceability in key sectors, and
    coordinating on diversification efforts.
-   Clean Economy: We will seek first-of-their-kind commitments on clean
    energy, decarbonization, and infrastructure that promote good-paying
    jobs. We will pursue concrete, high-ambition targets that will
    accelerate efforts to tackle the climate crisis, including in the
    areas of renewable energy, carbon removal, energy efficiency
    standards, and new measures to combat methane emissions. 
-   Fair Economy: We will seek commitments to enact and enforce
    effective tax, anti-money laundering, and anti-bribery regimes that
    are in line with our existing multilateral obligations to promote a
    fair economy. These will include provisions on the exchange of tax
    information, criminalization of bribery in accordance with UN
    standards, and effective implementation of beneficial ownership
    recommendations to strengthen our efforts to crack down on
    corruption.
