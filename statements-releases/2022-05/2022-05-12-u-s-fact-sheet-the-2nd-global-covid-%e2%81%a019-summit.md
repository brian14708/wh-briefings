*Preventing Complacency and Prioritizing Preparedness*

Today, the United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal
convened other heads of state and world leaders from international
organizations, the private sector, philanthropies, non-government
organizations, and other partners for the 2nd Global COVID-19 Summit.
   
  
The United States issued a call to redouble global efforts to control
the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future health emergencies.  The
U.S.  urged the world to prevent complacency and to keep political will
strong. We also called on leaders to accelerate financial and policy
commitments – country by country, community by community – to get shots
into arms; expand access to tests and treatments; protect those at
highest risk; and prevent future catastrophes by building and financing
country capacity, health workers, disease surveillance, and medical
countermeasures, including through the new health security fund at the
World Bank**.**

**Vice President Harris highlighted U.S. leadership and called on
Congress to** **continue to make Americans and the world safer by
promptly providing the $22.5 billion in supplemental funding for
responding to COVID-19 that the Administration requested on March 2,
2022, <u>including $5 billion to support the global effort</u> to stop
the spread of potential new variants, get shots into arms, expand access
to tests and treatments, and save lives here at home and abroad.**

U.S. leadership in vaccinating the world, saving lives, and building
better health security

This Summit continues to highlight American leadership in the global
COVID-19 response.  As the world’s largest donor, the United States has
to date provided more than $19 billion in health, humanitarian, and
economic assistance and has committed to provide 1.2 billon vaccine
doses to the world for free, of which we have already provided more than
535 million doses.

At the Summit, the United States called the world to action alongside
co-hosts Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal.  Leaders from around
the world made bold new commitments to control COVID-19 and prevent
future health crises.  The U.S. announced new commitments to the global
COVID-19 response and pandemic preparedness, building on substantial
U.S. commitments made to date and during the [last global COVID-19
Summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/22/fact-sheet-president-bidens-global-covid-19-summit-ending-the-pandemic-and-building-back-better/):

-   **Additional funding for a pandemic preparedness \[and global health
    security\] fund housed at the World Bank. ** Building on its initial
    commitment of $250 million previously announced at the first Global
    COVID-19 Summit, the United States intends to increase its initial
    contribution toward the establishment of the new pandemic
    preparedness and global health security fund at the World Bank by an
    additional $200 million, for a total of $450 million. Combined with
    funding pledged today by other donors, this funding makes a total of
    at least $960 million in seed funding in advance of the Fund’s
    launch this summer.  The Fund will provide sustained financing for
    improving national, regional, and global capacity to prevent,
    detect, and respond to pandemics and other infectious disease
    threats.

-   **Sharing U.S. Government COVID-19 vaccine-related intellectual
    property and research tools for greater global access.** Through the
    National Institutes of Health (NIH), the United States has recently
    licensed research tools and the intellectual property for several
    COVID-19 technologies to the Medicines Patent Pool, through the WHO
    COVID-19 Technology Access Pool. The licenses include the patent for
    the stabilized spike protein used in multiple existing COVID-19
    vaccines. These licenses will enable manufacturers from around the
    world to use these technologies.

<!-- -->

-   The United States, through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA), confirms its commitment to conducting thorough and efficient
    reviews of COVID-19 response products. While COVID-19 remains a
    public health emergency, FDA will prioritize the review of COVID-19
    therapeutics, including applications seeking tentative approval of
    generic products.  FDA grants tentative approvals for products that
    meet the requirements for FDA approval but cannot be approved for
    exclusivity or patent reasons. 

<!-- -->

-   **Test and Treat Strategy**. The United States, alongside the Global
    Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (“Global Fund”),
    Unitaid, and other ACT-Accelerator partners, will promote
    “test-and-treat” strategies for the most vulnerable populations in
    low and middle-income countries to help prevent hospitalizations and
    deaths from COVID-19. The Global Fund will procure up to $80 million
    in COVID-19 rapid test kits and oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs, which
    would be linked to $20 million of American Rescue Plan Act funds
    that the U.S. Agency for International Development plans to use to
    quickly scale up test-and-treat implementation in up to eight
    countries globally in 2022, in coordination with other U.S.
    Government programs, including PEPFAR. It would build on an
    additional $22 million from Unitaid to produce over $120 million in
    investments to introduce test and treatment strategies in over 20
    countries in 2022. This collaborative early investment would
    catalyze test-and-treat adoption and expansion in additional
    countries**. This commitment is a down payment on U.S. leadership
    that can be fully realized if Congress acts to provide the
    President’s requested COVID-19 supplemental funding.**
-   **Additional vaccination support through Global VAX.** Building on
    the more than $1.7 billion in funds committed to date, The United
    States, through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    (CDC), is providing an additional $15 million the U.S. Initiative
    for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), a whole-of-government effort
    to accelerate and expand vaccine readiness uptake in high-need
    countries, including 11 surge support countries. This funding will
    enable CDC to provide additional technical assistance and service
    delivery to countries for vaccination efforts, with a focus on
    high-risk populations. This will build upon $1.7 billion the United
    States is already providing through Global VAX.
-   **Expanded investments in bilateral global health security programs.
     **To advance the Global Health Security Agenda and to accelerate
    the implementation of U.S. Global Health Security Strategy, the U.S.
    government will expand the number of global health security
    intensive support partner countries by eight this year, including to
    three new regions. This will improve countries’ capacities to
    prevent, detect, and respond to future COVID-19 variants and future
    health threats.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding dose donation types to include boosters and pediatric
    doses to accelerate global vaccine coverage**. The United States is
    [expanding Pfizer vaccine dose
    types](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/04/05/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-hhs-public-health-officials-april-5-2022/)
    being donated globally to now include boosters and pediatric doses,
    as part of our 1 billion Pfizer dose donation commitment. This will
    help accelerate progress towards the 70% vaccination target and
    expand the availability of doses available for those at highest risk
    and for children globally.

<!-- -->

-   **Improving guidance for vaccine development to enhance
    protection.** The United States, through the FDA, is committing to
    help align global health authorities and the WHO to provide advice
    to COVID-19 vaccine producers to inform which strains they use as
    the basis for vaccines, using predictions about the predominance of
    future strains and which strains will lead to vaccines that provide
    the broadest protection against unknown future variants.

<!-- -->

-   **Financing facility for COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supply
    purchases and delivery through the U.S. International Development
    Finance Corporation (DFC).**  DFC has set up a vehicle to provide up
    to $1 billion in loan guarantees to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to
    provide bridge financing guaranteeing commitments from other donors.
    This will allow COVAX to react immediately in a crisis to purchase
    and deliver ancillary supplies and vaccines on behalf of developing
    countries participating in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment.

<!-- -->

-   **Advancing COVID-19 vaccine research and development through the
    Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). ** At least
    $50 million of the U.S. Government’s [recent $150 million, 3-year
    pledge to
    CEPI](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/mar-8-2022-usaid-announces-150-million-stimulate-and-accelerate-development)
    will support COVID-19 vaccine research in addition to the
    development of other vaccines and countermeasures for future
    emerging infectious diseases, with the goals of making vaccines more
    broadly protective and easier to administer in low-resource
    settings.

Despite these commitments to combat COVID-19 and enhance future
preparedness against health threats**, there is more work to be done to
ensure the United States can continue to lead, to make Americans and the
world safer.**  President Biden continues to urge Congress to act
promptly to provide supplemental resources. Without additional emergency
funding, the United States will be unable to purchase additional
life-saving treatments for the American people.  The United States will
be less able to stop the spread of possible new variants from around the
world.  The United States will be unable to keep vaccinating the world
against COVID-19 and getting shots into arms, to save lives here at home
and abroad.
