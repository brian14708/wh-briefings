title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with Prime Minister-Designate Anthony\_\
  Albanese"
---
 
President Biden spoke with Australian Prime Minister-Designate Anthony
Albanese to congratulate him on his election as Australia’s
31<sup>st</sup> prime minister. President Biden reaffirmed the United
States’ steadfast commitment to the U.S-Australia alliance
and his intent to work closely with the new government to make it
stronger still. President Biden expressed deep appreciation for the
Prime Minister-Designate’s own early commitment to the alliance,
reflected in his decision to travel almost immediately to Tokyo to
attend the Quad Summit—a vital opportunity to exchange views
and continue to drive practical cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific. President Biden looks forward to a close
partnership between our administrations that will benefit the American
people, the Australian people, and the world, starting with
consequential meetings in Japan this week.
