title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Record-Low State Unemployment\_Rates"
---
 
Americans across the country are back to work at a historic level. Right
now, workers in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are less likely to
be unemployed than in any other time on record. The unemployment rate
did not increase in any of our 50 states.

This news comes on the heels of new data showing that the number of
Americans who are forced to rely on unemployment insurance programs for
their support fell to its lowest level in over 52 years and that the
economy has added more than 8 million jobs since I took office – more
jobs on average per month than under any other President in history.

​This job creation is no accident – it’s the direct result of my
economic plan to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle
out through the historic American Rescue Plan and a nationwide
vaccination strategy. There is more work to do to build an economy that
works for all Americans. Tackling inflation is my top priority. But we
cannot lose sight of the fact that millions of workers are now able to
better provide for themselves and their families and enjoy the dignity
that a good-paying job provides.
