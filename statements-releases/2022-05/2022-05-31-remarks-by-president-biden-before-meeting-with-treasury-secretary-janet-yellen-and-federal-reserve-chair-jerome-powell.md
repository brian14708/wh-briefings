THE PRESIDENT:  I have a very brief statement.

First, I want to begin by congratulating Mr. Chairman on his recent
confirmation for a second term, along with Drs. Brainard and Cook and
Jefferson — recent confirmations.

And I’m meeting with the Chairman today and with Secretary Yellen to
discuss my top priority, and that is addressing inflation and — and the
— in order to transition from a historic recovery to a steady growth
that works for American families. 

(Clears throat.)  Excuse me.

And my plan is to address inflation.  It starts with a simple
proposition: Respect the Fed and respect the Fed’s independence, which I
have done and will continue to do.

My job as President is not to nominate highly — not only nominate highly
— highly qualified individuals for that institution, but to give them
the space they need to do their job.  I’m not going to interfere with
their critically important work.

The Fed has dual responsibilities: One, full employment.  Two, stable
prices. 

Chair Powell and other leaders of the Fed have noted, at this moment,
they have a laser-focus on addressing inflation, just like I am. 

And with a larger complement of board members now confirmed, I know
we’ll use those tools of monetary policy to address the rising prices
for the American people.

So, I look forward to Chairman Powell’s continued leadership at the
Fed.  And I look forward to the Senate considering my final nominee to
the board, Michael Barr, in the near future.

And that’s why we’re meeting, folks, and thank you for coming in.
