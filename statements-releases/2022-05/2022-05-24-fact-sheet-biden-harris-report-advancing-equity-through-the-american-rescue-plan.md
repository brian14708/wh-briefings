*Highlights the Most Equitable Economic Recovery Ever*

*Details Efforts to Ensure Equity in 32 Major American Rescue Plan
Policies*

Today, the American Rescue Plan Implementation Team and the Domestic
Policy Council released their interim [American Rescue Plan Equity
Report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ADVANCING-EQUITY-THROUGH-THE-AMERICAN-RESCUE-PLAN.pdf).
It covers 32 different American Rescue Plan programs that represent
nearly $900 billion or 60 percent of American Rescue Plan funds,
excluding Economic Impact Payments (i.e., stimulus checks). The report,
together with ongoing economic statistics provides further evidence that
the American Rescue Plan spurred the most equitable recovery in memory.
The report also outlines lessons learned and areas for continued work
and collaboration with external partners to build on progress to date,
including through the release of the ARP Equity Learning Agenda.

Since the American Rescue Plan passed: The American Rescue Plan helped
power a historic recovery which led to the largest job growth ever in a
calendar year, saw unemployment claims decline from nearly 20 million
when President Biden took office to close to 1 million – and
unemployment reach 3.6% – a level the Congressional Budget Office did
not predict our nation would reach during the entire decade. It is also
critical to recognize that the cumulative impact of the American Rescue
Plan – as well as the design and implementation of its policies – has
led to a historically equitable recovery. Below are some of the
highlights: 

**<u>A Historically Equitable Recovery</u>**

-   **Black Unemployment – largest calendar year drop since 1983 & below
    pre-pandemic rate:** 2021 featured the fastest calendar year of
    decline in the number of unemployed Black workers on record and the
    largest calendar year drop in the unemployment rate (2.9 percentage
    points) since
    1983—now [down](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006) to
    5.9 percent in April, *<u>below pre-pandemic levels</u>* – instead
    of taking over six years to recover as it did after the Great
    Recession.
    -   **Black employment is 233,000 above pre-pandemic levels:** When
        President Biden took office, 1.4 million fewer Black workers
        were employed than pre-pandemic. In April 2022, there were
        233,000 more Black workers with jobs than in February 2020. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Black Teen Unemployment is below its pre-pandemic rate.**
-   **Hispanic Unemployment – record calendar year drop & below
    pre-pandemic rate at just 4.1%: **Hispanic unemployment fell by 4.5
    points in 2021 from 9.4% to 4.9 percent—the*** ****<u>largest
    calendar year drop</u>* on record – and has [fallen
    further](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000009) to 4.1% in
    April, *<u>below pre-pandemic levels</u>. *Following the official
    end of the Great Recession, Hispanic Unemployment took* *over six
    years after the end of the recession to reach pre-crisis levels. 
    -   **Hispanic employment is 618,000 above pre-pandemic: **When
        President Biden took office, Hispanic employment was still 2.1
        million below February 2020 levels. By April 2022, there were
        618,000 more employed Hispanic workers than pre-pandemic. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Hispanic Women’s Unemployment is down to 3.8%, below
        pre-pandemic levels: **Hispanic women’s unemployment has fallen
        from 8.8% in January 2021 to 3.8% in April 2022, below
        pre-pandemic rates. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Hispanic Teen Unemployment reached a record low in March 2022
        – and is below its pre-pandemic rate.**
-   **Asian American Unemployment – down to 3.1%: **Asian American
    unemployment has fallen from 6.6% in January 2021 to 3.1%
    —approaching pre-pandemic levels. Asian American unemployment
    averaged 5% or above each year from 2009 to 2014. 
-   **Unemployment in Rural Counties with Persistent
    Poverty: **Unemployment in rural counties with persistent poverty
    spiked in 2020 and remained above 6 percent through mid-summer
    2021—but by the end of 2021,
    it [fell](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/february/persistently-poor-rural-counties-experienced-lower-employment-impacts-from-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-but-have-higher-cumulative-covid-19-case-rates/) to
    4.2 percent—well below pre-pandemic levels.
-   **Youth Unemployment – record calendar year drop: **Youth employment
    among 16-24-year-olds
    is [down](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14024887) to 7.9
    percent, matching 2019 lows and roughly at pre-pandemic levels,
    after the *<u>largest calendar year drop on record</u>* in 2021. 
-   **More jobs were created in rural communities in 2021 than in any
    other year in the last two decades**.

<!-- -->

-   **Women’s Unemployment down to 3.5%:** Women’s unemployment
    has [fallen](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000002) from a
    peak of 16.1% in April 2020 to 3.5% **– **equal to its pre-pandemic
    level, and slightly lower than the unemployment rate for men. 
-   **Long-term Unemployment – record 12-month drop:** The number of
    Americans who were long-term
    unemployed [fell](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UEMP27OV) by
    2.8 million in the 12 months after the American Rescue Plan passed
    – *<u>the largest 12-month drop on record</u>*. 
-   **Stronger financial security for lower income families:**
    -   **J.P. Morgan Chase** data shows that families have more in
        their checking accounts than pre-pandemic, including the bottom
        25% of households
        who [ended](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/institute/research/household-income-spending/household-pulse-cash-balances-at-year-end) 2021
        with 65% more in the bank than in 2019. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **The Federal Reserve’s Report on the Economic Well-Being of
        U.S.
        Households** [found](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2021-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202205.pdf) that
        a higher share of Americans were financially secure in 2021 than
        in previous years:
        -   The highest share of Americans could cover a $400 emergency
            cash expense – up 18 points since 2013.

        <!-- -->

        -   The highest share of Americans – and the highest share of
            Black, Asian, Hispanic, and white Americans – reported that
            they were at least doing OK financially. 
-   **Credit Card Delinquencies – which usually hit low-income and Black
    and Latino borrowers hardest – are at record lows:** In the final
    three quarters of 2021, credit card delinquencies hit record lows as
    fewer Americans took on riskier debt (with less credit card debt
    than pre-pandemic). Credit card delinquencies disproportionately
    impact Black and Hispanic borrowers, according to the New York
    Federal
    Reserve’s [analysis](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/11/unequal-distribution-of-delinquencies-by-gender-race-and-education/) of
    15 years of consumer data on public and community college
    students.  ****
-   **Strong real income growth for Black and Hispanic workers: **The
    J.P. Morgan Chase Institute found that over the past two years since
    the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Black and Hispanic
    households experienced the highest real income growth trends, with
    Black households reaching about 7.5 percent annualized real income
    growth over the past two years.

**<u>Enhanced Child Tax Credit Led to Lowest Black and Hispanic Child
Poverty Rate Ever in 2021</u>**

-   **Child Tax Credit leading to record low child poverty
    rates: **Researchers project that the CTC will have been the leading
    factor in driving the child poverty rate to its lowest rate on
    record in 2021—and result in record low Hispanic and Black child
    poverty rates. ****
-   **Monthly CTC payments helped to reduce food insufficiency among
    low-income families by 25 percent.**
-   **The American Rescue Plan made half of Black Children and half of
    Hispanic Children eligible for the full expanded child tax credit
    who would have previously gotten only a partial credit**. Providing
    a full benefit to all but the highest income families is responsible
    for 88% of the Child Tax Credit’s poverty reduction.
-   **Historic and permanent expansion of the Child Tax Credit and
    Earned Income Tax Credit for Puerto Rico families – increasing CTC
    eligibility from 10% of Puerto Rico families to 97%.**
    -   Previously, only Puerto Rico families with three or more
        qualifying children qualified for any Child Tax Credit benefit.
        This meant that before the American Rescue Plan, only about 10%
        of Puerto Rico families qualified for any Child Tax Credit.

    <!-- -->

    -   The ARP permanently changed that policy to extend the CTC to
        Puerto Rico families with fewer than three qualifying children
        who were previously excluded. As a result of the ARP, 97% of
        Puerto Rico families with children are eligible for the 2021
        Child Tax Credit.

    <!-- -->

    -   In addition, the ARP provided the first-ever federal support for
        Puerto Rico’s local Earned Income Tax Credit – allowing Puerto
        Rico to more than triple EITC benefits and extend the EITC to
        more workers.

    <!-- -->

    -   All-out effort, in partnership with UnidosUS, government
        officials and non-profits and foundations from Washington D.C.
        to San Juan coordinated outreach and worked through barriers to
        get wide sign up for the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income
        Tax Credit
-   **Automatically enrolled hard to reach families with 729K children
    for the Child Tax Credit:** The Biden Administration made the policy
    choice to enroll all 729,000 children whose parents had signed up
    for stimulus payments but who had not recently filed a full return
    for monthly Child Tax Credit payments.
-   **All of Gov’t effort & critical partnerships to make it easier for
    eligible families to get assistance signing up for benefits:**
    -   **Launched ChildTaxCredit.gov** – a one-stop shop in English and
        Spanish for families to sign up for the CTC while working with
        non-profit and advocacy communities to mobilize outreach and tax
        filing assistance across the country 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Launched first ever non-filer portals for the CTC** –
        including one that is mobile friendly and available in Spanish.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Disproportionately helped rural communities: **The Center on
        Budget and Policy Priorities found that 94 percent of children
        who live in rural areas will benefit from this expansion of the
        CTC. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **American Rescue Plan also tripled EITC for 17 million workers
        without dependent children from $540 to $1500** – first increase
        since 1993 – and extended the credit to younger & older workers.
        -   **Helping millions of front-line workers:** This expansion
            will help nearly 1.8 million cashiers and retail
            salespeople; almost 1 million cooks and food prep workers;
            and more than 850,000 nurses and health aides, 500,000
            janitors, 400,000 truck and delivery drivers, and 300,000
            childcare workers.

**<u>Powering a Small Business Recovery that Reaches the Smallest
Businesses</u>**

-   **In 2021, a Record Number of Americans applied to start 5.4 million
    new businesses**—more than 20 percent higher than any previous year
    on record and more than two-thirds higher than the annual average of
    3.2 million new businesses applications per year in the five years
    prior to the start of the pandemic. 
-   **Increased Black, Hispanic, and Asian Entrepreneurship**: A March
    2022 [study](https://indicators.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/2021-Early-State-Entrepreneurship-National-Report.pdf) from
    the Kauffman Foundation found strong rates of business formation
    from Black, Hispanic, Asian Americans and immigrants.
    -   **Hispanic Business Formation was at the highest rate in more
        than a decade in 2021 and 23 percent faster than pre-pandemic
        levels. **

    <!-- -->

    -   **Asian American Entrepreneurship was the fastest rate in over a
        decade in 2021– **and 20% higher than pre-pandemic.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Black Entrepreneurship was 17% above pre-pandemic in 2021. **
        -   In early in 2020, Black-owned small businesses closed at
            twice the rate of other businesses, with 41 percent shutting
            down, according to April 2020 census data.

        <!-- -->

        -   A separate analysis found that in 2021, Black-owned small
            businesses were created at the fastest rate in at least 26
            years.
-   **Smallest businesses adding record number of jobs**. In the first
    three quarters of 2021, small businesses with fewer than 50
    employees created 1.9 million jobs, the fastest 9-month start in any
    year on record.
-   **Restaurant Revitalization Funds:** Nearly two-thirds of Restaurant
    Revitalization Funds went to businesses owned by women, veterans,
    and economically and socially disadvantaged individuals.
-   **Made PPP available to the smallest businesses and those in low-
    and moderate- income communities:**
    -   **Instituted A 14-Day Period During Which Only Businesses with
        Fewer Than 20 Employees Could Apply for Relief:** Ninety-eight
        percent of small businesses have fewer than 20 employees. This
        exclusive application period allowed lenders to focus on serving
        these smallest businesses, which often need additional time to
        navigate the paperwork entailed in completing applications.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Helping Sole Proprietors, Independent Contractors, and
        Self-Employed Individuals Receive More Financial
        Support: **Revised the loan calculation formula for these
        applicants to offer additional relief and established a $1
        billion funding pool for businesses in this category located in
        low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas who do not have any
        employees. A high percentage of Black business owners are sole
        proprietors. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Eliminated an Exclusionary Restriction that Prevented Small
        Business Owners Who Were Delinquent on Their Federal Student
        Loans** from Obtaining Relief Through the PPP.
-   **Historic Investment in Community Navigators to ensure the smallest
    businesses in low- and moderate- income communities could get
    assistance: **
    -   SBA awarded $100 million to 51 organizations selected as part of
        a rigorous review process to ensure geographic diversity and
        diversity of small business service segments. In turn, the 51
        grantee organizations are working with more than 400 hyperlocal
        organizations to connect America’s small businesses to SBA.

**<u>Equitable Housing Recovery</u>**

-   **Historic National Eviction Prevention – helping 5 million renter
    households: **First-ever national eviction assistance infrastructure
    has already made payments to over 5 million households and committed
    over $30 billion in assistance to cover back rent, prospective rent,
    and utilities. 
-   **In the eight months after the end of the CDC Eviction moratorium –
    eviction filings were 30% below historical averages – **instead of
    surging as experts feared. 
-   **Strong evidence that Emergency Rental Assistance has reached those
    most in need**
    -   **Over 80% of assistance went to the lowest-income
        families** (with incomes 50% or less of area median income)

    <!-- -->

    -   **60% of assistance went to Hispanic or Black renters**

    <!-- -->

    -   **Over two-thirds of assistance went to female-headed
        households**

    <!-- -->

    -   **Low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods saw the greatest
        absolute reduction in eviction filings**
-   **Increased Housing Stability Among Most Vulnerable Populations:**
    -   **Public Housing Authorities partnered with Continuum of Care
        organizations to distribute over 74% of the 70,000 new Emergency
        Housing Vouchers** made available to households experiencing, or
        at risk of, homelessness, domestic violence, or trafficking,
        disproportionately helping families of color. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **States and local jurisdictions are committing $5 billion in
        HOME-ARP funds to housing, rental assistance, supportive
        services** to prevent and address homelessness in hard-hit
        communities.
-   **Homeowner Protections and Critical Support lead to record low
    foreclosures:**
    -   **American Rescue Plan policies and Biden Administration
        policies helped drive foreclosures to record lowsin 2021 – at
        just 151,000 homes in foreclosure, less than a third of
        pre-pandemic levels, **and 95 percent below the 2010 peak in the
        aftermath of the Great Recession. Reducing foreclosures is
        critical for protecting Black and Hispanic families and their
        wealth. For several years during and following the Great
        Recession, foreclosure rates for Black and Hispanic homeowners
        was [two-to-three times
        larger](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/2017-02-15/the-homeownership-experience-of-minorities-during-the-great-recession.pdf) than
        for white homeowners. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Administration extended foreclosure moratoriums and
        forbearance options for nearly 11 million households**

    <!-- -->

    -   **ARP established a new $10 billion Homeowner Assistance
        Fund.** Treasury has disbursed over $9 billion to HAF programs
        nationwide to distribute to eligible homeowners, of which at
        least 60 percent of funds must be used for low income
        homeowners. As of May 23, 2022, 44 states and territories have
        opened their programs to applicants, 5 states and the District
        of Columbia are operating pilot programs, and Treasury has
        approved all but two HAF plans.

**<u>Provided $130 Billion To Keep Schools Open Safely and Address
Students’ Academic and Mental Health Needs</u>**

-   **American Rescue Plan’s $122 billion in K-12 to reopen schools,
    address learning loss, and address student mental health, with a
    strong equity focus: **The American Rescue Plan provided $122
    billion to keep schools open safely, combat learning loss and
    address student mental health, with funds allocated based on which
    school districts have students with the greatest needs. These
    resources are addressing critical local needs like teachers and
    counselors—particularly for students who were disproportionately
    impacted by the pandemic.
    -   **Safely Reopened Nearly 100% of Schools—Up From 46% Open Before
        American Rescue Plan—Helping Address Inequities of Remote
        Learning: **Thanks to the resources provided by the American
        Rescue Plan, nearly 100% of schools are now open safely for
        full-time, in-person instruction—up from 46% open before the
        American Rescue Plan. Keeping schools open safely is
        helping address the inequities of remote learning, such as Black
        and Hispanic students being more likely to remain remote through
        late 2020 and less likely to have what they needed to learn
        effectively. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Cut Education Staff Shortages in Half:** When When the
        President took office, there were 624,000 fewer staff working in
        our schools than before the pandemic. Thanks to the American
        Rescue Plan, as of April, more than 300,000 of these jobs have
        been created, including new teachers, counselors and school
        staff—cutting that gap nearly in half. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Sevenfold Increase in Spending, Helping Get Resources into
        High-Need Classrooms Quickly:** The American Rescue Plan has
        accelerated emergency education spending sevenfold this school
        year, ensuring these critical resources reach students with the
        greatest needs quickly.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Independent Analysis Shows Planned Spending on Critical
        Resources for High-Need Students: **Independent analysis by
        Georgetown University’s FutureEd of nearly 4,000 district plans
        covering over 60% of American Rescue Plan’s K-12 funding shows
        nearly 60% of funding is planned to address staffing, academic
        recovery, and mental and physical health. Because of how funding
        was allocated, this planned spending will benefit schools
        serving students the greatest needs.

<!-- -->

-   **The American Rescue Plan invested $800 million to create a new
    Homeless Children and Youth Fund provide wrap-around services to
    children experiencing homelessness, and enable them to attend and
    fully participate in school.**
-   **The American Rescue Plan provided $3 billion in additional funding
    for students with disabilities: **These funds are being used to
    provide equitable, high-quality, and inclusive services to children
    with disabilities and their families – a critical need especially
    after COVID-19 exacerbated existing challenges experienced by states
    and school systems.

**<u>Keeping America’s College Students Enrolled and On Track to
Graduate</u>**

The American Rescue Plan ‘s Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund
provided **more than $10 billion to community colleges and their
students**, and the **<u>largest ever one-time investment – $2.7 billion
– in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and their
students</u>**. Other investments include:

-   **Approximately $190 million to Tribal Colleges and Universities**
-   **Approximately $11 billion to Hispanic-Serving Institutions **
-   **$5 billion to Asian American and Native American Pacific
    Islander-Serving Institutions**
-   **Colleges and universities are required to dedicate roughly half of
    these funds toward emergency financial aid grants directly to
    students. The Department of Education expects a greater proportion
    of funds will ultimately be provided directly to students. **

**<u>Helping Hard-Pressed Families Reduce Utilities Costs and Avoid
Shutoffs</u>**

-   **Low-Income Home Emergency Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is on track
    to serve more households in FY 2022 than in any prior year in the
    program’s 41-year history. **The American Rescue Plan provided $4.5
    billion to more than double typical LIHEAP funding to modest and
    lower-income working families and seniors. The Biden-Harris
    Administration’s record funding for LIHEAP is combating the strain
    of the pandemic for low-income households and communities of color
    who disproportionately face [high energy
    burdens](https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/u2006.pdf) –
    with Black households spending 32% more of their income on energy,
    Native American households spending 35% more of their income, and
    Hispanic households spending 13% more of their income on energy than
    the median household. 
    -   **Coordinated efforts to ensure benefits reached families
        quickly:** The White House called on grantees to prioritize
        quick and automatic distribution of LIHEAP benefits and led
        expanded outreach to households, including Spanish-speaking
        families and communities of color.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Led call to action to prevent shutoffs and expedite delivery
        of aid: **The White House has announced commitments from 14
        major utility companies across the country, as well as a major
        delivered fuel trade association, to prevent devastating utility
        shutoffs and expedite the delivery of unprecedented aid.
-   **First-ever national Low Income Water Assistance to provide
    critical nationwide water support:** The American Rescue Plan funded
    the first-ever federal program for water assistance. The U.S.
    Department of Health and Human Services has allocated over $1
    billion of available LIHWAP funds to 49 states, over 100 Tribes,
    five territories and the District of Columbia. 
    -   **Water affordability concerns and growing household
        indebtedness disproportionately impacts low-income individuals
        and communities of color** and can lead to multiple adverse
        household impacts such as service disconnections, home
        foreclosures, and evictions.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Prioritized populations that often experience the greatest
        barriers in accessing social service programs,**including:
        households with low incomes that included seniors, persons with
        disabilities and households with children under five years old. 

**<u>Closing Health Disparities</u>**

-   **Record number of enrollments into health coverage thanks to
    American Rescue Plan’s expansion of insurance subsidies: **Over 14.5
    million consumers selected or were automatically re-enrolled in
    health insurance coverage during the 2022 Open Enrollment Period – a
    21% increase compared to the 2021 Open Enrollment Period, which
    ended December 15, 2020 during the last Administration. 
    -   **Biden Administration efforts and expanded American Rescue Plan
        subsidies helped lead to 26% increase in Hispanic enrollment and
        35% increase in Black enrollment in health coverage on
        HealthCare.gov.**

    <!-- -->

    -   **Increased access to low-cost health coverage for uninsured
        Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders (AA and
        NHPIs):** 197,000 uninsured AA and NHPIs became newly eligible
        for premium savings through the American Rescue Plan’s expanded
        subsidies. 
-   **The American Rescue Plan is providing states with a new option to
    extend postpartum health coverage from 60 days up to 12 months.**
    -   This Medicaid state option helps postpartum individuals maintain
        health care coverage in an effort to reduce maternal morbidity
        and mortality and to improve well-baby milestones – which
        disproportionately impacts Black and American Indian and Alaskan
        Native women. 

    <!-- -->

    -   Many maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period and are
        considered preventable with appropriate follow-up care – the CDC
        has found that 66 percent of postpartum deaths are preventable.
-   **The American Rescue Plan Invested $1.5 billion Towards the
    Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse:** These funds are
    helping to address the estimated one in five older adults in the
    United States currently experiencing depression, anxiety, insomnia,
    substance use, or another mental health disorder, with higher rates
    of drug overdose deaths among black men. Programs are required to
    target underserved populations, including but not limited to,
    pregnant women and women with dependent children; persons using
    opioids and/or stimulant drugs associated with drug overdoses;
    persons at risk for HIV, TB, and Hepatitis; LGBTQ individuals; rural
    populations; and other underserved groups.
-   **Historic Investment of $25 Billion in Home and Community-Based
    Services (HCBS) To Expand Availability of Services: **HCBS help
    older adults and individuals with disabilities live independently
    outside of institutionalized settings. To date, nearly 8 million
    beneficiaries have received HCBS services under the American Rescue
    Plan. The American Rescue Plan is also funding longer-term
    investments to grow the pipeline of HCBS workers, as well as
    increase compensation and improve job quality for these workers –
    who are disproportionately women of color.

**<u>Reducing Hunger</u>**

-   **Reached over 30 million children with the first-ever nationwide
    Summer EBT program**
    -   States estimate they were able to issue EBT cards (or add
        benefits to existing cards) to the families of well over 30
        million children in the summer of 2021, helping children access
        meals when not in school.
    -   The ARP Summer EBT program was critical to ensuring equitable
        response to food insecurity. While children from low-income
        families and children of color take advantage of their schools’
        lunch and breakfast programs, a relatively small fraction who
        participate in free and reduced lunch during the school year
        typically access summer feeding programs. 

<!-- -->

-   **The American Rescue Plan extended P-EBT through the end of the
    COVID-19 public health emergency and expanded access to
    territories: **The ARP provided a guarantee that low-income
    pre-school-age children in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the
    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have access to P-EBT
    benefits on the same terms as children in all other states and
    territories.
-   **Increasing WIC Participation –disproportionately helping
    low-income, families of color and at-risk pregnant and postpartum
    women and their children**
    -   **USDA has allocated $250 million in funding to support
        increased participant enrollment and retention and $120 million
        to reduce disparities in program delivery**. Between 2016 and
        2018, the overall WIC participation
        rate [declined](https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/eligibility-and-coverage-rates-2018) from
        48% to 45%. WIC disproportionately supports Black and Hispanic
        families – with 4.4 million Hispanic, 2.4 million Black, and 1
        million people of other/multi-races qualifying for the program
        in 2018.
    -   Evidence shows that WIC is one of the most powerful
        evidence-based public health interventions available and is
        uniquely positioned to reduce racial disparities in maternal and
        child health outcomes.

**<u>Revitalizing Local Economies Across the Country</u>**

-   **The American Rescue Plan Provided $3 Billion in Grants Distributed
    by the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration
    (EDA) to build local economies that are resilient to future economic
    shocks. These funds are already powering an equitable recovery:**
    -   **$300 million to revitalize hard-hit energy
        communities **through the Coal Communities Commitment, building
        on the work of President Biden’s [Interagency Working
        Group](https://energycommunities.gov/) on Coal and Power Plant
        Communities and Economic Revitalization to deliver Federal
        resources and assistance to the communities that have powered
        America for generations. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **$1 billion Build Back Better Regional Challenge is reaching
        communities across the country: **60 finalist coalitions have
        received $500,000 each and are competing for up to $100 million
        in additional funding. Finalists include 12 coal communities and
        15 Indigenous Communities. In addition, more than 80% of the
        finalists propose to serve rural communities. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Dedicated Funding for Underserved Workers Through $500 million
        Good Jobs Challenge:** This program will provide skill building
        opportunities and connect unemployed or underemployed workers to
        job opportunities, including by encouraging efforts to reach
        underserved communities, women, and other groups facing labor
        market barriers. EDA received 509 applications across all states
        and territories for the Good Jobs Challenge and will be making
        25 to 50 awards in Summer 2022.

    -   **First-ever Native American Dedicated Funding at EDA: **$100
        million Indigenous Communities program is the first dedicated
        funding for Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native
        Pacific Islanders in EDA’s history.

**<u>Historic Investment in Tribal Communities </u>**

-   **Historic Tribal funding: **ARP allocated $32 billion to Tribal
    governments, including $20 billion in State and Local Fiscal
    Recovery Funds—a historic financial level of support for over 580
    Tribal governments and the largest amount of funding to Tribal
    governments in ARP.
-   **Significant Progress Towards Equitable Recovery in Indian
    Country: **
    -   **Over 2,700 Tribal Projects Utilizing State and Local Fiscal
        Recovery Funds: **To date, Tribal governments have obligated
        funds to nearly 900 projects that address the negative economic
        impacts of COVID and over 1,800 other projects that are helping
        Indian Country recover and strengthen capacity.

    -   **25% Indigenous Communities Among EDA Build Back Better
        Regional Challenge Finalists: **Among the 60 finalist coalitions
        that have received $500,000 each and are competing for up to
        $100 million in additional funding, 15 represent Indigenous
        Communities.

    -   **Reallocated Additional $20 Million In Emergency Rental
        Assistance Funding to Tribes**
-   **Conducted significant targeted outreach and consultations and
    partnered with Tribal organizations to engage all Tribal
    governments**—**including those with lower capacity and the greatest
    needs.**
-   **Provided key flexibilities across programs to reduce unnecessary
    paperwork burdens and ensure Tribes are able to focus on recovery
    efforts. These included: **
    -   Standard Tribal allowance of up to $10 million in State and
        Local Fiscal Recovery Funds for most flexible uses

    <!-- -->

    -   Expanded allowable use of State and Local Fiscal Recovery funds
        for broadband, water, and sewer infrastructure improvements

    <!-- -->

    -   Simplified and streamlined reporting requirements for smaller,
        low-capacity Tribes.
