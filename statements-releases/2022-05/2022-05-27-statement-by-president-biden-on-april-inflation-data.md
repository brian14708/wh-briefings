title: "Statement by President\_Biden on April Inflation\_Data"

This morning’s decline in inflation is a sign of progress, even as we
have more work to do. The report showed annual inflation declining and
average monthly core inflation at around 4% at an annual rate, down from
around 6% in the three months before it. At the same time, inflation is
still too high and Putin’s price hike continues to impact food and
energy prices. There is more work to do and tackling inflation is my top
economic priority. My plan is to give The Federal Reserve the
independence it needs to do its job, lower families’ costs, and lower
the federal deficit. Congressional Republicans have a different economic
plan, which would increase taxes on working families and put
programs like Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every
five years. That’s not the way forward to transition from what has been
an historic economic recovery to stable, steady growth that works for
working families.
