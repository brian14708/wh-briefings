title: "White\_House Announces Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health in\_September"
---
 
Today, President Biden is announcing that for the first time in over 50
years, the White House will host a Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and
Health this September. The Conference, and the preparatory work leading
up to it, will accelerate progress and drive significant change to end
hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, reduce diet-related
disease, and close the disparities around them. 

The Biden-Harris Administration has set a goal of ending hunger and
increasing healthy eating and physical activity in the U.S. by 2030 so
that fewer Americans experience diet-related diseases, such as diabetes,
obesity, and hypertension. The Conference will galvanize action
by anti-hunger and nutrition advocates; food companies; the health care
community; local, state, territorial and Tribal governments; people with
lived experiences; and all Americans, and it will launch a national plan
outlining how we achieve this goal.

“Hunger, diet-related disease, and the disparities surrounding them
impact millions of Americans, and the COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight
on the urgency of addressing these issues. No one should have to wonder
where their next meal will come from. We must take bold steps
now—with government, the private sector, non-profits, and communities
working together—to build a healthier future for every American.” —
Ambassador Susan E. Rice, Domestic Policy Advisor

The first White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health in 1969
was a pivotal event that influenced the country’s food policy agenda for
the next 50 years. The President sets out to do the same with this
year’s Conference. 

Leading up to the Conference, the Biden-Harris Administration will host
listening sessions so that we can hear from every region of the
country.  Anyone with ideas will soon be able to share their stories to
help inform the national plan. For more information,
