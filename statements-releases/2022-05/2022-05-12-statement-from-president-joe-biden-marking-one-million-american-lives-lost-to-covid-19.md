title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Marking One Million American Lives Lost\
  \ to\_COVID-\u206019"

Today, we mark a tragic milestone: one million American lives lost to
COVID-19. One million empty chairs around the dinner table. Each an
irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a
nation forever changed because of this pandemic. Jill and I pray for
each of them.

To those who are grieving, and asking yourself how will you go on
without him or what will you do without her, I understand. I know the
pain of that black hole in your heart. It is unrelenting. But I also
know the ones you love are never truly gone. They will always be with
you.

As a nation, we must not grow numb to such sorrow. To heal, we must
remember. We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do
everything we can to save as many lives as possible, as we have with
more testing, vaccines, and treatments than ever before. It’s critical
that Congress sustain these resources in the coming months.  

In remembrance, let us draw strength from each other as fellow
Americans. For while we have been humbled, we never give up. We can and
will do this together as the United States of America.

May God bless the one million American lives lost and their loved ones
left behind.
