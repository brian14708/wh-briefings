The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) held its second
ministerial meeting in Saclay – Paris, France on May 15-16, 2022. U.S.
co-chairs, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of Commerce
Gina Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai were
joined by EU Co-Chairs European Commission Executive Vice Presidents
Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis to review progress, meet with
a range of U.S. and EU stakeholders, and advance Transatlantic
cooperation and democratic approaches to trade, technology, and security
that deliver for people on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Thanks to the close and enduring ties between the United States and the
European Union, we have resolved long-standing bilateral issues,
including disagreements on tariffs, and leveraged the strength of our
partnership to counter non-market, trade distortive practices, and
respond swiftly to Putin’s war with unprecedented sanctions and export
control measures. Building on these successes, the United States and
European Union, home to 780 million people who share democratic values
and the largest economic relationship in the world, will advance the TTC
agenda on a number of critical economic and technology policies and
initiatives designed to strengthen our bilateral economies, meet current
geopolitical challenges and update the rules of the global economy.

TTC working groups are deepening U.S.-EU cooperation by expanding access
to digital tools for small- and medium-sized enterprises and securing
critical supply chains such as semiconductors. They are collaborating
closely on emerging technology standards, climate and clean tech
objectives data governance and technology platforms, information and
communications technology services’ (ICTS) security and competitiveness,
and the misuse of technology threatening security and human rights. The
TTC working groups are also coordinating on export controls, investment
screening and security risks, and a range of global trade challenges,
including countering the harmful impact of non-market, trade-distortive
policies and practices on technological development and competitiveness
in sectors of shared priority. To ensure that the government dialogues
are informed by the broad perspectives of the U.S. and EU communities
inform their work, the TTC working groups are continuing robust
engagement with a diverse range of stakeholders, including those in
industry, labor organizations, think tanks, non-profit organizations,
environmental constituencies, academics, and other civil society
members.

During their ministerial meeting, the U.S. and EU TTC co-chairs reviewed
the outcomes generated by the joint working groups and announced key
outcomes including:

-   Deeper information exchange on exports of critical U.S. and EU
    technology, with an initial focus on Russia and other potential
    sanctions evaders, coordination of U.S. and EU licensing policies,
    and cooperation with partners beyond the United States and the
    European Union;
-   Development of a joint roadmap on evaluation and measurement tools
    for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence and risk management, as well
    as a common project on privacy-enhancing technologies;
-   Creation of a U.S.-EU Strategic Standardization Information (SSI)
    mechanism to enable information sharing on international standards
    development;
-   An early warning system to better predict and address potential
    semiconductor supply chain disruptions as well as a Transatlantic
    approach to semiconductor investment aimed at ensuring security of
    supply and avoiding subsidy races;
-   A dedicated taskforce to promote the use of trusted/non-high-risk
    ICTS suppliers through financing for deployments in third countries;
-   A new Cooperation Framework on issues related to information
    integrity in crises, particularly on digital platforms, with a focus
    on ongoing issues related to Russian aggression, including Russia’s
    actions to manipulate and censor information;
-   A stakeholder-focused Trade and Labor Dialogue to discuss policy
    options to promote internationally recognized labor rights and to
    help workers and firms make successful digital and green
    transitions, remain globally competitive, and enjoy broad and
    inclusive prosperity;
-   An early dialogue on shared trade concerns regarding third-countries
    measures or initiatives and an early stage consultation mechanism
    regarding bilateral barriers that may disadvantage the transatlantic
    economy;
-   A policy dialogue aimed at developing responses to global food
    security challenges caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine; and
-   A [U.S.-EU guide](https://www.trade.gov/useuttc-cybersecurity) to
    cybersecurity best practices for small- and medium-sized companies,
    whose business is impacted disproportionally from cyber threats.
