title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Mass Shooting in Buffalo, New\_York"
---
 
Tonight, we grieve for the families of ten people whose lives were
senselessly taken and everyone who is suffering the physical and
emotional wounds of this horrific shooting. We are grateful for the
bravery of members of law enforcement and other first responders who
took immediate action to try to protect and save lives. The First Lady
and I are praying for the victims and their families, and hearts all
across this country are with the people of Buffalo.

We still need to learn more about the motivation for today’s shooting as
law enforcement does its work, but we don’t need anything else to state
a clear moral truth: A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the
very fabric of this nation. Any act of domestic terrorism, including an
act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology,
is antithetical to everything we stand for in America. Hate must have no
safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled
domestic terrorism.
