title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan election\
  \ as President of the United Arab\_Emirates"

I congratulate my long-time friend Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan
on his election as President of the United Arab Emirates.  As I told
Sheikh Mohammed yesterday during our phone call, the United States is
determined to honor the memory of the late president Sheikh Khalifa bin
Zayed Al Nahyan by continuing to strengthen the strategic partnership
between our countries over the coming months and years. The UAE is an
essential partner of the United States.  Sheikh Mohammed, whom I met
with several times as Vice President when he was the Crown Prince of Abu
Dhabi, has long been at the forefront of building this partnership. I
look forward to working with Sheikh Mohammed to build from this
extraordinary foundation to further strengthen the bonds between our
countries and peoples.
