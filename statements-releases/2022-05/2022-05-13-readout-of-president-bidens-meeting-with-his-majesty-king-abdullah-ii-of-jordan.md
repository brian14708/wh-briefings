President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with His Majesty King Abdullah
II of Jordan and reaffirmed the close and enduring nature of the
friendship between the United States and Jordan.  Jordan is a critical
ally and force for stability in the Middle East, and the President
confirmed unwavering U.S. support for Jordan and His Majesty’s
leadership.  The leaders consulted on recent events in the region and
discussed urgent mechanisms to stem violence, calm rhetoric and reduce
tensions in Israel and the West Bank. The President affirmed his strong
support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and
cited the need to preserve the historic status quo at the Haram
al-Sharif/Temple Mount. The President also recognized the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan’s crucial role as the custodian of Muslim holy places
in Jerusalem. The leaders discussed the political and economic benefits
of further regional integration in infrastructure, energy, water, and
climate projects, with Jordan a critical hub for such cooperation and
investment.  They agreed to remain in regular touch and further enhance
the historic ties between our countries.
