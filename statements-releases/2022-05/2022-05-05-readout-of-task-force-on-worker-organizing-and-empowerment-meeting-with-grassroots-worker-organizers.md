title: "Readout of Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment Meeting with Grassroots\
  \ Worker\_Organizers"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh held
a roundtable discussion with a diverse group of young, grassroots worker
organizers to discuss their extraordinary efforts to organize unions in
their workplaces, and how their efforts can inspire workers across the
country to make the choice to join or organize a union. The roundtable
was led by the Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, which
the Vice President chairs with Secretary Walsh as vice-chair.

President Biden stopped by the discussion and thanked the worker
organizers for their leadership in organizing unions, the inspiration
they offer to workers across the country who may want to organize, and
their contributions to the worker organizing momentum that is growing
across the country.

Vice President Harris and Secretary Walsh listened to the worker
organizers tell the stories of why they and their co-workers organized
unions in their workplaces and how they did it. Among other things, the
workers talked about fair pay, paid leave and health care benefits,
their commitment to co-workers, and the desire for basic dignity and
respect as important motivators for their organizing efforts. They also
described some of the anti-union tactics deployed by some of the
employers. The Vice President and Secretary Walsh reaffirmed that the
Biden-Harris Administration is the most pro-union administration in
history, and reiterated that worker power is at the core of this
administration’s economic vision to rebuild the economy from the bottom
up and middle out. As we experience an historically strong labor market
recovery, Vice President Harris and Secretary Walsh underscored that all
workers must benefit and get the dignity and respect they deserve in the
workplace. 

The attendees represented a wide range of industries with grassroots
union organizing efforts, from warehousing to animation to retail.
Attendees included Vice President Harris, Secretary Walsh, Christian
Smalls, Amazon Labor Union, Laura Garza, Starbucks Workers
United/Starbucks, Alex Speidel, United Paizo Workers/CWA, Rachel
Gitlevich, Titmouse productions/IATSE, Jaimie Caldwell, Baltimore Public
Library/IAM, and Damien Sowell, REI/UFCW-RWDSU.
