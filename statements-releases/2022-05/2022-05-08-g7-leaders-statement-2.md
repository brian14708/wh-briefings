title: "G7 Leaders\u2019 Statement"
---
 
1.  Today, on 8 May, we, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7),
    alongside Ukraine and the wider global community, commemorate the
    end of the Second World War in Europe and the liberation from
    fascism and the National Socialist reign of terror, which caused
    immeasurable destruction, unspeakable horrors and human suffering.
    We mourn the millions of victims and offer our respect, especially
    to all those who paid the ultimate price to defeat the National
    Socialist regime, including the western Allies and the Soviet Union.
2.  Seventy-seven years later, President Putin and his regime now chose
    to invade Ukraine in an unprovoked war of aggression against a
    sovereign country. His actions bring shame on Russia and the
    historic sacrifices of its people. Through its invasion of and
    actions in Ukraine since 2014, Russia has violated the international
    rules-based order, particularly the UN Charter, conceived after the
    Second World War to spare successive generations from the scourge of
    war.
3.  Today, we were honoured to be joined by Ukraine’s President
    Volodymyr Zelenskyy. We assured him of our full solidarity and
    support for Ukraine’s courageous defence of its sovereignty and
    territorial integrity, and its fight for a peaceful, prosperous and
    democratic future within its internationally recognised borders,
    with the liberties and freedoms that so many of us enjoy today.
4.  President Zelenskyy underlined the strong resolve of Ukraine to
    protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. He stated that
    Ukraine’s ultimate aim is to ensure full withdrawal of Russia’s
    military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine
    and to secure its ability to protect itself in the future and
    thanked G7 members for their support. In this regard, Ukraine
    emphasised that it relies on its international partners, in
    particular on G7 members, in providing necessary assistance in the
    domain of defense capabilities, as well as with a view to ensuring a
    swift and effective recovery of Ukraine’s economy and to securing
    its economic and energy security. Ukraine has entered into
    discussions with international partners on security mechanisms for a
    viable post-war peace settlement. Ukraine remains committed to
    working closely with G7 members to support Ukraine’s macroeconomic
    stability in the face of the challenges posed by the full-scaled
    Russian invasion, massive destruction of critical infrastructure and
    disruption of traditional shipping routes for Ukrainian exports.
    President Zelenskyy noted his country’s commitment to uphold our
    common democratic values and principles, including respect for human
    rights and the rule of law.
5.  Today, we, the G7, reassured President Zelenskyy of our continued
    readiness to undertake further commitments to help Ukraine secure
    its free and democratic future, such that Ukraine can defend itself
    now and deter future acts of aggression. To this end, we will pursue
    our ongoing military and defence assistance to the Ukrainian Armed
    Forces, continue supporting Ukraine in defending its networks
    against cyber incidents, and expand our cooperation, including on
    information security. We will continue to support Ukraine in
    increasing its economic and energy security.
6.  Together with the international community, we, the G7, have provided
    and pledged additional support since the start of the war exceeding
    USD 24 billion for 2022 and beyond, in both financial and material
    means. In the coming weeks, we will step up our collective
    short-term financial support to help Ukraine close financing gaps
    and deliver basic services to its people, while also developing
    options – working with the Ukrainian authorities and international
    financial institutions – to support long-term recovery and
    reconstruction. In this regard, we welcome the establishment of the
    International Monetary Fund’s Multi-Donor Administered Account for
    Ukraine and the European Union announcement to develop a Ukraine
    Solidarity Trust Fund. We support the World Bank Group’s support
    package to Ukraine and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
    Development’s Resilience Package.
7.  We call on all partners to join our support for the Ukrainian people
    and for refugees, and to help Ukraine to rebuild its future.
8.  We reiterate our condemnation of Russia’s unprovoked, unjustifiable
    and illegal military aggression against Ukraine and the
    indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian
    infrastructure, which has resulted in terrible humanitarian
    catastrophe in the heart of Europe. We are appalled by the
    large-scale loss of human life, assault on human rights, and
    destruction that Russia’s actions have inflicted on Ukraine.
9.  Under no circumstances can civilians and those not taking an active
    part in the hostilities be legitimate targets. We will spare no
    effort to hold President Putin and the architects and accomplices of
    this aggression, including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus,
    accountable for their actions in accordance with international law.
    To this end, we will continue to work together, along with our
    allies and partners around the world. We reaffirm our support for
    all efforts to ensure full accountability. We welcome and support
    the ongoing work to investigate and gather evidence on this,
    including by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, the
    independent investigation commission mandated by the United Nations
    Human Rights Council and the Organization for Security and
    Co-operation in Europe’s mission of experts.
10. We further condemn Russia’s attempts to replace democratically
    elected Ukrainian local authorities with illegitimate ones. We will
    not recognise these acts in violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and
    territorial integrity.
11. We will continue to counter the Russian strategy of disinformation,
    which deliberately manipulates the global – including the Russian –
    public in the hope of shrouding the Russian regime’s culpability for
    this war.
12. Our unprecedented package of coordinated sanctions has already
    significantly hindered Russia’s war of aggression by limiting access
    to financial channels and ability to pursue their objectives. These
    restrictive measures are already having a significant impact on all
    Russian economic sectors – financial, trade, defence, technology,
    and energy – and will intensify pressure on Russia over time. We
    will continue to impose severe and immediate economic costs on
    President Putin’s regime for this unjustifiable war. We collectively
    commit to taking the following measures, consistent with our
    respective legal authorities and processes:  
      
    a. First, we commit to phase out our dependency on Russian energy,
    including by phasing out or banning the import of Russian oil. We
    will ensure that we do so in a timely and orderly fashion, and in
    ways that provide time for the world to secure alternative supplies.
    As we do so, we will work together and with our partners to ensure
    stable and sustainable global energy supplies and affordable prices
    for consumers, including by accelerating reduction of our overall
    reliance on fossil fuels and our transition to clean energy in
    accordance with our climate objectives.  
      
    b. Second, we will take measures to prohibit or otherwise prevent
    the provision of key services on which Russia depends. This will
    reinforce Russia’s isolation across all sectors of its economy.  
      
    c. Third, we will continue to take action against Russian banks
    connected to the global economy and systemically critical to the
    Russian financial system. We have already severely impaired Russia’s
    ability to finance its war of aggression by targeting its Central
    Bank and its largest financial institutions.  
      
    d. Fourth, we will continue our efforts to fight off the Russian
    regime’s attempts to spread its propaganda. Respectable private
    companies should not provide revenue to the Russian regime or to its
    affiliates feeding the Russian war machine.  
      
    e. Fifth, we will continue and elevate our campaign against the
    financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in
    his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people.
    Consistent with our national authorities, we will impose sanctions
    on additional individuals.
13. We continue to work with our international partners and invite them
    to stand with us and to follow suit with similar actions, including
    to prevent sanctions evasion, circumvention and backfilling.
14. President Putin’s war is causing global economic disruptions,
    impacting the security of global energy supply, fertiliser and food
    provision, and the functioning of global supply chains in general.
    The most vulnerable countries are affected most severely. Together
    with partners globally, we are stepping up our efforts to counter
    these adverse and harmful impacts of this war.
15. President Putin’s war against Ukraine is placing global food
    security under severe strain. Together with the United Nations, we
    call on Russia to end its blockade and all other activities that
    further impede Ukrainian food production and exports, in line with
    its international commitments. Failure to do so will be seen as an
    attack on feeding the world. We will step up efforts to help Ukraine
    to keep producing in view of the next harvest season and exporting,
    including by alternative routes.
16. In support of the United Nations Global Crises Response Group, we
    will address the causes and consequences of the global food crisis
    through a Global Alliance for Food Security, as our joint initiative
    to ensure momentum and coordination, and other efforts. We will
    closely cooperate with international partners and organisations
    beyond the G7, and, with the aim of transforming political
    commitments into concrete actions as planned by various
    international initiatives such as the Food and Agriculture
    Resilience Mission (FARM) and key regional outreach initiatives,
    including towards African and Mediterranean countries. We reiterate
    that our sanctions packages are carefully targeted so as not to
    impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance or the trade of
    agricultural products and reaffirm our commitment to avoid food
    export restrictions which impact the most vulnerable.
17. The G7 and Ukraine stand united in this difficult time and in their
    quest to ensure Ukraine’s democratic, prosperous future. We remain
    united in our resolve that President Putin must not win his war
    against Ukraine. We owe it to the memory of all those who fought for
    freedom in the Second World War, to continue fighting for it today,
    for the people of Ukraine, Europe and the global community.
