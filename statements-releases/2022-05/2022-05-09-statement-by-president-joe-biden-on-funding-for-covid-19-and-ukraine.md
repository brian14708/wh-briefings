title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Funding for COVID-\u206019 and\_Ukraine"

Ten days ago, I sent to Congress an urgent proposal to provide needed
military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.  The plan
was substantial in size, because the need is substantial:  we must stand
by Ukraine as it defends itself from Russian aggression.  
   
The need is also urgent: I have nearly exhausted the resources given to
me by a bipartisan majority in Congress to support Ukraine’s fighters. 
This aid has been critical to Ukraine’s success on the battlefield.  We
cannot allow our shipments of assistance to stop while we await further
Congressional action.  We are approximately ten days from hitting this
critical deadline.   
   
I am pleased that, in my conversations with Congressional leaders, there
appears to be strong support for the proposal I submitted, and Congress
is likely to pass it in substantially the form I proposed.  I urge them
to do so, and again, I urge them to do so quickly.   
   
Previously, I had recommended that Congress take overdue action on much
needed funding for COVID treatments, vaccines and tests, as part of the
Ukraine Supplemental bill.  However, I have been informed by
Congressional leaders in both parties that such an addition would slow
down action on the urgently needed Ukrainian aid – a view expressed
strongly by several Congressional Republicans.  We cannot afford delay
in this vital war effort.  Hence, I am prepared to accept that these two
measures move separately, so that the Ukrainian aid bill can get to my
desk right away.  
   
However let me be clear:  as vital as it is to help Ukraine combat
Russian aggression, it is equally vital to help Americans combat COVID. 
Without timely COVID funding, more Americans will die needlessly.  We
will lose our place in line for America to order new COVID treatments
and vaccines for the fall, including next-generation vaccines under
development, and be unable to maintain our supply of COVID tests.  In
the fall, if we are hit by new variants, it will be too late to get the
tools needed for protection – critical treatments that will be available
in Europe, but not the United States.  In addition, our effort to help
lower-income countries get COVID vaccines into arms will stall.   
   
So I call on Congress to pass the Ukrainian Supplemental funding bill
immediately, and get it to my desk in the next few days.  And then, I
urge Congress to move promptly on the COVID funding bill.  This virus
knows no borders; we must continue to save lives here at home and around
the world.
