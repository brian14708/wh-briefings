title: "Statement from President\_Biden after Senate Confirmation of Federal Reserve\_\
  Nominees"
---
 
I have made it clear that tackling inflation is my top domestic
priority.Â So I am pleased to see the Senate take a step forward on my
agenda to get inflation under control by confirming my nominees to the
Fed. I want to thank the Senate for confirming Jerome Powell, Dr. Lisa
Cook, and Dr. Philip Jefferson this week, joining the recent
confirmation of Dr. Lael Brainard. The Federal Reserve plays a primary
role in fighting inflation, and these well-qualified members of the
Board will bring the skill and knowledge needed at this critical time
for our economy and families across the country. We still have more work
to do to finish filling the Fed Board, which is why I call on the Senate
to swiftly confirm Michael Barr, my nominee for Vice Chair for
Supervision.
