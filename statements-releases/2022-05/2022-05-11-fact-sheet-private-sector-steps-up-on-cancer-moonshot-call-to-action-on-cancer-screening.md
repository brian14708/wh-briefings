title: "FACT SHEET: Private Sector Steps Up on Cancer Moonshot Call to Action on Cancer\_\
  Screening"
---
 
*The White House announces private sector commitments in response to the
call to action from President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden on cancer
screening. These new actions and collaborations mark progress toward the
Cancer Moonshot goal to decrease the death rate from cancer by at least
50 percent over the next 25 years. *

Just under 100 days ago, President Biden reignited the Cancer Moonshot
with renewed White House leadership and new ambitious goals: to reduce
the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25
years, and improve the experience of people and their families living
with and surviving cancer – and, by doing this and more, [end cancer as
we know it
today](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-reignites-cancer-moonshot-to-end-cancer-as-we-know-it/).

In March, in his first State of the Union Address, President Biden
highlighted the Cancer Moonshot as part of his Unity Agenda for the
nation. The White House convened the Cancer Cabinet to establish a
prioritized agenda across government including the development of new
interagency programs and collaborations and announced [initial steps for
the Cancer
Moonshot](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/03/17/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-initial-steps-for-reignited-cancer-moonshot/). 

Last week, Cancer Cabinet agencies and departments hosted a virtual
series of 10 roundtable discussions, [Cancer Moonshot Community
Conversations](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cancermoonshot/events-and-webinars/past-events/),
to inform and advance Cancer Moonshot priorities and the White House
released a new webpage featuring the [stories of
people](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cancermoonshot/yourstories/) living
with cancer, survivors, and caregivers. 

Today, leaders from the patient and caregiver community, foundations,
non-profits, companies, health care providers, and others will come
together at the White House and virtually to strategize how we can each
act to make progress on the seven pillars of how we know cancer today.
The goal is to identify impactful steps to: (1) improve cancer
screening; (2) enhance prevention; (3) address inequities; (4) target
effective treatments to patients; (5) develop approaches for deadly and
rare cancers, including childhood cancers; (6) support patients,
survivors, and caregivers; and (7) learn more from people living with
cancer.

As part of the reignited Cancer Moonshot, the President and First Lady
announced a call to action on cancer screening to jumpstart progress on
the nearly 10 million screenings in the United States that were missed
as a result of the pandemic, and to work to ensure that all Americans
equitably benefit from the tools we have to prevent, detect, and
diagnose cancer. The following announcements comprise an initial
response to that call to action.  

For example, this includes efforts to reduce disparities in access to
cancer screening by bringing: high-quality care to New York City’s
Harlem, Washington, DC, and three other cities; mobile lung cancer
screening to communities in Appalachia and rural parts of Tennessee,
Georgia, and Alabama; support from screening through care to women in
South Florida; and bilingual navigation services to reach Latinas in
Baltimore and Washington, DC. These commitments also include business
leaders around Columbus, Ohio committing to support employees with the
time and resources needed to get their recommended cancer screenings and
national efforts that will reach communities from coast to coast with
knowledge, support, and access to cancer early detection.

**<u>Private sector actions in response to cancer screening call to
action:</u>**

**<u>Bringing Cancer Screening to More Communities </u>**

-   **The Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) and AstraZeneca
    Join Efforts to Create the “Rural Appalachian Lung Cancer Screening
    Initiative.”** The ACCC and AstraZeneca are launching a new
    partnership to develop and implement person-centered and sustainable
    approaches to increase lung cancer screening in rural America
    through the “Rural Appalachian Lung Cancer Screening Initiative.” As
    part of an initial $1.3 million investment, the Initiative will
    collect best practices and develop screening resources that will be
    shared with ACCC pilot sites with the potential to engage up to 30
    percent more eligible individuals in the first five years. Upon
    project completion, data will be shared with all 2,100 ACCC cancer
    programs and practices nationwide. The United States has made great
    strides in reducing lung cancer incidence and mortality over the
    last five years. In Appalachia, however, driven, in part, by
    increased rates of tobacco use, cancer mortality is 10 percent
    higher than the national rate and, for rural Appalachian counties,
    cancer mortality is 15 percent higher than the region’s metro
    counties.    
      
    ACCC will build on its portfolio of resources and tools for health
    care providers, including “Fostering Excellence in Care and Outcomes
    in Patients with Stage III and IV NSCLC,” “Improving Care
    Coordination: A Model for Lung Cancer Patients on Medicaid,” and
    “Understanding & Improving Lung Cancer Treatment in Asian Americans
    & Pacific Islanders in the Community Setting.” AstraZeneca convened
    the Lung Ambition Alliance (LAA) in 2019 with key partners, and is
    focused on accelerating advances in lung cancer survival and
    improving patient outcomes, with the goal of eliminating lung cancer
    as a cause of death. The LAA’s initial goal is to double the
    five-year survival rate for lung cancer.   
-   **Nonprofits Family Reach and Nueva Vida Collaborate to Provide
    Community Navigation and Financial Support for Latinas Facing Breast
    Cancer:** Nueva Vida, a support network for Latinas with — or at
    risk of — cancer, is partnering with Family Reach, a national
    nonprofit removing financial barriers to cancer treatment, to
    provide continuous support to 800 additional Latinas in the
    Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas during breast cancer
    screening and treatment. Latinas face unique and increasing
    challenges accessing and adhering to breast cancer screening and
    treatment due to psychosocial, logistical, financial, and systemic
    barriers.   
      
    Nueva Vida addresses the unmet needs of Latinas through free
    culturally-competent services. Bilingual/bicultural patient
    navigators attend appointments to ensure timely delivery of
    diagnostic and treatment services, provide language and clinical
    interpretation, and facilitate financial support for medications and
    basic needs. Their Navigators build trusting, long-term
    relationships with clients to ensure critical needs are met and that
    patients can effectively plan for and adhere to treatment.   
      
    Family Reach offers comprehensive financial services that reduce
    patients’ financial distress and improve access to care during
    treatment, regardless of immigration status. Nueva Vida’s Navigators
    will leverage Family Reach’s Financial Treatment Program to deliver
    financial tools that meet the unique needs of each family, ensuring
    they can both stay on treatment and keep their families housed and
    fed.   
-   **GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer Expands Mobile Screening to At-Risk
    Communities**: The GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer, in partnership
    with Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial, Chattanooga, Tennessee, a
    GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer Center of Excellence (COE), and with
    support from AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and a private
    funder, is bringing lung cancer screenings to at-risk, rural
    residents across southeast Tennessee and northern Georgia. The
    Breathe Easy mobile screening program currently provides more than
    1,000 lung cancer screenings annually, primarily to those who are
    uninsured and those with public insurance. Expansion of the Breathe
    Easy program will extend mobile lung cancer screening further south
    in Georgia and into Alabama where, in part, due to higher than the
    national average rates of tobacco use, there are over 20,000
    individuals at risk for lung cancer and eligible for lung cancer
    screening but currently without ready access to these services. An
    initial $1 million investment supporting the launch of this new
    mobile screening unit is estimated to provide services for 10 years,
    screening as many as 3,000 people per year.  
-   **Promise Fund of Florida Doubles Down on Model to Improve Women’s
    Health**:  
    The Promise Fund of Florida plans to double its reach in 2022 – to
    serve more than 30,000 women – with a Continuum of Care model that
    supports women in South Florida from screening through care for
    breast and cervical cancer. The Promise Fund of Florida co-locates a
    Women’s Health Center offering mammography and ultrasound services
    at a federally-qualified health center. In one example, FoundCare in
    West Palm Beach, this approach in partnership with Hologic led to
    screening rates jumping from 10% to 57%, demonstrating that women
    are more likely to obtain screenings when they are familiar with
    their provider organization, have been connected to financial
    assistance by a navigator, and are able to receive multiple services
    in one day, which reduces the associated barriers of having to
    secure rides to appointments and requesting additional time off from
    work.    
-   **Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation (RLCF) Commits $25 million to
    Improve Equity in Cancer Prevention, Screening, and Care.** In its
    single largest funding commitment to date, the RLCF is pledging $25
    million to five cancer care and prevention programs benefiting
    Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Georgetown Lombardi
    Comprehensive Cancer Center, and three yet-to-be-named additional
    National Cancer Institute-designated centers focused on reducing
    disparities in cancer care in underserved communities. The programs
    will provide increased screenings, early diagnosis, and treatment
    and patient navigation services, while improving access to
    high-quality care for those most in need.   
      
    As part of its commitment, the RLCF will build on its support of the
    Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Ralph Lauren Center in Harlem, New
    York.  In Washington D.C., the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive
    Cancer Center will newly establish the Ralph Lauren Center for
    Cancer Prevention. The renamed and reimagined center will build on
    the existing practices of the Capital Breast Care Center and expand
    access to diagnostic and navigation services for the District’s most
    underserved populations, focusing on breast, colorectal, lung, and
    prostate cancer, the area’s four most prevalent types of cancers.
    Going forward, RLCF will collaborate with Conquer Cancer®, the ASCO
    Foundation, to identify three additional grant recipients selected
    based on their National Cancer Institute-designation and
    demonstrated commitment to overcoming health disparities for
    communities in need.

**<u>Expanding Messaging and Support for Cancer Early Detection </u>**

-   **American Cancer Society (ACS) Launches National Platforms on
    Cervical and Breast Cancer**: ACS will initiate two new national
    roundtables in 2022 – one focused on cervical cancer, the other on
    breast cancer – to bring together leading organizations and experts
    to drive progress and improve the lives of people living with cancer
    as well as their families. ACS has established this convening model
    as an effective structure for collaboration and impact and this
    approach aligns with the President’s Cancer Panel
    recently-released [report on cancer
    screening](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/cancer-screening-presidents-cancer-panel-report).
    ACS is also pursuing several additional initiatives aimed at
    ensuring greater equity in cancer screening and early detection,
    including launching a learning collaborative with six community
    health centers across the country to address medical mistrust
    related to colorectal cancer screening. Finally, ACS’s advocacy
    affiliate, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS
    CAN), will advocate for robust and sustained funding for breast and
    cervical cancer early detection programs at the state and federal
    level to ensure those who are uninsured and underinsured have access
    to potentially lifesaving screenings and treatment once cancer is
    detected.  
-   **Cancer Support Community (CSC) Creates Pledge and Resources to
    Promote Urgency Around Cancer Screening. **CSC is launching a new
    social media campaign to encourage people to take a pledge to
    prioritize getting cancer screening and urging their friends and
    family to do the same. They expect to reach more than 150,000 people
    through email and social media efforts and expect thousands to come
    to the landing page to support the pledge and/or become more
    informed about screenings. CSC will provide resources to help people
    learn more about which routine screenings are currently available
    and recommended. Additionally, since anxiety and depression are not
    only common in people impacted by cancer, but often prevents people
    from even seeking cancer screening, these resources will include
    support and navigation services provided along the entire cancer
    continuum, from before screening, to waiting for test results, and
    through diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. This will include a
    toll-free Cancer Support Helpline and a network of 175 locations
    across the United States, including CSC and Gilda’s Club centers, in
    addition to healthcare partnerships.  
-   **Coalition of Companies Step Up to Help Employees Access
    Recommended Cancer Screenings**: Pelotonia, a non-profit cancer
    research organization and The Columbus Partnership, a membership
    organization that convenes CEOs from some of Central Ohio’s largest
    employers around opportunities to advance economic development and
    prosperity, are committed to developing a platform whereby employers
    access and adopt recommended cancer health education and screening
    materials to better the health of their workforces – an effort that
    will initially reach more than 250,000 employees. These employers
    will distribute cancer prevention and screening education materials,
    host on-site screening opportunities, and offer flexible time off to
    ensure their employees can take part in recommended cancer
    screenings, as a commitment to the health of their workforce.   
-   **Fight Colorectal Cancer (Fight CRC) Leads Renewed Push for
    Improved Screening Access at No Cost to Patient:** Fight CRC will
    build on the Administration’s recent guidance to commercial
    insurance plans that they must cover colonoscopy without
    out-of-pocket costs following an abnormal non-invasive colorectal
    cancer screening test. Fight CRC is working through its Catalyst
    State-by-State Advocacy Program to build on its state-level policy
    work to remove cost barriers to screening and help ensure that the
    Administration’s guidance is effectively and equitably
    implemented.  
      
    Additionally, Fight CRC launched its Path to a Cure report, a
    professional, multidisciplinary publication, which seeks to
    summarize and communicate a plan for the colorectal cancer community
    to rally around: pushing forward critical areas of research; care
    for patients; and policy, with prevention and early detection as
    priority areas. Through convening key stakeholders, identifying gaps
    and opportunities in both research and public policy, Fight CRC is
    committing to identifying and implementing strategies to increase
    access to colorectal cancer screening in all communities as part of
    its Path to a Cure.  
-   **Cancer Stage Shifting Initiative Launched by the National Minority
    Quality Forum (NMQF) to Reach Millions**: NMQF is announcing a
    multi-sponsored Cancer Stage Shifting Initiative (CSSI) guided by a
    board of scientific and community thought leaders. CSSI’s mission is
    to move from late stage to early-stage diagnosis and treatment of
    cancer in minority populations, with a special, but not exclusive,
    focus on people living with colorectal cancer. NMQF expects to reach
    an audience of more than 11 million patients, clinicians and other
    stakeholders monthly through its collaborations in advocacy and
    policy, social media communication, clinical research in underserved
    communities, representative data and quality improvement and
    community engagement.  The initiative will have a clear focus on
    equity and is expected to improve cancer care for all. Stage
    shifting will require system changes brought on by a coordinated
    effort that involves patients, caregivers, families and all
    stakeholders in the oncology community and beyond, advocating for,
    educating and communicating about earlier detection and treatment of
    cancer among underserved populations.   
-   **Philips and RadNet Partner to Improve Cancer Screening Reach and
    Accuracy: **Philips, a global leader in health technology, and
    RadNet, the largest owner of outpatient imaging centers in the
    United States, are collaborating to deploy and develop new solutions
    that can improve the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of
    cancer. RadNet will be using Philips solutions for workflow
    management and patient engagement in their lung cancer screening
    programs to increase the impact of patient outreach efforts,
    efficiently scale lung cancer screening workflow and programs, and
    get more at-risk people screened for lung cancer. Moreover, RadNet
    is using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies to
    improve detection and characterization of cancer at earlier stages,
    preventing false positive findings and reducing unnecessary patient
    burden, which can lead to better outcomes. Through RadNet’s network
    of imaging centers and educational outreach programs reaching 15
    million Americans each year, many of whom are located in
    densely-populated, ethnically-diverse communities with at-risk
    populations, Philips and RadNet are striving for improved education,
    earlier detection, and more engaged participants, which could yield
    improved cancer outcomes for all Americans.
