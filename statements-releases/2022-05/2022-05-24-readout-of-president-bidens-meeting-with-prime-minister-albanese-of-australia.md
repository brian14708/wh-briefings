Today, President Biden met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony
Albanese in Tokyo. President Biden congratulated Prime Minister Albanese
on his election and expressed gratitude for his decision to travel to
Japan for the Quad Summit on his first day in office. President Biden
reaffirmed his steadfast support for the US-Australia alliance and
commitment to strengthening it further. He commended Australia’s strong
support for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, and the leaders agreed on
the importance of continued solidarity, including to ensure that no such
event is ever repeated in the Indo-Pacific. The leaders praised the
swift progress the United States and Australia are making, together with
the UK, under the AUKUS partnership.  They agreed to work closely
together to implement the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and to
collaborate in addressing the existential threat posed by climate
change.
