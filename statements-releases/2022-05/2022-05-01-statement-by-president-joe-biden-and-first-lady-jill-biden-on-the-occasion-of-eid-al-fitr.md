  \ of Eid\_al-Fitr"

As Muslims in the United States and around the world conclude the month
of Ramadan and celebrate Eid al-Fitr, Jill and I extend our warmest
wishes to all who are celebrating this joyous occasion.  
  
Eid marks the completion of a holy month dedicated to devotion and
reflection, when families and communities come together to celebrate
their blessings. And Eid is also an occasion for Muslims to remember all
those who are struggling or impacted by poverty, hunger, conflict, and
disease, and to recommit to building a better future for all.     
  
This year, as we mark Eid al-Fitr, we hold in our hearts the millions of
displaced persons and refugees around the globe who are spending this
sacred holiday separated from their families and unsure of their future,
but still hoping for a brighter tomorrow. As a nation we must always
keep faith with those seeking a better life, and uphold our commitment
to serving as a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world.
And, Muslims across the United States celebrate Eid, let us renew our
dedication to our foundational commitment to respecting all faiths and
beliefs.  
  
The Holy Qur’an urges people to stand firmly for justice and reminds us
that we were created as nations and tribes so that we may get to know
one another.  The tradition of religious freedom for all strengthens our
country, and we will continue to work with Americans of all beliefs and
backgrounds to safeguard and deepen our collective commitment to this
fundamental principle. This year, we will resume the tradition of
celebrating Eid at the White House, and of honoring the inspiring Muslim
Americans who are leading efforts to build greater understanding and
unity across our nation.   
  
To all those celebrating, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a
Happy Eid.  May the spirit of community, compassion, and service we have
witnessed over the last month continue throughout the year. *Eid
Mubarak*!
