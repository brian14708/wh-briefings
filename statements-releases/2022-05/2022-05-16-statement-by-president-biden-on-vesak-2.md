Jill and I extend warm wishes to Buddhists in the United States and
around the world as they celebrate Vesak. This sacred day is a time to
reflect on the Buddhaâ€™s teachings, including the need to work for peace
and justice, recognize our common humanity, respect and preserve the
nature that surrounds us, and cultivate humility and compassion. The
Buddha taught that we are but guests visiting this world, and for over
2,500 years, those who adhere to these teachings have enriched and
strengthened this world we share. As we mark Vesak, we honor the
American Buddhists who contribute so much to our country and advance our
common values.
