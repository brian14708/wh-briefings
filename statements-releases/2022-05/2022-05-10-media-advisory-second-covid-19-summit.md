The United States as first COVID Summit Chair, Belize, as CARICOM Chair;
Germany, holding the G7 Presidency; Indonesia, holding the G20
Presidency; and Senegal as African Union Chair, will co-host the second
Global COVID-19 Summit, which will be held virtually on Thursday, May
12, 2022.  
  
We will be joined by countries, other partners, non-governmental
organizations, and private sector companies who have made financial or
policy commitments. Some of those will include South Africa; Canada;
Japan; India; Colombia; Republic of Korea; Italy; New Zealand; European
Commission; Spain, Nigeria; Norway; Palau; Tanzania; Rwanda; Wellcome;
Google; FIND, the global alliance for diagnostics; Rotary International;
the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; Clinton Health
Access Initiative; Open Society Foundations; the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation; Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance; and the Mastercard Foundation.
In addition, international and regional organizations will participate,
such as the World Health Organization, World Bank Group; the World Trade
Organization; the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention;
and the Caribbean Public Health Agency. We will share more about
additional participants closer to the Summit.   
  
Together, the Summit will redouble our efforts made at the first COVID
Summit and will focus on four key objectives: 

-   **Recommitting Intensity to Global Response.** The pandemic is not
    over, and now is the time to prepare for the next one.  The Summit
    will focus on securing new resources and policy commitments to
    control COVID-19 in 2022. 
-   **Vaccinating the World. **Vaccination remains the most important
    lifesaving tool in this pandemic. It is also the most effective
    means to fight emerging variants. This is true for the broad
    population, and particularly true for the most vulnerable. And it
    means focusing on both the quantity of vaccinations, but also the
    quality – including providing effective boosters.
-   **Protecting the Most Vulnerable.  **The Summit will focus on
    getting vaccines, tests, and treatments to those at highest risk,
    like the elderly, the immunocompromised and frontline and health
    workers.
-   **Preventing future catastrophes.  **By investing *now* to secure
    political commitment for pandemic preparedness globally.  The Summit
    will focus on expanding and financing country capacity, health
    workers, disease surveillance, and medical countermeasures,
    including through the new pandemic preparedness and global health
    security fund at the World Bank. 

President Biden and fellow heads of state from the co-host nations will
kick off the Summit with remarks on how fighting COVID-19 must remain an
international priority. The Summit will then feature three sessions
focused on getting shots in arms, expanding access to tests and
treatments, and advancing health security and preventing future
catastrophes.  Ahead of the Summit, the U.S. called on the leaders of
governments, civil society, businesses, and philanthropies to make
significant new commitments.  
To date, President has committed to sharing 1.2 billion doses of safe,
effective vaccines with the world, and the U.S. has made good on that
commitment. The U.S. has shipped over 530 million doses of vaccine to
115 countries around the world, over four times more than our next
closest donor. And the U.S. has sent them for free with no strings
attached.

The Summit builds the U.S.’s steadfast leadership in the global COVID-19
response and our efforts to engage with the world to do their part to
end this acute phase of the pandemic and prepare for future threats. It
also reflects the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to continue to push
the global response forward, including by securing funding from
Congress, because the virus is not waiting for Congress to act. It’s
critical for Congress to act with the urgency that a
once-in-a-generation pandemic warrants.  

The U.S. and the co-host nations look forward to another successful
Summit to accelerate the international response to combat COVID-19 and
to advance global pandemic preparedness.
