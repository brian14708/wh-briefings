title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Hits the Ground Running to Build\
  \ a Better America Six Months into Infrastructure\_Implementation"
---
 
For decades, Washington policymakers have celebrated “infrastructure
week” without delivering anything more than promises. In contrast,
President Biden worked across the aisle, forged consensus, and secured
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – a once-in-a-generation investment in
our nation’s infrastructure and competitiveness. 

President Biden promised to deliver results, change people’s lives for
the better, and build a better America. Six months in to implementing
the historic law, that’s exactly what he’s doing. 

The law is already creating good-paying, union jobs, helping fight
climate change, advancing environmental justice, boosting domestic
manufacturing, strengthening critical links in our supply chains, and
ultimately lowering costs for working families.

Since signing the law:

-   The Biden-Harris Administration has announced **over $110
    billion** to rebuild roads and bridges, modernize ports and
    airports, replace lead pipes to deliver clean water, and expand
    high-speed internet. This includes funding for [over **4,300
    specific projects**, touching over **3,200 communities** across
    all **50 states**, D.C., and Puerto
    Rico](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/six-month-anniversary/).  

<!-- -->

-   **53 states and territories** have appointed state infrastructure
    coordinators, responding to the call from Infrastructure Coordinator
    Landrieu to appoint an individual to coordinate efforts in a state
    along with serving as a single point of contact for the White House
    Infrastructure Implementation Team.  

<!-- -->

-   The President, Vice President, and Cabinet have traveled on more
    than **125 trips to over 40 states **as well as D.C. and Puerto Rico
    to demonstrate how the President is delivering on this
    once-in-a-generation opportunity.

**<u>DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE</u>**

The Biden-Harris Administration has announced over $110 billion for the
federal government, states, territories, Tribes, and local governments
from formula and competitive programs that will change people’s lives
for the better – improving roads and highways, rebuilding bridges,
strengthening links in our supply chains like ports and airports,
replacing lead pipes to deliver clean drinking water, building out
high-speed internet, and more. 

This includes funding for over 4,300 specific projects, touching over
3,200 communities across all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico.  Another
nearly $100 billion in requests for information and notices of funding
availability have been released. The Administration has also unveiled
new offices and action plans that will ensure these investments are
implemented wisely and well. To showcase the state announced allocations
and projects, please
visit [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/six-month-anniversary/).

And, in line with the President’s Justice40 commitment, the
Administration is ensuring that 40% of the benefits of the climate and
energy related investments are delivered to disadvantaged communities. 

Outlined at the bottom is a summary of funding announcements,
opportunities, and more that demonstrate how President Biden’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is upgrading transportation and supply
chains, improving water, conservation, and resilience, cleaning up
legacy pollution, modernizing the grid and deploying clean energy, and
expanding high-speed internet. 

**<u>ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY </u>**

In April, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
released [guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-prioritizes-effectiveness-accountability-and-transparency-in-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-implementation/) to
federal agencies to set a strong foundation for effective, efficient,
and equitable implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. As
the President said in his State of the Union, “in my administration, the
watchdogs are back.” President Biden has a long-standing commitment to
collaboration with Inspectors General (IGs) and the broader oversight
community, dating back to his leadership as Vice President when he was
tasked with implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act. He has made clear that results and accountability go hand-in-hand,
and that to deliver results for all Americans, the federal government
must act and support appropriate oversight of its activities in a manner
deserving of public trust.

The initial guidance will combat fraud, waste, and abuse in the
implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The initial
guidance also ensures that projects are delivered on time and on budget
with accountability, effectiveness, and transparency – collaborating
with IGs and the oversight community and providing technical and
financial assistance for communities.

As part of his commitment to accountability, President Biden and senior
administration officials—including OMB Director Shalanda Young,
Infrastructure Coordinator Landrieu, American Rescue Plan Implementation
Coordinator Gene Sperling, and OMB Deputy Director for Management Jason
Miller— met in April with agency IGs who have been providing oversight
to the implementation of the American Rescue Plan and who will provide
oversight of implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The
President, his senior advisors, and IGs discussed steps they are taking
to ensure robust oversight of federal programs.

To make the most of these historic investments and ensure infrastructure
projects are delivered on time and on budget, the Biden-Harris
Administration also released a new [Permitting Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-permitting-action-plan-to-accelerate-and-deliver-infrastructure-projects-on-time-on-task-and-on-budget/) to
strengthen and accelerate federal permitting and environmental reviews
by fully leveraging existing permitting authorities, as well as new
provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Action Plan
outlines the Administration’s strategy for ensuring that federal
environmental reviews and permitting processes are effective, efficient,
and transparent, guided by the best available science to promote
positive environmental and community outcomes, and shaped by early and
meaningful public engagement.  The Action Plan is the latest example of
the Administration acting to swiftly deliver the benefits of
infrastructure investment to the American people through well-designed
projects that support the President’s ambitious climate and clean energy
goals. Putting the Action Plan into place will result in better
permitting outcomes, enhanced predictability for project sponsors, and
increased accountability across federal agencies to execute efficiently
and effectively.

**<u>BUILDING THE TEAM</u>**

President Biden’s s Infrastructure Implementation Task Force, led by
White House Senior Advisor & Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator
Mitch Landrieu, has focused on building the team across the federal
government and with state and local partners who will execute on this
historic undertaking. In the first months, each agency appointed an
Infrastructure Coordinator, senior leaders who are in constant
communication, meet as a group multiple times each week to collaborate
across the government to deliver results from the law. The federal
government is hiring for over 8000 essential and mission-driven roles to
implement the law including scientists to combat climate change,
engineers to repair and rebuild our roads and bridges, and workers to
help ensure that every community in America has clean water, among many
others. 

Given that over 90 percent of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding
will be implemented by non-federal partners, the White House also
requested in January
that [Governors](https://www.ibtta.org/sites/default/files/documents/Advocacy/GA053-Mitch%20Landrieu%20Letter%20to%20Governors%202022-0104.pdf) and
local leaders take a series of preparatory actions, including appointing
infrastructure coordinators to manage the flow of funds to their states.
Since then, 53 states and territories have made appointments to lead
implementation within states, including Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia. Those coordinators have met regularly with the White House
Infrastructure Implementation Team.  

**<u>PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR STATES, TERRITORIES, TRIBES, AND LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS</u>   
  
**In January, the White House released the [first edition of its
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Guidebook](https://www.build.gov/) to help
state, local, Tribal, territorial governments, community members and
other key partners unlock the benefits from the historic investments in
our nation’s infrastructure. The guidebook is a central repository on
the law and contains the most comprehensive information to date on 375
programs included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. 

Along with its accompanying information online, the guidebook
provides states, territories, Tribes, local governments community
members and other key partners with information on funding
opportunities, who to contact, and how to get ready to rebuild. In
February, the White House launched an [“Infrastructure School” webinar
series](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/briefing-room/2022/05/04/infrastructure-school-webinars/) to
go more in depth into each of the guidebook’s 13 chapters and allow
communities the opportunity to ask questions to the agency experts,
overseeing implementation of key programs. The Administration has also
released a [fact
sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BIL-Factsheet-Local-Competitive-Funding.pdf) on
some of the largest sources of competitive funding, particularly for
local governments. Infrastructure Coordinator Landrieu has shared these
resources during meetings with the National Governors Association, U.S.
Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, National Association of
Counties, and hundreds of tribes through Tribal Consultations.    
  
While many funding streams in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
specifically set aside funds for underserved communities, the White
House Infrastructure Implementation Team has also been engaging states,
local governments, Tribal governments, territories, federal agencies,
philanthropy, and others to leverage all available resources to quickly
deliver the necessary technical assistance and capacity to underserved
communities. In keeping with efforts like the President’s Justice40
Initiative, the Administration is committed to ensuring disadvantaged
communities receive benefits from all available resources in relevant
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law programs.

In April, the White House released a [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
Rural Playbook](/Users/RFBerni/OneDrive/build.gov/rural) to help state,
local, Tribal, territorial communities, community members and other key
partners in rural areas unlock the benefits from the historic
investments in our nation’s infrastructure by providing rural
communities with information on the “what, when, where, and how to
apply” for funding under the law – so that no community needs to hire a
lobbyist to access their government. The Playbook also identifies over
100 programs funded under the law with federal cost share flexibilities
and matching requirement waivers for rural communities, making it easier
for rural communities to access funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law.
