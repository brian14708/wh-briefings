title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable with\_Nurses"
---
 
Today, in recognition of Nurses Appreciation Week, the White House
hosted a roundtable with nurses to thank them for their efforts on the
frontlines of the pandemic, providing essential health care and ensuring
patients receive the care they deserve.  The roundtable, which was
convened by White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein,
brought together nurses from across the country who work in various
specialties – including maternal health and mental health – and with
populations including youth, pregnant and postpartum women, military
service members and their families, as well as veterans.  
   
Participants discussed the devastating impact the pandemic has had on
nurses and other health care workers, as well as patients, families, and
communities.  They underscored the importance of addressing the
pandemic-related burnout, advancing gender equity in health care,
including through supporting women’s health care, and tackling the
national mental health crisis.  Participants also highlighted the need
to sustainably grow and support the nursing workforce.  Administration
officials reaffirmed the White House’s commitment to recognizing,
supporting, and strengthening America’s nurses and underscored President
Biden’s support for emergency COVID-19 funds to ensure we continue to
have the vaccines, tests, and treatments we need to protect the American
people, keep America moving forward safely and prepare for potential
surges to come.
