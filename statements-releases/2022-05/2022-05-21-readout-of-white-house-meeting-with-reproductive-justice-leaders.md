title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Reproductive Justice\_Leaders"
---
 
Yesterday, Jennifer Klein, Director of the White House Gender Policy
Council, and Rohini Kosoglu, Domestic Policy Advisor to the Vice
President, hosted a meeting with reproductive justice leaders from
across the country.   
Reproductive justice leaders shared their concerns about access to
reproductive health care on the ground, describing the range of
challenges that patients currently face as states pass extreme laws
restricting access to critical health care. Participants also
highlighted the disproportionate impact that abortion restrictions have
on underserved communities, including communities of color and
low-income women.  
  
On Thursday, the Vice
President [met](https://twitter.com/VP/status/1527351664432525317?s=20&t=-WpEoNePRl1rtAw-uqMjQw) with
doctors and nurses to discuss the impact that overturning *Roe v.
Wade *would have on women’s health care. Later the day, White House
Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre issued
a [statement](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/19/statement-from-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-the-oklahoma-abortion-bill/) on
