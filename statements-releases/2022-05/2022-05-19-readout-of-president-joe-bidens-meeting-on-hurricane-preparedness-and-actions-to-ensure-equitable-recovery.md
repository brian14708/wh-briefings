On May 18, President Biden met with leaders of his Federal emergency
preparedness and response team to receive the annual briefing on the
Atlantic Hurricane<s> </s>Season Outlook and to review progress on his
directive to enhance equity and access to Federal disaster support and
resources. He was briefed by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
Administrator Deanne Criswell, Administrator of the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Richard Spinrad, Director
of the National Hurricane Center Kenneth Graham, Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development Marcia Fudge, Small Business Administrator
Isabella Guzman, U.S. Coast Guard Vice Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan,
and Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall.

The President was briefed on the projected hurricane activity for the
upcoming season and how lessons learned from past years have improved
accuracy in analysis and forecasting.  Following this overview, the
President had the opportunity to discuss the actions that FEMA, the
Small Business Administration, and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development have taken to ensure more equitable outcomes for underserved
communities following a disaster.

The President also met with the brave men and women who fly into
hurricanes and perform high-risk missions to provide early warning and
real time analysis of severe storms in order to save American lives.  He
toured the aircraft with specialized technologies that are used to
predict hurricane tracks and spoke with U.S. Coast Guard members who
conduct search and rescue missions during hurricanes and other extreme
weather events.
