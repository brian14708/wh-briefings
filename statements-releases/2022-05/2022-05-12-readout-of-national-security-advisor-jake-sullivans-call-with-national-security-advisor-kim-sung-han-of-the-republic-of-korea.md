National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with
Republic of Korea National Security Advisor Kim Sung-han to discuss the
President’s upcoming visit to the Republic of Korea (ROK). Mr. Sullivan
congratulated Mr. Kim on his appointment and they jointly noted that the
meeting between President Biden and President Yoon is an opportunity to
highlight the strength and breadth of the modern U.S.-ROK Alliance. They
also condemned the DPRK’s ballistic missile launches, including the
launches today, as a violation of United Nations Security Council
resolutions and committed to maintain close coordination to address the
threats posed by the DPRK and to advance our shared objective of the
complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Sullivan and Mr.
Kim also conferred on additional details about the President’s visit to
the ROK and strengthening our cooperation across a range of shared
foreign policy priorities.
