National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Akiba Takeo, the
Secretary General of Japan’s National Security Secretariat, to discuss
preparations for the President’s upcoming trip to the Republic of Korea
and Japan. Mr. Sullivan commended Japan’s strong response to Russia’s
brutal and unjustified further invasion of Ukraine, including financial
sanctions, export controls, and humanitarian and defense assistance for
Ukraine and they agreed to continue working closely together on the
international response to Russia’s aggression. Secretary General Akiba
welcomed the President’s visit to Tokyo, noting that it would send a
strong signal to the region and beyond about the U.S. commitment to the
Indo-Pacific. The two agreed that the meeting between the President and
Prime Minister Kishida is an opportunity to affirm the strength of the
U.S.-Japan alliance, take steps to strengthen deterrence in the region,
and advance our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.  Mr.
Sullivan highlighted the importance of the second in-person Quad Leaders
Meeting as a key event in demonstrating that the Quad is delivering
results for the people of the region.
