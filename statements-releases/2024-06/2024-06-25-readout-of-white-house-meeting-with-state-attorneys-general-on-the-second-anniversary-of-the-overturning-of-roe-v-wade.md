title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Attorneys General on the Second\
  \ Anniversary of the Overturning of Roe v.\_Wade"
---
 
Yesterday, to mark the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court’s
decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade*, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the
President and Director of the White House Gender Policy Council, and Tom
Perez, Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President and Director of the
Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, convened Attorneys General from
Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, and Oregon to discuss the
devastating impact of dangerous abortion bans implemented by Republican
elected officials and the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to protect
access to reproductive health care in their states and nationwide.

Participants discussed how the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn *Roe
v. Wade* has led to extreme abortion bans in 21 states and has paved the
way for attacks on the full spectrum of reproductive care, including
medication abortion, emergency medical care, IVF, and contraception.
While Republican elected officials continue to advance abortion bans in
states and at the national level, the Biden-Harris Administration and
Democratic Attorneys General are fighting back to protect access to
reproductive health care. Directors Klein and Perez thanked the
participants for their leadership and reaffirmed the Administration’s
commitment to defending reproductive freedom.

President Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the vast majority
of Americans who support a woman’s right to make deeply personal health
care decisions and continue to call on Congress to restore the
protections of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law. Yesterday’s discussion
builds on the Administration’s long-standing commitment to partnering
with state leaders on the frontlines in the fight for reproductive
rights. The White House has hosted [more than two dozen formal
convenings](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dobbs-Anniversary-States-Report-6.22.23.pdf)
of state officials, including governors, attorneys general, and state
legislators. The Vice President has led these efforts, traveling to more
than 20 states to meet with state legislators, health care providers,
and advocates and leading a nationwide Fight for Reproductive Freedoms
tour earlier this year to continue fighting back against extreme attacks
throughout America.

Participants:

-   Andrea Campbell, Attorney General of Massachusetts
-   Dana Nessel, Attorney General of Michigan
-   Aaron Ford, Attorney General of Nevada
-   Matthew Platkin, Attorney General of New Jersey
-   Ellen Rosenblum, Attorney General of Oregon
