title: "FACT SHEET: The 2024 G7 Summit in Apulia,\_Italy"
---
 
President Biden and G7 leaders stood united at the G7 Summit in Apulia,
Italy, taking bold action to meet the tests of our time:  supporting
Ukraine’s fight for freedom and driving up the costs of Russia’s war,
pushing back on unfair economic practices, tackling the climate crisis
and food and health insecurity, harnessing critical technologies for the
benefit of all, and working with partners around the world to support
developing countries investing in their futures.  
  
**Supporting Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom**  
  
Joined by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, G7 leaders reaffirmed their
unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes – sending an
unmistakable signal to Putin that he will not outlast our resolve. 

-   **Unlocking $50 billion for Ukraine:**  G7 leaders announced a plan
    to provide Ukraine with $50 billion in new financing by bringing
    forward the interest earned on immobilized Russian sovereign assets
    held in the European Union and other jurisdictions.  Leaders
    reaffirmed their commitment that Russia’s sovereign assets within G7
    jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia ends its
    aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.  This
    new financing will provide critically needed support for Ukraine’s
    military, budget, and reconstruction needs.  The United States will
    work with Ukraine and G7 partners in the coming months to finalize
    the details of the financing arrangement and issue the loan by the
    end of the year.  
-   **Driving Up Costs for the Russian War Machine: **The Biden
    Administration this week issued a sweeping set of new sanctions and
    export control measures, guided by G7 commitments to intensify the
    pressure on Russia for its war against Ukraine.  Foreign banks now
    face increased sanctions risk when they deal with Russia’s war
    economy.  New sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities in
    Russia, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and globally target
    Russia’s financial infrastructure; over a dozen international
    evasion and procurement networks; Russia’s future energy, metals,
    and mining revenues; and Russian elites involved in the deportation
    or so-called re-education of Ukrainian children.  The Administration
    also announced steps to restrict access to certain U.S. software and
    information technology services, to crack down on diversion of goods
    through shell companies, and to more extensively restrict exports to
    entities that supply Russia with U.S.-branded items produced
    overseas.  
-   **Supporting Ukraine Now and in the Future.**  In Puglia, President
    Biden and President Zelensky signed the [U.S.-Ukraine Bilateral
    Security
    Agreement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/13/fact-sheet-u-s-ukraine-bilateral-security-agreement/)
    as a demonstration of enduring U.S. support for Ukraine, including
    through binding commitments to deepen our security and defense
    cooperation and to consult in the event of a future armed attack.

**Advancing International Peace, Security, and Prosperity**  
  
The G7’s work is grounded in a shared commitment to respect the UN
Charter, promote international peace and security, and uphold the free
and open rules-based international order.

-   **Calling for a Comprehensive Deal in Gaza: **The G7 was united in
    supporting the comprehensive deal outlined by President Biden that
    would lead to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all
    hostages, a significant and sustained increase in the flow of
    humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the
    crisis, with Israel’s security interests and safety for Palestinian
    civilians in Gaza assured.  
-   **Standing with Allies and Partners in the Indo-Pacific:** 
    President Biden discussed robust U.S. engagement in the Indo-Pacific
    to strengthen our alliances and partnerships, and welcomed the
    increasing connectivity between European and Indo-Pacific partners.
     He joined with other leaders in stressing the importance of peace
    and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and in raising concerns
    regarding the PRC’s dangerous actions in the South China Sea.  
-   **Deepening Cooperation with Partners in Africa:**  The G7 is
    working together with African partners to contribute to global
    stability and prosperity, and have endorsed African countries’ call
    for greater voice in international bodies.

**Promoting Economic Resilience and Economic Security**  
  
President Biden rallied the G7 to take further steps to protect our
workers, industries, and the investments we are making from begin
undermined by the PRC’s unfair practices.  The PRC’s policies are
creating global spillovers, including harmful overcapacity, that
undercut market firms and lead to supply chain dependencies in sectors
such as solar, wind, electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, medical
devices, mature-node semiconductors, steel, aluminum, and others. 

-   **Working Together to Level the Playing Field and Protect Economic
    Security:**  The G7 pledged to work together to confront non-market
    policies and practices and efforts to dominate strategic sectors. 
    The G7 will undertake new monitoring and information-sharing
    efforts, update our respective toolkits to counter harmful
    practices, and coordinate efforts to deter and respond to economic
    coercion.   
-   **Building Partnerships to Promote Resilient Supply Chains and
    Reduce Critical Dependencies:**  The G7 will work with partners in
    developing countries and emerging markets to increase their
    participation in global supply chains while promoting high
    standards.  
-   **Protecting Critical and Sensitive Technologies:**  We are updating
    our respective tools to protect certain critical and sensitive
    technologies from being used to undermine international peace and
    security, while avoiding broader restrictions on international trade
    and investment.  The G7 is also strengthening cooperation on
    research security, data security, and investment screening efforts,
    and coordinating to streamline the implementation of export
    controls.

**Partnering with Developing Countries to Invest in their Future**  
  
The G7 is taking ambitious steps to scale up support to developing
countries and accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development
Goals.

-   **Breaking the Global Debt Impasse:**  Recognizing that mounting
    debt burdens are putting developing countries’ ability to make such
    critical investments out of reach, President Biden – alongside
    Kenyan President Ruto – championed and garnered G7 support for the
    *Nairobi-Washington Vision* that calls on the international
    community to step up support for developing countries to make
    critical investments and reforms.  The G7 committed to work with the
    IMF, World Bank, and other stakeholders to bring this plan forward,
    with a view to realizing it for pilot countries this year.  
-   **Boosting the Financial Power of the International Financial
    Institutions:** President Biden further championed efforts to
    deliver better, bigger, more effective multilateral development
    banks (MDBs).  The G7 rallied together to announce planned
    contributions which, once approved domestically, would make it
    possible for the World Bank to boost lending by $70 billion over the
    next decade.  This is on top of efforts from the United States and
    other MDB shareholders to unlock over $250 billion in new lending
    capacity at these institutions.   
-   **Delivering on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
    Investment (PGI): ** President Biden and Italian Prime Minister
    Meloni co-hosted a [PGI side
    event](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/13/g7-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-side-event-co-chair-statement/)
    that included participation by BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink
    and Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella.  G7 leaders and
    private sector executives reaffirmed their commitment to unlocking
    public and private capital for investments in partner countries,
    demonstrated by BlackRock’s announcement that a group of investors
    plan to invest at least $4 billion in alignment with PGI priorities
    and Microsoft’s announcement of $5 billion in recent digital
    infrastructure investments in emerging markets.  President Biden
    announced new projects and highlighted progress on PGI economic
    corridors, including the Lobito Corridor in Sub-Saharan Africa and
    the Luzon Corridor in the Philippines.  The United States has
    [mobilized more than $60 billion to date towards
    PGI.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/13/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-at-the-g7-summit-2/)

**Accelerating the Clean Energy Transition to Address Climate Change**  
  
The G7 is accelerating its work to address the challenges of climate
change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.  G7 members reaffirmed
ambitious COP28 commitments to triple renewable energy capacity, double
global energy efficiency by 2030, and strengthen energy security.

-   **Phasing Out Unabated Coal Power and Increasing Energy Storage:** 
    The G7 has committed for the first time to phase out unabated coal
    power generation in energy systems during the first half of the
    2030s.  The G7 has also further set a target to deploy 1,500 GW of
    long-duration energy storage by 2030, building on top of the COP28
    pledge to triple globally installed renewable energy by 2030.  
-   **Building Clean and Resilient Supply Chains:**  Working with
    Congress, President Biden announced that the United States intends
    to contribute $5 million to the Partnership for Resilient and
    Inclusive Supply-Chain Enhancement (RISE), launched by the G7 last
    year.  RISE supports low- and middle-income countries to invest in
    their economies and strengthen their engagement throughout critical
    minerals supply chains, helping to drive the clean energy transition
    and promote resilient supply chains.  
-   **Promoting International Collaboration on Nuclear and Fusion
    Energy:**  The G7 recognized nuclear energy as a clean/zero
    emissions energy source that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels
    to address the climate crisis and improve global energy security,
    and pledged to support multilateral efforts to strengthen the
    resilience of nuclear supply chains.  Recognizing the potential for
    fusion energy to serve as a breakthrough energy solution, the G7 is
    establishing a Working Group on Fusion Energy to share best
    practices and promote cooperation on research and development.

**Promoting Health and Food Security**  
  
The G7 continues to lead global efforts to address the food security
crisis and support strong, resilient and responsive health systems
around the world.

-   **Launching the Apulia Food Security Initiative:**  G7 leaders
    joined Italy in launching the Apulia Food Security Initiative to
    address structural barriers to food security and nutrition and build
    more resilient, sustainable, and productive agriculture and food
    systems.  Aligned with the United States’ signature food security
    initiative, The Feed the Future Initiative, as well as the Vision
    for Adapted Crops and Soils, the G7 recommitted to investing in
    sustainable and resilient food systems and in healthy, fertile soil
    management and climate-adapted crop varieties.  
-   **Transforming Global Health Security Financing:**  President Biden
    and G7 leaders called for at least $2 billion in new pledges for the
    Pandemic Fund, and pledges equal to or greater than that for
    catalytic financing, which helps developing countries build pandemic
    prevention, preparedness, and response capacities.  They
    additionally committed to achieve concrete progress to boost surge
    financing for medical countermeasure (MCM) to enable countries to
    quickly procure, produce, and deliver MCMs during future
    pandemics.  
-   **Expanding Immunization Coverage:**  President Biden and G7 leaders
    expressed support for a sustainable replenishment of Gavi, the
    Vaccine Alliance, this year, with the goal of significantly
    expanding immunization coverage globally.  President Biden committed
    to making a robust and multi-year pledge to Gavi, the Vaccine
    Alliance, in support of this year’s replenishment and urged other G7
    leaders to step up with ambitious pledges of their own.  
-   **Addressing** **antimicrobial resistance (AMR):**  G7 Leaders
    committed to take action to address the emergence, spread, and
    impact of AMR, including through ensuring a successful High-Level
    Meeting on AMR in September 2024 that galvanizes action on this
    critical health, economic, and security threat.

**Investing in Childcare to Support Women’s Economic Participation**  
  
The G7 is tackling the unequal gender distribution of care work, which
contributes to gender inequality.  The G7 committed to support, by 2035,
at least 200 million more women to join the workforce by investing in
efforts to close the global gap in the availability of childcare –
including through the World Bank Invest in Childcare Initiative
announced by First Lady Dr. Jill Biden in 2022 to help promote women’s
economic opportunity.  G7 partners have contributed more than $100
million to the World Bank to support more high-quality investments in
childcare globally.

**Enhancing Our Partnership on Migration**  
  
Drawn from the principles of the *Los Angeles Declaration on Migration
and Protection* that President Biden launched at the Summit of the
Americas in 2022, the G7 affirmed a collective commitment to addressing
migration in ways that reflect both the challenges and opportunities it
presents.  Leaders endorsed a three-pronged approach focused on
addressing root causes of irregular migration, strengthening safe and
regular migration pathways, and enhancing border management and
enforcement and curbing transnational organized crime.  
  
**Deepening Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence**  
  
In line with the Biden Administration’s vision laid out in the October
2023 *Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development
and Use of Artificial Intelligence*, the G7 is building partnerships
around the world to ensure the benefits of artificial intelligence and
other technologies are widely shared while mitigating risks.

-   **Bridging Technology Divides and Addressing AI’s Impact on
    Workers:**  G7 leaders affirmed the importance of international
    partnerships to bridge the digital divide and ensure people
    everywhere access the benefits of AI and other technologies in order
    to make scientific advancements, promote sustainable development,
    improve public health, accelerate the clean energy transition, and
    more. G7 labor ministers will develop an action plan to leverage
    AI’s potential to increase quality jobs and empower workers while
    addressing its potential challenges and risks to workers and labor
    markets.

**Increasing Coordination to Promote AI Safety:**  G7 leaders committed
to step up efforts to enhance interoperability between our respective
approaches to AI governance and risk management.  This includes
deepening cooperation between the U.S. AI Safety Institute and similar
bodies in other G7 countries to advance international standards for AI
development and deployment.

-   **Promoting Resilient Technology Supply Chains: **The G7 welcomed
    the establishment of a Semiconductors G7 Point of Contact Group to
    bolster our coordination on issues impacting this critical sector
    underpinning the AI ecosystem.
