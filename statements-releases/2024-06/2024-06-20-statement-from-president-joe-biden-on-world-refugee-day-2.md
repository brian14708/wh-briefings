On World Refugee Day, the United States reaffirms its commitment to the
safety, dignity, and protection of refugees and forcibly displaced
persons worldwide. A historic number of people, now more than 120
million, have been forced from their homes by war, violence, and
persecution. Many of them left behind everything, fleeing with their
families because of a fear of violence, ethnic oppression, political or
religious persecution, or other forms of hatred and intolerance.   
   
On this day, we reaffirm our solidarity with refugees. We also express
our profound appreciation for the United Nations and the many
humanitarian organizations and workers who provide refugees with
life-saving assistance. We recognize the special challenges faced by
countries hosting large numbers of refugees and applaud governments that
have welcomed refugees and given them opportunities to integrate into
and contribute to local communities.  
   
The United States is proud to be a global leader in responding to the
needs of refugees and displaced people worldwide. We are the largest
donor of humanitarian assistance globally, providing those in need with
life-saving food, water, shelter, and medical care. Our commitment to
refugee protection extends to doing more to address the root causes of
displacement, including to resolve conflicts and oppression in troubled
parts of the world. This Administration has also led an historic
expansion of lawful pathways so migrants do not put themselves and their
families at grave risk undertaking perilous journeys.  
   
Here at home, my Administration has rebuilt the U.S. Refugee Admissions
Program, strengthened our extensive refugee vetting processes, and
expanded access to resettlement to the most vulnerable around the
world. In Fiscal Year 2024, we are on track to resettle more than
100,000 refugees in the United States, the most in three decades.
Refugees make significant political, social, and economic contributions
that enrich American communities. Refugees and asylees contributed
almost $124 billion to our nation’s economy from 2005 to 2019.  Last
year, to expand opportunities for Americans to more directly help
refugees, the United States launched the [Welcome
Corps](https://welcomecorps.org/), an initiative that builds upon our
country’s long tradition of providing refuge to people forced to flee
their homes in search of safety and freedom through sponsorship.   
   
Despite our achievements resettling refugees at home and protecting them
overseas, we have much left to do. Together with our partners, we must
work toward a world where people are safe from persecution and war, and
where all people feel welcome and integrated into their communities.
