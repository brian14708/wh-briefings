On June 10-11, Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor
Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall traveled to Mexico City. On June 10, she and

López Obrador. They discussed our ongoing joint efforts to reduce
irregular migration flows, promote the use of lawful immigration
pathways, invest in addressing the root causes of migration throughout
the region, and counter fentanyl and arms trafficking.

On June 11, Dr. Sherwood-Randall and Ambassador Salazar met with
President-elect Dr. Claudia Sheinbaum. Dr. Sherwood-Randall expressed
congratulations on behalf of President Biden and the entire
Administration on Dr. Sheinbaum’s historic election.  She and Dr.
Sheinbaum discussed the enduring value of the U.S.-Mexico partnership
and the opportunities it creates to deliver security and prosperity for
the people of both nations and our shared Hemisphere.

These meetings took place on the second anniversary of the [Los Angeles
Declaration on Migration and
Protection](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/07/fact-sheet-third-ministerial-meeting-on-the-los-angeles-declarationon-migration-and-protection-in-guatemala/) and

initiatives that President Biden has successfully launched and led.
