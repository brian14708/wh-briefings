title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Proposal to Prohibit Medical Bills\
  \ from Being Included on Credit Reports and Calls on States and Localities to Take\
  \ Further Actions to Reduce Medical\_Debt"
---
 
*American Rescue Plan funds are being used to eliminate an estimated $7
billion in medical debt for up to nearly 3 million of Americans; the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) proposal would ensure that
no Americans have medical debt on their credit reports, down from 46
million in 2020*

Today, Vice President Harris and CFPB Director Rohit Chopra announced a
new action by the CFPB that would remove medical debt from credit
reports of more than 15 million Americans, raising their credit scores
by an average of 20 points and leading to the approval of approximately
22,000 additional mortgages every year. Under the CFPB proposed rule,
there would be zero Americans with medical debt listed on their credit
reports, down from 46 million in 2020. The Vice President also called
upon states, local governments, and health care providers to take
additional actions to reduce the burden of medical debt for millions of
Americans, building upon the $7 billion in medical debt that is being
eliminated by the end of 2026 thanks to the American Rescue Plan
(ARP).  
  
President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that getting sick or
taking care of loved ones should not mean financial hardship for
American families. The burden of medical debt and its impact on credit
reports inflicts serious financial repercussions on American families,
restricting access to credit, increasing risk of bankruptcy, creating
barriers to housing and health care access, and negatively impacting
health outcomes. This debt is often placed on American families [despite
evidence](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_medical-debt-burden-in-the-united-states_report_2022-03.pdf)
of medical bills frequently being invalid, unsubstantiated, and
inaccurate. And these repercussions do not fall equally across
Americans—Black and Hispanic communities, as well as people with low
incomes, veterans, older adults, and young adults of all races and
ethnicities, are disproportionately impacted by medical debt.  
  
While the Biden-Harris Administration has been hard at work to tackle
medical debt and to lower the costs of prescription drugs and health
care, Congressional Republicans have repeatedly opposed efforts to lower
health care costs and for years have tried to repeal the Affordable Care
Act. A recent Budget proposal from the Republican Study
Committee—representing 100% of House Republican leadership and nearly
80% of their members— cuts  Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care
Act, and would prevent Medicare from directly negotiating lower
prescription drug prices. And instead of supporting the CFPB’s efforts
to bar medical debt from credit reporting, the Republican proposal would
defund the CFPB entirely.  
  
Today, Vice President Harris is calling on states, local governments,
and health care providers to take comprehensive action to reduce the
burden of medical debt, including but not limited to:

-   **Leverage public dollars to purchase and eliminate medical
    debt;**  
-   **Prevent accumulation of medical debt and protect patients from
    aggressive debt collectors by expanding access to charity care**;
    and  
-   **Protect patients and consumers by limiting coercive debt
    collections practices by health care providers and third-party debt
    collectors.**

These strategies will help ensure that no one will need to go into debt
to get the health care that they need.

**Leverage public dollars to purchase and eliminate medical debt**  
  
Several states, cities, and counties have pioneered medical debt relief
efforts in their communities leveraging American Rescue Plan funds.
Building on that momentum, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on
additional states and localities to leverage their own funding to aid
families and relieve additional medical debt, including debt that
patients have more recently accrued. Because past-due medical debt is
frequently available for purchase at a discount, states and localities
are often able to purchase this debt for pennies on the dollar.  
  
**Thanks to the American Rescue Plan (ARP), states, counties, and cities
are canceling an estimated $7 billion in medical debt for up to nearly 3
million Americans**, including:

-   **Arizona** is using ARP funds to relieve an estimated up to $2
    billion in medical debt for up to 1 million Arizonans.
-   **Cook County, Illinois** is investing ARP funds to wipe out an
    estimated up to $1 billion in medical debt for 400,000 residents.
    Since launching in 2022, the ARP-funded Cook County Medical Debt
    Relief Initiative has already benefited over 200,000 residents.
-   **New Jersey** has budgeted millions of dollars that could be drawn
    from the State’s ARP funds to eliminate up to $1 billion in medical
    debts, benefiting an estimated 400,000 residents of the Garden
    State.
-   **Connecticut** is using ARP funding to cancel up to $650 million in
    medical debt for an estimated 250,000 residents.
-   **Wayne County, Michigan** is providing funding enabled in part by
    ARP to eliminate up to $700 million in medical debt for up to
    200,000 residents.
-   **Orange County, Florida** is leveraging ARP funding to relieve up
    to $450 million in medical debt for over 150,000 residents.
-   **Oakland County, Michigan** is using ARP funds to eliminate up to
    $200 million in medical debt, benefiting up to 80,000 residents.
-   **Cleveland, Ohio** is investing public funds enabled by ARP to
    purchase and retire more than $180 million in medical debt. To date,
    the initiative has already helped over 160,000 residents.
-   **Toledo and Lucas County, Ohio** are partnering, including
    leveraging ARP funding to relieve up to $240 million in medical debt
    for up to 50,000 residents.
-   **Cincinnati, Ohio** is using public funds to retire medical debt
    for an estimated almost 60,000 residents.
-   **New Orleans, Louisiana** is using public funds to cancel
    approximately $130 million in medical debt for up to 50,000
    residents.
-   **St. Paul, Minnesota** will invest ARP funding to relieve up to
    $110 million in medical debt, benefiting more than 40,000 residents.
-   **Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania** is leveraging ARP funding to discharge
    an estimated $115 million in medical debt for up to 40,000
    residents.
-   **City and County of Kalamazoo, Michigan** are partnering to
    eliminate up to $89 million in medical debt for over 30,000
    residents.
-   **St. Louis, Missouri** is investing ARP funding to relieve medical
    debt for roughly 30,000 residents.
-   **Akron, Ohio** is committing ARP funding to eliminate medical debt
    for an estimated 20,000 residents.

**Prevent accumulation of medical debt and protect patients from
aggressive debt collectors by expanding access to charity care**  
  
Despite receiving roughly $60 billion in tax breaks, too many nonprofit
hospitals are failing to provide sufficient financial assistance – or
failing to make known the availability of financial assistance – to
low-income patients. In fact, recent reporting and [CFPB
research](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/understanding-required-financial-assistance-in-medical-care/)
show that some non-profit hospitals are erecting significant barriers to
obtaining financial assistance. Overall, one report found that
non-profit hospitals are [spending only
2.3%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nonprofit-hospitals-vs-for-profit-charity-care-spending-11657936777)
of their revenue on financial assistance, a lower percentage than
for-profit hospitals.

To increase financial assistance for low-income families, the Vice
President is calling on states to pass legislation or take executive
action to expand eligibility for financial assistance and increase
screening of patients. Research shows that uptake of financial
assistance not only reduces financial burdens but also [promotes access
to care and improves
health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9634821/) – as
patients with less debt are more likely to obtain high-value follow-up
care. These impacts would accrue to uninsured and low-income families,
reducing wealth and health inequality. Actions like these will prevent
the accumulation of medical debt by lowering patients’ upfront health
care costs and ensuring that they are not forced to take on medical debt
in order to receive care.

Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [recently announced
plans](https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/irs-plans-more-nonprofit-hospital-audits-as-scrutiny-heats-up)
to increase audits of tax-exempt hospitals in fiscal year 2024 to better
ensure that nonprofit hospitals provide the community benefits necessary
to maintain their non-profit status.

**Protect patients and consumers by limiting coercive debt collections
practices by hospitals and third-party debt collectors**

Research by the CFPB shows that [tens of millions of
people](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-highlighting-consumer-protection-issues-in-medical-debt-collection/)
are pursued by debt collectors annually. These collectors, including
both hospitals and third-party debt collectors, often subject patients
to persistent and aggressive collection practices, including litigation,
wage garnishment, and charging excessive interest. The CFPB is already
taking action to ensure that medical debt collections follow the law,
including taking supervision and enforcement efforts where appropriate,
reminding collection entities about their legal obligations, supporting
state-level enforcement actions, and conducting education and outreach
activities to inform consumers of their rights.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration calls on states to build on these
actions to curb coercive debt collections practices. Several states have
already taken actions to limit debt collection practices, including to
require financial assistance screening by hospitals before debt is sold
to a third party, pausing collections on medical debt until patients’
insurance coverage appeals are settled, requiring debt collectors to
provide written notices of patient rights and responsibilities, and
capping interest rates charged on medical debt. States should swiftly
move to adopt practices such as these to limit the coercive power of
debt collectors and protect patients from unfair collection practices.

**The Biden-Harris Record on Lowering Health Care Costs and Reducing the
Burden of Medical Debt**

The Biden-Harris Administration has made great progress in reducing the
impact of medical debt since the President and Vice President launched a
whole-of-government effort.  By making coverage under the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) more affordable and accessible and expanding Medicaid in
four states, this Administration has enrolled millions of Americans into
coverage and driven the uninsured rate to the lowest point in history.
Following the release of a CFPB report in March 2022 that found that
Americans owed $88 billion in unpaid medical bills, the three largest
credit reporting agencies announced that they would no longer include
paid medical debts, unpaid medical debts less than a year old, and
medical debt under $500 from credit reporting. This action reduced the
amount of households with medical debt on credit reports from 46 million
in 2020 to 15 million Americans today, and the CFPB’s proposed rule
would bring that number to zero. Removing medical bills from consumer
credit reporting and the Vice President’s call on states to take action
both build on the significant progress the Biden-Harris Administration
has already made to lower health care costs and address the negative
impacts of medical debt, including:

-   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) implemented [a streamlined
    process](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-supporting-veterans-experiencing-financial-hardship-and-addressing-the-harmful-effects-of-military-environmental-exposures/#:~:text=VA%20will%20streamline%20the%20request%20process%20and%20set,effect%20in%20the%20next%2090%20to%20120%20days.)
    to make it easier and faster for lower-income veterans to get their
    VA medical debt forgiven, already providing relief to over 10,000
    veterans and saved them more than $10 million in copay debt.  
-   The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) [validated and
    approved](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Documents/CS-Fact-Sheet-2022.pdf) the
    use of VantageScore 4.0, along with FICO 10T, for the underwriting
    of mortgages by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, marking the first time
    that a credit score that excludes medical debt has been approved for
    mortgage underwriting of Enterprise loans.  
-   The Small Business Administration (SBA) is taking steps to reduce
    the role of medical debt in the underwriting of loans for its
    flagship 7(a) guaranteed loan program, including revising its lender
    Standard Operating Procedures and Lender Match tool to discourage
    consideration of medical debt.  
-   The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued
    memorandum
    [M-22-17](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/M-22-17.pdf)
    to direct agencies to reduce the impact of medical debt in the
    underwriting of Federal credit programs, helping to spur the actions
    by VA, FHFA, and SBA listed above.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of the Treasury
[issued a joint request for
information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/notice-opportunities-comment/archive-closed/request-for-information-on-medical-payment-products/)
seeking comment on the prevalence, nature, and impact of medical payment
products.

-   The Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury
    have prioritized implementing [surprise billing
    protections](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-new-steps-to-lower-prescription-drug-and-health-care-costs-expand-access-to-health-care-and-protect-consumers/),
    preventing 1 million Americans from receiving surprise medical bills
    every single month.  
-   As a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden [capped
    the cost of insulin at
    $35](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-president-bidens-cap-on-the-cost-of-insulin-could-benefit-millions-of-americans-in-all-50-states/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20announced%20they%20are%20lowering%20the%20cost,diabetes%20in%20all%20fifty%20states%20and%20U.S.%20territories.)
    and capped out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 annually
    starting in 2025 for seniors and others with Medicare. Since taking
    these actions, President Biden has called on Congress [to expand
    these
    caps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-new-steps-to-lower-prescription-drug-and-health-care-costs-expand-access-to-health-care-and-protect-consumers/#:~:text=Expand%20Cap%20on%20Out%2Dof%2DPocket%20Prescription%20Drug%20Costs.&text=The%20President%20is%20calling%20on,putting%20food%20on%20the%20table.)
    to cover all Americans.  
-   President Biden has [called on
    states](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/10/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-lowers-health-care-costs/)
    to close the Medicaid coverage gap and create new pathways to health
    coverage by expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.  
-   The Biden-Harris Administration
    [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-landmark-rule-to-protect-americans-from-junk-health-insurance/#:~:text=Under%20the%20new%20rules%2C%20new%20plans%20that%20claim,they%20in%20fact%20provided%20little%20to%20no%20coverage.)
    a final rule that protects consumers from junk health insurance and
    makes sure Americans aren’t scammed into low-quality coverage that
    leaves consumers on the hook for thousands of dollars in medical
    bills.  
-   The White House [convened state and local
    leaders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/08/readout-of-the-white-house-state-convening-on-medical-debt/)
    to discuss initiatives to further lower health care costs and reduce
    the burden of medical debt, including addressing medical payment
    products, unfair debt collection practices, surprise billing and
    facility fees, and charity care.
