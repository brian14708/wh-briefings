title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Anniversary of\_DACA"
---
 
Twelve years ago today, President Obama and I announced the Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to allow our young people
to live and work in the only country they’ve called home. Since then,
DACA has provided more than 800,000 Dreamers with the ability to work
lawfully, pursue an education, open businesses, and contribute their
enormous talents to make our communities better and stronger.

I’m proud of the contributions of Dreamers to our country and I am
committed to providing Dreamers the support they need to succeed. That’s
why I directed the Department of Homeland Security to take all
appropriate actions to “preserve and fortify” DACA, and that’s why we
continue to vigorously defend the DACA rule in court. That’s also why
last month, the Department of Health and Human Services took the
historic step of expanding access to affordable, quality health coverage
to DACA recipients through the Affordable Care Act.

On Day One of my administration, I sent a comprehensive immigration
reform plan to Congress to protect Dreamers and their families. While
Vice President Harris and I will continue fighting for our Dreamers,
only Congress can provide permanent and lasting stability for them and
their families. Congress must still act.
