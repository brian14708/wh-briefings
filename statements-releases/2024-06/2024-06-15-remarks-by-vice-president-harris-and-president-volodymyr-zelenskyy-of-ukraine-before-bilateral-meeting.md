     PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you so much.  Happy to see you —  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  And you.  
   
     PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  — Madam Vice President, and to see your
team.  Thank you so much.   
   
     First, I would like to thank the United States and the President
Biden, his team for our security agreement — thank you so much — between
Ukraine and America.  We signed it in Italy.  And today we can already
say that our teams have started to implement it.   
   
     And these are truly historic steps that strengthen the security of
Ukraine and, therefore, of the whole Europe and, therefore, of
America.    
   
     And I also want to thank the U.S. Congress — both parties, both
chambers — for passing a package.  That is really very important for us,
our people.  And Putin is trying to expand the war and make it more
bloody.  But together, with America and all our partners, we protect the
lives of our people and open up new opportunities for diplomacy.   
   
     Actually, we are here today for the sake of diplomacy.  And Ukraine
has always believed in the power of diplomacy.  War is not our choice;
it’s Putin’s choice.  At the peace summit today, we will do everything
we can to start moving towards real peace through di- — diplomacy.  And
I am grateful to America for its support.   
   
     I thank you, Madam Vice President, for your participation in the
summit.  And it is indeed vital that — that the United States is helping
to bring peace closer.    
   
     Happy to see you.  Thank you very much.   
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.  Thank you, President
Zelenskyy.  It is good to see you again.  I — by my count, I think this
is our sixth meeting together in person.  And —    
   
     PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Not the last.  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  And — for sure not the last and hopefully
in better times.   
   
     It is good to see you again.  And President Biden was very happy
with the time that you spent together over the last couple of weeks and
in — most recently in Italy.    
   
     You and I last met in person four months ago at the Munich Security
Conference.  Since then, Russia has continued its brutal aggression
against the people of Ukraine, including opening a new front outside of
Kharkiv and relentlessly attacking Ukraine’s energy system.  Yet the
people of Ukraine, so admirably, stand firm.  
   
     President Biden and my support for the people of Ukraine is
unwavering.  We support Ukraine not out of charity but because the
people of Ukraine and their future is in our strategic interests.  It is
in our interest to uphold international rules and norms, such as
sovereignty and territorial integrity and the international system we
helped create following World War Two, which bolsters America’s security
and prosperity.    
   
     It is in the interest of the United States to defend democratic
values and stand up to dictators.  It is in our interest to stand with
our friends, such as Ukraine.   
   
     As a demonstration of that support, President Joe Biden recently
signed into law, as you mentioned, $60 billion in funding to support
Ukraine.  Since then, we have rapidly delivered weapons to Ukraine, and
our support is having a significant impact on the battlefield.   
   
     And just this week, you and President Biden, as you mentioned,
signed a bilateral security agreement, a demonstration of our long-term
commitment to Ukraine’s defense.   
   
     President Zelenskyy, your military remains a resilient and
effective fighting force, so admirably — one that has and will continue
to impress the world.  And this war remains an utter failure for
Putin.   
   
     I am here in Switzerland to stand with Ukraine and the leaders from
around the world in support of a just and lasting peace.  As we look
forward to that peace and work toward that, the United States is
committed to helping Ukraine rebuild.   
   
     To that end, today I am pleased to announce that the United States
will provide more than one and a half billion dollars to address
Ukraine’s humanitarian and energy needs and to help relieve the
suffering of the people of Ukraine.   
   
     This number includes $824 million for critical ener- — energy
needs, including repairing energy infrastructure; $379 million in
humanitarian assistance, including food, water, shelter, and health
services; and $300 million for civilian security assistance, including
support for law enforcement.   
   
     President Zelenskyy, this support is a demonstration of the fact —
the indisputable fact the United States stands with the people of
Ukraine.  And I look forward to our discussion today.  
   
     Thank you.  
   
                               END                 3:48 P.M. CEST
