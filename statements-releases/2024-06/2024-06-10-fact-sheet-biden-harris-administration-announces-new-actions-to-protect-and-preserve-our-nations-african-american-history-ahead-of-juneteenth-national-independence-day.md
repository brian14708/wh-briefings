title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Protect\
  \ and Preserve Our Nation\u2019s African American History Ahead of Juneteenth National\
  \ Independence\_Day"
---
 
Since day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris have [advanced
racial justice](https://www.whitehouse.gov/equity/) and asserted that
**Black history is American history**. We build a better future —
together as a Nation — not by trying to erase America’s past, but by
knowing our full history as a country. The Biden-Harris Administration
is committed to recognizing the full arc of our Nation’s history,
including African American history, to help us understand how the past
connects us to the present and shapes our shared future.

The Biden-Harris Administration is proud of its record of recognition of
the history and contributions of Black people to our country. The
President was proud to [sign into law the Juneteenth National
Independence Day
Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/17/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-the-juneteenth-national-independence-day-act/),
the first new Federal holiday since the creation of the Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. holiday 41 years ago in 1983, [designate the Emmett
Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National
Monument](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/07/25/a-proclamation-on-establishment-of-the-emmett-till-and-mamie-till-mobley-national-monument/),
and posthumously [award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Medgar
Evers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/03/president-biden-announces-recipients-of-the-presidential-medal-of-freedom-2/). Despite
growing forces that are attacking racial progress and attempting to
rewrite history, the President and Vice President are committed to
remind us that our country is only strengthened by the breadth,
complexity, and significance of the Nation’s African American history.

Today, the White House Domestic Policy Council is convening
Administration officials, award-winning artists, civil rights leaders,
and nationally-renowned scholars for a [live-streamed
event](https://www.youtube.com/live/P3leRn-yUpQ) on honoring and
protecting the country’s African American history. This event will
demonstrate actions the Federal Government is taking to protect and
preserve African American history; and supports ways the public can
commemorate Juneteenth, as well as uplift the experiences, histories,
and impacts of Black Americans.

Later today, the [President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities
(PCAH)](https://www.pcah.gov/), in partnership with the White House, is
producing the [second annual celebration of Juneteenth National
Independence
Day](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/07/white-house-announces-juneteenth-concert-2/)
— the official end of chattel slavery in the United States. This
large-scale concert on the White House South Lawn will also celebrate
[Black Music
Month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/05/31/a-proclamation-on-black-music-month-2024/)
and feature African American musical legends to honor and contextualize
American history through this important Federal holiday. This event
spotlights the richness of the arts and humanities to demonstrate
African American history as an indelible part our shared National story.

Vice President Harris has declared Juneteenth— June 19, 2024 — as one of
[three National Days of Action on
Voting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/27/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-before-meeting-with-voting-rights-leaders-to-discuss-the-fight-for-voting-rights-and-other-fundamental-freedoms/).
With a focus on voter engagement, these National Days of Action on
Voting aim to ensure all Americans have the information they need to
vote, promote voter participation for students, protect election
workers, and fight voter suppression laws. Other National Days of Action
on Voting are the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 2024
and National Voter Registration Day on September 17, 2024.

**Protecting National Truths and Public Access to African American
History and Culture**

Aligned with President Biden’s [Executive Order on Promoting the Arts,
the Humanities, and Museum and Library
Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/09/30/executive-order-on-promoting-the-arts-the-humanities-and-museum-and-library-services/),
the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the National Endowment for
the Humanities (NEH), and the Institute of Museum and Library Services
(IMLS), in coordination with national and local philanthropic and civil
society organizations, are committed to protecting and preserving
African American history and culture.

-   To commemorate Juneteenth, the National Archives Museum [announced
    it will display the original Emancipation Proclamation and General
    Order No.
    3](https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2024/nr24-28#:~:text=Washington%2C%20DC,a%20ticket%20at%20recreation.gov.)
    from June 18 – June 20, 2024.
-   The National Park Service (NPS) announced [Free Entrance Days in the
    National
    Parks](https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/fee-free-parks.htm), where
    all visitor entrance fees will be waived at Park Service sites for
    Juneteenth on June 19, 2024.
-   The National Endowment for the Humanities published a [digital
    repository](https://www.neh.gov/news/neh-virtual-bookshelf-juneteenth)
    of resources that commemorate Juneteenth by deepening public
    understanding of African American history from the Reconstruction
    Era to the present.
-   NEH will establish a nationwide program focused on celebrating
    Juneteenth and promoting African American history and culture in the
    leadup to the 160th Anniversary of Juneteenth in 2025.  These new
    actions will include: new funding opportunities in all 50 states and
    Territories to support reading and discussion programs, traveling
    museum exhibits, and interactive workshops about the legacy of
    slavery and Emancipation, as well as the origins and significance of
    Juneteenth; lectures on pivotal moments in African American history
    and culture; film and documentaries on the ongoing struggle for
    freedom; new free and classroom-ready educational Juneteenth content
    for K-12 educators; and other efforts to preserve African American
    history and culture at the community and state level. These programs
    will culminate in a grand celebration of Juneteenth in 2025,
    bringing together local communities across the nation to commemorate
    the end of slavery in the United States and reflect on the progress
    and challenges faced by African Americans throughout history.
-   In response to the troubling spike in book bans that threaten
    Americans’ rights, the U.S. Department of Education named a
    coordinator for responding to book bans in order to support the
    public and school communities in understanding the civil rights
    impact that book restrictions can have, and the circumstances under
    which such restrictions can violate federal civil rights laws. The
    focus of many of the current bans occurring across America
    disproportionately strip books about the experiences of historically
    marginalized groups of people, including, books about African
    American history. By conducting trainings throughout the country,
    the book ban coordinator is working to ensure that parents,
    students, teachers, school administrators, authors, and elected
    officials know and understand that where book bans target specific
    communities, they may violate students’ civil rights. Book banning
    erodes our democracy, removes vital resources for student learning,
    and can contribute to the bias, isolation, and social invisibility
    that Black, LGBTQ+, and other marginalized communities face.
-   On June 12, 2024 the [White House Initiative on Advancing
    Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Black
    Americans](https://sites.ed.gov/whblackinitiative) will host [Power
    Up –
    Chicago](https://web.cvent.com/event/d470ac79-3858-4b2b-baeb-d27d895d8a85/summary),
    convening experts to discuss the critical role of well-rounded
    education in empowering Black students and supporting academic
    excellence. Experts will explore the impact of a holistic approach
    to education, including the importance of cultural relevance and
    learning opportunities that include honest African American history
    and access to diverse literature. In January 2024, the White House
    Initiative hosted [Power Up – South
    Carolina](https://sites.ed.gov/whblackinitiative/power-up-sc-agenda/)
    that featured the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil
    Rights and a community training on how book bans may violate Federal
    civil rights laws and the process to resolve potential violations.
-   In July, the National Endowment for the Arts will announce new
    recipients of the [NEA Jazz Masters
    Fellowship](https://www.arts.gov/honors/jazz), the Nation’s highest
    honor in jazz. From its origins in the Black American experience to
    what is now a global treasure, jazz is a uniquely American art form
    and source of inspiration and creativity. This cohort of rare
    fellowships include an award of $25,000; and the honorees will be
    celebrated at a public concert where NEA commits to centering and
    uplifting the African American roots of jazz during the program.
-   As part of the [IMLS 250: All Stories. All People. All Places
    initiative](https://www.imls.gov/news/imls-250-all-stories-all-people-all-places),
    the Institute of Museum and Library Services will be highlighting a
    variety of funded projects focused on preserving and protecting
    African American history from museums, libraries, and archives
    across the country. For example, the award-winning [Visions of
    America
    series](https://www.imls.gov/news/imls-visions-america-all-stories-all-people-all-places-series-wins-best-public-television)
    highlights lesser-known moments in our country’s history and
    culture, such as African American culture in Kansas City at the
    Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and the American Jazz Museum.

**Investing in Local Institutions to Preserve African American History
and Culture**

The Biden-Harris Administration is also announcing efforts to strengthen
America’s vibrant tapestry of community-based organizations, library
systems, museums and cultural institutions, as well as building capacity
across the local arts and humanities workforces that care for our
Nation’s treasures.

-   Established 21 years ago in 2003, the [Museum Grants for African
    American History and Culture
    (AAHC)](https://www.imls.gov/grants/available/museum-grants-african-american-history-and-culture),
    administered by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS),
    is one of the longest-standing Federal programs in support of
    preserving and protecting African American history and culture. In
    Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, AAHC is funding awards to 31 organizations
    for projects to begin July 1, 2024— including a continuing
    partnership with the Association of African American Museums to
    build the capacity for this national network of institutions. AAHC
    grant program applications for FY 2025 will open in mid-August 2024
    with an expected funding level of $6 million, a historic high for
    the program and represent an increase of over $4 million compared to
    funding levels over the last five fiscal years.
-   In Spring 2024, the NEA— in partnership with the Advisory Council on
    Historic Preservation, the U.S. Department of Education, Library of
    Congress, NEH and IMLS— began a new mixed-methods research study to
    map the arts and cultural assets of Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities (HBCUs), analyzing regional arts and culture workforce
    needs, and detailing how HBCUs are partnering with local, state and
    regional arts organizations to preserve the heritage of these
    institutions.
-   The National Endowment for the Arts, in partnership with a
    consortium of U.S. Regional Arts Organizations (RAOs), will announce
    a cohort of nearly one hundred
    [ArtsHERE](https://www.arts.gov/initiatives/artshere) grantees in
    September 2024. Launched in November 2023 by NEA in response to the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government priorities on
    advancing racial equity, ArtsHERE is a new $10 million pilot program
    that awards $65,000 to $130,000 grants to support local projects by
    organizations demonstrating a commitment to reducing barriers and
    driving equitable participation in the arts for underserved
    communities that historically lack access.
-   Since January 2021, NEH has invested more than $50 million in
    humanities projects that promote African American history and
    culture, support HBCUs, and counter hate-motivated violence. In
    furtherance of its [Equity Action
    Plan](https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/NEH%20Agency%20Equity%20Action%20Plan%20--%20Final%20Public%20Version.pdf),
    NEH has launched three new offices to deepen its engagement with
    HBCUs, African American communities, and other underserved
    institutions and communities, including its inaugural Office of
    Outreach. 

**Safeguarding Sites and Preserving Communities that Hold America’s
Treasured Histories**

The Biden-Harris Administration is ensuring that new and ongoing Federal
investments help protect the unique local traditions, sacred stories,
and generational legacies that breathe life and pride into America’s
cities and towns, historic districts and Freedmen’s settlements,
landmarks, monuments, and National parks.

-   Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the Department of Interior
    (DOI) through NPS, has [invested $190
    million](https://www.doi.gov/media/document/interior-departments-commitment-investing-and-protecting-black-history)
    in infrastructure and preservation projects for sites that relate to
    the African American experience across the nation. Additionally,
    through the [Historic Preservation
    Fund](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservationfund/index.htm),
    DOI has invested over $140 million in grants that support the
    preservation of African American history since 2021.
-   NPS announced the availability of new $1.25 million in
    [Underrepresented Communities grants](http://go.nps.gov/urc) by the
    Historic Preservation Fund to diversify the nominations to the
    National Register of Historic Places.
    [Applications](https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/354589) for
    this grant cycle are due on August 29, 2024. In recent years, the
    Park Service has worked to increase the number of African American
    Heritage Sites and National Register designations— such as the Black
    Wall Street Greenwood Business District, the site of the 1921 Tulsa
    Race Massacre. African American-historic sites make up less than 3%
    of overall sites in the National Register.
-   In February 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) launched
    the [“Past, Present, and Future of Reconnecting
    Communities”](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/dc61e3bcecd44464b4bfef8299d9d6ce)
    storymap to document communities, including historic Black
    neighborhoods and business districts that were razed or displaced as
    a result of decades of documented racial discrimination in Federal
    transportation policy. As part of DOT’s [ongoing equity
    efforts](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportations-commitment-investing-and-protecting-black-communities),
    the agency will announce new infrastructure grants and roll out new
    digital resources to uplift the stories of local communities,
    including many Black communities, who are benefiting from the
    billions of dollars in nationwide projects made possible under
    President Biden’s landmark [Investing in
    America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/) agenda.
-   The National Endowment for the Humanities will create a special
    encouragement in its grant programs for projects that preserve and
    promote access to historical collections documenting the history of
    slavery and its legacies, amplify African American voices in the
    stewardship of history and culture, and safeguard African American
    cultural resources from the threat of loss, such as during public
    health crises and the negative effects of climate change.
-   Throughout the summer and fall of 2024, the President’s Committee on
    Arts and the Humanities will partner with nonprofit organizations
    and Federal art and humanities agencies to launch programs and
    initiatives that address sustainability and capacity challenges of
    historically underserved creative and cultural communities—
    including local institutions, such as African American-owned
    theaters—who are at high-risk of generational loss, displacement,
    erasure, and climate-related natural disaster. Additional programs
    will facilitate cross-sector dialogue on the development of
    culturally sensitive artificial intelligence, explore improved
    community arts integration in Black communities who have been
    historically disrupted by infrastructure projects, and promote
    coordinated policy on ethical returns of African and African
    American cultural heritage in the museum sector. Alongside federal
    partners, PCAH will also pilot locally-driven placemaking projects
    with libraries located in historically Black cities and Territories.
-   The National Park Service and the National Park Foundation announced
    a new Request for Proposals (RFP) and new round of funding in
    support of [Inclusive
    Storytelling](https://www.nationalparks.org/explore/programs/inclusive-storytelling)
    that focuses on amplifying, documenting, and sharing lesser-known
    stories of America throughout the park system. The RFP and grant
    [application](https://www.nationalparks.org/grant-applications) for
    this round of funding closes on June 12, 2024. Last year, the
    program awarded more than $4 million in grants to support 57
    projects nationwide.

**Advancing Racial Equity and Making History Through the Biden-Harris
Administration**

The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to further advancing
racial justice so that the promise of America is real for every
American, including Black Americans.

-   Signed [two Executive Orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/equity/)
    directing the Federal Government to advance an ambitious
    whole-of-government equity agenda to redress systemic barriers,
    including increasing access to Federal contracting dollars, capital,
    and lending programs for small disadvantaged businesses; advancing
    civil rights and environmental justice; closing health disparities;
    building economic prosperity in rural communities; and combating
    urban community disinvestment and housing discrimination.
-   Signed an [Executive Order on Promoting Access to
    Voting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/)
    to leverage the resources of the Federal Government to provide
    nonpartisan information about the election process and increase
    access to voter registration. Agencies across the Federal Government
    are taking action to respond to the President’s call for an
    all-of-government effort to enhance the ability of all eligible
    Americans to participate in our democracy.
-   [Announced new
    actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/27/readout-of-vice-president-kamala-harriss-convening-with-voting-rights-leaders-2/)
    to protect the sacred right to vote, including increased funding for
    the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, which has more
    than doubled the number of voting rights enforcement staff. The
    Justice Department also created the Election Threats Task Force to
    address violence against election workers and ensure that all
    election workers are able to do their jobs free from threats and
    intimidation.

The Biden-Harris Administration is delivering history-making results,
including for Black Americans:

-   Under President Biden, the Black unemployment rate and gap between
    Black and white unemployment hit record lows.
-   Black wealth is up 60% relative to pre-pandemic levels.
-   Black-owned businesses are being created at the fastest rate in 30
    years.
-   Selected the first Black person and first woman to serve as Vice
    President of the United States.
-   Nominated the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court and
    more Black women to federal circuit courts than every President
    combined.
-   Appointed the most diverse Presidential administration in American
    history.
