title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces New Actions to Keep Families\_Together"
---
 
Since his first day in office, President Biden has called on Congress to
secure our border and address our broken immigration system. As
Congressional Republicans have continued to put partisan politics ahead
of national security – twice voting against the toughest and fairest set
of reforms in decades – the President and his Administration have taken
actions to secure the border, including:  

-   Implementing executive actions to bar migrants who cross our
    Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum when encounters are
    high;  
-   Deploying record numbers of law enforcement personnel,
    infrastructure, and technology to the Southern border;  
-   Seizing record amounts of fentanyl at our ports of entry;  
-   Revoking the visas of CEOs and government officials outside the U.S.
    who profit from migrants coming to the U.S. unlawfully; and  
-   Expanding efforts to dismantle human smuggling networks and
    prosecuting individuals who violate immigration laws.

President Biden believes that securing the border is essential. He also
believes in expanding lawful pathways and keeping families together, and
that immigrants who have been in the United States for decades, paying
taxes and contributing to their communities, are part of the social
fabric of our country. The Day One immigration reform plan that the
President sent to Congress reflects both the need for a secure border
and protections for the long-term undocumented. While Congress has
failed to act on these reforms, the Biden-Harris Administration has
worked to strengthen our lawful immigration system. In addition to
vigorously defending the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood arrivals)
policy, the Administration has extended Affordable Care Act coverage to
DACA recipients and streamlined, expanded, and instituted new
reunification programs so that families can stay together while they
complete the immigration process.   
  
Still, there is more that we can do to bring peace of mind and stability
to Americans living in mixed-status families as well as young people
educated in this country, including Dreamers. That is why today,
President Biden announced new actions for people who have been here many
years to keep American families together and allow more young people to
contribute to our economy.    
  
**<u>Keeping American Families Together</u>**

-   Today, President Biden is announcing that the Department of Homeland
    Security will take action to ensure that U.S. citizens with
    noncitizen spouses and children can keep their families together.  
-   This new process will help certain noncitizen spouses and children
    apply for lawful permanent residence – status that they are already
    eligible for – without leaving the country.  
-   These actions will promote family unity and strengthen our economy,
    providing a significant benefit to the country and helping U.S.
    citizens and their noncitizen family members stay together.  
-   In order to be eligible, noncitizens must – as of June 17, 2024 –
    have resided in the United States for 10 or more years and be
    legally married to a U.S. citizen, while satisfying all applicable
    legal requirements. On average, those who are eligible for this
    process have resided in the U.S. for 23 years.  
-   Those who are approved after DHS’s case-by-case assessment of their
    application will be afforded a three-year period to apply for
    permanent residency. They will be allowed to remain with their
    families in the United States and be eligible for work authorization
    for up to three years. This will apply to all married couples who
    are eligible.    
-   This action will protect approximately half a million spouses of
    U.S. citizens, and approximately 50,000 noncitizen children under
    the age of 21 whose parent is married to a U.S. citizen.

**<u>Easing the Visa Process for U.S. College Graduates, Including
Dreamers</u>**

-   President Obama and then-Vice President Biden established the
    DACA policy to allow young people who were brought here as children
    to come out of the shadows and contribute to our country in
    significant ways. Twelve years later, DACA recipients who started as
    high school and college students are now building successful careers
    and establishing families of their own.  
-   Today’s announcement will allow individuals,  
    including DACA recipients and other Dreamers, who have earned a
    degree at an accredited U.S. institution of higher education in the
    United States, and who have received an offer of employment from a
    U.S. employer in a field related to their degree, to more quickly
    receive work visas.  
-   Recognizing that it is in our national interest to ensure that
    individuals who are educated in the U.S. are able to use their
    skills and education to benefit our country, the Administration is
    taking action to facilitate the employment visa process for those
    who have graduated from college and have a high-skilled job offer,
    including DACA recipients and other Dreamers.
