title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration on World Refugee Day Celebrates\
  \ a Rebuilt U.S. Refugee Admissions\_Program"
---
 
*Plans to welcome more than 100,000 refugees to their new U.S.
communities in Fiscal Year 2024, the most in three decades*

*Encourages Americans to consider directly supporting  
and welcoming a refugee into their community*

From Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized rebuilding
and strengthening the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program after its
dismantling under the previous administration.

The United States has long been a leader in refugee resettlement,
providing a beacon of hope for persecuted people around the world,
facilitating international efforts to address record displacement, and
demonstrating the generosity and core values of the American people.
Today, on World Refugee Day, the Biden-Harris Administration is
providing an update on actions taken under the President’s [Executive
Order
14013](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/executive-order-on-rebuilding-and-enhancing-programs-to-resettle-refugees-and-planning-for-the-impact-of-climate-change-on-migration/)
to restore the nation’s refugee resettlement program as a longstanding
demonstration of the United States’ promise and welcome.

**The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is rebuilt and stronger than
ever.** This fiscal year, the United States will resettle more than
100,000 refugees, the most in three decades. The unfortunate reality is
there are many more refugees who are still overseas and in need of
resettlement. As we look ahead, the Administration encourages Americans
to consider directly supporting and welcoming refugees into their
community through [the Welcome
Corps](https://www.welcomecorps.org/wrd/). You can team up with others
in your community, apply to sponsor a refugee family today, and welcome
them into your community this summer.

Refugee resettlement in the United States represents the opportunity to
start anew and pursue a life of safety and dignity without fear of
persecution. In turn, refugees and asylees enrich American communities
culturally and economically, [contributing almost $124
billion](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/02/15/new-hhs-study-finds-nearly-124-billion-positive-fiscal-impact-refugees-and-asylees-on-american-economy-15-year-period.html)
to our nation’s economy from 2005 to 2019.

**Rebuilding and modernizing resettlement infrastructure**

The Biden-Harris Administration inherited a U.S. Refugee Admissions
Program that had been systematically weakened by the previous
administration. Historically low refugee admissions for four years led
to drastic reductions in funding, staffing, and infrastructure across
the U.S. Government agencies, international organizations, and nonprofit
organizations that manage the program domestically and overseas. Through
a whole-of-government effort starting on Day One, this Administration
methodically rebuilt and modernized the program:

-   **Invested in the domestic resettlement network.** The ten national
    refugee resettlement agencies have opened or reopened more than 150
    local resettlement offices, bringing the total to more than 350. As
    part of this effort, the Department of State and the Department of
    Health and Human Services worked with resettlement partners to
    design new innovative programs and provide targeted technical
    assistance. The Department of State, the Department of Housing and
    Urban Development, the Department of Homeland Security, and HHS also
    recently issued a [fact
    sheet](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/orr/landlord-guide-factsheet.pdf)
    providing information to landlords and property managers about
    renting to refugees.  
-   **Hired more than 300 refugee officers.** DHS has more than tripled
    the size of its refugee officer corps. In the first half of 2024
    alone, these refugee officers interviewed more than 80,000 refugee
    applicants overseas. DHS also partnered with the Department of State
    to expand the international office footprint of the U.S. Citizenship
    and Immigration Services after many offices were closed under the
    previous administration.  
-   **Reimagined overseas processing steps.** The Department of State,
    DHS, and the U.S. Digital Service redesigned the overseas process
    for Afghan refugees by conducting multiple required steps at the
    same time rather than sequentially. This overhaul allowed processing
    to occur within weeks or months—a dramatic decrease from
    historically years-long processing times—without sacrificing
    national security. The Administration expanded this new approach to
    other populations, and by late 2023, more than half of all refugees
    interviewed worldwide went through concurrent processing.  
-   **Digitized processes for greater efficiency.** In September 2023,
    the Department of State, DHS, and USDS fully implemented digital
    case management, shifting away from a paper-based process. Modern
    case management systems at both departments now support overseas
    processing that is more secure, efficient, and cost-effective. The
    Department of State, DHS, the Social Security Administration, and
    USDS also [launched a new automated
    process](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-streamlines-process-for-refugee-employment-authorization-documents)
    that enables most refugees to receive their Employment Authorization
    Documents and Social Security Cards within weeks of their arrival,
    easing their path to self-sufficiency and full integration into
    their new communities.  
-   **Resolved many of the oldest cases in the program.** The Department
    of State, DHS, and USDS created new case tracking mechanisms to
    ensure refugees who have been waiting the longest for a decision on
    their case are prioritized. Since October 2022, more than 32,000
    refugees with cases pending for more than five years have been
    resettled in the United States.  
-   **Launched the Safe Mobility initiative to expand lawful pathways in
    the Western Hemisphere.** In June 2023, the United States announced
    [the Safe Mobility initiative](https://movilidadsegura.org/en/), in
    partnership with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the International
    Organization for Migration. Safe Mobility offices in Colombia, Costa
    Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala provide information and counseling
    about a range of existing services and local integration assistance
    available for refugees and migrants, and facilitate access to lawful
    pathways including refugee resettlement to the United States,
    Canada, and Spain.  
-   **Established the Resettlement Diplomacy Network**. In 2022, the
    Department of State launched a new high-level multilateral forum,
    the Resettlement Diplomacy Network, in partnership with Australia,
    Canada, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the
    European Commission. As the network’s chair, the United States is
    driving an ambitious shared agenda around the global expansion and
    modernization of resettlement programs.

**Building on the generosity of the American people through private
sponsorship**

Over the past few years, the Americans have extended an extraordinarily
generous and welcoming hand to our Afghan allies, Ukrainians displaced
by war, and Venezuelans and others fleeing violence and oppression.
Following President Biden’s direction in Executive Order 14013, the
Administration has created new opportunities for everyday Americans to
engage directly in refugee resettlement:

-   In January 2023, the Department of State launched [**the Welcome
    Corps**](https://www.welcomecorps.org/), a private sponsorship
    program to empower Americans from all walks of life to be matched
    with approved refugees overseas and directly support their
    resettlement and integration as they build new lives in the United
    States. **Now through July 31,** [**the Sponsor
    Fund**](https://www.welcomecorps.org/wrd/) **will cover fundraising
    costs for Americans** **to welcome refugees through the Welcome
    Corps.** This funding is available to help Americans welcome
    refugees into their community this summer, thanks to private
    philanthropy efforts led by the Shapiro Foundation in partnership
    with the Community Sponsorship Hub, WelcomeNST, and GoFundMe.org.  
-   In December 2023, **the Welcome Corps expanded to allow sponsors
    to** [**identify and welcome refugees they
    know**](https://welcomecorps.org/become-a-sponsor/sponsoring-someone-you-know/)**.**
    Sponsors can identify specific refugees they wish to support, a
    first in the history of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.  
-   In August 2024, participating U.S. colleges and universities will
    welcome the first [**Welcome Corps on
    Campus**](https://welcomecorps.org/become-a-sponsor/campus/) cohort
    of 31 refugee students to continue their higher education in the
    United States at 17 participating colleges and universities. This
    World Refugee Day, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary
    of Education Miguel Cardona [sent a
    letter](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/secletter/240618.html)
    to colleges and universities to consider taking steps to support
    refugee resettlement.  
-   In April 2024, the Department of State launched the [**Welcome Corps
    at Work**](https://welcomecorps.org/about/welcome-corps-at-work/), a
    targeted pilot initiative where refugees can be matched with U.S.
    employers in critical industries such as healthcare, education, and
    information technology, and receive support from private sponsors in
    the employer’s community. In September 2022, HHS also launched an
    Employer Engagement Program to help employers develop
    workplace-based training programs.

**Enhancing screening and vetting**

The Administration’s commitment to keeping Americans safe is paramount.
Refugees undergo mandatory and rigorous security vetting overseas,
including biometric and biographic security checks conducted by our
nation’s law enforcement, intelligence, and counterterrorism
professionals. The Administration has taken steps to reform and further
enhance screening and vetting of refugees, including:

-   **Repealed the Muslim ban.** On his first day in office, President
    Biden [repealed the previous administration’s discriminatory Muslim
    ban](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/proclamation-ending-discriminatory-bans-on-entry-to-the-united-states/),
    a stain on our national conscience that was inconsistent with our
    nation’s foundation of religious freedom and tolerance. The
    Administration has since taken additional steps to reform legacy
    nationality-based vetting practices that the previous administration
    weaponized to implement its Muslim ban and exclude applicants on the
    basis of their religion or nationality. These reforms have enhanced
    the program’s rigorous vetting processes and strengthened national
    security.  
-   **Integrated refugee vetting into the National Vetting Center.**
    Consistent with Executive Order 14013, the Administration has
    integrated refugee vetting into the National Vetting Center, which
    has strengthened and simplified the ways that DHS uses intelligence
    and law enforcement information to inform decisions, while
    maintaining strong privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties
    protections.

**Expanding access to resettlement**

The Biden-Harris Administration has expanded access to the U.S. Refugee
Admissions Program for particularly vulnerable individuals facing
persecution:

-   **Opened avenues for resettlement for human rights defenders and the
    most vulnerable LGBTQI+ refugees.** In 2023, the Department of State
    designated two senior U.S. government human rights officials to
    identify individuals in need of resettlement who face persecution as
    a result of their work promoting respect for human rights and those
    who face persecution on the basis of their real or perceived sexual
    orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex
    characteristics.  
-   **Strengthened the ability of U.S. Embassies to refer the most
    vulnerable refugees.** U.S. ambassadors are now encouraged to refer
    to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program any vulnerable individuals
    they have identified as facing persecution and are in need of
    resettlement, an option previously reserved for exceptional
    circumstances.  
-   **Expanded NGO referrals for highly vulnerable cases.** As directed
    in Executive Order 14013, the Department of State partnered with a
    new consortium of non-governmental organizations to identify and
    refer highly vulnerable refugees to the U.S. Refugee Admissions
    Program who are in need of resettlement but are unlikely to be
    identified through traditional resettlement mechanisms, including
    LGBTQI+ refugees and certain ethnic and religious minorities.  
-   **Facilitated protection and expanded access to the refugee program
    for Afghans.** In August 2021, the Administration [announced a
    special refugee
    designation](https://www.state.gov/u-s-refugee-admissions-program-priority-2-designation-for-afghan-nationals/)
    for certain Afghans and their eligible family members, as part of
    the Administration’s commitment to welcoming those who served
    alongside us during the 20-year war in Afghanistan. The
    Administration is also allowing, in certain cases, U.S. government
    and military officials to refer Afghans to the U.S. Refugee
    Admissions Program who worked with the United States in
    Afghanistan.  
-   **Led the most significant increase of operations in the Americas in
    the history of the program.** As forced displacement in the Western
    Hemisphere reaches historic highs, the Administration has
    dramatically expanded operations in the region, in particular
    through the Safe Mobility initiative. The United States has welcomed
    13,000 refugees from the region this year, by far the most in the
    program’s history. Since January 2021, the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR,
    has referred more than twice as many refugees to the U.S. Refugee
    Admissions Program as in the previous three decades combined.
