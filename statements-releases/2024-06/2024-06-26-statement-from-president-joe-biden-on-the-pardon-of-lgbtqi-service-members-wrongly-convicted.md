title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Pardon of LGBTQI+ Service Members\
  \ Wrongly\_Convicted"
---
 
Today, I am righting an historic wrong by using my clemency authority to
pardon many former service members who were convicted simply for being
themselves. Our Nation’s service members stand on the frontlines of
freedom, and risk their lives in order to defend our country. Despite
their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ service members
were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or
gender identity. Some of these patriotic Americans were subject to
court-martial, and have carried the burden of this great injustice for
decades.   
   
As Commander in Chief, I am committed to maintaining the finest fighting
force in the world. That means making sure that every member of our
military is safe and respected – so they can focus on their mission.  
   
This is about dignity, decency, and ensuring the culture of our Armed
Forces reflect the values that make us an exceptional nation. We have a
sacred obligation to all of our service members – including our brave
LGBTQI+ service members: to properly prepare and equip them when they
are sent into harm’s way, and to care for them and their families when
they return home. Today we are making progress in that pursuit.
