  \ Security\_Advisors"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with his counterparts
from NATO Allies Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.  They expressed
unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of continued Russian
aggression.  They also discussed preparations for the July 9-11 NATO
Summit in Washington, including concrete steps Allies are working toward
to bring Ukraine closer to NATO and to ensure that Ukraine has a bridge
to eventual membership. The Allies underscored the importance of
strengthening the transatlantic defense industrial base and discussed
approaches to unlocking the value of Russian sovereign assets to benefit
Ukraine.  Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and to the security of NATO’s eastern
flank Allies.
