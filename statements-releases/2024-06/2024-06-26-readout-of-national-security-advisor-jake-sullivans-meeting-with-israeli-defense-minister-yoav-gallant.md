National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Israeli Defense
Minister Yoav Gallant today at the White House. They discussed the
ongoing efforts to finalize a ceasefire deal together with the release
of hostages. Minister Gallant once again confirmed the support of the
Israeli government for the deal as outlined by President Biden and
endorsed by the UN Security Council, the G7, and countries around the
world. 

Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to
Israel’s security, including in the face of threats from Iranian-backed
terrorist groups such as Lebanese Hezbollah. They discussed ongoing U.S.
efforts to support de-escalation and a diplomatic resolution to the
ongoing hostilities in Lebanon that would ensure the return of both
Israeli and Lebanese families to their homes in the border regions. The
two also discussed President Biden’s unprecedented support for Israel
since the Hamas attacks of October 7th. Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed
President Biden’s commitment to ensure that Israel has all it needs to
defend itself militarily and confront its Iranian-backed adversaries.

Mr. Sullivan and Minister Gallant discussed the humanitarian crisis in
Gaza, and the need to increase and sustain the flow of humanitarian
assistance into Gaza. Mr. Sullivan recognized Minister Gallant’s
personal efforts and leadership to support these efforts. Mr. Sullivan
also raised the importance of de-escalating tensions in the West Bank,
to include the transfer of clearance revenues to the Palestinian
Authority without further delay.
