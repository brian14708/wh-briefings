No one who has been abused should have to worry about their abuser
getting a gun. As a result of today’s ruling, survivors of domestic
violence and their families will still be able to count on critical
protections, just as they have for the past three decades.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked to prevent domestic abusers from
purchasing guns and to protect all Americans from the threat of gun
violence. Thirty years ago, I wrote the Violence Against Women Act, and
as President, I have strengthened the law and secured its highest-ever
funding. I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that narrowed the
so-called “boyfriend loophole” so that dating partners convicted of
domestic violence cannot buy a firearm. And I have taken dozens of
executive actions to strengthen gun safety and end gender-based
violence.

Vice President Harris and I remain firmly committed to ending violence
against women and keeping Americans safe from gun violence. We will
continue to call on Congress to further strengthen support and
protections for survivors and to take action to stop the epidemic of gun
violence tearing our communities apart.
