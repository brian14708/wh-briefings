title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Howard\_Fineman"
---
 
Great journalists hold a mirror up to the Nation to reveal the good, the
bad, and the truth of who we are as Americans. For four decades, Howard
Fineman was one of the great journalists of our time.  
   
His career covered much of mine, and throughout the debates over big
issues and historic campaigns, I respected his reporting and insights
whether I agreed or disagreed with him.  
   
Where I believe all politics is personal, Howard believed all journalism
is personal. No matter the issue or who he was interviewing, he always
thought about the people he grew up with in his cherished Pittsburgh, or
where he first started as a reporter in Louisville.  
   
He understood the fundamental role of journalism in our democracy is to
illuminate, educate, and shed light. With his focus on the facts and
ability to tell a great story, it’s no surprise why Howard was a trusted
and respected voice for millions of Americans, and true friend and
mentor to countless colleagues.  
   
Above all, in the decades we knew each other, it was clear that his love
of family was the greatest story he ever told. Jill and I send our love
to Amy and their children Nick and Meredith. We know what it’s like when
cancer takes away the life of a beloved family member. But no matter
where you are, he will always be with you.
