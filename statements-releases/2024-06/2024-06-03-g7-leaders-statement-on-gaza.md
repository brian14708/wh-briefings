title: "G7 Leaders\u2019 Statement on\_Gaza"
---
 
We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), fully endorse and will stand
behind the comprehensive deal outlined by President Biden that would
lead to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, a
significant and sustained increase in humanitarian assistance for
distribution throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with
Israelâ€™s security interests and Gazan civilian safety assured. We
reaffirm our support for a credible pathway towards peace leading to a
two State solution.

We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move
forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help
ensure that it does so.
