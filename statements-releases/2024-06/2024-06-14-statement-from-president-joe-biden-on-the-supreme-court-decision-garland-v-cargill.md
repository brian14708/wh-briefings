  \ v.\_Cargill"

In October 2017, a gunman opened fire at a concert in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Because he used a weapon that was modified with a bump stock, he fired
more than 1000 bullets in just ten minutes, killing 60, wounding
hundreds, and traumatizing countless Americans. Today’s decision strikes
down an important gun safety regulation. Americans should not have to
live in fear of this mass devastation.

While extreme Congressional Republicans want to defund the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), I have used every tool
in my Administration to stamp out gun violence. I nominated the first
Senate-confirmed Director of the ATF since 2015. My Administration
ensured that the ATF has the funding it needs to address emerging
firearm technologies like machinegun conversion devices and ghost guns
that pose a unique and acute threat to public safety.

Notwithstanding this decision, my Administration will continue to take
action. I took on the NRA and signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities
Act – the most significant gun violence reduction legislation to pass
Congress in nearly 30 years. My Administration established the
first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, made historic
investments in mental health to support people in times of crisis, and
expanded background checks to keep firearms out of the wrong hands.

We know thoughts and prayers are not enough. I call on Congress to ban
bump stocks, pass an assault weapon ban, and take additional action to
save lives – send me a bill and I will sign it immediately.
