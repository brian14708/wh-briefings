title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Supreme Court Decision on FDA v. Alliance\
  \ for Hippocratic\_Medicine"

Today’s decision does not change the fact that the fight for
reproductive freedom continues. It does not change the fact that the
Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade* two years ago, and women lost a
fundamental freedom. It does not change the fact that the right for a
woman to get the treatment she needs is imperiled if not impossible in
many states.

It does mean that mifepristone, or medication abortion, remains
available and approved. Women can continue to access this medication –
approved by the FDA as safe and effective more than 20 years ago. 

But let’s be clear: attacks on medication abortion are part of
Republican elected officials’ extreme and dangerous agenda to ban
abortion nationwide. Since the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, Republican
elected officials have imposed extreme abortion bans in 21 states, some
of which include zero exceptions for rape or incest. Women are being
turned away from emergency rooms, or forced to go to court to plead for
care that their doctor recommended or to travel hundreds of miles for
care. Doctors and nurses are being threatened with jail time, including
life in prison, for providing the health care they have been trained to
provide. And contraception and IVF are under attack.

The stakes could not be higher for women across America. Vice President
Harris and I stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a
woman’s right to make deeply personal health care decisions. We will
continue to fight to ensure that women in every state get the health
care they need and we will continue to call on Congress to restore the
protections of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law — that is our commitment.
