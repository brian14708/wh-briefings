title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Bolsters Protections for Americans\u2019\
  \ Access to Healthcare Through Strengthening Cybersecurity"
---
 
Recent cyberattacks targeting the nation’s healthcare system have
demonstrated the vulnerability of our hospitals and payment systems.
 Providers across the health system had to scramble for funding after
one attack on a key payment system. And some hospitals had to redirect
care after another.  These disruptions can take too long to resolve
before full access to needed health care services or payment systems is
restored.  Cyberattacks against the American healthcare system rose
[128% from 2022 to
2023](https://www.dni.gov/files/CTIIC/documents/products/Ransomware_Attacks_Surge_in_2023.pdf).   
  
In February and March of 2024 alone, the United States experienced one
of the most significant healthcare-related cyberattacks to date.
During the attack, providers reported that one out of every three health
care claims in the United States were impacted, leading to disruptions
in timely payment to healthcare providers.  
  
**Recognizing that effective cybersecurity is critical to Americans
accessing the care they need, the Biden-Harris Administration is working
relentlessly to improve the resilience of the healthcare sector to
cyberattacks. Many healthcare companies are private sector owned and
operated, so private sector uptake and partnership is key to meaningful
improvements in the sector’s ability to withstand attacks. **

-   In January of 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services
    launched a [healthcare cybersecurity gateway
    website](https://hphcyber.hhs.gov/) to simplify access to the
    Department’s healthcare-specific cybersecurity information and
    resources and published voluntary Healthcare and Public Health
    Cybersecurity Performance Goals designed to help healthcare
    institutions plan and prioritize high-impact cybersecurity
    practices.  
-   In May of 2024, the White House convened Chief Information Security
    Officers and other high-level executives from across the healthcare
    sector – spanning care delivery organizations, medical technology
    companies, and industry associations – to advance cybersecurity
    solutions across the industry. Participants shared their
    organization’s views on cybersecurity challenges and the need to
    work together with government to better share threat intelligence
    and adopt secure-by-design solutions for the technologies
    underpinning the healthcare system.     
-   In May of 2024, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health
    (ARPA-H) announced the launch of the Universal Patching and
    Remediation for Autonomous Defense (UPGRADE) program, a
    cybersecurity effort that will invest more than $50 million to
    create tools for information technology (IT) teams to better defend
    the hospital environments they are tasked with securing.

Healthcare-related cyber disruptions can be particularly disruptive to
rural hospitals, which serve over 60 million Americans. Most rural
hospitals are critical access hospitals, meaning they are located more
than 35 miles from another hospital, which makes diversions of patients
and staffing-intensive manual workarounds in response to attacks more
difficult. Recognizing the critical role these hospitals play in the
communities they serve, the White House worked with and received
commitments from leading U.S. technology providers to provide free and
low-cost resources for all 1,800-2,100 rural hospitals across the
nation.

As part of this initiative to improve security and resilience of our
rural hospital system, our private sector partners have committed to the
following:

-   For independent Critical Access Hospitals and Rural Emergency
    Hospitals, Microsoft is extending its nonprofit program to provide
    grants and up to a 75% discount on security products optimized for
    smaller organizations. For participating larger rural hospitals
    already using eligible Microsoft solutions, Microsoft is providing
    its most advanced security suite at no additional cost for one year.
    Microsoft will also provide free cybersecurity assessments by
    qualified technology security providers and free training for
    frontline and IT staff at eligible rural hospitals throughout the
    country to deepen our resiliency to malicious cyberattacks. 
    Additionally, Microsoft will extend security updates for Window 10
    to participating hospitals for one year at no cost.  
-   Google will provide endpoint security advice to rural hospitals and
    non-profit organizations at no cost and a pool of funding to support
    software migration. In addition, Google is committing to launch a
    pilot program with rural hospitals to develop a packaging of
    security capabilities that fit these hospitals’ unique needs.
