title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Moyle v. United\_States"
---
 
Today’s Supreme Court order ensures that women in Idaho can access the
emergency medical care they need while this case returns to the lower
courts. No woman should be denied care, made to wait until she’s near
death, or forced to flee her home state just to receive the health care
she needs. This should never happen in America. Yet, this is exactly
what is happening in states across the country since the Supreme Court
overturned *Roe v. Wade*.  
   
State abortion bans are also forcing doctors to leave Idaho and other
states. In January, I heard heartbreaking testimony from Dr. Kylie
Cooper, a physician who cared for patients with high-risk pregnancies in
Idaho. After practicing medicine under Idaho’s extreme abortion
ban—which went into effect after *Roe v. Wade* was overturned—Dr. Cooper
made the difficult decision to uproot her family, leave the community
she loved, and move to a different state. Because of the state ban, and
for the first time in her career, she was unable to offer the care her
patients with certain pregnancy complications desperately needed.  
   
Doctors should be able to practice medicine. Patients should be able to
get the care they need. Instead, Dr. Cooper’s story is the reality for
doctors and the women they care for since *Roe v. Wade* was overturned.
And make no mistake: this is all part of Republican elected officials’
extreme and dangerous agenda to ban abortion nationwide, and put women’s
health and lives at risk.  
   
The stakes could not be higher and the contrast could not be clearer. My
Administration is committed to defending reproductive freedom and
maintains our long-standing position that women have the right to access
the emergency medical care they need.  Vice President Harris and I will
continue to fight for a woman’s right to make deeply personal health
care decisions. And we will continue to fight to restore the protections
of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law, for all women in every state across the
country.
