President Joe Biden called President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of
Mexico to congratulate him and the Mexican people on their free and fair
electoral process that resulted in the historic election of
President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum.  He thanked President López Obrador
for the strong and constructive partnership they have built to enhance
our bilateral economic cooperation, manage migration at our shared
border, and advance regional security and prosperity.  President Biden
informed President López Obrador that he has approved three new
Presidential permits for international bridge projects in Texas that
will benefit local communities and strengthen the U.S.-Mexico economic
relationship by building infrastructure that promotes increased trade
travel.  The two leaders pledged to maintain their strong cooperation
through the completion of President López Obrador’s term in office and
to ensure a stable, productive bilateral relationship during the
transition to the administration of President-elect Sheinbaum.
