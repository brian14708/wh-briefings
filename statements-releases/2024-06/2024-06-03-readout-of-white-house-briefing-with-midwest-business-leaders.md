title: "Readout of White\_House Briefing with Midwest Business\_Leaders"

On Friday, May 31, the White House welcomed small business owners and
local business leaders from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and
Wisconsin for a dialogue with senior officials on the Biden-Harris
Administration’s priorities to grow the U.S. economy, especially in
communities that have too often been left behind, by supporting
entrepreneurs and small business owners. More than 60 individuals
representing small businesses, local chambers of commerce, and economic
development organizations met with senior officials from the White
House, Council of Economic Advisers, and Small Business Administration
to discuss how the Administration is investing in local businesses and
communities in the region to grow the economy from the middle out and
the bottom up. Under President Biden and Vice President Harris, more
than 1.5 million jobs have been created and more than $65 billion has
been [invested](https://invest.gov/) by the private sector in [the
states
represented](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/resources/state-fact-sheets/)
in Friday’s meeting. Additionally, the Administration has powered a
small business boom, with the first, second and third strongest years of
new business applications on record—including over 1.8 million
applications for new businesses in these five states alone, which have
all seen record business applications under this Administration.

Friday’s meeting was the second in a series of White House Regional
Business Briefings, following an initial gathering of Mid-Atlantic
business leaders in March. Additional meetings are planned for later
this summer.

Administration participants included:

-   Isabel Casillas Guzman, Administrator, U.S. Small Business
    Administration
-   Gene Sperling, White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator and
    Senior Advisor to the President
-   Heather Boushey, Member, Council of Economic Advisers
-   Kate Balcerzak, Special Assistant to the President and Director of
    Partnerships and Private Sector Engagement, White House Office of
    Public Engagement
-   Jackson Spivey, Senior Advisor, White House Office of Public
    Engagement
