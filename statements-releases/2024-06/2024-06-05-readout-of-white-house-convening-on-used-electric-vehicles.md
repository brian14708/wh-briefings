title: "Readout of White\_House Convening on Used Electric\_Vehicles"
---
 
Today, June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2024, the White House and the Treasury
Department hosted private sector leaders in the pre-owned vehicle sales
industry alongside clean car advocates and State and federal officials
to recognize the momentum generated by the Inflation Reduction Act’s 25E
used clean vehicle tax credit and encourage usage and adoption of the
dealer transferability option that allows consumers to claim the tax
credit at the point of sale. In attendance were John Podesta, Senior
Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy, and other
senior administration officials from the White House and the Treasury
Department. Already, **more than 13,000 dealerships have signed up** to
provide the tax credit at the point of sale, and **90% of EV buyers that
qualify for the credit are opting to receive their cash immediately**
instead of waiting until tax season, **saving buyers over $850
million** **this year alone.** IRS is processing these advance payments
quickly, with dealers generally receiving their payment within a week.

The Inflation Reduction Act’s 25E used clean vehicle tax credit provides
up to $4,000 off qualified electric vehicles for taxpayers that fall
below certain income limits—individual taxpayers making less than
$75,000 or up to $150,000 for married taxpayers that are filing jointly.

Most Americans buy used cars instead of new, so this tax credit makes
going electric more affordable and accessible. In addition, starting on
January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2024, taxpayers have been able to take advantage
of both the used and new clean vehicle tax credits when they purchase
their vehicle at participating dealerships.

As part of today’s convening, **companies large and small made**
[**major, new voluntary
commitments**](https://www.kbb.com/car-news/exclusive-white-house-making-used-ev-tax-credits-easier/)

their websites and other point of sale platforms, developing targeted

the credit:**
