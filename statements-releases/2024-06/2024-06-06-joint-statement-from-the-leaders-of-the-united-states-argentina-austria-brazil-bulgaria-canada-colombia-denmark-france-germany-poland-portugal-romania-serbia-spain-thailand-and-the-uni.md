As leaders of countries deeply concerned for the hostages held by Hamas
in Gaza, including many of our own citizens, we fully support the
movement towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal now on the table
and as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024.  There is no time to
lose.  We call on Hamas to close this agreement, that Israel is ready to
move forward with, and begin the process of releasing our citizens. 

We note that this agreement would lead to an immediate ceasefire and
rehabilitation of Gaza together with security assurances for Israelis,
and Palestinians, and opportunities for a more enduring long-term peace
and a two-state solution.  At this decisive moment, we call on the
leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises
are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our
hostages, as well as those on both sides of this terrible conflict,
including the civilian populations.  It is time for the war to end and
this deal is the necessary starting point.
