title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Agreement between the UAW and Ultium\_\
  Cells"
---
 
I congratulate the United Auto Workers and Ultium Cells for reaching a
historic agreement in Lordstown, Ohio, where UAW workers are
manufacturing batteries for General Motors electric cars and trucks.
This agreement significantly increases wages and ensures critical health
and safety and scheduling protections for 1,600 workers. 

Five years ago, the previous administration made false promises to
Lordstown workers – and then stood by as the community lost jobs and
faced economic devastation. Today, Lordstown is a comeback story and it
didn’t happen by accident. With the help of my Investing in America
agenda, the UAW and companies like General Motors are building the
future of autos in America while we bring back good paying union jobs to
communities like Lordstown. This agreement ensures that these union jobs
will continue to be middle class jobs that allow workers to support
their families.
