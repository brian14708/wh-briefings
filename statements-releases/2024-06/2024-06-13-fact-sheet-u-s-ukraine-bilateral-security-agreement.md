title: "FACT SHEET: U.S.-Ukraine Bilateral Security\_Agreement"
---
 
On June 13<sup>th</sup>, 2024, President Biden and Ukrainian President
Zelenskyy signed a historic U.S.-Ukraine Bilateral Security Agreement
reflecting the close partnership between our two democracies. Today, the
United States is sending a powerful signal of our strong support for
Ukraine now and into the future. Through this agreement, the United
States will work with our partners to strengthen Ukraine’s ability to
defend itself now and to deter future aggression. By doing so, we will
bolster Ukraine’s security, which is central to European security and to
American security.   
  
More than two years after Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault on
Ukraine, today, President Biden is stating unequivocally that United
States and its partners will stand with Ukraine as it fights for its
freedom and for the principles enshrined in the UN Charter.  
  
With the signing of this 10-year agreement, the United States and
Ukraine will work together to:

-   **Build and maintain Ukraine’s credible defense and deterrence
    capability.** The agreement lays out a vision for a Ukrainian future
    force that is strong, sustainable, and resilient. The United States
    and Ukraine will deepen security and defense cooperation and
    collaborating closely with Ukraine’s broad network of security
    partners. We will support the full range of Ukraine’s current
    defensive needs now and over the long term by helping Ukraine win
    the war and strengthening its deterrence capabilities against future
    threats. Together, we will expand intelligence sharing, enhance
    interoperability between our militaries in line with NATO standards,
    and work with our allies and partners to position Ukraine as a
    long-term contributor to European security.  
-   **Strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to sustain its fight over the long
    term**, including by [building on
    efforts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/06/fact-sheet-the-white-house-announces-new-actions-to-strengthen-cooperation-and-co-production-between-u-s-and-ukraines-defense-industrial-bases/)
    to bolster in Ukraine’s defense industrial base, and supporting its
    economic recovery and energy security.  
-   **Accelerate Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration,** including
    through Ukraine’s implementation of reforms to its democratic,
    economic, and security institutions in line with its EU accession
    goals and NATO’s program of reforms.  
-   **Achieve a just peace** that respects Ukraine’s rights under
    international law, is underwritten by broad global support, upholds
    the key principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty and
    territorial integrity, and includes accountability for Russia’s
    actions.  
-   **Consult in the event of a future Russian armed attack against
    Ukraine **at the highest levels to determine appropriate and
    necessary measures to support Ukraine and impose costs on Russia.

This agreement, together with the mutually reinforcing security
agreements and arrangements Ukraine has signed with a broad network of
partners under the G7 Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine, is a key
part of Ukraine’s bridge to NATO membership. As [President Biden said in
Vilnius](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2023/07/12/remarks-by-president-biden-prime-minister-kishida-of-japan-and-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-in-a-g7-joint-declaration-of-support-for-ukraine-vilnius-lithuania/)
last year and as NATO allies have agreed, Ukraine’s future is in NATO.
We are not waiting for the NATO process to be completed to make
long-term commitments to Ukraine’s security to address the immediate
threats they face and deter any aggression that may occur.  
  
The United States will continue to work a broad coalition of Allies and
Partners to continue to impose costs on the Russian Federation so long
as its aggression against Ukraine continues.  
  
In 2024, the United States Congress appropriated $61 billion to respond
to the war in Ukraine in a bipartisan show of support for Ukraine. To
realize the goals laid out in this agreement and accompanying annex, the
Biden Administration will work closely with the U.S. Congress to  build
on the national security supplemental and develop sustainable levels of
assistance to Ukraine over the long term. We will continue to with our
allies and partners, including the 15 other countries that have already
completed their own bilateral security agreements and the 16 additional
countries that are negotiating agreements with Ukraine, to maintain a
balanced division of responsibility and burden-sharing to meet the
necessary capabilities for Ukraine’s future force.  
  
We are sending the clearest possible message today: the United States
stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and
democracy. Ukraine can count on the enduring strength of the
U.S.-Ukrainian partnership.
