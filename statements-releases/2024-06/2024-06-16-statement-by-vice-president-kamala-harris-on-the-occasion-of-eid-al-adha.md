Doug and I wish a blessed Eid al-Adha to all Muslims in America and
across the world who are celebrating this holiday of prayer, reflection,
and community. We hope that your sacred journey ends with a festive
moment alongside family and friends.    
   
Our nation is fortunate to be home to millions of Muslims who are our
neighbors, classmates, coworkers, and loved ones. They contribute to our
shared success each day – from teaching in our classrooms and serving in
our military, to leading our small businesses and making a difference in
our government. President Joe Biden and I are proud that more Muslim
Americans serve in our Administration than in all previous
Administrations combined.  
   
Last year, Doug and I were honored to welcome some of these leaders from
across our country into our home for Eid al-Adha when we hosted the
first-ever gathering of Muslim community leaders at the Vice President’s
Residence. Together, we celebrated the countless contributions of Muslim
Americans to the U.S. and pledged to continue working alongside one
another to increase opportunity and combat hate.  
   
We know that for far too long, Muslims in America have endured a
disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks. We have witnessed an
uptick in anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, antisemitic, and Islamophobic
incidents across America over the last eight months. Too many of our
fellow Americans have also had to live with the fear that they will be
targeted, profiled, or attacked simply because of how they worship, how
they look, or who they are. President Biden and I announced the
development of the country’s first National Strategy to Counter
Islamophobia, and our Administration will continue to work to protect
communities against hate, violence, and discrimination.  
   
I know that Eid al-Adha comes at a difficult time for many Muslims this
year. The war in Gaza and the immense suffering it has caused weighs
heavily on our hearts. Our Administration is working every day to bring
this war to an end, free all hostages, deliver humanitarian relief,
relieve the suffering of the Palestinian people, and build a future of
security, freedom, and dignity for Palestinians and Israelis.   
   
Today, in the spirit of Eid al-Adha, let us renew our commitment to
compassion, empathy, and respect. Eid Mubarak.
