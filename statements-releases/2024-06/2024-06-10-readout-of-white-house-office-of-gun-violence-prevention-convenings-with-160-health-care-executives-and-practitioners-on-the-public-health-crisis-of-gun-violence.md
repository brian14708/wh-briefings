  \ 160 Health-Care Executives and Practitioners on the Public Health Crisis of Gun\_\
  Violence"

Last week, to kick off Gun Violence Awareness Month and further address
the gun violence public health crisis, the White House Office of Gun
Violence Prevention (OGVP), which is overseen by Vice President Kamala
Harris, convened healthcare executives, leaders, practitioners and
service providers to discuss the ways in which the health care sector is
taking action to prevent gun violence. The convenings focused on the
importance of hospital-based violence programs (HVIPS), firearm-risk
screening and secure gun storage counseling, data and research, and
regional collaboration.  Senior Administration Officials discussed steps
that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking in each of those spaces
to accelerate the recent progress we’ve seen in preventing gun
violence.  

***Summit of Health System and Hospital Executives on the Public Health
Crisis of Gun Violence***

On June 6, OGVP hosted nearly 80 executives and leaders representing
health systems and hospitals from across the country to discuss the
importance of utilizing a public health approach to preventing gun
violence. This is the first time that the White House has ever convened
health systems and hospitals to discuss public health solutions to gun
violence. During the convening, representatives from major health
systems such as Intermountain Health and Northwell Health alongside the
Children’s Hospital Association and hospitals like Boston Children’s
Hospital, and universities like the Duke University Health System, among
many others, gathered at the White House to discuss their role in taking
action to address the public health crisis of gun violence. The
participants discussed how heath systems and hospitals are working to
implement and expand hospital-based violence intervention programs,
engage in system-wide safe gun storage counseling to prevent suicide,
and the collection of gun violence data.

***White Coats at the White House***

On June 7, which is also Wear Orange Day in honor of the victims and
survivors of gun violence, OGVP convened 80 medical professionals, from
doctors to nurses to emergency responders, to discuss the trauma and
long-term impacts they witness firsthand due to the gun violence public
health epidemic affecting their communities.

In addition to medical practitioners, the event included gun violence
survivors and organizations committed to addressing the public health
epidemic of gun violence, including:

-   Doctors for America
-   This is Our Lane
-   Brady United
-   Scrubs Addressing the Firearms Epidemic
-   The American College of Emergency Physicians
-   The Health Alliance for Violence Prevention
-   The American College of Physicians
-   The American Geriatrics Society
-   The American College of Preventive Medicine. 

As a part of the convening, Doctors for America discussed the ways in
which doctors can use their positions as trusted messengers to educate
patients and members of the public on evidence-based gun safety
practices, encourage safe and open dialogue with patients and community
members on guns, and collaborate with other medical professionals to
prevent firearm-related injuries.

The President has taken a whole-of-government approach to prevent crime,
promote public safety, and end the epidemic of gun violence tearing
apart communities nationwide. In January, the Office of Gun Violence
Prevention, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Education and the
Department of Justice, also announced [new executive actions to help
promote safe storage of
firearms](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/25/white-house-announces-new-actions-to-promote-safe-storage-of-firearms/) that
implement President Biden’s Executive Order on promoting safe gun
storage, which has been shown to dramatically reduce children’s risk of
self-inflicted harm and unintentional shootings.

The President’s American Rescue Plan also helped states and over one
thousand cities, towns, and counties across the country to invest over
$15 billion in public safety and violence prevention.  Communities have
invested those funds to support additional police officers, expand
community violence intervention, add crisis responders, and more. The
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) that President Biden signed in
2022 provided an additional $15 billion for mental health, school safety
and violence intervention programs.
