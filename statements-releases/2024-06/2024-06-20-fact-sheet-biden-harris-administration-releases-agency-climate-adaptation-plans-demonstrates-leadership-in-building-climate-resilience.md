title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Releases Agency Climate Adaptation\
  \ Plans, Demonstrates Leadership in Building Climate\_Resilience"
---
 
Across the country, communities are experiencing the devastating impacts
of climate change. From record-high average temperatures and extreme
heat to changing precipitation patterns and sea-level rise, climate
impacts – including disasters made worse by climate change – are
affecting every corner of society and every community in America. The
magnitude of challenges posed by the climate crisis was underscored last
year when the nation endured a record 28 individual billion-dollar
extreme weather and climate disasters that caused more than $90 billion
in aggregate damage. Just this week, more than 82 million Americans have
been under heat alerts due to extreme temperatures made worse by climate
change. That is why President Biden is leading the most ambitious
climate, conservation, and environmental justice agenda in history,
which includes directing federal agencies to lead by example.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration released updated [Climate
Adaptation Plans developed by more than 20 federal
agencies](http://www.sustainability.gov/adaptation) that expand agency
efforts to ensure their facilities, employees, resources, and operations
are increasingly resilient to climate change impacts like extreme
weather. This work advances the Biden-Harris Administration’s [National
Climate Resilience
Framework](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/National-Climate-Resilience-Framework-FINAL.pdf),
which helps to align climate resilience investments across the public
and private sector through common principles and opportunities for
action to build a climate-resilient nation. These efforts are backed by
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, through which more than
$50 billion is being delivered to advance climate adaptation and
resilience across the nation, including in communities that are the most
vulnerable to climate impacts.

At the beginning of his Administration, President Biden tasked agencies
with leading a whole-of-government effort to address climate change
through Executive Order 14008, [*Tackling the Climate
Cris*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/)[*i*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/)[*s
at Home and
Abroad*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/).
Federal agencies [released initial Climate Adaptation Plans in
2021](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/07/fact-sheet-biden-administration-releases-agency-climate-adaptation-and-resilience-plans-from-across-federal-government/)
and progress reports outlining advancements toward achieving their
adaptation goals [in
2022](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-strengthens-the-federal-governments-resilience-to-climate-change-impacts/).
With more than 300,000 buildings, four million employees, 640 million
acres of public land, and $700 billion in annual purchases of goods and
services, the federal government must continue to be a leader and
partner in advancing adaptation and resilience.

In coordination with the White House Council on Environmental Quality
(CEQ) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agencies updated
their Climate Adaptation Plans for 2024 to 2027 to better integrate
climate risk across their mission, operations, and asset management,
including:

-   Combining historical **data** and projections to assess exposure of
    assets to climate-related hazards including extreme heat and
    precipitation, sea level rise, flooding, and wildfire;
-   Expanding the **operational** focus on managing climate risk to
    facilities and supply chains to include federal employees and
    federal lands and waters;
-   Broadening the **mission** focus to describe mainstreaming
    adaptation into agency policies, programs, planning, budget
    formulation, and external funding;
-   Linking climate adaptation actions with **other Biden-Harris
    Administration priorities**, including advancing environmental
    justice and the President’s [Justice40
    Initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
    strengthening engagement with Tribal Nations, supporting the
    [*America the
    Beautiful*](https://www.conservation.gov/pages/america-the-beautiful-initiative)
    [initiative](https://www.conservation.gov/pages/america-the-beautiful-initiative),
    scaling up [nature-based
    solutions](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Nature-Based-Solutions-Roadmap.pdf),
    mobilizing the next generation of climate resilience workers through
    the [American Climate
    Corps](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-american-climate-corps-to-train-young-people-in-clean-energy-conservation-and-climate-resilience-skills-create-good-paying-jobs-and-tackle-the-clima/),
    and addressing the causes of climate change through climate
    mitigation; and
-   Adopting [common progress
    **indicators**](https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/indicatorsmetrics-2024-cap.pdf)
    across agencies to assess the progress of agency climate adaptation
    efforts.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is making available more than 20
updated Climate Adaptation Plans from major federal agencies. Highlights
of key actions to address the effects of climate change on agency
operations and mission-delivery include:

-   **Building facility climate resilience.** Agencies are retrofitting
    and upgrading federal buildings to better withstand climate hazards
    and provide emergency backup systems for power, water, and
    communications. For example, the **Department of Defense’s** Tyndall
    Air Force Base is working with local, state, and national partners
    to build an “Installation of the Future,” which includes using
    updated building codes that capture future conditions, and
    constructing living shorelines adjacent to the base to preserve
    water quality, enhance overall ecosystem health, and strengthen
    flood resilience. The **General Services Administration** (GSA) is
    integrating localized flood risk information into its asset
    management systems, asset planning processes, and site acquisition
    guidance for GSA-controlled, federally owned buildings.
-   **Fostering a climate-ready workforce.** Agencies are establishing
    protocols to ensure continuity of operations and safeguard federal
    employee wellbeing in the face of increasing exposure to
    climate-related hazards. The Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration within the **Department of Labor** is providing
    resources to help federal agencies address employee exposure to
    climate hazards such as extreme heat, flooding, and wildfires, with
    guidance on how to manage impacts and exposure to these hazards. To
    ensure employee safety, the **Department of Energy** is enhancing
    communication systems to alert employees to climate hazards in the
    workplace and, where needed, improving air filtration standards to
    manage health impacts of wildfire smoke.
-   **Developing climate-resilient supply chains.** Agencies are
    assessing mission-critical supply chains, diversifying their
    suppliers, and encouraging climate-smart sourcing to enhance
    resilience to climate-related disruptions. The **National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)** is developing a
    toolset to analyze risks and address impacts from climate change and
    real-time disaster disruption on NASA’s supply chains. The **U.S.
    Army Corps of Engineers** is evaluating suppliers’ locations,
    infrastructure, and vulnerability to climate-related risks,
    including identifying critical supply chain nodes vulnerable to
    climate change impacts, such as ports, warehouses, and
    transportation routes.
-   **Managing lands and waters for** **climate adaptation and
    resilience.** Federal land and water management agencies are
    protecting, connecting, and conserving federal lands and waters to
    provide strongholds for species and enhance community wellbeing in a
    changing climate. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA) within the **Department of Commerce**
    continues to advance its Mission Iconic Reefs Initiative, a
    first-of-its-kind effort to restore coral reef sites and promote
    coastal resilience to climate impacts in the Florida Keys National
    Marine Sanctuary. The **Department of the Interior** is advancing
    “Keystone Initiatives” that include restoring Atlantic salt marshes
    to buffer coastal communities to flooding, supporting watershed
    restoration projects in the Klamath Basin to improve drought
    resilience, conducting fuels management activities in sagebrush
    ecosystems to manage wildfire risk.
-   **Applying climate data and tools to decision-making.** Agencies are
    using data and tools to better understand climate risks and inform
    decisions and investments. CEQ worked with NOAA to develop a beta
    screening tool that enabled agencies to [overlay their buildings and
    employee data with climate hazard
    data](https://resilience.climate.gov/pages/policy#adaptation-plans)
    to understand where agencies may be most exposed to climate-related
    hazards. Agencies are developing their own internal tools to
    understand site-specific climate risks to their assets and use that
    risk information to inform their investments. The **Department of
    Transportation**’s Climate Hazard Exposure and Resilience Tool
    integrates high-quality, publicly available natural hazard and
    climate projection data layers with vulnerability assessments from
    site managers to present a climate risk score for each facility or
    asset. The **Department of Justice**’s Facility Climate Hazard
    Assessment Tool supports components in assessing the extent to which
    their real property assets are exposed to current and future climate
    hazards, including coastal flooding, extreme heat, drought,
    wildfire, riverine flooding, hurricanes, and tornadoes.
-   **Developing climate-informed policies and programs.** Agencies are
    incorporating consideration of climate impacts and adaptation
    actions in federal policies and guidance, where relevant. For
    example, the **U.S. Department of Agriculture**’s Forest Service is
    updating or proposing climate-informed revisions to guidance and
    policies related to silviculture practices, beneficial uses of
    forest restoration byproducts, recreation, and designated areas
    planning, habitat and water resource management, and forest-level
    land management planning. The **Department of Veterans Affairs** is
    integrating health, demographic, and climate change information to
    anticipate the effects of climate change on Veterans’ health and
    plan for adjustments to their program delivery in the future. The
    **Environmental Protection Agency** is integrating consideration of
    climate risks into multiple actions as appropriate and where
    consistent with its statutory authorities: for example, in the
    development of rules, policy and guidance; permitting and
    environmental reviews; in monitoring, enforcement, and compliance
    activities; and in grant making.
-   **Integrating climate resilience into external funding
    opportunities.** Agencies are encouraging the consideration of
    climate impacts on federally-supported projects and advancing
    climate resilience through federal project delivery and
    grant-making, including incorporating [climate-smart
    infrastructure](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M-24-03-Advancing-Climate-Resilience-through-Climate-Smart-Infrastructure-Investments.pdf)
    practices across the Administration’s historic infrastructure
    investments. **Department of State** Bureaus have reviewed grant and
    foreign assistance announcements and requirements to ensure relevant
    grants and foreign assistance include climate risk and adaptation
    considerations. The **Department of Housing and Urban Development**
    is including climate change preference points in Notices of Funding
    Opportunities to encourage applications that invest in climate
    resilience, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. The
    **Department of Homeland Security**’s Federal Emergency Management
    Agency continues to incentivize and support climate adaptation at
    state and local levels via financial assistance programs such as the
    Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, the Flood Mitigation Assistance
    program, and the Building Resilient Infrastructure in Communities
    program.
