  \ for Ukrainian Children\u2019s Education Following Russian\_Attacks"

Russia is waging a war not just against the Ukrainian military, but also
against the Ukrainian people.  On May 23, 2024, a Russian strike
destroyed the Faktur-Druk printing house in Kharkiv, one of the largest
printing houses in Europe. This is part of Russia’s ongoing destruction
of printing houses in Kharkiv and elsewhere in Ukraine. Kharkiv’s
printing houses produce a significant percentage of all books in
Ukraine, including textbooks for Ukrainian children. By striking these
printing houses, Russia is attacking Ukraine’s education system. We will
not let Russia succeed. 

Today, we are announcing that the United States government, through
USAID, is providing assistance to print more than three million
textbooks for Ukrainian elementary school students ahead of this school
year. These textbooks will be produced in Ukraine and delivered to more
than 12,000 schools across the country. Our message is clear: We will
continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend against
Russia’s barbaric war of aggression.
