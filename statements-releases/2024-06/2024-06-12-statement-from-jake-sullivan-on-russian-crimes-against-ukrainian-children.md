title: "Statement from Jake Sullivan on Russian crimes against Ukrainian\_children"
---
 
Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, members of Russia’s
forces and other Russian officials have deported hundreds of thousands
of Ukrainian civilians to Russia, including children who have been
forcibly separated from their families. We are aware of new and credible
[reports](https://www.ft.com/content/2d0013d2-a407-449f-b1e2-3d14fe65188f)
that Russian authorities are listing abducted Ukrainian children on
Russian adoption websites. This is despicable and appalling. These
Ukrainian children belong with their families inside Ukraine. Russia is
waging a war not just against the Ukrainian military – but against the
Ukrainian people. As the President has said before, Russia is committing
war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. We will continue to
stand with the Ukrainian people as we help them defend against Russia’s
barbaric war of aggression.
