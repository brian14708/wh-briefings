  \ Conflict-Related Sexual\_Violence"
---
 
Preventing and responding to conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) is
a top priority for President Biden and Vice President Harris.  The
Biden-Harris Administration is advancing policies and programs to
prevent conflict-related sexual violence and all forms of gender-based
violence, to support survivors and ensure accountability and justice. 
This work is guided by the 2023 [U.S. Strategy and National Action Plan
on Women, Peace, and
Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/U.S.-Strategy-and-National-Action-Plan-on-Women-Peace-and-Security.pdf) and
the 2022 [U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence
Globally](https://www.state.gov/reports/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gender-based-violence-globally-2022/),
which recognize that conflict-related sexual violence is a heinous crime
used by perpetrators as a tactic of war, and that preventing it is
essential to stability, peace, and security.  
  
On June 17, the Vice President is hosting an event at the White House to
mark the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in
Conflict.  Together with survivors and experts on CRSV from around the
world, the Vice President will condemn CRSV unequivocally—wherever and
whenever it occurs—and called for the international community to join
the United States in advancing justice and accountability for this
crime.  
  
The Vice President spent her career as a prosecutor working to protect
women and girls from violence.  As Vice President, she has continued
this leadership globally, working to ensure that CRSV—and promoting the
status of women and girls—remains at the forefront of our national
security policymaking.  
  
As part of this event, the Vice President is launching the **Dignity in
Documentation Initiative**, which intends to provide support for
survivor- and civil society-led efforts to investigate and document CRSV
in line with the Murad Code, named for Nobel Laureate and survivor Nadia
Murad.  This holistic program, supported under a $10 million investment
from the U.S. Department of State, will support justice for survivors by
promoting accountability for crimes punishable under international
law.   
  
In addition, the Biden-Harris Administration announces the following
actions to implement the 2022 President Memorandum on Promoting
Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence—including efforts
focused on documenting violence and supporting survivors, advancing
justice and accountability, and preventing CRSV.  
  
**<u>Documenting Violence and Supporting Survivors</u>**

-   **Incorporating Gender-Based Violence Prevention into Humanitarian
    Response. **In 2022, USAID and the U.S. Department of State launched
    Safe from the Start: ReVisioned, an ambitious update of the flagship
    U.S. Government initiative focused on GBV prevention and response in
    humanitarian emergencies.  The expansion of this program supports a
    systemic shift in humanitarian response to focus on women and girls
    as experts, service providers, and leaders.  Since the start of this
    initiative in FY 2013, the United States has provided nearly $373
    million for dedicated GBV prevention and response programming at the
    global, regional, and country levels, including in support of Safe
    from the Start.  
     
-   **Supporting Survivors in Ukraine. **To support survivors of CRSV
    and other forms of GBV in Ukraine, the U.S. Department of State is
    supporting a $4 million project offering survivors and local GBV
    service providers critical services to help individuals and
    communities recover and thrive, including psycho-social support and
    survivor-centered care.  The Department of State also supports
    Ukraine’s effort to hold accountable those responsible for
    atrocities, including CRSV, through the U.S.-UK-EU Atrocity Crimes
    Advisory Group, which provides coordinated strategic advice,
    capacity building, and operational assistance to Ukraine’s Office of
    the Prosecutor General.  USAID is also supporting the World Health
    Organization, the International Organization for Migration, the
    United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund,
    and eleven NGO partners to respond to CRSV and other forms of GBV
    across Ukraine.

**<u>Advancing Justice and Accountability</u>**

-   **Imposing Sanctions.** In 2022, [President Biden signed a
    Memorandum on Promoting Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual
    Violence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/11/28/memorandum-on-promoting-accountability-for-conflict-related-sexual-violence/) and
    committed to fully exercising U.S. authorities—including sanctions,
    visa restrictions, and security assistance vetting—to promote
    accountability for perpetrators and enablers of CRSV.  Following the
    release of this new policy, the Biden-Harris Administration issued
    sanctions in June 2023, marking the first time the United States
    imposed sanctions based solely on CRSV.  In December 2023, the
    Administration announced additional sanctions against thirteen
    targets from four countries for their connection to acts of CRSV—the
    largest set of financial sanctions and visa restrictions the United
    States has issued against individuals connected to this human rights
    abuse.  Sanctions issued on the basis of CRSV since the release of
    the PM include:  
    -   *Central African Republic*. Designated two armed rebel group
        members—one for involvement or complicity in killing, maiming,
        torture, or rape or other sexual violence, and the other who
        supplied weapons to an armed rebel group that has recruited
        child soldiers and perpetrated sexual violence.  
         
    -   *Democratic Republic of the Congo*. Designated two leaders from
        the ISIS affiliate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for
        their leadership role in ISIS-DRC, which is responsible for
        killing, maiming, and committing sexual violence against women
        and girls.  Additionally, the administration sanctioned two
        individuals from the March 23 Movement and Mai-Mai Yakutumba,
        two armed groups implicated in sexual violence against
        civilians.  
         
    -   *Haiti*. Designated four leaders of gangs that have committed
        serious human rights abuses, including rape.  One of the targets
        and his gang were identified by survivors as directly
        responsible for more than 1,000 documented cases of sexual
        violence in 2022 alone.  
         
    -   *Iraq*. Designated two ISIS leaders, who committed sexual
        violence and were responsible for the enslavement of Yazidi
        women and girls.  
         
    -   *South Sudan*. Designated five government and military officials
        in South Sudan who oversaw, ordered, incentivized, directly
        engaged in, or failed to prevent sexual assault, sexual slavery,
        and gang rape.  
         
    -   *Sudan*. Designated a Sudanese paramilitary leader for his
        leadership of the Rapid Support Forces, an entity whose members
        have engaged in acts of violence and human rights abuses,
        including the massacre of civilians, ethnic killings, and use of
        sexual violence.  
         
    -   *Syria*. Designated two Syria-based armed militias and three
        members of the groups’ leadership structures in connection with
        serious human rights abuses, including rape.   
         
-   **Strengthening Sanctions Regimes. **In June 2024, the United States
    negotiated the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2734,
    renewing measures under the sanctions regime on ISIS, Al Qaeda, and
    other terrorist organizations originally established under
    Resolution 1267.  For the first time, the resolution explicitly
    recognized that planning, directing, or committing of acts involving
    sexual- and gender-based violence are eligible for designation for
    sanctions under the regime’s criteria, recognizing that GBV is used
    as a tactic by terrorist groups, and leading to improved reporting,
    coherence, and coordination. 

**<u>Preventing Conflict-Related Sexual Violence</u>**

-   **Supporting United Nations Efforts to End CRSV. **In 2022, the
    United States announced an additional $400,000 for the Office of the
    UN Special Representative to the Secretary General (SRSG) on Sexual
    Violence in Conflict, supporting efforts to promote justice and
    accountability and address the root causes of conflict-related
    sexual violence.  The United States provides an annual contribution
    of $1.75 million to support the Office of the SRSG.  
     
-   **Increasing Women’s Leadership to Address CRSV.** Through the
    Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Incentive Fund, USAID plans to
    support implementation of the WPS Strategy by investing in programs
    that increase women’s participation in peacebuilding and decision
    making, improve access to justice for GBV survivors, and address
    CRSV.  
    -   In** Sudan, **USAID intends to provide $2.72 million in WPS
        Incentive Funds to strengthen monitoring, documentation, and
        accountability processes and amplify existing Sudanese women’s
        initiatives, such as the Women Coordination Advocacy Agenda. 
        Activities include the development of specialized training for
        GBV and CRSV case documentation, increasing access to care and
        psychosocial support for survivors, and incorporating the needs
        of women and girls in relief and recovery distribution systems
        and services.  
         
    -   In **Sri Lanka**, USAID intends to provide $1.5 million to
        facilitate women’s advocacy on CRSV and peacebuilding and
        develop programs for women leaders to conduct dialogue and
        mobilize collective action.  This program will also provide
        grants to women-led organizations to engage men and boys and
        mitigate cultural barriers that inhibit women’s participation
        and fuel CRSV.
-   **Expanding Atrocity Prevention. **The White House-led Atrocity
    Prevention Task Force—comprised of representatives from a broad
    array of U.S. government departments and agencies—requires the
    consideration of gender and GBV in atrocity risk assessments and has
    refined atrocity prevention toolkits to incorporate CRSV-specific
    early warning, prevention, and accountability tools.  This helps
    ensure that U.S. government response efforts, whether diplomatic or
    programmatic, are informed by an analysis of gender equality issues.
