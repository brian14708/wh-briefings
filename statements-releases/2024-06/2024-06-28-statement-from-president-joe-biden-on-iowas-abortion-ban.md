title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Iowa\u2019s Abortion\_Ban"
---
 
Today, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that the state’s extreme and
dangerous abortion ban can go into effect. Iowa is the twenty-second
state with an abortion ban, imposed by Republican elected officials,
that puts women’s health and lives in jeopardy.

This should never happen in America. Yet, this is exactly what is
happening in states across the country since the Supreme Court
overturned *Roe v. Wade*. And it’s not stopping at the state level –
Republican elected officials in Congress have proposed four national
abortion bans while refusing to protect nationwide access to IVF and
contraception.

Vice President Harris and I believe that women in every state must have
the right to make deeply personal decisions about their health. We will
continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of *Roe v. Wade*
in federal law and stand firm against efforts made by Republican elected
officials to undermine Americans’ fundamental freedoms.
