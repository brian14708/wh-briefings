title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on New Administration Actions\
  \ to Increase Access to Affordable, High-Speed\_Internet"

Every person in America should be able to access affordable, high-speed
internet no matter where they live or how much they earn. That is why
President Biden and I made the largest investment in affordable,
high-speed internet in history with $90 billion to address barriers to
internet access. That includes helping 23 million families save on their
monthly bills through our Affordable Connectivity Program. While
Republicans in Congress have refused to help us revive this program, our
Administration is refusing to let them stop us from delivering for
families across America.  
  
Today, I am proud to highlight that we are finalizing a rule to allow
schools and libraries – primarily in low-income and rural areas – to use
funding from the Federal Communications Commission’s E-Rate program for
Wi-Fi hotspots that will increase access to remote learning and virtual
library services. Additionally, the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration will award over $9 million to the state of
Nevada to implement their Digital Equity Plan. This is the first award
issued under our Administration’s more than $1.4 billion State Digital
Equity Capacity Grant Program, which will help millions of families
receive the resources, skills, and opportunities they need to access
internet that is fast, affordable, and reliable.   
  
President Biden and I understand that this is essential in the 21st
century – from ensuring our students can do their homework and that
parents can find a good-paying job, to making sure our communities’
small business owners can use the internet to run their business. We
will not stop fighting to make it easier for everyone to access
affordable, high-speed internet. Today’s actions are another important
step toward fulfilling that vision.
