title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Anniversary of\_DACA"
---
 
Twelve years ago today, President Obama announced protections that have
made it possible for more than 800,000 Dreamers to live, study, work,
and raise families in the only home they have ever known.  
  
The story of Dreamers is a story of America. Dreamers across our Nation
serve in our military, teach in our classrooms, and lead our small
businesses as entrepreneurs. They are our neighbors, classmates, and
loved ones. Their ambition and aspiration power our communities,
economy, and country – and they deserve our protection.  
  
As the Attorney General of California and as a United States Senator, I
fought to defend and protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
(DACA). And as Vice President, I have worked alongside President Biden
to preserve and fortify DACA, including by ensuring Dreamers have access
to affordable health care, which will improve the health of all
communities.  
  
While President Biden and I will continue fighting to protect Dreamers,
only the United States Congress can ensure permanent protections for
these young people and their families. Lawmakers must pass legislation
that creates a path to citizenship. The time for a lasting solution is
long overdue.
