title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Supreme Court Decision\
  \ in Garland v.\_Cargill"

Weapons of war have no place on the streets of a civil society. That is
why Democrats and Republicans alike supported the federal government
banning bump stocks after they were used to fire over 1,000 rounds into
a crowded music festival in Las Vegas, killing 60 people in the
deadliest mass shooting in American history.  
   
Unfortunately, today’s Supreme Court ruling strikes down this important,
commonsense regulation on devices that convert semiautomatic rifles into
weapons that can fire hundreds of bullets per minute.   
   
While the Supreme Court has once again rolled back progress, we will not
allow the victims and survivors of 1 October to be forgotten. President
Biden and I fought to pass the most significant gun safety legislation
in nearly 30 years, but our work is not done. We are calling on Congress
to immediately ban bump stocks. We do not have a moment to spare nor a
life to spare.
