title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden and First Lady Jill\_Biden on the Passing\
  \ of Mrs. Marian\_Robinson"
---
 
We knew Mrs. Marian Robinson as a devoted mother and grandmother with a
fierce and unconditional love of her family. With the blessing
of friendship, we felt that love ourselves – with every quiet smile or
warm embrace she shared with us.

She believed, like we do, that family is the beginning, middle and end.
 She moved into the White House to be there for her family when they
needed her the most, and in so doing, she served her country right
alongside them. Her life is a reminder that we are a great nation
because we are a good people.  
  
The entire Biden family sends its deepest love to Michelle, Craig,
Barack, Kelly, and the six irrepressible grandchildren
whom she helped to raise and so loved, and in whom her kind and gentle
spirit lives on.   
  
May she rest in peace with her beloved Fraser.  
  
May God bless Mrs. Marian Robinson.
