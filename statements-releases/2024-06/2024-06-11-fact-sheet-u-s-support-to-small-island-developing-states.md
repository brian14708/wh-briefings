title: "FACT SHEET: U.S. Support to Small Island Developing\_States"
---
 
The United States is proud to partner with Small Island Developing
States (SIDS) to accelerate development progress, promote
sustainability, and respond to the climate crisis. SIDS, which are
situated in areas of strategic importance around the world, including in
the Indo-Pacific, Western Hemisphere, and Africa, are disproportionately
affected by the impacts of multiple global crises, including the climate
impacts of sea-level rise and extreme weather events. They have been
vital partners, sharing our interest in: fostering a freer, more open
Pacific region; strengthening our shared democratic values, economic
prosperity, and regional security in the Caribbean; and promoting
maritime security, combatting drug and other forms of trafficking, and
protecting the environment in the Indian Ocean.  
  
The U.S. delegation to the Fourth International Conference on Small
Island Developing States (SIDS4) on May 27-30 was led by U.S. Secretary
of the Interior Deb Haaland and included high-level representatives from
the White House, U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID), National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).   
  
Since 2015, the United States has invested over $5 billion in foreign
assistance and continues to expand its diplomatic presence and
development programming in SIDS.  At SIDS4 and in the lead-up to the
Conference, the United States announced a number of new projects and
initiatives aimed at enhancing our partnerships with SIDS, promoting
climate resilience, and building capacity to help SIDS advance their
priorities, including:   
  
**Deepening Partnerships**

-   The Biden-Harris Administration released the first ever U.S.-Pacific
    Partnership Strategy in 2022 and is working with Congress on plans
    to **provide over $8 billion in new funding and programs for the
    Pacific Islands**.      
-   Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States has
    **increased its high-level engagement** in the Pacific Islands by
    expanding our diplomatic and development presence in the region. 
    This includes opening new embassies in Solomon Islands and Tonga
    with plans to open another in Vanuatu later in 2024.     
-   USAID has opened **a new regional Pacific Island Mission in Fiji**
    and **enhanced its presence in Papua New Guinea. ** Furthermore,
    **over 60 Peace Corps Volunteers have returned to Fiji, Samoa, and
    Tonga,** with more scheduled to arrive in Vanuatu (2024) and Palau
    (2025).     
-   In March 2024, the U.S. Congress appropriated **$7.1 billion in
    funding to implement agreements related to the Compacts of Free
    Association with the Freely Associated States** (Federated States of
    Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of
    Palau).  These funds ensure continued U.S. Postal Services to the
    FAS as well as $6.5 billion in direct economic assistance to support
    the environment, health, education, and infrastructure.     
-   The Millennium Challenge Corporation recently announced several new
    initiatives with SIDS.  MCC’s board selected **Cabo Verde to develop
    a regional compact to support economic growth** through stronger
    regional trade and integration.  MCC plans to seek board approval of
    a **$125 million compact in Belize to increase the quality of
    education** and **reduce high electricity costs,** both which are
    recognized as key development challenges.  And finally, **in
    Kiribati, MCC signed a $26 million threshold program** intended to
    advance Kiribati-led economic growth by supporting the Ministry of
    Employment and Human Resources to promote safe, accessible, decent,
    and inclusive employment opportunities for Kiribati workers and to
    strengthen workers’ rights and resilience.   
-   The Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, which includes several
    SIDS in the Caribbean and West Africa, is building an Atlantic
    community to share experiences and best practices on sustainable
    economic development, scientific capacity building, and
    environmental protection.  **The United States is working with
    Congress to provide $10 million to support these efforts. **   
-   The public-private partnership, the Coalition for Climate
    Entrepreneurship, will **open a Caribbean Climate Hub in Kingston,
    Jamaica** with local partner the Branson Centre for
    Entrepreneurship.  The hub will provide programming, training, and
    mentorship and facilitate access to capital for climate
    entrepreneurs throughout the Caribbean.   
-   The United States, through the U.S. Department of State, was pleased
    to provide **$300,000 to Antigua and Barbuda to support the hosting
    of SIDS4**.  The U.S. Government also provided in-person security
    training and equipment for law enforcement personnel in advance of
    SIDS4 and security during the conference, providing real time U.S
    expertise on crisis preparedness and maritime security.  In
    addition, U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Heriberto Hernandez, a fast
    response cutter homeported in Puerto Rico, made a scheduled port
    visit during the conference, demonstrating U.S. commitment to
    partnership in the Caribbean on search and rescue, law enforcement,
    and regional security.

**Addressing the Climate Crisis**

-   In recognition of the uniquely profound threat of climate change to
    SIDS, the United States is working in partnership with SIDS around
    the world to build resilience to extreme weather events, sea-level
    rise and other climate-related impacts.  **The State Department is
    working with Congress to provide over $27 million for SIDS climate
    priorities this year.  **  
    -   This includes more than **$16 million delivered through the
        President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience
        (PREPARE)** to co-develop and strengthen climate information and
        early warning systems in the Pacific and support for the
        Local2030 Islands Network, including building community
        resilience and measuring progress at the local level.    
    -   These investments will unlock **financing to help SIDS advance
        climate resilience priorities and to expand clean energy
        infrastructure in SIDS.  **This includes support to help design
        and stand up the **Pacific Resilience Facility** – a
        Pacific-designed and -owned funding facility that will provide
        community-based grants for climate adaptation and resilience.
           
    -   Funds will also provide on-demand support to **help establish
        green shipping corridors** for SIDS and strengthen institutional
        capacity to **deploy** **climate-resilient energy infrastructure
        development. **   
-   The United States has **provided nearly $100 million in new
    resources** to increase access to climate finance, accelerate the
    transition to renewable energy, and build resilience to climate
    change and natural disasters under the U.S. Caribbean Partnership to
    Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030) established in 2022.

**Advancing Capacity Building**

-   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in
    partnership with the Department of State, **is providing $10 million
    for capacity building efforts** and training on heat-health early
    warning systems in the Caribbean and multi-hazard early warning
    systems on excessive rainfall and drought in the Pacific.    
-   NOAA, with funding from USAID and the Department of State, has
    **trained over 300 meteorologists from the Pacific and Caribbean
    over the past 23 years to enhance climate resilience** through
    improved forecasts for weather and climate events, including extreme
    events.    
-   Since 2010, the United States has committed more than **$912 million
    in economic and security assistance, including $82 million last
    year, through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) to
    build Caribbean partners’ capacity to disrupt illicit trafficking
    and transnational crime, advancing Caribbean and U.S. citizen
    security.**  CBSI programs are designed to address shared
    U.S-Caribbean security priorities including illicit firearms
    trafficking, border and port security, and maritime law enforcement,
    countering transnational organized crime, and preventing youth crime
    and violence.  
-   The Department of the Interior, working with Congress, intends to
    **provide this year more than $700,000 for government and
    administrative capacity building programs. ** One specific
    initiative called the Executive Leadership Development Program
    (ELDP) ensures students from Pacific and Caribbean insular areas
    have access to programs centered on higher education and building
    workforce capacity across all sectors.  The ELDP assists insular
    island governments with developing and retaining qualified and
    skilled staff to lead their respective governments into the future.
