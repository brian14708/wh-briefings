---
 
I congratulate Cyril Ramaphosa on his re-election as president of the
Republic of South Africa, and commend all the political parties for
working together to form a Government of National Unity. 

I also send my warm wishes to the people of South Africa. This year—as
South Africa celebrates 30 years of all citizens having the right to
vote—they have demonstrated the enduring power of government of the
people, by the people, and for the people.

I look forward to the United States and South Africa continuing our work
together, to expand economic opportunity, invest in clean energy
solutions, and demonstrate that democracy delivers.
