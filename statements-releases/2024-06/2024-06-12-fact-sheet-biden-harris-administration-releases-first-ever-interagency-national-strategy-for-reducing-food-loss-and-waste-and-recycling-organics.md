title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Releases First-Ever Interagency\
  \ National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling\_Organics"
---
 
This week, the Biden-Harris Administration released its [National
Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling
Organics](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NATIONAL-STRATEGY-FOR-REDUCING-FOOD-LOSS-AND-WASTE-AND-RECYCLING-ORGANICS_6.11.24.pdf)
to accelerate the prevention of food loss and waste, which will help cut
costs for families, address climate change, and advance environmental
justice. This is the first interagency national strategy that lays out a
path for the United States to meet its national goal to halve food loss
and waste by 2030. To help advance progress toward this goal, the
Biden-Harris Administration has invested more than $200 million to
reduce food loss and waste from the President’s Investing in America
agenda.

Preventing food loss and waste will save families money and lower food
costs. In the United States, the average family of four [spends $1,500
each
year](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/43833/43680_eib121.pdf)
on food that ends up uneaten. The National Strategy is a deliverable in
the Biden-Harris Administration’s [*National Strategy on Hunger,
Nutrition, and
Health*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/White-House-National-Strategy-on-Hunger-Nutrition-and-Health-FINAL.pdf).
Additionally, preventing food loss and waste and recycling food and
other organic waste will reduce landfill methane emissions, a key driver
of the climate crisis, and advance the [*U.S. Methane Emissions
Reduction Action
Plan*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/US-Methane-Emissions-Reduction-Action-Plan-1.pdf).
Food is the [single most common material found in
landfills](https://www.epa.gov/land-research/quantifying-methane-emissions-landfilled-food-waste),
and 61 percent of methane generated by landfilled food waste is not
captured by landfill gas collection systems and is released to the
atmosphere, contributing to climate change.

The Biden-Harris Administration is also advancing environmental justice
through this Strategy. Many of the highlighted programs in the Strategy
are covered under the President’s [Justice40
Initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
which set the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal
investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by
underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. The Strategy also
recognizes that identifying and addressing the challenges related to
food loss, food waste, and organic waste to help meet the needs of
Tribal communities as well as communities with environmental justice
concerns is integral. These communities bear the brunt of the adverse
environmental, social, and economic consequences of waste management,
among other systems.

The National Strategy identifies four objectives:

1.  **Prevent food loss.**
    -   USDA is investing in research to address food loss and waste,
        including $2.7 million in foundational research with American
        Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and other funds; a total of $7.6 million
        through USDA’s Agriculture Research Service from fiscal year
        2021 to 2024; and $69.2 million into 76 awards through the
        Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from 2019 to 2023.
    -   From fiscal year 2021 to 2023, USDA provided $14.9 million to
        State agencies that administer The Emergency Food Assistance
        Program for Farm to Food Bank Projects, which facilitate food
        donation by building relationships between agricultural
        producers, processors, distributors, and emergency feeding
        organizations.
    -   In May 2024, USDA invested $1.5 million to fund a
        [Center](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/05/30/usda-announces-expansion-interagency-collaboration-help-reduce-food)
        that will prioritize food loss and waste prevention and recovery
        among Land-grant Universities, their partners, and external
        stakeholders and will establish a National Extension Food Loss
        and Waste Strategy so that extension agents can help educate
        individuals and communities to reduce food loss and waste.
    -   In 2021 and 2022, USDA
        [hosted](https://www.labroots.com/ms/virtual-event/2nd-usda-food-loss-waste-innovation-fair)
        two Food Loss and Waste Innovation Fairs where thousands of
        attendees learned about new food loss and waste investments and
        technologies.
2.  **Prevent food waste.**
    -   USDA invested $15 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding in
        [Community Food
        Projects](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/hunger-food-security-programs/community-food-projects-competitive-grant-program-cfpcgp)
        grants and [Sustainable Agriculture Research &
        Education](https://southern.sare.org/news/sare-supporting-strategies-to-curb-food-loss-and-reduce-food-waste-with-grant-opportunity/).
        Awards support projects that reduce food loss and waste, get
        surplus wholesome food to individuals in need, and develop
        linkages between food producers, providers, and food recovery
        organizations.
    -   USDA invested $10 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding in
        [Food and Agriculture Service Learning
        Program](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/food-agriculture-service-learning-program)
        grants and an award to work with the National 4-H Council so
        that youth develop and maintain lifelong practices of minimizing
        food loss and waste.
    -   USDA published materials to reduce consumer confusion about
        [food date
        labels](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDA-Food-Date-Labeling-Infographic.pdf)
        and to spread the word about the [product liability
        protections](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/FAQs-GoodSamaritanAct.pdf)
        of the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, including
        updates from recent amendments.
    -   In December 2022, FDA released the most recent version of the
        [Food
        Code](https://www.fda.gov/food/retail-food-protection/fda-food-code),
        which included new language reducing barriers to food donations
        by clarifying for the first time that food donations from retail
        food establishments are acceptable as long as proper food safety
        practices are followed.
    -   In November 2023, FDA released a [fact
        sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/173901/download?attachment) to
        help retailers understand and implement recent changes to the
        Food Code effectively.
    -   In November 2022, FDA
        [published](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-requirements-additional-traceability-records-certain-foods)
        the Final Rule on Requirements for Additional Traceability
        Records for Certain Foods to facilitate faster identification of
        contaminated food. FDA is also encouraging the entire food
        supply chain to voluntarily adopt more advanced technology that
        enables digital tracing technologies, which could dramatically
        reduce food loss and waste associated with contamination events.
    -   From 2021- 2023, EPA released several [food waste
        research](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fland-research%2Ffood-waste-research&data=05%7C02%7Cjean.buzby%40usda.gov%7C5471a07cd8c14f977ef008dc8420d4d2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638530523755746967%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=MTs54XWh3FBl1fgQ%2FUIMO%2FXERWNn3v1X1nhGArrsc5A%3D&reserved=0)
        reports, culminating in the new [Wasted Food
        Scale](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fsustainable-management-food%2Fwasted-food-scale&data=05%7C02%7Cjean.buzby%40usda.gov%7C5471a07cd8c14f977ef008dc8420d4d2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638530523755754635%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=5Di4vmeRIuhJC0Aa5DItksRm8uYZJq7JReP88OkJa2U%3D&reserved=0)**,**
        which ranks food waste reduction pathways. These “top” pathways
        prioritize using food for its intended purpose: to nourish
        people.
    -   In April 2023, EPA updated data and measurement in the [2019
        Wasted Food
        Report](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Ffacts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling%2Ffood-material-specific-data&data=05%7C02%7Cjean.buzby%40usda.gov%7C5471a07cd8c14f977ef008dc8420d4d2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638530523755727198%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=MM968Edqpa1Yo8TjsUmKTF%2FvMEE55n3ACxHGVkaWG28%3D&reserved=0)
        and the fourth [Anaerobic Digestion Facilities Processing Food
        Waste](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fanaerobic-digestion%2Fanaerobic-digestion-data-collection-project&data=05%7C02%7Cjean.buzby%40usda.gov%7C5471a07cd8c14f977ef008dc8420d4d2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638530523755732097%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=a0%2B4e7XnbEsfTZt6GmO%2FqCWVlpQaUFQXBBikbaTOIus%3D&reserved=0)
        Survey.
    -   In August 2023, EPA released Version 3.0 of the [Excess Food
        Opportunities
        Map](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fsustainable-management-food%2Ftools-preventing-and-diverting-wasted-food%23map&data=05%7C02%7Cjean.buzby%40usda.gov%7C5471a07cd8c14f977ef008dc8420d4d2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638530523755722252%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=b4mI23VyEDFPUYpDPo7nl%2BYUjj89A6IqWT7HKAVlMiI%3D&reserved=0),
        which provides data updates for all excess food generators and
        recipients as well as two new data layers: farmers markets and
        refrigerated warehousing and storage facilities.
    -   USDA and EPA increased membership of the U.S. Food Loss and
        Waste [2030
        Champions](https://www.usda.gov/foodlossandwaste/champions) from
        30 Champions in 2020 to 50 Champions currently. These businesses
        and organizations have made a public commitment to reduce food
        loss and waste in their U.S. operations by 50% by 2030.
    -   In June 2024, USDA, EPA, and FDA renewed the Memorandum of
        Understanding with the Food Waste Reduction Alliance to support
        greater engagement in food loss and waste reduction efforts by
        food industry members.
3.  **Increase the recycling rate for all organic waste.**
    -   Using Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, EPA established two
        grant programs—the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling
        program and the Recycling Education and Outreach program—to
        support communities, states, territories and
        [Tribes](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fnewsreleases%2Fbiden-harris-administration-announces-more-90-million-tribal-recycling-infrastructure&data=05%7C02%7Cjean.buzby%40usda.gov%7C5471a07cd8c14f977ef008dc8420d4d2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638530523755717288%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=FKTd8sCmgpPwr%2BjldMXQyLfZiXfPWQTdUOPMIfWkiC8%3D&reserved=0)
        with materials management, including food. Of the nearly $200
        million in investments
        [announced](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fnewsreleases%2Fbiden-harris-administration-invests-more-100-million-recycling-infrastructure-projects&data=05%7C02%7Cjean.buzby%40usda.gov%7C5471a07cd8c14f977ef008dc8420d4d2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638530523755712221%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=39lsoPzY4%2F7zRnGTaVH8FvNaws0RoYh4WciHF7a6Crs%3D&reserved=0)
        last fall, more than $83 million went to projects that addressed
        organics recycling. Many projects supported composting projects,
        the majority of which included food waste.
    -   USDA invested $30 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding in
        [Composting and Food Waste
        Reduction](https://www.usda.gov/topics/urban/coop-agreements)
        cooperative agreements to assist local and municipal governments
        with projects that develop and test strategies for planning and
        implementing innovative, scalable compost plans and food waste
        reduction plans. To date, 119 entities have received a total of
        $23.3 million. 
    -   In 2023, EPA released two new social marketing toolkits around
        [preventing food
        waste](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-04/EPA_Wasted_Food_Social_Marketing_Tookit.pdf)
        and [composting food
        scraps](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-06/EPA_CompostingFoodScraps-SocialMarketingTookit_6_12_2023_508.pdf)
        to provide communities with guidance on developing social
        marketing campaigns as well as customizable materials to spur
        behavior change.
    -   In February 2024, FDA
        [announced](https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-announces-pfas-used-grease-proofing-agents-food-packaging-no-longer-being-sold-us)
        that all grease-proofing agents containing Per- and
        Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are no longer being sold by
        manufacturers for food contact use in the U.S. market. This work
        reduces potential for contamination of food wastes with PFAS
        from food packaging.
4.  **Support policies that incentivize and encourage the prevention of
    food loss and waste and organics recycling.**
    -   In May 2024, USDA, EPA and FDA [renewed the formal agreement for
        the Federal Food Loss and Waste
        collaboration](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/05/30/usda-announces-expansion-interagency-collaboration-help-reduce-food)
        which now includes the U.S. Agency for International
        Development.
    -   USDA and EPA, with support from other agencies, collaborated
        with the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, the
        Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and other
        international organizations on a
        [report](http://www.cec.org/publications/technical-report-quantifying-food-loss-and-waste-and-its-impacts/)
        and [practical
        guide](http://www.cec.org/publications/why-and-how-to-measure-food-loss-and-waste/)
        with best practices and policies for the reduction and
        measurement of food waste.
