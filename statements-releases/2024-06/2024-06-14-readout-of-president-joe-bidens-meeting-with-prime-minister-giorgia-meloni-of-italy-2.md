President Joseph R. Biden met today with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni
of Italy in Apulia, Italy to deepen the U.S.-Italy partnership across a
range of vital security, economic, and regional issues.  President Biden
commended Prime Minister Meloni for Italy’s steadfast support for
Ukraine as it continues to defend itself from Russia’s brutal war of
aggression, including Italy’s critical security assistance.  President
Biden and Prime Minister Meloni welcomed the unanimous commitment by G7
leaders to provide $50 billion in additional financial support to
Ukraine using the proceeds of immobilized Russian sovereign assets. 
They also agreed to continue to pursue all available options to impose
further costs on Russia and those who support Russia’s war machine. 
They also discussed their respective efforts to enhance mutual economic
security and respond to economic coercion. The two leaders discussed the
importance of two-way trade and investment to enhance economic
prosperity. President Biden and Prime Minister Meloni also highlighted
the urgent need to secure a hostage deal and a ceasefire in Gaza, and
emphasized the importance of Hamas taking a constructive approach to
that process.
