*The President and First Lady to Host a Juneteenth Concert on Monday,
June 10, 2024*

The White House announced today a Juneteenth Concert on Monday, June 10.
The South Lawn concert will be a celebration of community, culture and
music.

In 2021, President Biden signed bipartisan legislation
[establishing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/18/a-proclamation-on-juneteenth-day-of-observance-2021/)
Juneteenth as the nation’s newest Federal holiday, so that all Americans
can feel the power of this day, learn from our history, celebrate our
progress, and recognize and engage in the work that continues.  

Since taking office, President Biden has worked to advance racial equity
and ensure the promise of America for Black Americans. See a fact sheet
