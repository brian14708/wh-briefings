title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on New Actions to Keep Families\_\
  Together"

Immigrants have always made America stronger. For generations, they have
served in our military, taught in our classrooms, and led our small
businesses as entrepreneurs. They are our neighbors, classmates, and
loved ones. And their experiences, ambition, and aspirations power our
communities, economy, and country each day.  
   
That is why from Day One of our administration, President Joe Biden and
I have worked to protect immigrants, keep families together, and expand
lawful pathways to citizenship. Working with advocates and organizers
from across the nation, we have rejected hateful attacks on immigrants,
preserved and fortified DACA, increased access to affordable health
care, and expanded economic opportunity.  
   
Today, we are building on that work by taking bold action to bring
relief to an estimated half a million spouses of American citizens who
have been here in the country for a decade or more and their children.
They deserve our protection, and should be allowed to remain with their
families and contribute to our communities while they apply for a green
card.  
   
President Biden and I are also expediting work visas for Dreamers who
have graduated from college in the United States and have a job offer
from a U.S. employer. We value their contributions and want them to
continue to unleash their skills, ideas, and potential right here in the
country that has invested in their success, to the benefit of our
economy and our communities.  
   
While today’s actions are a significant step forward, there is more work
to be done to fix our broken immigration system. That includes the need
for a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. President Biden and I
continue to call on the United States Congress to join us in acting by
passing permanent protections for Dreamers.
