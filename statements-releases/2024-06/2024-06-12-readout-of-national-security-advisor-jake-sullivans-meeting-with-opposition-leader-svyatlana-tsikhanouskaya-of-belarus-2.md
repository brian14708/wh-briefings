National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met yesterday with democratic
opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya of Belarus. Mr. Sullivan
conveyed steadfast U.S. support for the people of Belarus in their
pursuit of a democratic future. He made clear that the United States,
together with partners and allies, will continue to take steps to hold
the Lukashenka regime to account for its actions, including through the
imposition of additional sanctions. They discussed the Lukashenka
regime’s support for Russia’s war against Ukraine, continued
imprisonment of political prisoners, and flagrant human rights
violations. They also reviewed plans to continue the Strategic Dialogue
between the United States Government and the Belarusian democratic
movement and civil society.
