title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting on Expanding Access to Free Community\_College"
---
 
This week, the Biden-Harris Administration convened state leaders to
discuss efforts to expand free community college programs across the
country and prepare their workforce for good jobs. State leaders shared
how lowering costs for community college students has increased
enrollment rates and access to postsecondary education. Several state
leaders highlighted how they have used funds from President Biden’s
American Rescue Plan as a key source for building and expanding
community college promise programs.

Officials from the Domestic Policy Council and Office of the First Lady
spoke to the Administration’s commitment to expanding access to free
community college. Community colleges are the nation’s largest provider
of workforce training, and the Administration has centered community
colleges in federal efforts to prepare workers for the jobs of today and
tomorrow. This includes both the President’s [$90 billion
proposal](https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget25/justifications/u-fcc.pdf)
in his budget to expand free community college nationwide, which would
save eligible students an estimated $4,500 or more per year, and the
Classroom to Career proposal, which would provide high school students
access to 12 free career-related community college credits through dual
enrollment.

State participants included:

1.  Joe Marro, Senior Policy Advisor to Maine Governor Janet Mills
2.  Karen Spilka, Massachusetts Senate President
3.  Michelle Richard, Acting Director of the Michigan Department of
    Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential
4.  Stephanie Rodriguez, New Mexico Secretary of Higher Education
5.  Shannon Gilkey, Rhode Island Postsecondary Commissioner

Administration participants included:

1.  Mala Adiga, Deputy Assistant to the President and Policy Director
    for the First Lady
2.  Robert Gordon, Deputy Assistant to the President for Economic
    Mobility, Domestic Policy Council
