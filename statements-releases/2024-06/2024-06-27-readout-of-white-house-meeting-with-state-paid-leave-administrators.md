title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Paid Leave Administrators"
---
 
Yesterday, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of
the Gender Policy Council, and Tom Perez, Senior Advisor and Assistant
to the President and Director of the White House Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs, convened agency partners and administrators
of state paid family and medical leave programs for a discussion.
Participating administrators represented Colorado, Connecticut, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island,
Washington state, and Washington, D.C.

Earlier this year, the President released his FY 2025 Budget, which
proposes a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program
to ensure that all workers can take the time they need to bond with a
new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own
serious illness; address circumstances arising from a loved one’s
military deployment; find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault,
or stalking; or grieve the death of a loved one. The Administration
applauds the thirteen states and the District of Columbia that have
passed paid leave laws, and continues to call for a national paid family
and medical leave program.

During the meeting, Administration officials underscored the
Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to pursuing a national
paid family and medical leave program, while supporting the leadership
and efforts of state programs paving the way—implementing programs that
uplift families, our economy, and the fight for paid leave at the
national level. Representatives from the Department of Treasury
announced that the agency is working on guidance on the tax treatment of
state paid family and medical leave programs that would provide greater
clarity to existing and future programs.
