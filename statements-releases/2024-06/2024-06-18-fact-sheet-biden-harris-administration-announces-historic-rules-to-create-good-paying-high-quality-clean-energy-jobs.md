title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Historic Rules to\
  \ Create Good-Paying, High-Quality Clean Energy\_Jobs"
---
 
*Inflation Reduction Act final rules build on Administration actions to
develop a skilled, well-paid workforce to build the clean energy economy
and combat the climate crisis*

Since day one, President Biden has committed to building a clean energy
economy that creates good-paying and union jobs for American workers.
Spurred by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, which includes
the most significant investment in climate and clean energy in history,
America has unleashed a clean energy manufacturing and deployment boom
that has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in private sector
investment and created more than 270,000 new good-paying and union clean
energy jobs. These investments are [flowing to the
places](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-act-a-place-based-analysis-updates-from-q3-and-q4-2023)
President Biden promised not to leave behind, including the historic
energy communities that have powered this nation for generations and
economically distressed communities, providing jobs and economic
opportunity, particularly for workers without a college degree.

The Inflation Reduction Act delivered on President Biden’s commitment to
be the most pro-worker, pro-union president in history, attaching strong
labor protections and incentives to climate and clean energy tax credits
for the first time ever. Outside analysis projects that the Inflation
Reduction Act could create [1.5 million additional
jobs](https://laborenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/8-6-22-IRA-Impact-Analysis-V14.pdf)
over the next decade, and these provisions will ensure that those jobs
building wind farms, installing solar panels, and constructing hydrogen
and carbon capture facilities will be good-paying and support proven
pathways into the clean energy industry that will allow workers to earn
while they learn.

**<u>Today, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue
Service</u>**
[**announced**](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2413)
**<u>final rules implementing the prevailing wage and registered
apprenticeship increased credit provisions of the Inflation Reduction
Act.</u>**

Clean energy projects that meet the [requirements of these final
rules](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2413) will
receive a fivefold increase for clean energy tax credits for deployment
of wind, solar, nuclear, hydrogen, and other clean energy technologies,
as well as for projects receiving allocations under the Section 48C
Advanced Energy Projects credit., providing a significant incentive for
project developers to pay prevailing wages to workers for construction,
alteration, and repair of clean energy projects and to hire registered
apprentices to earn while they learn by working on those projects.  

Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo and Acting Secretary of
Labor Julie Su also [published a
blog](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/project-labor-agreements-a-best-practice-for-clean-energy-projects-seeking-to-meet-ira-wage-and-apprenticeship-standards)
highlighting the use of Project Labor Agreements as a best practice for
large construction projects and a tool to help project developers comply
with the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. Project Labor
Agreements, or pre-hire collective bargaining agreements that set the
terms and conditions for employment on a construction project, help
workers and developers alike by providing strong worker and wage
protections while ensuring a reliable supply of skilled workers to help
deliver projects on time and on budget.

The final rules provide certainty for clean energy developers and
workers to realize the benefits of President Biden’s historic
investments in the clean energy economy. To protect workers and ensure
compliance with these requirements, the IRS also released a [Fact
Sheet](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5983.pdf) that can be posted at
job sites and used to educate workers about the prevailing wage and
registered apprenticeship standards for clean energy projects, including
information on how to use IRS Form 3949-A to report suspected violations
of tax law. The IRS and Department of Labor (DOL) also announced that
they are working on an MOU, to be signed by the end of the year, that
will harness DOL’s extensive prevailing wage and registered
apprenticeship expertise, to facilitate joint education and public
outreach, develop training content for IRS examiners, and formalize a
process for DOL to share with IRS, any credible tips or information
about potential noncompliance with the prevailing wage and registered
apprenticeship requirements.

Today’s announcement builds on efforts across the Administration to
create strong pathways into good-paying and union jobs in clean energy
and build a high-quality, diverse pipeline of workers prepared to build
the clean energy economy of the future:

-   The Department of Labor [launched an interactive
    map](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/cleanenergyprojects) to
    highlight for workers, unions, and the public more than 1,000
