title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Israeli Hostage\
  \ Rescue\_Operation"
---
 
Today, Israeli security forces conducted a successful operation to
rescue four hostages from the grips of Hamas in Gaza. All four were
taken from the Nova Music Festival on October 7, and Hamas filmed the
horrific abduction of Ms. Argamani for the world to see. Now they are
safe and reunited with their families. We commend the work of the
Israeli security services that conducted this daring operation. 

The United States is supporting all efforts to secure the release of
hostages still held by Hamas, including American citizens. This includes
through ongoing negotiations or other means. The hostage release and
ceasefire deal that is now on the table would secure the release of all
the remaining hostages together with security assurances for Israel and
relief for the innocent civilians in Gaza. This deal has the full
backing of the United States and has been endorsed by countries from
around the world, including the G7, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, UAE,
and Qatar, as well as the sixteen countries with their citizens still
being held by Hamas. They all must be released — now.
