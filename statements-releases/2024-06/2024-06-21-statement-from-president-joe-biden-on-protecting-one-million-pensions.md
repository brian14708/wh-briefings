title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Protecting One Million\_Pensions"
---
 
Today, we mark a major milestone: Thanks to my American Rescue Plan, we
have protected one million pensions from devastating cuts. Whether it is
Social Security, Medicare, or pensions, workers who earn a dignified
retirement through decades of hard work and sacrifice should never see
their benefits cut due to broken promises or policies that favor the
wealthy over working families.

Members of my Administration are joining Senator Bob Casey, one of the
champions of the Butch Lewis Act to protect pensions that was included
in my Rescue Plan, in Pennsylvania today to announce we are protecting
over 103,000 Bakery and Confectionary Workers from cuts to their
pensions of up to 45%. With today’s announcement, we have protected the
pensions of over 52,000 Pennsylvanians, 71,000 Illinoisans, 71,000 New
Yorkers, 62,000 Ohioans, 61,000 Michiganders, 39,000 Missourians, 33,000
Wisconsinites, and many more. This protects the retirements of over half
a million Teamsters, over 100,000 Food and Commercial Workers, over
100,000 Steelworkers and Auto Workers, and thousands of Communications
Workers, Carpenters, and others. That’s what it means to build the
economy from the middle out and the bottom up, and to protect the
dignity of work.
