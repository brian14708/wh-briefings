President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with His Holiness Pope Francis today
on the margins of the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Apulia, Italy.  The leaders
emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire and a hostage deal
to get the hostages home and address the critical humanitarian crisis in
Gaza. President Biden thanked Pope Francis for the Vatican’s work to
address the humanitarian impacts of Russia’s war of aggression in
Ukraine, including his efforts to help return kidnapped Ukrainian
children to their families. President Biden also reaffirmed his deep
appreciation for the Pope’s tireless advocacy for the poor and those
suffering from persecution, the effects of climate change, and conflict
around the world.
