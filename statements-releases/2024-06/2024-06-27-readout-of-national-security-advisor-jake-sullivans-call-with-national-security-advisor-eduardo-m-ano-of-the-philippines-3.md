---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke yesterday with Philippine
National Security Advisor Eduardo M. Año.  Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Año
discussed shared concerns over the People’s Republic of China’s
dangerous and escalatory actions against the Philippines’ lawful
maritime operations near Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea. 
Mr. Sullivan reiterated ironclad U.S. commitment to the U.S.-Philippines
Mutual Defense Treaty, which extends to armed attacks on Philippine
armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft—to include those of its Coast
Guard—anywhere in the South China Sea.  Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Año
reaffirmed the enduring friendship between our nations and our shared
commitment to freedom of navigation and international law in the South
China Sea.  The two committed to continued close cooperation in support
of their shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.
