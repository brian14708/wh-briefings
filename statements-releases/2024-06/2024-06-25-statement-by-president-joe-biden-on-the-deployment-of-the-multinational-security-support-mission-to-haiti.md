title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden On the Deployment of the Multinational Security\
  \ Support Mission to\_Haiti"

Today, with strong support from the United States, Kenyan forces part of
the Multinational Security Support mission arrived in Haiti, beginning
an effort that will bring much needed relief to Haitians. Rampant gang
violence has killed or harmed thousands of children, women, and men.
Over half a million people have been displaced. Gender-based violence is
widespread. As gangs hinder access to critical supplies, nearly five
million Haitians now face severe food insecurity.  
   
The people of Haiti deserve to feel safe in their homes, build better
lives for their families, and enjoy democratic freedoms. Haiti’s future
depends on the return to democratic governance.  While these goals may
not be accomplished overnight, this mission provides the best chance of
achieving them.   
   
This mission will support the Haitian National Police as they increase
their anti-gang operations, build their capacity to maintain public
safety, and ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those in need.
And we’ve worked with Kenya and other partners to integrate critically
important accountability and oversight measures into the mission.  

I commend – and am deeply grateful to – all the countries that have
pledged personnel and financial support to this mission that will grow
to 2,500 multinational personnel, led by Kenya and including Benin,
Jamaica, The Bahamas, Belize, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Bangladesh,
Algeria, Canada, France, Germany, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, the
United Kingdom, and Spain. For our part, the United States is this
mission’s largest financial contributor, providing over $300 million and
up to $60 million in equipment. And we will continue our diplomatic
outreach to encourage more countries to join this effort, because what
happens in Haiti matters to its neighbors, the region, and the world.

  
Haiti is an extraordinary country, and the people of Haiti deserve what
people everywhere deserve: security, opportunity, and freedom. We are
enriched by Haitian immigrants and Haitian Americans’ contributions. The
United States has and will continue providing significant security,
humanitarian, and economic development assistance, including my
Administration’s strong support for trade preferences with Haiti.
