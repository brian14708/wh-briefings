title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the May Jobs\_Report"
---
 
The great American comeback continues, but we still have to make more
progress. On my watch, 15.6 million more Americans have the dignity and
respect that comes with a job. Unemployment has been at or below 4% for
30 months—the longest stretch in 50 years. And a record high share of
working-age women have jobs.  
   
I will keep fighting to lower costs for families like the ones I grew up
with in Scranton. I’m fighting corporate greed by calling on
corporations with record profits to lower prices—as Target and Walmart
have for grocery prices. I’m fighting to make rent more affordable by
building 2 million new homes. I’m fighting to lower the cost of health
care and prescription drugs, like insulin and inhalers.  
   
Congressional Republicans have a different vision—one that puts
billionaires and special interests first. The Republican plan would
increase inflation by repealing the Affordable Care Act, siding with Big
Oil to raise utility bills, letting Big Banks rip off Americans, and
blow up the debt by slashing taxes for billionaires. I will never stop
fighting for Scranton—not Park Avenue.
