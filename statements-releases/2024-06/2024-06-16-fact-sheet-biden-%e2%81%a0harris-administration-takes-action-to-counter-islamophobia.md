title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Action to Counter\_Islamophobia"
---
 
As Muslims in America and around the world commemorate Eid-al-Adha this
year, the holiday arrives at a time of deep pain for communities at home
and abroad. In addition to the devastating humanitarian impacts of the
ongoing fighting in Gaza, there has been a rise in harassment, bigotry
and horrifying violence towards Muslim, Arab and Palestinian
Americans.  
  
To address discrimination and violence, last November the Biden-Harris
Administration announced the development of the first-ever U.S. National
Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and
Discrimination, including hate against Arab, Sikh and South Asian
Americans (“the Strategy”). Building on work that had been underway
since 2021, departments and agencies across the government are in close
communication with communities regarding their concerns and
recommendations on societal and institutional discrimination as we
continue to develop the Strategy. Over the past year, the Administration
has taken steps to support these communities, including the following
actions: 

-   On March 15, 2024, President Biden became the first U.S. President
    to recognize the International Day to Combat Islamophobia. In his
    [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/15/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-international-day-to-combat-islamophobia/),
    President Biden recognized the violence and hate that Muslims
    worldwide too often face because of their religious beliefs—and the
    ugly resurgence of Islamophobia in the wake of the devastating war
    in Gaza. He rededicated his Administration to help build a world
    where people of all faiths and all backgrounds are free to live
    without fear of persecution. To mark this day, the Department of
    Education’s (ED) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a [Dear
    Colleague
    Letter](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-reminds-schools-their-legal-obligation-address-discrimination-against-muslim-arab-sikh-south-asian-hindu-and-palestinian-students)
    reminding schools of their legal obligation under Title VI to
    address discrimination, including harassment, based on race, color
    or national origin, including discrimination against students who
    are or are perceived to be Muslim, Arab, Sikh, South Asian, Hindu or
    Palestinian based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. U.S.
    Attorney General Merrick Garland also issued a statement
    [recommitting](https://x.com/TheJusticeDept/status/1768682200692572601)
    the Justice Department (DOJ) to protecting Muslim Americans from
    discrimination and hate-fueled violence, and DOJ published resources
    on [hate crimes](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes), [combating

-   Through the Fiscal Year 2024 [National Security
    Supplemental](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/13/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-senate-passage-of-the-national-security-supplemental/),
    President Biden secured an additional $400 million for the Nonprofit
    Security Grant Program, which funds security improvements and
    training to nonprofits and houses of worship, including mosques. The
    **Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DOJ** published
    a [resource
    guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/protecting-places-worship-six-steps-enhance-security-against-targeted-violence) titled,
    “Protecting Places of Worship: Six Steps to Enhance Security Against
    Targeted Violence,” outlining actions Muslim and other faith-based
    communities and houses of worship can take to increase security
    through easily implementable steps that sustain an open and
    welcoming environment. In addition, DHS conducted a series of
    regional and online workshops on protecting places of worship,
    including with Muslim organizations and communities, which featured
    opportunities for communities to offer feedback to help inform DHS
    policies and practices. To receive information about future
    engagements, please contact <NGOEngagement@hq.dhs.gov>.   
-   The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) published a
    fact sheet titled, “[Anti-Arab, Anti-Middle Eastern, Anti-Muslim,
    and Antisemitic Discrimination are
    Illegal](https://www.eeoc.gov/anti-arab-anti-middle-eastern-anti-muslim-and-antisemitic-discrimination-are-illegal),”
    which highlights employees’ rights related to disparate treatment,
    segregation, harassment, religious accommodations and retaliation,
    and which the EEOC has shared at over 70 outreach and education
    events already this Fiscal Year.  
-   ED shared [federal campus safety

    safeguard religious freedom rights of K-12 students, ED also
    continues to disseminate its recently
    updated [guidance](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/religionandschools/prayer_guidance.html) on
    protected prayer and other religious expression in elementary and
    secondary schools. Ahead of the start of Ramadan, the ED-funded
    National Center for Safe and Supportive Learning Environments
    released an [expanded
    collection](https://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov/k12/promoting-religious-inclusion-schools)
    of specialized K-12 educator resources for supporting Muslim
    students.   
-   ED OCR issued a [Dear Colleague
    Letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-202405-shared-ancestry.pdf)
    in May 2024 providing information on the legal analyses it uses to
    determine whether discrimination exists and examples of conduct
    that, depending on facts and circumstances, could raise concerns
    under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This letter also
    includes a section on First Amendment considerations.  
-   The Department of Labor released a “[Know Your
    Rights](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/KnowYourRightsForUnionMembersAntidiscriminationFactSheet.pdf)”
    document for union members on discrimination based on actual or
    perceived religion, shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. It
    notes that union members and workers—including those who are, or are
    perceived to be, Muslim, Arab, Middle Eastern, Palestinian, Sikh and
    South Asian—have the right to be free from workplace discrimination
    based on religion, national origin or race.  
-   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the
    availability of $500,000 to support partnerships between state and
    local fair housing agencies and community-based organizations. Among
    the overall funds available to support state and local partnerships
    to combat housing discrimination, HUD has prioritized use of these
    funds to combat religious discrimination, including Islamophobia and
    Antisemitism, through education and outreach activities. These funds
    are available to jurisdictions that enforce fair housing laws under
    cooperative agreement with HUD through its Fair Housing Assistance
    Program.       
-   USDA has worked to increase access to culturally appropriate foods
    for USDA customers with religious dietary needs, including those who
    need [halal
    food](https://www.ams.usda.gov/content/usda-seeks-information-expand-kosher-and-halal-food-options-its-nutrition-assistance).
    This work has included engagement with halal food producers,
    processors and vendors; expanding and creating greater awareness of
    the number of halal or halal-certified foods in USDA’s food
    procurement and available to program operators; training schools on
    how to meet students’ religious dietary needs for the National
    School Lunch and School Breakfast programs; [developing
    resources](https://www.fns.usda.gov/tefap/supporting-kosher-and-halal-communities-faqs)
    for food bank partners; and expanding outreach and technical
    assistance for halal or kosher meat processors. USDA hosted a
    discussion with the commercial U.S. halal food industry to discuss
    opportunities for further collaboration, including to address food
    insufficiency in schools and underserved communities across
    America. Also, USDA organized a summit in Omaha,
    Nebraska on countering Islamophobia, Antisemitism, and related forms
    of hatred and bias in rural America.  
-   The Office of Management and Budget announced that Middle Eastern or
    North African (MENA) is now a reporting category that all federal
    agencies must use when collecting information on race and ethnicity,
    including in the decennial census, to generate more accurate and
    useful data across the federal Government. Federal agencies,
    including the Census Bureau, will continue ongoing engagement with
    MENA communities as they begin implementing this update into
    censuses, surveys and forms.  
-   The President’s Committee for the Arts and the Humanities, the
    National Endowment for the Arts, the Institute of Museum and Library
    Services, and the National Endowment for the Humanities launched
    [Artists for
    Understanding](https://pcah.gov/artists-for-understanding), a new
    initiative that brings together a diverse community of artists and
    cultural luminaries who share a common belief in the power of the
    arts and humanities to counter all forms of hate, including bias and
    discrimination against Arab, Jewish, Muslim, Palestinian, Sikh and
    South Asian Americans.  
-   For the first time, eight agencies—the Departments of
    [Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/usda-title-vi-fact-sheet.pdf),
    [Health and Human
    Services](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/shared-ancestry-or-ethnic-characteristics-discrimination/index.html),

    and
    [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/306/Treasury-Title-VI-Ancestry-and-Ethnicity-Fact-Sheet-9-11-2023.pdf)—clarified
    in writing that Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits
    discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics,
    including certain forms of Islamophobic, Antisemitic and related
    forms of discrimination and bias in federally funded programs and
    activities.  
-   The Department of Defense leveraged existing survey data to estimate
    the prevalence of potential Islamophobic and Antisemitic behavior in
    the military workplace to evaluate its policies to counter
    discrimination, discriminatory harassment and extremist activity.
    This analysis was the first to specifically estimate the prevalence
    of potential Islamophobic and Antisemitic activity in the military
    workplace, with the goal of identifying gaps to be addressed in
    future policies, programs and procedures.  
-   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) incorporated training on
    countering anti-Muslim and anti-Sikh bias, Antisemitism and related
    forms of bias and discrimination into its Chaplain Orientation
    Program, which teaches VA chaplains how to respond to and connect
    with veterans.
