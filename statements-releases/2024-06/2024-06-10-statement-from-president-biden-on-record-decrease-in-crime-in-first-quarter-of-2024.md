title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Record Decrease in Crime in First Quarter\
  \ of\_2024"
---
 
Violent crime is dropping at record levels in America. It’s good news
for our families and our communities. Today, the FBI released
preliminary data collected from over 11,000 law enforcement agencies
around the country showing that, in the first quarter of this year,
murders decreased by 26%, robberies by almost 18%, and violent crime
overall by 15%. These large decreases follow major reductions in crime
in nearly every category in 2023 – including one of the lowest rates for
all violent crime in 50 years and significant declines in murder.

This progress we’re seeing is no accident. My Administration is putting
more cops on the beat, holding violent criminals accountable, and
getting illegal guns off the street – and we are doing it in partnership
with communities. As a result, Americans are safer today than when I
took office.

After we saw the largest increase in murders ever recorded during the
previous Administration, my Administration got to work protecting the
American people. My America Rescue Plan – which every Republican voted
against – delivered $15 billion to cities to hire and retain more cops
and keep communities safe. I took on the gun lobby and signed the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law, the most significant gun
violence legislation in nearly 30 years. But there is more to do. I will
continue fighting for funding for 100,000 additional police officers,
and crime prevention and community violence intervention programs. Every
American deserves to feel safe in their community – which is why I will
continue to invest in public safety.
