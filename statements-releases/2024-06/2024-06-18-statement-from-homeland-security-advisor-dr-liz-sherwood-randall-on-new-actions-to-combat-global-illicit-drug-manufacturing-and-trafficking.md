title: "Statement from Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Liz Sherwood Randall on New Actions\
  \ to Combat Global Illicit Drug Manufacturing and\_Trafficking"

In a coordinated action involving the United States, People’s Republic
of China (PRC), and Mexico, the Department of Justice [announced
today](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-indictment-alleges-alliance-between-sinaloa-cartel-and-money-launderers-linked)
the unsealing of indictments against 24 individuals for their role in a
money-laundering scheme on behalf of the deadly Sinaloa cartel.  The PRC
has informed the United States that it has taken into custody and is
pursuing its own charges against one of the charged individuals, and
Mexico has taken into custody another charged individual.  The PRC
actions build on the commitment made between President Biden and
President Xi at the Woodside Summit in November 2023 to resume bilateral
cooperation to combat global illicit drug manufacturing and trafficking,
and the subsequent launch of a U.S.-PRC Counternarcotics Working Group. 
Mexico’s actions reinforce the strong partnership that President Biden
has established with President Lopez Obrador to counter the drug
trafficking organizations that profit off the deadly scourge of illicit
fentanyl.  Another 20 charged individuals have already been arrested in
connection with this case.

Today’s action is another step in the Biden Administration’s continued
work to identify and track down those responsible for and supporting the
trafficking of illicit fentanyl and other deadly drugs.  It is also a
testament to the importance and value of our international partnerships
in dismantling the criminal organizations that support the manufacture,
distribution, and financing of illicit fentanyl and other deadly
synthetic drugs.
