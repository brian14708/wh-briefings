title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces New Actions to Secure the\_Border"
---
 
*New actions will bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully
from receiving asylum*  
  
*Biden taking action as Congressional Republicans put partisan politics
ahead of national security, twice voting against toughest reforms in
decades*

  
Since his first day in office, President Biden has called on Congress to
secure our border and address our broken immigration system. Over the
past three years, while Congress has failed to act, the President has
acted to secure our border. His Administration has deployed the most
agents and officers ever to address the situation at the Southern
border, seized record levels of illicit fentanyl at our ports of entry,
and brought together world leaders on a framework to deal with changing
migration patterns that are impacting the entire Western Hemisphere.   
  
Earlier this year, the President and his team reached a historic
bipartisan agreement with Senate Democrats and Republicans to deliver
the most consequential reforms of America’s immigration laws in decades.
This agreement would have added critical border and immigration
personnel, invested in technology to catch illegal fentanyl, delivered
sweeping reforms to the asylum system, and provided emergency authority
for the President to shut down the border when the system is
overwhelmed. But Republicans in Congress chose to put partisan politics
ahead of our national security, twice voting against the toughest and
fairest set of reforms in decades.  
  
**President Biden believes we must secure our border. That is why today,
he announced executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern
border unlawfully from receiving asylum. These actions will be in effect
when high levels of encounters at the Southern Border exceed our ability
to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today. They will make it
easier for immigration officers to remove those without a lawful basis
to remain and reduce the burden on our Border Patrol agents.**  
  
But we must be clear: this cannot achieve the same results as
Congressional action, and it does not provide the critical personnel and
funding needed to further secure our Southern border. Congress still
must act.  
  
**The Biden-Harris Administration’s executive actions will:  **  
  
**Bar Migrants Who Cross the Southern Border Unlawfully From Receiving
Asylum**

-   President Biden issued a proclamation under Immigration and
    Nationality Act sections 212(f) and 215(a) suspending entry of
    noncitizens who cross the Southern border into the United States
    unlawfully. This proclamation is accompanied by an interim final
    rule from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security that
    restricts asylum for those noncitizens.
-   These actions will be in effect when the Southern border is
    overwhelmed, and they will make it easier for immigration officers
    to quickly remove individuals who do not have a legal basis to
    remain in the United States.
-   These actions are not permanent. They will be discontinued when the
    number of migrants who cross the border between ports of entry is
    low enough for America’s system to safely and effectively manage
    border operations. These actions also include similar humanitarian
    exceptions to those included in the bipartisan border agreement
    announced in the Senate, including those for unaccompanied children
    and victims of trafficking.

**Recent Actions to secure our border and address our broken immigration
system:**  
  
**Strengthening the Asylum Screening Process**

-   The Department of Homeland Security published a proposed rule to
    ensure that migrants who pose a public safety or national security
    risk are removed as quickly in the process as possible rather than
    remaining in prolonged, costly detention prior to removal. This
    proposed rule will enhance security and deliver more timely
    consequences for those who do not have a legal basis to remain in
    the United States.

**Announced new actions to more quickly resolve immigration cases**

-   The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security
    launched a Recent Arrivals docket to more quickly resolve a portion
    of immigration cases for migrants who attempt to cross between ports
    of entry at the Southern border in violation of our immigration
    laws.
-   Through this process, the Department of Justice will be able to hear
    these cases more quickly and the Department of Homeland Security
    will be able to more quickly remove individuals who do not have a
    legal basis to remain in the United States and grant protection to
    those with valid claims.
-   The bipartisan border agreement would have created and supported an
    even more efficient framework for issuing final decisions to all
    asylum seekers. This new process to reform our overwhelmed
    immigration system can only be created and funded by Congress.

**Revoked visas of CEOs and government officials who profit from
migrants coming to the U.S. unlawfully**

-   The Department of State imposed visa restrictions on executives of
    several Colombian transportation companies who profit from smuggling
    migrants by sea. This action cracks down on companies that help
    facilitate unlawful entry into the United States, and sends a clear
    message that no one should profit from the exploitation of
    vulnerable migrants.
-   The State Department also imposed visa restrictions on over 250
    members of the Nicaraguan government, non-governmental actors, and
    their immediate family members for their roles in supporting the
    Ortega-Murillo regime, which is selling transit visas to migrants
    from within and beyond the Western Hemisphere who ultimately make
    their way to the Southern border.
-   Previously, the State Department revoked visas of executives of
    charter airlines for similar actions.

**Expanded Efforts to Dismantle Human Smuggling and Support Immigration
Prosecutions**

-   The Departments of State and Justice launched an “Anti-Smuggling
    Rewards” initiative designed to dismantle the leadership of human
    smuggling organizations that bring migrants through Central America
    and across the Southern U.S. border. The initiative will offer
    financial rewards for information leading to the identification,
    location, arrest, or conviction of those most responsible for
    significant human smuggling activities in the region.
-   The Department of Justice will seek new and increased penalties
    against human smugglers to properly account for the severity of
    their criminal conduct and the human misery that it causes.
-   The Department of Justice is also partnering with the Department of
    Homeland Security to direct additional prosecutors and support staff
    to increase immigration-related prosecutions in crucial border U.S.
    Attorney’s Offices. Efforts include deploying additional DHS Special
    Assistant United States Attorneys to different U.S. Attorneys’
    offices, assigning support staff to critical U.S. Attorneys’
    offices, including DOJ Attorneys to serve details in U.S. Attorneys’
    Offices in several border districts, and partnering with federal
    agencies to identify additional resources to target these crimes.

**Enhancing Immigration Enforcement**

-   The Department of Homeland Security has surged agents to the
    Southern border and is referring a record number of people into
    expedited removal.
-   The Department of Homeland Security is operating more repatriation
    flights per week than ever before. Over the past year, DHS has
    removed or returned more than 750,000 people, more than in every
    fiscal year since 2010.
-   Working closely with partners throughout the region, the
    Biden-Harris Administration is identifying and collaborating on
    enforcement efforts designed to stop irregular migration before
    migrants reach our Southern border, expand investment and
    integration opportunities in the region to support those who may
    otherwise seek to migrate, and increase lawful pathways for migrants
    as an alternative to irregular migration.

**Seizing Fentanyl at our Border**

-   Border officials have seized more fentanyl at ports of entry in the
    last two years than the past five years combined, and the President
    has added 40 drug detection machines across points of entry to
    disrupt the fentanyl smuggling into the Homeland. The bipartisan
    border agreement would fund the installation of 100 additional
    cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our
    Southern border ports of entry.
-   In close partnership with the Government of Mexico, the Department
    of Justice has extradited Nestor Isidro Perez Salaz, known as “El
    Nini,” from Mexico to the United States to face prosecution for his
    role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and human rights abuses. This
    is one of many examples of joint efforts with Mexico to tackle the
    fentanyl and synthetic drug epidemic that is killing so many people
    in our countries and globally, and to hold the drug trafficking
    organizations to account.
