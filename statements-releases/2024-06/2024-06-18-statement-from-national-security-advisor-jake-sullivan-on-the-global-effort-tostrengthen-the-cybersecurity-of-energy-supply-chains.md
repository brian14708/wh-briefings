title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Global Effort\
  \ toStrengthen the Cybersecurity of Energy Supply\_Chains"

Energy systems around the world face continuous cyber attacks and are
vulnerable to disruption.  As new digital clean energy technologies are
integrated, we must ensure they are cyber secure to prevent destruction
or disruption in services.  This is a global issue and at the G7
Leaders’ Summit in Apulia, President Biden and G7 leaders committed to
taking critical action to strengthen the cybersecurity of the global
supply chain of key technologies used to manage and operate electricity,
oil, and natural gas systems across the world.  The G7 will work to
establish a collective cybersecurity framework for operational
technologies for both manufacturers and operators. This builds on the
White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience’s work to strengthen
supply chains critical to America’s economic and national security. It
also builds upon the efforts of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and
Idaho National Laboratory which have brought tremendous expertise to
bear in securing operational technologies to date.

We are pleased that several prominent suppliers and manufacturers
serving the energy sector have already expressed support for a new set
of [Supply Chain Cybersecurity
Principles](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/Final%20Supply%20Chain%20Cybersecurity%20Principles%20061424.pdf)
released today by DOE, including: GE Vernova, Schneider Electric,
Hitachi Energy, Honeywell, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Rockwell
Automation, Siemens and Siemens Energy.
