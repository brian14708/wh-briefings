title: French-American Roadmap
---
 
1.  Following the ceremonies of the 80th anniversary of the Normandy
    landings, the President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron
    hosted the President of the United States Joseph R. Biden Jr. in
    Paris for a State visit, highlighting the deep historic ties and the
    shared values between France and the United States. Reflecting on
    their historical relationship and recalling the price for peace and
    freedom paid by past generations in both countries, the Presidents
    reaffirm their commitment to a Europe, whole, free, and at peace. 

**<u>Ukraine</u>**

1.  The Presidents reaffirm their strong condemnation of Russia’s war
    against Ukraine and reject Russia’s attempted annexation of
    sovereign Ukrainian territory, in clear violation of international
    law, including the United Nations Charter. Russia’s irresponsible
    nuclear rhetoric and disregard of arms control regimes are
    unacceptable. In that context, France and the United States reaffirm
    their continued support for Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and
    territorial integrity, including through the continued provision of
    political, security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to
    Ukraine. The United States and France confirm their support for a
    comprehensive, just, and durable peace, respectful of international
    law, and will continue working with partners and allies to
    coordinate assistance efforts to allow Ukraine to fully exercize its
    right of self-defense, as reflected in Article 51 of the UN
    Charter.  
2.  The Presidents discussed options to do more to support Ukraine;
    Euro-atlantic security as a whole is at stake in this war. France
    and the United States co-chair the artillery coalition at the
    Ukraine Defense Contact Group and intend to take new steps to
    provide the necessary support to Ukraine in the current phase and in
    the longer term.  France and the United States remain determined to
    dispel any false notion that time is on Russia’s side; the
    Presidents commit to support efforts within the European Union and
    by the G7 to bring forward the extraordinary profits from the
    immobilized Russian sovereign assets for the benefit of Ukraine,
    consistent with international law and our respective legal systems
    and decision-making processes.  
3.  The Presidents also expressed strong concern about transfers of
    weapons, especially from Iran and Democratic People’s Republic of
    Korea, and dual-use materials and components for military production
    from businesses in the People’s Republic of China and other
    countries, that Russia is using to rebuild its military and defense
    industrial base to pursue its war against Ukraine. The United States
    and France support actions to curtail access to the U.S. and French
    financial systems for those who engage in such transfers. France and
    the United States share a common commitment to support the
    Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s work to
    spotlight and document abuses of human rights and violations of
    international humanitarian law by Russia’s forces.   
4.  The United States and France remain committed to mitigating the
    tragic humanitarian and human rights consequences of the war as well
    as its effects on global food security, energy, nuclear safety and
    security, and the environment.

    their commitments as NATO Allies. France and the United States are
    strengthening their collective defense, based on a 360-degree
    approach, against all threats and from all directions. The leaders
    reaffirmed the importance of strengthening the NATO-EU strategic
    partnership and promoting a stronger and more capable European
    defense underpinning the European pillar of transatlantic security
    that contributes positively to collective security. The United
    States supports European Allies’ and partners’ growing investments
    in military capabilities that enable our shared defense, in
    complementarity with NATO.

**<u>Moldova, Western Balkans, and South Caucasus</u>**

1.  France and the United States intend to continue to work with Moldova
    and other partners to strengthen Moldova’s resilience to Russia’s
    destabilization attempts, diversify its energy supply, and fortify
    its democratic institutions and human rights protections, to advance
    its European integration.  
2.  France and the United States welcomed continued close cooperation on
    the integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union in
    order to increase prosperity and fortify democratic governance and
    the rule of law.  They welcome the opportunity to strengthen joint
    engagement in the Western Balkans, including through cooperation
    between the European Union (EU) and NATO, the EU-facilitated
    dialogue on the normalization of relations between Kosovo and
    Serbia, and by supporting key reforms for EU integration.  As
    witness of the Dayton-Paris Agreements, France and United States
    reaffirm their  support for the Office of the High Representative
    and will continue to firmly protect Bosnia and Herzegovina’s
    sovereignty, territorial integrity, and multiethnic character.  They
    call on leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina to reject the path of
    division and secession and instead work together to make the reforms
    needed to join the EU.  They urge the new government in North
    Macedonia to stay focused on the EU path and abide by their
    international commitments.    
3.  The United States and France affirm their commitment to standing
    with the people of Georgia in their Euro-Atlantic aspirations.  The
    Presidents urge the Georgian Dream ruling party to respect the
    public’s wishes by returning to the Euro-Atlantic path.  The United
    States and France support the establishment of a fair and lasting
    peace in the South Caucasus, based on the respect of international
    law as well as the principles of sovereignty, inviolability of
    borders and territorial integrity. They support further regional
    integration in the South Caucasus for the benefit of all the
    region’s people.

**Middle East**

1.  In the Middle East, France and the United States are committed to
    pursue their joint efforts to de-escalate and avoid regional
    conflagration.  
2.  France and the United States call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza
    and reiterate that all hostages are to be released immediately,
    without preconditions. The Presidents reiterate their grave concern
    for the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and call for the delivery
    of vital humanitarian aid at scale to the civilian population and
    unhindered and sustained humanitarian access through all routes into
    and inside Gaza. They also reiterate the need for Israel to do more
    to effectively protect Palestinian civilians and humanitarian
    workers. They reaffirm their commitment to a two-state solution, the
    only way to ensure lasting peace between Israelis and
    Palestinians.  
3.  They particularly underline the utmost importance of preserving the
    stability of Lebanon and de-escalation on the Blue Line, and will
    work together to reach this goal. Both countries call on all parties
    to exert maximum restraint and responsibility consistent with
    UNSCR1701. In this context, France and the United States underline
    the urgency to bring an end to Lebanon’s 18-month long presidential
    vacuum and to proceed without further delay with the election of a
    president, the formation of a government, and the implementation of
    the reforms necessary to stabilize the Lebanese economy and lay the
    foundations for recovery and sustainable inclusive growth.  
4.  They reaffirmed their determination to increase pressure on Iran to
    curb its destabilizing regional activities, nuclear escalation and
    missile proliferation, halt its support to Russia’s war of
    aggression against Ukraine, secure its full cooperation with the
    International Atomic Energy Agency, and pave the way for a future
    negotiated solution that ensures its nuclear program is exclusively
    peaceful. They stand ready to adopt further sanctions and take other
    measures to counter Iranian destabilising activities and to prevent
    transfers of Iranian missiles to Russia. They also reiterate deep
    concern over Iran’s human rights violations and abuses, especially
    against women, girls, and minority groups. We call on Iran’s
    leadership to end all arbitrary detentions.

    member of the G20 and will work with African countries to ensure
    they are fully represented in international institutions.  They
    support African partners and regional organizations in their efforts
    to bring peace, stability and good governance to the region, while
    investing in inclusive and sustainable development, human capital,
    and infrastructure as a key driver of economic growth.  
2.  The United States and France are also deeply concerned by the
    deterioration of the governance, security, and humanitarian
    situation in Sudan, the Sahel, Great Lakes, and other crises. They
    strongly condemn ongoing human rights violations committed by
    multiple parties including Russian proxies as well as national armed
    forces,  the shrinking of democratic space and rise in
    disinformation. France and the United States call on all
    belligerents in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to
    immediately cease hostilities, for Rwanda to withdraw and stop
    supporting M23, for DRC to stop any collaboration with FDLR and
    other armed groups, and for all actors to respect international
    humanitarian law. The Presidents continue to be supportive of
    regional diplomatic efforts and commend in particular the mediation
    led by the President of Angola, and call on all parties to
    de-escalate, protect civilian populations, and participate
    constructively in dialogue to create conditions for a negotiated
    solution leading to a lasting peace.  The Presidents commit to
    consulting on their respective approaches in Western Africa,
    including in the Sahel. The United States and France are committed
    to advancing mediation efforts to find a political solution to the
    Sudan crisis as well as to support increased, sustained and vital
    humanitarian assistance to the Sudanese population.
