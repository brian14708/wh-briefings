President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ahead of
NATO’s 75th Anniversary Summit in Washington, DC next month, which the
President will host.  The President welcomed steps NATO Allies are
taking to support Ukraine and to deepen partnerships, including in the
Indo-Pacific.  President Biden and Secretary General Stoltenberg also
discussed significant progress on defense spending, including that a
record 23 Allies will reach NATO’s two percent spending threshold, a
more than two-fold increase since President Biden took office.
