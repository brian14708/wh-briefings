title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on James\_Lawson"
---
 
Born in Pennsylvania, the cradle of our democracy, James Lawson
dedicated his life to fighting for our country’s ideals. Hailing from a
family of ministers, he became a disciple for freedom and a visionary of
the Civil Rights Movement.  
  
While attending Vanderbilt Divinity School, James Lawson organized
sit-ins in Nashville, Tennessee that led to his expulsion from the
university. But he kept marching on. His organizing and civil rights
activism led to the desegregation of public accommodations in Nashville,
one of the first southern cities to do so. His sit-ins became a model
throughout the south.   
  
As a mentor, he taught the likes of Diane Nash, Congressman John Lewis,
and countless others about the tactics and promise of nonviolence
resistance. And as a minister, he preached about how the fight for
equality, dignity, and justice for all was a divine calling. It is only
fitting that Vanderbilt University now boasts the James Lawson Institute
in honor of a man who was the architect of the Southern Freedom Movement
and, later in life, a consistent advocate for human rights.  
  
Jill and I are saddened by the loss of one of our nation’s noblest
leaders. His passing before Juneteenth is a reminder that our nation’s
journey from slavery to freedom started in the hearts of people like
James Lawson spellbound by freedom. We send our condolences to the
Lawson family as our nation mourns a man who helped redeem the soul of
our nation.
