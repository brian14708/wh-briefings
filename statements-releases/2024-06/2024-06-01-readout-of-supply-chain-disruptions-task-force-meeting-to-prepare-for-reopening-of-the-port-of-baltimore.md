title: "Readout of Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force Meeting to Prepare for Reopening\
  \ of the Port of\_Baltimore"
---
 
On Thursday, the National Economic Council convened a meeting of the
Biden-Harris Administration Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to
discuss the reopening of the Port of Baltimore and identify steps the
federal government can take to support the full return of cargo and
cruise traffic to the Port of Baltimore. This meeting followed the
[President’s
meeting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/29/readout-of-president-bidens-meeting-on-federal-and-state-response-to-the-francis-scott-key-bridge-collapse-in-baltimore/)
with Maryland Governor Wes Moore and leaders of the Unified Command on
Tuesday.

The Task Force, [launched in

to monitor and address near-term supply chain challenges, consists of
supply chain experts across the Administration who bring the full
capacity of the federal government to assess potential supply
constraints and bottlenecks, engage stakeholders, and prepare response
and mitigation efforts. The Task Force met

[times](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/29/readout-of-latest-supply-chain-disruptions-task-force-meeting/)
after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and partial closure
of the Port of Baltimore to coordinate the Administration’s response to
supply chain impacts.

In the immediate aftermath of the bridge’s collapse, the Administration
worked with businesses large and small that rallied to make clear that
they would stick with the Port of Baltimore and its workers through this
temporary disruption. This included shippers and ocean carriers that
temporarily diverted cargo to alternative ports in order to mitigate
impacts of the disruption on American consumers. Now, the Unified
Command, the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of
Transportation, and state and local officials are working to support the
full return of cargo and cruise traffic to the Port of Baltimore. Last
weekend, two cruise ships docked in Baltimore and the first container
ship since the collapse is expected to arrive the first week of June.

As companies honor their commitments to return shipping volumes to the
Port of Baltimore, the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force is working
proactively to enable a smooth return to full operations. During
yesterday’s meeting, agencies shared plans to engage shippers,
businesses, and ocean carriers across all sectors to surface any
logistical or operational challenges they are facing as operations ramp
back up. Department of Agriculture officials discussed ongoing
coordination with food and agricultural producers as shipping schedules
and routes shift back to Baltimore. Department of Transportation
officials discussed their close collaboration with port operators,
truckers, and local Baltimore officials to ensure that the Port and the
surrounding Baltimore area is prepared to absorb increased traffic and
shipping activity. Department of Commerce officials discussed their
ongoing work to assist retailers and other companies in minimizing
supply chain disruptions and resuming use of the port. All agencies
committed to engage proactively with stakeholders over the next few
weeks to quickly identify and address bottlenecks.

-   The White House
-   Department of Agriculture
-   Department of Commerce
-   Department of Energy
-   Department of Health and Human Services
-   Department of Homeland Security
