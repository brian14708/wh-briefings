title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Supreme Court Ruling in\
  \ Loper\_Bright"

People throughout our Nation should be able to count on their government
to ensure that our air and water are clean, health care is accessible
and affordable, financial markets are sound, products are safe, and
workers are not exploited on the job. Courts have long deferred to
federal experts to make these ideals a reality.   
   
Unfortunately, today’s Supreme Court decision sides with powerful
special interests who want to roll back commonsense rules that protect
Americans. President Biden and I will continue to do everything in our
power to protect the American people and ensure that every person in our
country can thrive.
