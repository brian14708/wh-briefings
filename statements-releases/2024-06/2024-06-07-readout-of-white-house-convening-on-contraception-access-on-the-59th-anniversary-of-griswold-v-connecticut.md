title: "Readout of White\_House Convening on Contraception Access on the 59th Anniversary\
  \ of Griswold v.\_Connecticut"
---
 
Today, to mark the 59th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s landmark
decision in *Griswold v. Connecticut*—which  found that the
constitutional right to privacy protects access to
contraception—Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of
the White House Gender Policy Council, and Erica Songer, Deputy
Assistant to the President and Counsel to the Vice President, convened
women’s community leaders, health care advocates, and reproductive
rights advocates to highlight the Biden-Harris Administration’s [strong
record](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/22/fact-sheet-white-house-task-force-on-reproductive-healthcare-access-announces-new-actions-and-marks-the-51st-anniversary-of-roe-v-wade/)
of strengthening access to affordable, high-quality contraception, an
essential part of reproductive health care. They were joined by Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure,
Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Health
Admiral Rachel Levine, and Principal Deputy Director of the Department
of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights Jenny Ma.

Contraception has come under attack by Republican elected officials
following the Supreme Court’s devastating decision to overturn *Roe v.
Wade*. Just earlier this week, Senate Republicans
[refused](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/05/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-senate-republicans-blocking-efforts-to-safeguard-nationwide-access-to-contraception/)
to support legislation to protect a woman’s fundamental right to
contraception in every state. As part of its work to continue to protect
access to reproductive care, including contraception, the Biden-Harris
Administration reversed the prior Administration’s restrictions on the
Title X Family Planning Program and called on Congress to increase Title
X funding to support family planning providers, expanded contraception
access for veterans and service members, and improved insurance coverage
for those covered under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and the
Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. As part of these continued
efforts, Administrator Brooks-LaSure announced a [new funding
opportunity](https://www.grants.gov./search-results-detail/354660) of
more than $11 million to support states in enhancing and expanding
access to reproductive and maternal health coverage and services—with an
emphasis on contraception and family planning services.

Participants discussed how the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn *Roe
v. Wade* has paved the way for attacks on reproductive care, including
abortion, IVF, and contraception. Participants also highlighted
opportunities for continued federal and state action to address gaps in
access, close health disparities, and partner with the private sector.
Many also underscored the importance of access to Opill, the first daily
oral contraceptive approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
over-the-counter use, that became available earlier this year.

Speakers at the convening included:

-   Jamie Hart, Coalition to Expand Contraceptive Access
-   Megan Kavanaugh, Guttmacher Institute
-   Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, Power to Decide
-   Joy McGlaun, CVS Health
