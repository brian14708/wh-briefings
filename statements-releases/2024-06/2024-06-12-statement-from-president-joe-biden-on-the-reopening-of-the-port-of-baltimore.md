title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Reopening of the Port of\_Baltimore"
---
 
I made clear that my Administration would move heaven and earth to
reopen the Port of Baltimore – one of our nation’s largest shipping
hubs. Today, thanks to the tireless work by the men and women in the
Unified Command, the full navigation channel is now open to all vessel
traffic, allowing a full return of commerce to the Port of Baltimore.

Within minutes of the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the U.S.
Coast Guard arrived on the scene. They established a Unified Command the
same day to support rescue and recovery operations, and worked with the
Army Corps of Engineers around the clock to remove the wreckage from the
channel.  My Departments of Transportation and Labor and the Small
Business Administration worked hand-in-hand with federal and state
partners to limit supply chain impacts and keep costs down for
Americans, and to support impacted workers and small businesses. I want
to thank Governor Moore for his steadfast leadership, Mayor Scott,
County Executive Olszewski, and the Maryland congressional delegation.
The partnership between federal, state, and local governments, labor
leaders like the longshoremen who keep this hub running, and the
business community shows what we can get done when we work together.

Our hearts remain with the families of the victims of the bridge
collapse, and we will continue to stand with the community throughout
this period of recovery. Thank you to the people of Baltimore for
showing us what it means to be Maryland tough and Baltimore strong. 
Baltimore can count on us to stick with them every step of the way, and
we will continue to have your back until the bridge is rebuilt.
