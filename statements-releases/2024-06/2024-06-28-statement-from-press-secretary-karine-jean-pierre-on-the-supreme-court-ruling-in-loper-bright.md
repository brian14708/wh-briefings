title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Supreme Court Ruling\
  \ in Loper\_Bright"

The Supreme Court’s ruling in *Loper Bright Enterprises* *v. Raimondo*
is yet another deeply troubling decision that takes our country
backwards. Republican-backed special interests have repeatedly turned to
the Supreme Court to block common-sense rules that keep us safe, protect
our health and environment, safeguard our financial system, and support
American consumers and workers. And once again, the Supreme Court has
decided in the favor of special interests, just as it did when they
sought to gut long-standing protections for clean water, thwart efforts
to respond to a global pandemic, and block the cancelation of crippling
student debt for tens of millions of Americans.

While this decision undermines the ability of federal agencies to use
their expertise as Congress intended to make government work for the
people, the Biden-Harris Administration will not relent in our efforts
to protect and serve every American. The President has directed his
legal team to work with the Department of Justice and other agency
counsel to review today’s decision carefully and ensure that our
Administration is doing everything we can to continue to deploy the
extraordinary expertise of the federal workforce to keep Americans safe
and ensure communities thrive and prosper.
