title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Senate Republicans\u2019 Second Time\
  \ Blocking Nationwide Protections for\_IVF"
---
 
Once again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility
treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant. And
just last week, Senate Republicans blocked nationwide protections for
birth control. The disregard for a woman’s right to make these decisions
for herself and her family is outrageous and unacceptable.  
   
Republican officials have had every opportunity to protect reproductive
freedom since the Supreme Court’s extreme decision to overturn *Roe v.
Wade*, but they refuse to do so. Instead, Republicans’ dangerous,
out-of-touch agenda is devastating women’s health and lives.  
   
Vice President Harris and I believe that every woman should have the
right to access the care they need, including fertility treatment,
without interference from politicians. This is a basic issue of
reproductive freedom, and we will continue fighting, alongside Democrats
in Congress, until we restore the protections of *Roe v. Wade* in
federal law for all women in every state.
