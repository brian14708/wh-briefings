President Biden spoke today with Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani of
Qatar.  They confirmed that the comprehensive ceasefire and hostage
release deal now on the table offers a concrete roadmap for ending the
crisis in Gaza.  The President confirmed Israel’s readiness to move
forward with the terms that have now been offered to Hamas.  The
President emphasized that this is the best possible opportunity for an
agreement, and that Hamas’ ongoing refusal to release hostages would
only prolong the conflict and deny relief to the people of Gaza.  The
President confirmed that the United States, together with Egypt and
Qatar, would work to ensure the full implementation of the entire
agreement.  He urged Amir Tamim to use all appropriate measures to
secure Hamas’ acceptance of the deal and affirmed that Hamas is now the
only obstacle to a complete ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza.
 The President thanked the Amir and his senior team for their tireless
efforts to secure the release of all hostages held in Gaza and agreed to
remain closely coordinated over the coming days.
