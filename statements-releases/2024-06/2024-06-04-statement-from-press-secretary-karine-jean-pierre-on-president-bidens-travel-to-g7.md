President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will attend the G7 Leaders’ Summit in
Apulia, Italy on June 13-14. The President and G7 leaders will discuss a
range of the most pressing global issues, including the G7’s unwavering
support for Ukraine.  Leaders will advance efforts to make use of
Russia’s immobilized sovereign assets to help Ukraine as well as actions
to continue imposing costs on Russia and those who support Russia’s war
effort. G7 leaders will take steps to promote economic security and
resilience, including by addressing harmful overcapacity. The President
and G7 leaders will also redouble commitments to support developing
countries seeking to make investments in their future and to help
strengthen food security and health financing.
