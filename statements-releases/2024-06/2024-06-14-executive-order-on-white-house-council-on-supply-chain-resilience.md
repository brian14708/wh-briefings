title: "Executive Order on White\_House Council on Supply Chain\_Resilience"
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows: 

     Section 1.  Policy.  As described in Executive Order 14017 of
February 24, 2021 (America’s Supply Chains), it is the policy of my
Administration to strengthen the enduring resilience of America’s supply
chains.  The United States needs resilient, diverse, and secure supply
chains to ensure our economic prosperity, public health, and national
security.  Pandemics and other biological threats, cyber attacks,
climate stressors and extreme weather events, transnational corruption,
terrorist attacks, geopolitical disputes, unfair economic competition,
and other disruptive conditions can reduce critical infrastructure,
manufacturing, and processing capacity and the availability of critical
goods, materials, and services.  Building resilient American supply
chains will necessitate enhancing domestic manufacturing capacity,
supporting America’s competitive edge in research and development,
encouraging innovation, reinforcing critical infrastructure, and
creating well-paying jobs.  Building resilient American supply chains
will also provide a foundation to strengthen prosperity, advance the
fight against climate change, enhance national emergency preparedness,
and encourage economic growth across the Nation.    
     More resilient supply chains are secure and diverse. 
Characteristics of resilient supply chains include greater domestic
production; a diverse and agile supplier base; built-in redundancies; a
reliable transportation system; secure critical infrastructure; adequate
stockpiles; safe and secure data networks; reliable food systems; and a
world-class, globally competitive American manufacturing base and
workforce.  Close cooperation on building global supply chain resilience
with allies and partners who share our values will foster collective
economic and national security, encourage innovation, and strengthen the
capacity to respond to and recover from international disasters and
emergencies.

     Sec. 2.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:  
     (a)  “Agency” has the meaning given to that term in Executive Order
14017.  
     (b)  “Critical goods and materials” has the meaning given to that
term in Executive Order 14017.  
     (c)  “Other essential goods, materials, and services” means goods,
materials, and services that are essential to national and economic
security, emergency preparedness, or to advance the policy set forth in
section 1 of this order, but not included within the definition of
“critical goods and materials.”  
     (d)  “Critical infrastructure” means assets, systems, and networks,
whether physical or virtual, that are so vital to the United States that
their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on
national security, economic security, national public health or safety,
or any combination thereof.

     Sec. 3.  Coordination.  (a)  This order supplements and reaffirms
the principles governing America’s supply chains established in
Executive Order 14017.  Any provisions of Executive Order 14017 not
amended in this order shall remain in effect.   
     (b)  Notwithstanding section 2 of Executive Order 14017, the
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA) and the
Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (APEP) shall coordinate,
as appropriate, the executive branch actions necessary to implement this
order through the White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience
(Council) established on November 27, 2023, and further described in
section 4 of this order.  In coordinating the work of the Council on
issues related to national security, and on other issues as they deem
appropriate, the APNSA and the APEP shall work with the Council in
conformance with the interagency process identified in National Security
Memorandum 2 of February 4, 2021 (Renewing the National Security Council
System).

an individual basis to help accomplish the policy objectives identified
in section 1 of this order and in section 1 of Executive Order 14017. 
Any member of the Council that receives a recommendation from a Federal
Advisory Committee, as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 1001(2),

timeliness of the associated data.  At the conclusion of each review,
the Council shall submit a report to the President, with the first
report submitted no later than December 31, 2024, and subsequent reports
submitted every 4 years thereafter.  Where practicable and as
appropriate, the report shall make recommendations concerning:  
          (i)    Federal incentives and any potential amendments to
Federal procurement regulations that may be necessary to attract and
retain private sector investments in the supply chains for critical
goods and materials and other essential goods, materials, and services
as defined in section 2 of this order, including any new programs that
could encourage both domestic and foreign investment in the supply
chains for critical goods and materials and other essential goods,
materials, and services;  
          (ii)   a strategic plan that includes diplomatic, economic,
security, international development, trade, and other policy actions to
guide United States engagement with allies and partners, including
through regional economic frameworks or partnerships supported by the
United States, to strengthen global supply chain resilience in critical
sectors;  
          (iii)  actions for the insulation of Federal supply chain
analyses and actions from conflicts of interest, corruption, or the
appearance of impropriety to ensure continued integrity and public
confidence in supply chain analyses and actions;  
          (iv)   potential legislative changes that would promote the
policy objectives set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 14017 and in
section 1 of this order;  
          (v)    reforms to domestic and international trade rules and
agreements that could be pursued to support supply chain resilience,
security, diversity, sustainability, and strength;  
          (vi)   education and workforce reforms needed to strengthen
the domestic industrial base for critical goods and materials and other
essential goods, materials, and services; and  
          (vii)  steps to ensure that the Federal Government’s supply
chain policies support small businesses and family-owned small- and
mid-sized farming operations, prevent monopolization, strengthen
critical infrastructure, empower workers to advocate for their rights
and quality jobs, consider climate and other health and environmental
effects, encourage economic growth in underserved communities and
economically distressed areas, and promote the geographic dispersal of
economic activity across all regions of the United States.  
     (f)  Subsection (e) of this section supersedes section 5(c) of
Executive Order 14017.  
     (g)  Each member of the Council shall designate, within 30 days of
the date of this order, a senior official within their respective agency
or office who shall coordinate with the Council and who shall be
