title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on a Record 18 Million Small Business\_\
  Applications"
---
 
Today, my Administration announced over 18 million new business
applications since I took office, each one an act of hope and
confidence. We’ve had the three strongest years for new businesses on
record and the small business boom that has powered our economic
comeback continues. Since the pandemic, Black business ownership has
more than doubled, Hispanic business ownership is up 40 percent, and
women own a record share of businesses.

This didn’t happen by accident. My Administration is supporting this
unprecedented wave of entrepreneurship with historic investments in
small businesses and communities across the country. Every Republican in
Congress voted against vital American Rescue Plan relief that helped
100,000 restaurants and bars and 225,000 child care programs stay open,
and a State Small Business Credit Initiative that is helping businesses
launch across the country. And the Congressional Republican agenda would
undercut small businesses by repealing our investments in infrastructure
and manufacturing, slashing Small Business Administration funding by
almost a third, and putting big corporations and billionaires first by
cutting their taxes and protecting their loopholes. I’m fighting for
Scranton and main street—not Park Avenue and Wall Street.
