title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Senate Republicans Blocking Efforts\
  \ to Safeguard Nationwide Access to Contraception"
---
 
Senate Republicans just refused to protect a woman’s right to birth
control. This is the second time since the Supreme Court’s extreme
decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade* that Congressional Republicans have
refused to safeguard this fundamental right for women in every state.
It’s unacceptable.

Today’s vote comes two days before the 59th anniversary of the Supreme
Court’s landmark decision in *Griswold v. Connecticut*, which
established that the fundamental right to privacy protects the ability
to make deeply personal decisions free from the interference of
politicians, including to access contraception. Two years ago, the Court
put that right in jeopardy by overturning *Roe v. Wade* and taking away
a woman’s constitutional right to choose.

Since then, Republicans have doubled down. Republican elected officials’
extreme agenda—which is at odds with the majority of Americans—continues
to undermine access to reproductive health care, from abortion to
contraception to in vitro fertilization. Dangerous abortion bans are
forcing health care providers to close, disrupting access to critical
health care services. Republican officials continue to try to restrict
access to birth control and to defund federal programs that help women
access contraception.

Vice President Harris and I believe that women in every state must have
the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the
right to decide if and when to start or grow their family. My
Administration alongside Democrats in Congress will continue to fight to
protect access to reproductive health care and keep taking action to
strengthen access to affordable, high-quality contraception. And we will
continue to urge Congress to restore the protections of *Roe v. Wade* in
federal law and safeguard the right to contraception once and for all.
