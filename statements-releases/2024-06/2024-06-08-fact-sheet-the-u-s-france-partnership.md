---
 
On the occasion of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s visit to France to
commemorate the 80<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the D-Day landings in
Normandy and the State Visit hosted by President Emmanuel Macron of
France, the United States is taking steps to deepen our relationship
with France. As America’s oldest Ally – for nearly 250 years – France
has been a likeminded and dependable partner in all of the world’s
greatest challenges. In December 2022, President Biden hosted President
Macron at the White House for the first State Visit of the Biden-Harris
Administration. Since then, U.S. and French counterparts have continued
to work closely to advance both Presidents’ vision to strengthen
security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build
greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values. Today,
President Biden and President Macron will meet in Paris, at the Elysée
Palace, to discuss and deepen U.S.-France cooperation across a broad
range of regional and thematic topics.  
  
Since the December 2022 State Visit in Washington, D.C., the United
States and France have announced many new and continuing initiatives,
some of which are listed here.
