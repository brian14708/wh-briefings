I congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum on her historic election as the first
woman President of Mexico.  I look forward to working closely with
President-elect Sheinbaum in the spirit of partnership and friendship
that reflects the enduring bonds between our two countries.  I express
our commitment to advancing the values and interests of both our nations
to the benefit of our peoples.  I also congratulate the Mexican people
for conducting a nationwide successful democratic electoral process
involving races for more than 20,000 positions at the local, state, and
federal levels.
