Yesterday, the Office of Public Engagement and the Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs convened a roundtable with 20 Latino venture
and business leaders to highlight the Biden-Harris Administration’s
investments in the Latino community and how President Biden’s economic
agenda is expanding access to capital for Latinos.  Latino entrepreneurs
are a critical driver of the small business boom taking place under
President Biden, with Latino business ownership up 40% compared to
before the pandemic.

During the convening, participants discussed the Administration’s direct
investments in Latino communities and provided recommendations on how to
scale efforts to increase access to capital. Administration officials
highlighted investments to grow the economy from the middle out by
supporting minority business owners and fund managers, and discussed
ways to increase direct investment for Latino entrepreneurs, including
programs like the SBA’s [Growth Accelerator Fund
