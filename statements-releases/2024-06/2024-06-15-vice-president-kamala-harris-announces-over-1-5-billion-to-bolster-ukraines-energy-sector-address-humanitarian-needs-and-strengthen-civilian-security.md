  s Energy Sector, Address Humanitarian Needs, and Strengthen Civilian\_Security"
---
 
Today, as part of the Summit for Peace in Ukraine and her sixth meeting
with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Vice President Kamala
Harris is announcing that the United States will provide over $1.5
billion through USAID and the State Department to support the people of
Ukraine.  
  
From USAID, this includes $500 million in new funding for energy
assistance and redirecting $324 million in previously announced funds
towards emergency energy needs in Ukraine. This funding will repair
energy infrastructure damaged in the war, expand power generation,
encourage private sector investment, and protect energy infrastructure.
These efforts will help Ukraine respond to Russia’s latest attacks on
Ukraine energy infrastructure by supporting repair and recovery,
improving Ukraine’s resilience to energy supply disruptions, and laying
the groundwork to repair and expand Ukraine’s energy system.  
   
Additionally, the Vice President is announcing more than $379 million in
humanitarian assistance from State and USAID to help address urgent
needs of refugees, internally displaced persons, and conflict-affected
communities impacted by Russia’s brutal war against the Ukrainian
people. This support entails food assistance, health services, shelter,
and water, sanitation, and hygiene services for millions of vulnerable
Ukrainians inside the country and in the region. The assistance also
includes support for comprehensive protection activities, including case
management and psychosocial support services, as well as agriculture and
livelihoods assistance to enable families to restore income and meet
their basic needs.   
   
Vice President Harris is also announcing that, working with Congress,
the State Department plans to provide an additional $300 million in
Ukrainian civilian security assistance to support lifesaving equipment
for Ukrainian border guards and law enforcement. This support will help
them safely operate on the front lines of the war to defend Ukraine’s
territory, rescue civilians targeted by the Kremlin’s attacks, protect
critical infrastructure, and investigate the over 120,000 registered
cases of war crimes and other atrocities.  
   
These funds come as part of a larger foreign aid package spearheaded by
President Biden to support the people of Ukraine as the Russian
Federation continues its attacks against civilians and critical
infrastructure that have killed nearly 11,000 people and displaced
millions more, cutting them off from electricity, heat, water, and other
essential utilities. Despite this, Ukrainians persist in pushing back
against Putin’s brutal invasion both on and off the battlefield.   
   
Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the
United States has devoted more than $3.2 billion in humanitarian
assistance funding and nearly $1.5 billion to help the recovery of the
energy sector, enable clean and reliable energy, and strengthen
transparency in the sector.
