Consultative Group (SCG) with Israeli counterparts today by secure video

were represented by experts and senior officials from across their
respective inter-agencies.  The two sides over the course of two hours
had a constructive engagement on Rafah.  They agreed that they share the
objective to see Hamas defeated in Rafah. The U.S. side expressed its
concerns with various courses of action in Rafah.  The Israeli side
agreed to take these concerns into account and to have follow up

discussions would include in person SCG meeting as early as next week.
