title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Rules to Deliver Automatic\
  \ Refunds and Protect Consumers from Surprise Junk Fees in Air\_Travel"
---
 
*Newly finalized rules will mandate automatic, cash refunds for
cancelled or significantly delayed flights and save consumers over half
a billion dollars every year in airline fees*

  
WASHINGTON – Building on a historic record of expanding consumer
protections and standing up for airline passengers, the Biden-Harris
Administration announced final rules that require airlines to provide
automatic cash refunds to passengers when owed and protect consumers
from costly surprise airline fees. These rules will significantly expand
consumer protections in air travel, provide passengers an easier pathway
to refunds when owed, and save consumers over half a billion dollars
every year in hidden and surprise junk fees.  
   
The rules are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to lower
costs for consumers and take on corporate rip-offs. President Biden
signed an [Executive Order on Promoting
Competition](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/)
in 2021 that encouraged DOT to take steps to promote fairer, more
transparent, and competitive markets.  
   
**<u>Requiring Automatic Cash Airline Refunds</u>**  
**The first rule requires airlines to promptly provide passengers with
automatic cash refunds when owed because their flights are cancelled or
significantly changed, their checked bags are significantly delayed, or
the ancillary services, like Wi-Fi, they purchased are not provided.**  
   
Without this rule, consumers have to navigate a patchwork of cumbersome
processes to request and receive a refund — searching through airline
websites to figure out how to make the request, filling out extra
“digital paperwork,” or at times waiting for hours on the phone.
Passengers would also receive a travel credit or voucher by default from
many airlines instead of getting their money back, so they could not use
their refund to rebook on another airline when their flight was changed
or cancelled without navigating a cumbersome request process.  
   
DOT’s rule makes it simple and straightforward for passengers to receive
the money they are owed. The final rule requires refunds to be:

-   **Automatic:** Airlines must automatically issue refunds without
    passengers having to explicitly request them or jump through hoops.
-   **Prompt:** Airlines and ticket agents must promptly issue refunds
    within seven business days of refunds becoming due for credit card
    purchases and 20 calendar days for other payment methods.
-   **Cash or original form of payment:** Airlines and ticket agents
    must provide refunds in cash or whatever original payment method the
    individual used to make the purchase, such as credit card or airline
    miles. Airlines may not substitute vouchers, travel credits, or
    other forms of compensation unless the passenger affirmatively
    chooses to accept alternative compensation.
-   **Full amount:** Airlines and ticket agents must provide full
    refunds of the ticket purchase price, minus the value of any portion
    of transportation already used. The refunds must include all
    government-imposed taxes and fees and airline-imposed fees.

**<u>Protecting Against Surprise Airline Junk Fees</u>**  
**Secondly, DOT is requiring airlines and ticket agents to tell
consumers upfront what fees they charge for checked bags, a carry-on
bag, for changing a reservation, or cancelling a reservation. This
ensures that consumers can avoid surprise fees when they purchase
tickets from airlines or ticket agents, including both brick-and-mortar
travel agencies or online travel agencies.**  
  
The rule will help consumers avoid unneeded or unexpected charges that
can increase quickly and add significant cost to what may, at first,
look like a cheap ticket. Extra fees, like checked baggage and change
fees, have been a growing source of revenue for airlines, while also
becoming more complex and confusing for passengers over time. In total,
thanks to the final rule, consumers are expected to save over half a
billion dollars every year that they are currently overpaying in airline
fees.  
  
DOT’s rule ensures that consumers have the information they need to
better understand the true costs of air travel. Under the final rule,
airlines are required to:

-   **Disclose baggage, change, and cancellation** **fees upfront**:
    Each fee must be disclosed the first time that fare and schedule
    information is provided on the airline’s online platform — and
    cannot be displayed through a hyperlink.
-   **Explain fee policies before ticket purchase:** For each type of
    baggage, airlines and ticket agents must spell out the weight and
    dimension limitations that they impose. They must also describe any
    prohibitions or restrictions on changing or cancelling a flight,
    along with policies related to differences in fare when switching to
    a more or less expensive flight.  
-   **Share fee information with third parties**: An airline must
    provide useable, current, and accurate information regarding its
    baggage, change, and cancellation fees and policies to any company
    that is required to disclose them to consumers and receives fare,
    schedule, and availability information from that airline.
-   **Inform consumers that seats are guaranteed:** When offering an
    advance seat assignment for a fee, airlines and ticket agents must
    let consumers know that purchasing a seat is not necessary to
    travel, so consumers can avoid paying unwanted seat selection fees.
-   **Provide both standard and passenger-specific fee information:**
     Consumers can choose to view passenger-specific fee information
    based on their participation in the airline’s rewards program, their
    military status, or the credit card that they use — or they can
    decide to stay anonymous and get the standard fee information.
-   **End discount bait-and-switch tactics:** The final rule puts an end
    to the bait-and-switch tactics some airlines use to disguise the
    true cost of discounted flights. It prohibits airlines from
    advertising a promotional discount off a low base fare that does not
    include all mandatory carrier-imposed fees.

**<u>DOT’s Historic Record of Consumer Protection Under the Biden-Harris
Administration</u>**  
Both of these actions were suggested for consideration by the DOT in the
Executive Order on Promoting Competition and build on historic steps the
Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to expand consumer
protections, promote competition, and protect air travelers. Under the
Biden-Harris Administration, DOT has advanced the largest expansion of
airline passenger rights, issued the biggest fines against airlines for
failing consumers, and returned more money to passengers in refunds and
reimbursements than ever before in the Department’s history.

-   DOT launched the [flightrights.gov](http://flightrights.gov/)
    dashboard, and now all 10 major U.S. airlines guarantee free
    rebooking and meals, and nine guarantee hotel accommodations when an
    airline issue causes a significant delay or cancellation. These are
    new commitments the airlines added to their customer service plans
    that DOT can legally ensure they adhere to and are displayed on
    flightrights.gov.
-   Since President Biden took office, DOT has helped return more than
    $3 billion in refunds and reimbursements owed to airline passengers
    – including over $600 million to passengers affected by the
    Southwest Airlines holiday meltdown in 2022.
-   DOT has issued over $164 million in penalties against airlines for
    consumer protection violations. Between 1996 and 2020, DOT
    collectively issued less than $71 million in penalties against
    airlines for consumer protection violations.
-   DOT recently launched a new
    [partnership](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/secretary-buttigieg-launches-bipartisan-partnership-state-attorneys-general-protect)
    with a bipartisan group of state attorneys general to fast-track the
    review of consumer complaints, hold airlines accountable, and
    protect the rights of the traveling public.
-   In 2023, the flight cancellation rate in the U.S. was a [record
    low](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/2023-numbers-more-flights-fewer-cancellations-more-consumer-protections)
    at under 1.2% — the lowest rate of flight cancellations in over 10
    years despite a record amount of air travel
-   DOT is undertaking its first ever industry-wide review of airline
    [privacy
    practices](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/secretary-buttigieg-announces-first-industry-wide-privacy-review-us-airlines)
    and its first review of airline loyalty programs

In addition to finalizing the rules to require automatic refunds and
protect consumers from surprise fees, DOT is also pursuing rulemakings
that would:

-   Propose to ban family seating junk fees and guarantee that parents
    can sit with their children for no extra charge when they fly.
    Before President Biden and Secretary Buttigieg pressed airlines last
    year, no airline committed to guaranteeing fee-free family seating.
    Now, four airlines guarantee fee-free family seating, as the
    Department is working on its family seating junk fee ban proposal.
-   Propose to make passenger compensation and amenities mandatory so
    that travelers are taken care of when airlines cause flight delays
    or cancellations.
-   Expand the rights for passengers who use wheelchairs and ensure that
    they can travel [safely and with
    dignity](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/secretary-buttigieg-announces-proposed-rule-ensure-passengers-who-use-wheelchairs-can).
    The comment period on this proposed rule closes on May 13, 2024.
