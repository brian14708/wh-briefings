*White House Hosts Event and Issues Call to Action to Government
Leaders, Employers, and Others to Build on These Efforts*

During [Care Workers Recognition
Month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/09/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-substantial-progress-on-the-presidents-care-agenda-during-month-of-action-on-care/)
and the [Month of Action on
Care](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/09/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-substantial-progress-on-the-presidents-care-agenda-during-month-of-action-on-care/),
the Biden-Harris Administration will mark progress toward expanding
access to care and other supportive services workers need to train for
and stay in good-paying jobs. Today, Senior Biden-Harris Administration
officials—including White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden,
Director of the Gender Policy Council Jennifer Klein, Secretary of
Commerce Gina Raimondo, and Administrator of the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) Shailen Bhatt—will be joined by Governor Tina
Kotek of Oregon, Governor Kathy Hochul of New York, and Governor Maura
Healey of Massachusetts along with tradeswomen, care advocates, and
business community representatives for a Making Care Work event.
Participants will announce new actions that advance President Biden’s
call to strengthen the nation’s Care Economy and discuss the importance
of supportive services, including child care and long-term care, for
building a skilled, diverse workforce.  
  
Workers cannot train for or stay in good jobs if they cannot meet basic
needs, such as access to child care and transportation. That is why
supportive services are critical to building the workforce necessary to
carry out President Biden’s Investing in America (IIA) agenda. Building
on the Department of Commerce’s historic requirement that companies
receiving major CHIPS and Science Act grants provide child care for
their workers, the President’s [Executive Order on Increasing Access to
High-Quality Care and Supporting
Caregivers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/)
(Care EO) directed every cabinet-level agency to determine how they can
require, preference, or encourage their own federal funding applicants
to provide supportive services, including care, for workers.  
   
Today’s event will highlight how agencies are implementing the
President’s Care EO, including by making funds available for supportive
services in their grants and loans where allowable, strengthening
language in their funding opportunities, producing key resources for
applicants, and more. The event will also showcase examples of how
grantees—from states to employers, unions, community colleges, and
more—are leading the way on care and other supports for workers.
Administration officials will announce the first National Child Care
Innovation Summit, and issue calls to action to employers, governors,
and others to further expand care and other supports for workers.  
   
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will make new announcements,
including:  

-   Secretary Raimondo will announce that the **Department of Commerce
    (DOC)** will cohost, in collaboration with the U.S. Chamber of
    Commerce and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, the first
    National Child Care Innovation Summit this summer. The Summit will
    bring together key public- and private-sector stakeholders to
    discuss the vital role of child care as economic infrastructure and
    will encourage action by the private sector as an ally and force
    multiplier to the public sector.  
-   **The Department of Transportation (DOT)** will
    [release](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativeprograms/centers/workforce_dev/hcwp/)
    a new $4.2 million funding opportunity authorized under the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, providing grants for educational
    institutions and State Departments of Transportation to develop or
    scale workforce development programs for highway construction.
    Projects will be evaluated on how closely they align to the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s goal to include supportive services as
    part of high-quality workforce development programs to train, place,
    and retain people in good-paying jobs and Registered
    Apprenticeships. State DOTs that are applying are encouraged to show
    how they will also use FHWA formula funds and other sustainable
    funding sources for workforce development projects.  
-   **The Department of Treasury** will [publish a fact
    sheet](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/frequently-asked-questions-about-work-life-referral-services)
    highlighting that employer-provided “work-life referral
    services”—such as services that help an employee identify a child
    care provider or other services aimed at assisting an employee or
    negotiating on an employee’s behalf—are generally considered a de
    minimis fringe benefit and therefore excluded from an employee’s
    taxable income. 
-   **The Biden-Harris Administration** will release new resources:

<!-- -->

-   **The** **White House Council of Economic Advisers** will publish
    [*Seven Facts About the Economics of Child
    Care*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/04/17/seven-facts-about-the-economics-of-child-care/)*,*
    laying out the research-based imperative for investing in child
    care—including how access to affordable, high-quality care can
    encourage U.S. labor force participation, particularly among
    women.  
-   **The White House** will release a new guide, *[Advancing Care as a
    Supportive
    Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Advancing-Care-as-a-Supportive-Service.pdf)*,
    to help care and workforce development stakeholders leverage federal
    funds to support care and other supportive services for workers,
    including on federally funded and federally supported projects.  
-   **The Department of Labor (DOL)** will [release new
    guidance](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-job/supportive-services-for-child-and-longterm-care)
    to help agencies, federal funding recipients, employers, and care
    community stakeholders make thoughtful investments in child care and
    long-term care to support workers. The guidance provides best
    practices as well as example strategies for designing care solutions
    for workers.

States will expand commitments to care and other supportive services for
workers, including:

-   **Oregon** is announcing it will expand its investments to support
    construction workers across the state—building on its successful
    Highway Construction Partnership program. For over a decade, the
    program has leveraged FHWA formula funds to support construction
    apprentices with supportive services, including covering child care
    costs of up to 7 percent of household income (or up to $2,500 per
    child each month).
    -   The state will invest $7.5 million in the new Oregon CHIPS
        Childcare Infrastructure Fund, expanding the Highway
        Construction Partnership model to fund supportive services and
        child care for workers in the semiconductor supply chain.
    -   Oregon Department of Transportation will double its workforce
        investments from FHWA formula funds using new flexibilities from
        the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, creating a new $1 million
        program to enable women returning from incarceration to directly
        transition into highway apprenticeships upon release.  
-   **New York’s** state Department of Transportation and Department of
    Labor are collaborating closely to ensure that workforce development
    and supportive services are available for transportation projects in
    Syracuse and Buffalo. The state is leveraging a $5 million Quality
    Jobs, Equity, Strategy and Training (QUEST) grant from the U.S.
    Department of Labor to expand child care access, legal services for
    drivers’ licenses, and other necessary supportive services for
    workers looking to join the I-81 project workforce. The project
    includes a first-in-the-nation local hire initiative of 15 percent,
    which aims to give opportunity to Syracuse’s most disadvantaged
    neighborhoods, including the same communities that have been divided
    by this highway for decades.  
-   **Massachusetts** will seek to invest $20 million in a Workforce
    Training System (WTS) that will help align child care, education,
    job training, and employment opportunities in Western Massachusetts’
    Springfield and Holyoke—two communities with predominately residents
    of color—through the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s
    [Recompete Pilot
    Program](https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/recompete-pilot-program),
    authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act.  
-   **Maryland’s** state Department of Transportation, in support of the
    [Baltimore Workforce
    Hub](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/13/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-holds-workforce-hub-convening-in-baltimore-announces-commitments-to-train-and-hire-local-residents-to-support-major-infrastructure-projects/)
    and the state’s workforce development efforts, is allocating an
    unprecedented $24 million of federal funds over six years to support
    transportation infrastructure workforce in the state. This
    initiative, developed in partnership with Maryland Department of
    Labor, will help Marylanders enter good jobs in the transportation
    sector through increasing access to resources, occupational
    training, and critical wraparound services including quality
    affordable child care. This will complement and leverage the state’s
    historic investment of over $300 million in fiscal year 2025 for
    child care scholarships to make high-quality child care more
    affordable.  
-   **Washington** tripled investment in its Pre-Apprenticeship and
    Supportive Services (PASS) grant program, providing $6 million in
    the 2021-2023 period to colleges, labor unions, and workforce
    organizations that are helping individuals get into Registered
    Apprenticeship programs, including by providing care and other
    supportive services to participants. Since 2015, the program has
    served nearly 2,800 participants, of whom 20 percent are women, 13
    percent are Black, 32 percent are Hispanic, and 9 percent are Native
    American. The state is now expanding this successful model to
    maritime workforce training.

Today’s announcements build on the robust action that agencies have
already taken to implement the President’s Care EO. Recent actions
include:

-   **The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** has made supportive
    services, including care, an allowable use of funds in the major
    Investing in America (IIA) investments it will soon be awarding,
    including its Solar for All (Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund) program,
    Climate Pollution Reduction Grants, and Environmental and Climate
    Justice Community Change Grant program.
    -   ***Selected applicant spotlight:*** *Nonprofit coalition **Power

        *through EPA’s National Clean Investment Fund to decarbonize and
        transform American housing—saving families money, reinvesting in
        communities, and tackling the climate crisis. The coalition will
        invest in new and existing pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship
        programs, including, when possible, investments in supportive
        services to increase participation from individuals in
        low-income and disadvantaged communities.*  
-   **The Department of Labor
    (DOL)**[announced](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20240410-0)
    on April 10 it will award a total of $65 million in Strengthening

        women—to help fill good semiconductor manufacturing jobs spurred
        by the President’s CHIPS Act. CSCC has budgeted project funds
        for supportive services, emphasizing provision of accessible
        child care for students who are parents.*  
-   **The Department of Energy (DOE)** has made supportive services,
    including caregiving assistance that enables students to participate
    in DOE-supported training and technical assistance, an allowable use
    of funds in its open [$24 million funding
    opportunity](https://www.energywerx.org/opportunities/doe-clean-energy-and-manufacturing-workforce-training-and-technical-assistance-awards-iac-program)
    to establish new centers as part of the Industrial Assessment
    Centers (IAC) network. The IAC program supports inclusive access to
    high-quality training programs in clean energy, energy efficiency,
    and advanced manufacturing, and helps small and midsized
    manufacturers save money, reduce energy waste, and improve
    productivity.  Additionally, DOE requires applicants for nearly all
    of its competitive BIL and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) programs to
    develop a Community Benefits Plan (CBP) detailing how the project
    will invest in good-quality jobs and support inclusive access to
    those jobs, among other objectives geared towards increasing the
    success of the project. To help applicants develop strong CBPs, DOE
    released a [comprehensive
    FAQ](https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/about-community-benefits-plans)
    that provides effective strategies for applicants to consider,
    including related to supporting workers’ access to high-quality,
    affordable child care and other forms of caregiving assistance.
