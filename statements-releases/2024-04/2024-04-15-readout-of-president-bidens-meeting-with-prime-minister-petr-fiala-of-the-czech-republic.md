President Biden welcomed Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala to the White
House today.  President Biden congratulated the Czech Republic, a
stalwart Ally, on celebrating 25 years in NATO and on the recent passage
of legislation requiring it to spend at least 2 percent of its GDP on
defense.  The leaders reaffirmed their iron-clad commitment to the NATO
Alliance, which makes us all safer.  President Biden also welcomed the
Czech decision earlier this year to purchase 24 U.S. F-35s, a $4.5
billion deal that contributes to U.S. jobs, bolsters the Czech
Republic’s defense modernization, and deepens the U.S.-Czech defense
relationship.

The leaders underscored their unwavering support for Ukraine as it
defends itself against Russia’s brutal invasion.  They also coordinated
on challenges in the Middle East. The two condemned the blatant
and unprecedented attacks against Israel by Iran and its proxies.  They
also discussed Israel’s right to self-defense against the threats it
faces in accordance with international law and efforts to expand
humanitarian aid to Gaza.  The leaders also spoke about the U.S.-Czech
energy security relationship, deepening strategic ties, and shared
democratic values.  President Biden and Prime Minister Fiala also
announced their countries’ intent to sign a memorandum of understanding
on countering foreign information manipulation that will help defend
democratic institutions from foreign disinformation.
