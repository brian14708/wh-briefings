title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Senate Passage of the National Security\_\
  Package"
---
 
Tonight, a bipartisan majority in the Senate joined the House to answer
history’s call at this critical inflection point. Congress has passed my
legislation to strengthen our national security and send a message to
the world about the power of American leadership: we stand resolutely
for democracy and freedom, and against tyranny and oppression.

I will sign this bill into law and address the American people as soon
as it reaches my desk tomorrow so we can begin sending weapons and
equipment to Ukraine this week. The need is urgent: for Ukraine, facing
unrelenting bombardment from Russia; for Israel, which just faced
unprecedented attacks from Iran; for refugees and those impacted by
conflicts and natural disasters around the world, including in Gaza,
Sudan, and Haiti; and for our partners seeking security and stability in
the Indo-Pacific. I want to thank Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, and
all of the bipartisan lawmakers in the Senate who voted for this
bill. This critical legislation will make our nation and world more
secure as we support our friends who are defending themselves against
terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin.
