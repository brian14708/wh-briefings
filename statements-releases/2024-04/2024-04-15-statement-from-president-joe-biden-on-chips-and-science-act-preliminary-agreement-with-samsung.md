title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on CHIPS and Science Act Preliminary Agreement\
  \ with\_Samsung"
---
 
I signed the CHIPS and Science Act to restore U.S. leadership in
semiconductor manufacturing and ensure America’s consumers, businesses,
and military maintain access to the chips that underpin our modern
technology. But well before the law was passed, I was working to address
our supply chain vulnerabilities. This included my trip to the Republic
of Korea (ROK), where I visited Samsung’s Pyeongtaek campus to see one
of the largest semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the world.

Now, nearly two years later, I’m pleased to announce a preliminary
agreement between Samsung and the Department of Commerce to bring
Samsung’s advanced semiconductor manufacturing and research and
development to Texas. This announcement, will unleash over $40
billion in investment from Samsung, and cement central Texas’s role as a
state-of-the-art semiconductor ecosystem, creating at least 21,500 jobs
and leveraging up to $40 million in CHIPS funding to train and develop
the local workforce. These facilities will support the production of
some of the most powerful chips in the world, which are essential to
advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and will bolster U.S.
national security.

Today’s announcement of Samsung’s investment in the United States is
another example of how my Investing in America agenda and the U.S.-ROK
Alliance is creating opportunity in every corner of the country.
