title: "Readout of the White\_House Convening on Implementing Red Flag\_Laws"
---
 
On April 12, the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention and
Office of Intergovernmental Affairs hosted 30 local leaders from across
15 states in response to the Vice President urging states to use federal
funding for the implementation of existing red flag laws, which allow
family members or law enforcement to seek a court order to temporarily
take away access to guns if there is evidence a person may harm
themselves or others.

Last month, Vice President Harris encouraged states to use Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act (BSCA) funding to implement existing red flag
laws. While the Biden-Harris Administration has made $750 million in
federal funding available to implement state crisis intervention
programs –which includes red flag programs – much of this funding
remains unused. Of the 21 states that currently have passed red flag
laws, only six are using BSCA funding to implement them.

During the virtual event, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials
along with state and local government leaders and gun violence
prevention experts highlighted the impact BSCA funding can have on the
implementation of red flag laws across the country and encouraged other
states to take up the Vice President’s call, in order to protect their
communities and save lives.

Office of Gun Violence Prevention Director Stefanie Feldman, Deputy
Director Rob Wilcox and Deputy Director Greg Jackson were joined by
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority Executive Director
Delrice Adams, Illinois Criminal Justice Information Technical Director
Maureen Brennan, Brady Chief Programs and Policy Officer Christian
Heyne, Ad Council Vice President Allison Baum, Illinois Department of
Public Health Deputy Director Lauri Sanders, Illinois Department of
Public Health Chief Operating Officer Shannon Lightner, and San Diego
City Attorney Mara Elliott.

Today’s convening comes on the heels of the [Biden-Harris Administration

that will save lives by reducing the number of firearms sold without
background checks. This action is part of the Biden-Harris
Administration’s strategy to stem the flow of illegally acquired
firearms into our communities and hold accountable those who supply the
firearms used in crime.
