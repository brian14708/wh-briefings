title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on World Malaria\_Day"

Today—on World Malaria Day—we recommit to ending this disease for
everyone, everywhere.  
   
Malaria is one of the world’s deadliest diseases. In 1951, the United
States eliminated malaria in our country. And with strong bipartisan
support in Congress, we’ve led the fight to eliminate this disease
worldwide—saving nearly 12 million lives and preventing more than two
billion infections since 2000.  
   
But despite this progress, nearly half the global population remains
vulnerable to malaria—living in constant fear that they will lose their
lives because of a mosquito bite. And last year, after two decades of no
domestically-acquired cases of malaria, ten cases were reported in the
United States. While the individuals were successfully treated, and the
spread was halted, it was a solemn reminder of the urgent need to
continue preventing and treating the disease globally.  
   
That is exactly what my Administration is doing. We’ve expanded the U.S.
President’s Malaria Initiative, and are now partnering with 30 countries
to bring life-saving tools and treatments to people in need. We also
hosted the seventh replenishment for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria, raising a historically high level of funding
from global donors. And, the United States has been a driving force
behind deployment of the first-ever malaria vaccine. When combined with
other prevention tools—such as mosquito nets and preventive
medicines—these vaccines have the potential to save millions of
children’s lives around the world.  
   
To all those living in fear of malaria: the United States sees you. We
stand with you. And together, we can—and will—end this disease.
