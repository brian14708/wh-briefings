title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on the Passing of Reverend Cecil\_Williams"
---
 
Reverend Cecil Williams was a beacon of light and love.

In all he did, Reverend Williams was guided by his faith. He fought for
the rights and dignity of all people. He led re-entry programs for those
leaving prison, provided clothing and housing for people in need, and
helped thousands of people access healthcare. Under his leadership, San
Francisco’s GLIDE Memorial Church became one of the first churches to
welcome members of the LGBTQ+ community. Reverend Williams made GLIDE
what it is today: a sanctuary of hope and healing, where all people are
made to feel like family.

It was my honor to call Reverend Williams a dear friend. I have many
fond memories over the years of attending GLIDE’s morning sermon on
Thanksgiving—and then, joining Rev. and Jan downstairs to serve meals to
members of the community. Cecil offered every person who walked through
his doors a warm smile, a hot meal, and unconditional love.  

Our country is more just, more compassionate, and stronger for the
leadership of Reverend Cecil Williams. Doug and I send our prayers to
the entire Williams family.
