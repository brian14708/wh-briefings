Today, U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics
Daleep Singh and Norwegian Minister of Trade and Industry Jan Christian
Vestre signaled their intent to move forward with a U.S.-Norway
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Concerning Cooperation on
High-Standard, Market-Oriented Trade of Critical Minerals. The MoU is an
important step  towards further strengthening the United States and
Norway’s future strategic cooperation regarding critical minerals. Under
this MOU, the United States and Norway intend to build on months of
constructive dialogue through a coordinated approach to the challenges
and opportunities that characterize markets for critical minerals. Key
focus areas of this cooperation will include advancing high-standard
labor and environmental conditions in global critical minerals supply
chains and examining and identifying appropriate responses to non-market
policies and practices in third countries that have contributed to
volatile, distorted market conditions.  With this MOU, the United States
and Norway intend to deepen our partnership in pursuit of the long-term
commercial viability of sustainable, high-standard, market-oriented
critical minerals mining and processing activities in the United States,
Norway, and globally.
