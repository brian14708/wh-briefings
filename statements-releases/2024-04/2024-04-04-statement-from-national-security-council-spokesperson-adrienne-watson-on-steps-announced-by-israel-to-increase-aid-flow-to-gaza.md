title: "Statement from National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Steps\
  \ Announced by Israel to Increase Aid Flow to\_Gaza"
---
 
We welcome the steps announced by the Israeli government tonight at the
President’s request following his call with Prime Minister Netanyahu.
These steps, including a commitment to open the Ashdod port for the
direct delivery of assistance into Gaza, to open the Erez crossing for a
new route for assistance to reach north Gaza, and to significantly
increase deliveries from Jordan directly into Gaza, must now be fully
and rapidly implemented. 

As the President said today on the call, U.S. policy with respect to
Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel’s immediate action
on these and other steps, including steps to protect innocent civilians
and the safety of aid workers. We are prepared to work in full
coordination with the Government of Israel, the Governments of Jordan
and Egypt, the United Nations, and humanitarian organizations, to ensure
that these important steps are implemented and result in a significant
increase in humanitarian assistance reaching civilians in dire need
throughout Gaza over the coming days and weeks.
