title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the March Consumer Price\_Index"
---
 
Today’s report shows inflation has fallen more than 60% from its peak,
but we have more to do to lower costs for hardworking families. Prices
are still too high for housing and groceries, even as prices for key
household items like milk and eggs are lower than a year ago. I have a
plan to lower costs for housing—by building and renovating more than 2
million homes—and I’m calling on corporations including grocery
retailers to use record profits to reduce prices.

Fighting inflation remains my top economic priority. We’re making
progress: wages are rising faster than prices, incomes are higher than
before the pandemic, and unemployment has remained below 4% for the
longest stretch in 50 years. But we have more to do: my agenda is
lowering costs for prescription drugs, health care, student debt, and
hidden junk fees. Rather than proposing solutions for hardworking
families, Congressional Republicans want to slash taxes for billionaires
and big corporations, while helping special interests and Big Pharma
raise prices. I won’t let them.
