  \ with\_TSMC"

Semiconductors – those tiny chips smaller than the tip of your finger –
power everything from smartphones to cars to satellites and weapons
systems. America invented these chips, but over time, we went from
producing nearly 40% of the world’s capacity to just over 10%, and none
of the most advanced chips, exposing us to significant economic and
national security vulnerabilities. I was determined to turn that around,
and thanks to my CHIPS and Science Act – a key part of my Investing in
America agenda – semiconductor manufacturing and jobs are making a
comeback.  
   
Today, we continue building on that historic progress, with the
Department of Commerce announcing a preliminary agreement with Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to support the construction
of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing facilities right here in the
United States. Thanks to this investment, TSMC will also build a third
chip factory in Phoenix, increasing its total investment in Arizona to
$65 billion and creating over 25,000 direct construction and
manufacturing jobs, along with thousands of indirect jobs. These
facilities will manufacture the most advanced chips in the world,
putting us on track to produce 20% of the world’s leading-edge
semiconductors by 2030. The agreement also dedicates $50 million of
CHIPS funding to training and developing the local workforce, so workers
don’t have to leave their hometowns to find good-paying jobs in
innovative industries.  
   
A year and a half ago, I toured the site of TSMC’s first new fab in
Phoenix, Arizona. TSMC’s renewed commitment to the United States, and
its investment in Arizona represent a broader story for semiconductor
manufacturing that’s made in America and with the strong support of
America’s leading technology firms to build the products we rely on
every day.
