President Joe Biden and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador spoke by
telephone on Sunday, April 28th about their continued commitment to
strengthening bilateral and regional cooperation that will benefit the
people of the United States and Mexico. The two leaders discussed how to
effectively manage hemispheric migration, strengthen operational
efficiency on our shared border, and thereby improve the security and
prosperity of citizens of both countries. In the short term, the two
leaders ordered their national security teams to work together to
immediately implement concrete measures to significantly reduce
irregular border crossings while protecting human rights. President
Biden and President López Obrador also pledged to advance initiatives to
address the root causes of migration throughout the Western Hemisphere,
noting that increasing shared prosperity and security will be of
critical importance in effectively addressing the migration challenge
over the longer term.
