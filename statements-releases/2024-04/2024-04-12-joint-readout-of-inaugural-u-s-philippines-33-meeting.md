Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J.
Austin III, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with
Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo, Philippine
Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro, and Philippine National
Security Advisor Eduardo M. Año in Washington, DC today. The meeting
followed President Biden’s bilateral meeting with Philippines President
Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. and the historic Japan-Philippines-United
States Trilateral Leaders’ Summit on April 11.

The parties reaffirmed their shared vision of a free and open
Indo-Pacific and discussed ways to deepen coordination regarding shared
challenges in the South China Sea, including repeated harassment of
lawful Philippine operations by the People’s Republic of China.
Secretary Blinken, Secretary of Defense Austin, and National Security
Advisor Sullivan reiterated the United States’ ironclad commitment to
the U.S.-Philippine Alliance and recalled that the 1951 Mutual Defense
Treaty extends to armed attacks on Philippine armed forces, public
vessels, or aircraft – including those of its Coast Guard – anywhere in
the South China Sea.  The parties underscored their determination to
increase U.S. support for the modernization of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines to improve interoperability and to achieve our shared
security objectives. The parties further decided to explore additional
opportunities to strengthen global support for upholding the
international law of the sea.
