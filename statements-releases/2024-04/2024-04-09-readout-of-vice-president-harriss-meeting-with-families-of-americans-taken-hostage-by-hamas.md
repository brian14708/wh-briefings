Vice President Kamala Harris met today with families of Americans taken
hostage by Hamas on October 7. The Vice President underscored that
President Biden and she have no higher priority than reuniting the
hostages with their loved ones. She also reaffirmed the U.S. commitment
to bring home the remains of those who have been tragically confirmed to
be deceased. The Vice President again condemned Hamas as a brutal
terrorist organization and its horrific use of sexual violence,
reaffirmed that the threat Hamas poses to Israel must be eliminated, and
denounced the rise of antisemitism worldwide. The Vice President
expressed her continued support for these families and they discussed
the agony and pain felt over the past 6 months. The Vice President told
them that they and their loved ones remain at the forefront of her mind
and in her prayers as the Biden-Harris Administration works to secure
the release of all the hostages. The Vice President provided an update
on U.S. efforts to secure the release of all hostages and an immediate
ceasefire in Gaza.
