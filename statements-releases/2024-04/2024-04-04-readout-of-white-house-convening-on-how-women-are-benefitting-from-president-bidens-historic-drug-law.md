This week, Domestic Policy Council Director Neera Tanden, Deputy
Secretary of Health and Human Services Andrea Palm, Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure and Deputy
Administrator and Director of the Center for Medicare Dr. Meena
Seshamani, and Gender Policy Council Deputy Director Katie Keith
headlined a White House convening on how President Biden’s prescription
drug law, the Inflation Reduction Act, is directly benefitting women
with Medicare, as well as the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing
efforts to lower prescription drug costs for women of all ages.

Senior Administration officials highlighted [new

released today by the Department of Health and Human Services on how the
President’s prescription drug law is lowering costs for women enrolled
in Medicare, including the nearly 30 million women in Medicare Part D.
From lowering caps on costs for covered insulin to $35 per month, to
capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare enrollees at
$2,000 annually in 2025, to negotiating the prices of prescription drugs
for the first time, the Administration is helping women and their
families save money on the care they need—from treatment for cancer to
asthma to autoimmune diseases.

The convening also featured a panel with leading experts and advocates
who discussed how women are benefitting from President Biden’s historic
prescription drug law. Panelists highlighted the importance of the
Inflation Reduction Act in promoting women’s economic security and
ensuring that more women can access affordable medications for
themselves and their families. Panelists also discussed the importance
of the law’s benefits to younger women and the need to continue the
Administration’s fight to lower health care costs for all Americans and
deliver a better deal for women and their families.

Panelists and speakers included:

-   Sneha Dave, Executive Director, Generation Patient
-   Stacie Dusetzina, Professor, Vanderbilt University School of
    Medicine
-   Jocelyn Frye, President, National Partnership for Women & Families
-   Leigh Purvis, Prescription Drug Policy Principal, AARP
-   Samantha Reid, Patient Advocate and Senior Director of Digital
    Engagement, Center for American Progress
