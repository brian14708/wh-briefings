  \ David\_Pryor"

If there is one word that defined David Pryor – and the essence of his
character – it is *integrity.*  
   
In serving the people of his beloved Arkansas as a State Representative,
a U.S. Congressman, a Governor, and a Senator, David always kept his
word. He never stopped fighting for working men and women, for the poor,
for civil rights. And he was willing to reach across the aisle and do
the right thing – even when it cost him politically.  
   
David was my colleague in the Senate for 18 years, and he was my friend.
His kindness was always on display: David would drag tables together in
the Senate Dining Room to make sure Senators got to know one another on
a personal level. Together, we worked to protect Americans from the
epidemic of gun violence. David voted for the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban,
knowing he’d incur the NRA’s wrath – because it would save lives. David
and I worked closely together to pass the Violence Against Women Act
which David co-sponsored. As Chair of the Senate Select Committee on
Aging, David fought for America’s seniors – standing up against elder
abuse and improving nursing home care.  
   
Our country is better off because David Pryor dedicated his life to
public service. Today, Jill and I are praying for Barbara, David, Scott,
former Senator Mark Pryor, and the extended Pryor family.
