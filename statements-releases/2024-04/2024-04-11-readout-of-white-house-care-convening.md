Today, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials hosted advocates
from across the country, including early educators, home- and
community-based care workers, family caregivers, veterans, people with
disabilities, and older Americans. Participants in the convening
highlighted the [substantial
progress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/09/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-substantial-progress-on-the-presidents-care-agenda-during-month-of-action-on-care/)
the Biden-Harris Administration has made toward making care more
affordable for American families, supporting family caregivers, boosting
compensation and job quality for care workers, and expanding care
options.  

As a part of [Care Workers Recognition
Month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/03/29/a-proclamation-on-care-workers-recognition-month-2024/),
the convening honored the coalition driving the care agenda in
communities across the country and highlighted the stories of Americans
from all care sectors: child care, home- and community-based services
for older Americans and people with disabilities, family caregivers, and
paid family and medical leave. The White House convening follows
