title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Former U.S. Senator\
  \ and Florida Governor Bob\_Graham"

Bob Graham was a colleague, friend, and devoted Floridian whose nearly
50 years of service to his beloved home state and to our country have
made America a safer and stronger nation.  
  
Bob chose a life of service, working his way up from state legislator,
to governor, senator, and presidential candidate. He and I served
together in the U.S. Senate, as respective chairs of the Intelligence
and Foreign Relations committees in the wake of 9/11, working to heal a
shattered nation and to protect America in a changing world. Bob stood
on principle against the Iraq War. He cosponsored my landmark Violence
Against Women Act, transforming the way our nation responds to domestic
abuse and sexual assault. He was committed to education and to the
environment, continuing work that he’d begun as governor to support
public schools and universities, and to protect the water supply,
wetlands, and wildlife of Florida’s iconic Everglades. He was full of
humor and humanity, and I’m grateful for the support that he gave me
over the years.  
  
Bob loved people, and he knew that politics at its core is about
learning from and serving others. That’s why he spent more than 400
“workdays” on the job with constituents, doing everything from picking
tomatoes, to handling baggage, to patrolling the streets with police. He
knew it matters to walk a mile in other folks’ shoes. In recent years,
he sought to instill that same ethic and empathy in a new generation of
public servants through his center in Gainesville, and by working to
require civics classes in public schools. He inspired his own daughter,
Gwen, to serve in Congress as well; and I’m proud to have her in my
Administration today, as an Assistant Secretary of Education. Bob was so
proud, too.  
  
Our hearts today are with Bob’s beloved wife of 65 years, Adele; with
their four daughters, Gwen, Cissy, Suzanne, and Kendall; with their
grandchildren and friends; and with the people of Florida, whom Bob
served so well in so many ways for so long.
