President Biden spoke today with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine to
underscore the United States’ lasting commitment to supporting Ukraine
as it defends its freedom against Russian aggression. President Biden
shared that his administration will quickly provide significant new
security assistance packages to meet Ukraine’s urgent battlefield and
air defense needs as soon as the Senate passes the national security
supplemental and he signs it into law. President Biden also underscored
that the U.S. economic assistance will help maintain financial
stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian
attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of
Euro-Atlantic integration.
