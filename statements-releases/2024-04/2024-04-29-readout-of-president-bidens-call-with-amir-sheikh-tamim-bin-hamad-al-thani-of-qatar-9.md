President Biden spoke today with Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani of
Qatar.  The two leaders discussed the deal now on the table to secure
the release of hostages together with an immediate and sustained
ceasefire in Gaza. The President confirmed that the United States
together with Egypt and Qatar would work to ensure the full
implementation of its terms. He urged Amir Tamim to exert all efforts to
secure the release of hostages held by Hamas as this is now the only
obstacle to an immediate ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza.
The two leaders reviewed ongoing initiatives to increase the flow of
life-saving assistance to civilians in Gaza.  The President thanked the
Amir and his senior team for their tireless efforts to secure the
release of all hostages held in Gaza.  The leaders agreed to remain
closely coordinated directly and through their teams over the coming
days.
