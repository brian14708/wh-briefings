title: "Joint Statement from the Leaders of the United\_States, Argentina, Austria,\
  \ Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland,\
  \ Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom Calling for\
  \ the Release of the Hostages Held in\_Gaza"
---
 
We call for the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas in Gaza
for over 200 days. They include our own citizens.  The fate of the
hostages and the civilian population in Gaza, who are protected under
international law, is of international concern.

We emphasize that the deal on the table to release the hostages would
bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza, that would
facilitate a surge of additional necessary humanitarian assistance to be
delivered throughout Gaza, and lead to the credible end of hostilities.
Gazans would be able to return to their homes and their lands with
preparations beforehand to ensure shelter and humanitarian provisions.

We strongly support the ongoing mediation efforts in order to bring our
people home.  We reiterate our call on Hamas to release the hostages,
and let us end this crisis so that collectively we can focus our efforts
on bringing peace and stability to the region.
