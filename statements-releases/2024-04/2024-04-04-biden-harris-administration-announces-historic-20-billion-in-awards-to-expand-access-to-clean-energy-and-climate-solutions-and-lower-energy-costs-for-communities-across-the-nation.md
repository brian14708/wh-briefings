*Vice President Harris and Administrator Regan to visit Charlotte, North
Carolina to announce selectees under the Inflation Reduction Act’s
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund  
* 

*First-of-its-kind national network to fund tens of thousands of climate
and clean energy projects across America, especially in communities
historically left behind and overburdened by pollution*

Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and EPA Administrator Michael Regan
will announce selections for $20 billion in awards to stand up a
national financing network that will fund tens of thousands of climate
and clean energy projects across the country, especially in low-income
and disadvantaged communities, as part of President Biden’s Investing in
America agenda. This investment is part of the **Environmental
Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, afirst-of-its-kind
and national-scale $27 billion program funded through President Biden’s
Inflation Reduction Act** to combat the climate crisis by catalyzing
public and private capital for projects that slash harmful climate
pollution, improve air quality, lower energy costs, and create
good-paying jobs. This program will ensure communities across the
country have access to the capital they need to participate in and
benefit from a cleaner, more sustainable economy.  
  
Vice President Kamala Harris and EPA Administrator Michael Regan will be
joined by Governor Roy Cooper, Mayor Vi Lyles, and Congresswoman Alma
Adams to announce the selections under these two grant competitions in
Charlotte, North Carolina.  
  
This historic investment will support a wide range of climate and clean
energy projects, including distributed clean power generation and
storage, net-zero retrofits of homes and small businesses, and
zero-emission transportation, all of which can lower energy costs for
families and improve housing affordability while tackling the climate
crisis. Collectively, the selected applicants have committed to
**reducing or avoiding up to 40 million metric tons of carbon pollution
annually over the next seven years**, contributing toward the
Biden-Harris Administration’s historic climate goals. In addition,
selectees plan to **mobilize almost $7of private capital for every $1 of
federal funds**—**approximately $150 billion total**—ensuring that
today’s awards will have a catalytic, ongoing effect on the deployment
of climate and clean energy technologies at scale, particularly in
underserved communities.  
  
The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program advances the Biden-Harris
Administration’s [Justice40
Initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
which sets the goal that 40% of the overall benefits from certain
federal climate, clean energy, and other investments flow to
disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and
overburdened by pollution. **At least70% of the funds announced
today—over $14 billion of capital—will be invested in low-income and
disadvantaged communities**, including historic energy communities that
have powered our nation for over a century, communities with
environmental justice concerns, communities of color, low-income
communities, rural communities, Tribal communities, and more. This makes
the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund the **singlelargest non-tax investment
within the Inflation Reduction Act to build a clean energy economy while
benefiting communities historically left behind.**  
  
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are already attempting to roll back
these historic investments. Last month, the House of Representatives
passed H.R. 1023, which would repeal the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Fund. On March 19, President Biden issued a [Statement of Administration
Policy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SAP-HR1023.pdf)
with his intent to veto that bill if it were to pass the Senate and come
to his desk.  
  
**Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Selectees**  
  
The $20 billion in awards announced today will be deployed through eight
selected applicants across two separate and complementary programs under
EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—the $14 billion National Clean
Investment Fund (NCIF) and the $6 billion Clean Communities Investment
Accelerator (CCIA). Together, the two programs will create a
first-of-its-kind national network of mission-driven, community-led
financial institutions that will finance climate and clean energy
projects across the country, especially in low-income and disadvantaged
communities.  
  
Under the $14 billion **National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF)**,
selected applicants will partner with the private sector, community
organizations, and others to provide accessible, affordable financing
for new clean technology projects nationwide. While EPA required that at
least 40 percent of NCIF funds flow to low-income and disadvantaged
communities, each selected applicant significantly surpassed that
requirement. Therefore, almost 60 percent of NCIF funds will flow to the
communities that need it most. The three NCIF selectees are:  

-   **Climate United Fund ($6.97 billion award),** a nonprofit formed by
    Calvert Impact to partner with two U.S. Treasury-certified Community
    Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Self-Help Ventures Fund
    and Community Preservation Corporation. Together, these three
    nonprofit financial institutions bring a decades-long track record
    of successfully raising and deploying $30 billion in capital with a
    focus on low-income and disadvantaged communities. Climate United
    Fund’s program will focus on investing in harder-to-reach market
    segments like consumers, small businesses, small farms, community
    facilities, and schools—with at least 60% of its investments in
    low-income and disadvantaged communities, 20% in rural communities,
    and 10% in Tribal communities.  
-   **Coalition for Green Capital ($5 billion award),** a nonprofit with
    almost 15 years of experience helping establish and work with dozens
    of state, local, and nonprofit green banks that have already
    catalyzed $20 billion into qualified projects—and that have a
    pipeline of $30 billion of demand for green bank capital that could
    be coupled with more than twice that in private investment. The
    Coalition for Green Capital’s program will have particular emphasis
    on public-private investing and will leverage the existing and
    growing national network of green banks as a key distribution
    channel for investment—with at least 50% of investments in
    low-income and disadvantaged communities.  
-   **Power Forward Communities ($2 billion award),** a nonprofit
    coalition formed by five of the country’s most trusted housing,
    climate, and community investment groups that is dedicated to
    decarbonizing and transforming American housing to save homeowners
    and renters money, reinvest in communities, and tackle the climate
    crisis. The coalition members—Enterprise Community Partners, LISC
    (Local Initiatives Support Corporation), Rewiring America, Habitat
    for Humanity, and United Way—will draw on their decades of
    experience, which includes deploying over $100 billion in
    community-based initiatives and investments, to build and lead a
    national financing program providing customized and affordable
    solutions for single-family and multi-family housing owners and
    developers—with at least 75% of investments in low-income and
    disadvantaged communities.

Through the $6 billion **Clean Communities Investment Accelerator
(CCIA)**, selected applicants will establish hubs that provide funding
and technical assistance to community lenders working to finance clean
technology projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities—leading
to near-term deployment of climate and clean energy projects while
building the capacity of community lenders to finance projects at scale
for years to come. 100 percent of CCIA funds will flow to low-income and
disadvantaged communities. The five selectees of the CCIA are:

-   **Opportunity Finance Network ($2.29 billion award),** a
    ~40-year-old nonprofit CDFI Intermediary that provides capital and
    capacity building for a national network of 400+ community
    lenders—predominantly U.S. Treasury-certified CDFI Loan Funds—which
    collectively hold $42 billion in assets and serve all 50 states, the
    District of Columbia, and several U.S. territories.  
-   **Inclusiv ($1.87 billion award),** a ~50-year-old nonprofit CDFI
    Intermediary that provides capital and capacity building for a
    national network of 900+ mission-driven, regulated credit
    unions—which include CDFIs and financial *cooperativas* in Puerto
    Rico—that collectively manage $330 billion in assets and serve 23
    million individuals across the country.  
-   **Native CDFI Network ($400 million award),** a nonprofit that
    serves as national voice and advocate for the 60+ U.S.
    Treasury-certified Native CDFIs, which have a presence in 27 states
    across rural reservation communities as well as urban communities
    and have a mission to address capital access challenges in Native
    communities.  
-   **Justice Climate Fund ($940 million award),** a
    purpose-built nonprofit supported by an existing ecosystem of
    coalition members, a national network of more than 1,200 community
    lenders, and ImpactAssets—an experienced nonprofit with $3 billion
    under management—to provide responsible, clean
    energy-focused capital and capacity building to community lenders
    across the country.  
-   **Appalachian Community Capital ($500 million award),** a nonprofit
    CDFI with a decade of experience working with community lenders in
    Appalachian communities, which is launching the Green Bank for Rural
    America to deliver clean capital and capacity building assistance to
    hundreds of community lenders working in coal, energy, underserved
    rural, and Tribal communities across the United States.

**Expanding Access to Clean Energy**  
  
Today’s historic Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund announcement builds on a
range of innovative tools and programs in President Biden’s Investing in
America agenda that aim to empower the communities that can benefit most
from new investments to take an active role in building the clean energy
economy. These programs leverage a range of approaches to make it easier
and more affordable for states, cities, Tribes, schools, nonprofit
organizations, and businesses of all sizes to build, own, and benefit
from cost-saving clean energy projects, invest in energy efficiency
improvements, expand access to clean transportation, and participate
fully in decisions that affect underserved communities and
populations.  
  
For example:

-   In March, the Treasury Department [finalized
    rules](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2157) for
    **direct pay**—a provision in the Inflation Reduction Act that
    enables, for the first time, tax-exempt entities like states,
    cities, Tribes, counties, territories, nonprofit organizations,
    public schools, hospitals, rural electric co-operatives, and more to
    access clean energy tax credits and fully participate in building
    and owning new clean energy projects. For example:  
-   To meet its goal of 100% carbon free operations by 2030, the City of
    **Madison, Wisconsin** is planning to access $13 million via direct
    pay to support transitioning their municipal fleet to low and
    no-carbon vehicles, as well as for solar and geothermal energy
    projects.  
-   The City of **San Antonio, Texas** is taking advantage of direct pay
    to build and own the largest municipal onsite solar project in
    Texas. This $30 million project will install roof top, parking, and
    park canopy solar photovoltaic systems at 42 city facilities to
    lower their energy costs and energy consumption and make progress
    toward their goal of achieving net-zero energy for all municipal
    buildings by 2040.  
-   The Inflation Reduction Act’s **transferability** provision allows
    businesses to transfer all or a portion of certain clean energy tax
    credits to a third-party in exchange for cash, so that small
    businesses, start-ups, and other entities without sufficient tax
    liability may still take advantage of the credits. The Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) has already registered more than [45,000 new
    projects](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/business/biden-climate-tax-credits.html)
    seeking to benefit from this new tool, which is lowering financing
    costs for clean energy projects and helping accelerate the buildout
    of the clean energy economy.  
-   The **Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit** program created by the
    Inflation Reduction Act promotes cost-saving clean energy
    investments in low-income communities, on Tribal lands, as part of
    affordable housing developments, and that benefit low-income
    households by providing a 10 to 20 percentage point bonus credit for
    up to 1.8 GW of small clean energy projects per year. In the first
    year of [the
    program](https://www.energy.gov/justice/low-income-communities-bonus-credit-program),
    the administration received more than 46,000 applications for
    allocations, signaling robust market demand to build projects
    serving low-income communities. The second year of the program will
    open for applications [later this
    spring](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2217).  
-   In March, the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO)
    offered its first conditional commitment through the [**Tribal
    Energy Financing Program**](https://www.energy.gov/LPO/Tribal),
    which was expanded and provided new loan authority by the Inflation
    Reduction Act to support tribal entities in building out energy
    infrastructure. LPO [announced up to $72.8
    million](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-viejas-microgrid-build-renewable-utility-scale)
    for a partial loan guarantee to finance the development of a
    solar-plus long-duration energy storage microgrid on the Tribal
    lands of the Viejas Band of the Kumeyaay Indians near Alpine,
    California.   
-   Last week, LPO offered its first conditional commitment through the
    [**Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment
    Program**](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/energy-infrastructure-reinvestment)
    under Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Section 1706, first authorized
    and appropriated by the Inflation Reduction Act, to finance projects
    that retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure
    that has ceased operations or enable operating energy infrastructure
    to reduce pollution. These projects direct new investment in
    historical energy communities that have powered our nation for over
    a century. [Last week’s offer of a conditional
    commitment](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-holtec-palisades-finance-restoration-and)
    of up to $1.52 billion for a loan guarantee to Holtec Palisades will
    finance the restoration and resumption of service of an 800-MW
    electric nuclear generating station in Covert Township, Michigan
    that closed in May 2022 and upgrade it to produce baseload clean
    power for decades to come.   
-   Last week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
    Acting Secretary Todman [traveled to Chicago to
    announce](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_064)
    that the Department has now awarded more than half of the nearly $1
    billion provided through the Inflation Reduction Act to make homes
    more energy-efficient, comfortable, and climate resilient for
    low-income Americans. The **Green and Resilient Retrofit Program**
    makes grants and loans to finance energy and climate renovations in
    HUD-assisted multifamily housing for low-income individuals,
    families, and seniors.  
-   Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S.
    Department of Agriculture (USDA) has invested more than $1.8 billion
    through their **Rural Energy for America Program**, which provides
    guaranteed loan financing and grant funding for rural small
    businesses and agricultural producers to adopt clean energy and save
    money. President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act invests more than
    $2 billion to expand this program, and USDA just announced the
    latest tranche of over [$120 million in awards for projects in 44
    states](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/03/28/biden-harris-administration-invests-clean-energy-and-fertilizer)
    last week.  
-   In December 2023, EPA [announced 11 grant
    makers](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-600m-11-grantmakers-fund-thousands-environmental)
    to receive $600 million from the Inflation Reduction Act through the
    **Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program**
    to offer subgrants for environmental justice projects to local
    community-based organizations around the country. This new program
    is designed to make it easier for small community-based
    organizations to access federal environmental justice funding and
    responds to feedback about the need to reduce barriers to federal
    funds and improve the efficiency of the awards process to benefit
    underserved communities.   
-   In November 2023, EPA announced [approximately $2 billion in
    funding](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-2-billion-fund-environmental-and-climate-justice)
    available to support community-driven projects that deploy clean
    energy, strengthen climate resilience, and build capacity for
    communities to tackle environmental and climate justice challenges.
    The **Community Change Grants Program** is the single largest
    investment in environmental justice going directly to communities in
    history, and will advance collaborative efforts to achieve a
    healthier, safer, and more prosperous future for all.
