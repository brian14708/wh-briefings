Millions of American families count on programs like the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and child care
to support their health, nutrition, and well-being. These programs have
a proven record of supporting better life outcomes for parents and
children alike. 

Beginning with the President’s [Executive Order on Customer
Experience](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/),
the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to ensure improved access and
accurate benefits. Families should be able to:

-   Easily find out what they are eligible for;
-   Apply for and receive benefits quickly and without excessive red
    tape;
-   Provide critical information to government once, rather than
    re-submitting the same information multiple times across programs;
-   Remain enrolled as long as they are eligible; and
-   Have equitable, high quality service experiences.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is highlighting policy and
implementation actions that the Federal Government has taken to improve
benefits access.  These actions include both policy changes, like
simplifying applications and eliminating waiting periods, and
implementation actions, like helping states reduce application backlogs
and enabling data sharing across programs. These actions build on the
Office of Management and Budget and the United States Digital Service’s
(USDS) Life Experience project to support Americans Facing a Financial
Shock. 

The Biden-Harris Administration is also identifying opportunities for
States to take additional policy actions to streamline the process of
accessing benefits or use existing data sources to verify information
rather than requiring it from users. 

Effective federal and state strategies for improving customer service
can improve efficiency and achieve three benefits:

-   **Reducing the burden on residents**, so they do not need to produce
    paperwork to get or keep their benefits and establish facts that the
    state knows or should know;
-   **Reducing the burden on state agencies**, so they can focus on
    areas of greatest human need and greatest fraud risk; and
-   **Reducing risk of error and fraud**, as simpler applications
    generate fewer unintentional mistakes, automatic verifications can
    be more accurate, and streamlined processes free staff to focus on
    the riskiest cases and at-scale benefits fraud.

**Highlights from the Biden-Harris Administration Record**

*Policy Changes*:

-   On March 27, 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    issued a [final
    rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/03/27/biden-harris-administration-builds-success-affordable-care-act-streamlining-enrollment-medicaid-chip-coverage.html)
    to **protect and improve how millions of eligible people apply**
    for, renew, and maintain their Medicaid coverage. The rule reduces
    red tape and simplifies applications, verifications, enrollment, and
    renewals for health care coverage through Medicaid and the
    Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). It also expands access
    to coverage for children in CHIP by eliminating waiting periods,
    coverage lockouts for non-payment of premiums, and annual and
    lifetime benefit limits.

<!-- -->

-   HHS [finalized a
    rule](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/fact-sheet/2024-ccdf-final-rule-fact-sheet)
    strengthening the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG)
    program, which supports over a million children and their families
    each month with child care assistance. The rule makes it easier for
    families to access CCDBG subsidies by encouraging states to
    streamline eligibility and enrollment processes and reduce red tape
    that can disrupt parent employment, training, and education. The
    final rule also encourages states to adopt a policy of presumptive
    eligibility for child care subsidies, considerably lowering the
    burden for families to receive the subsidy, particularly for
    families experiencing homelessness.

*Implementation Support:*

-   The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) partnered with
    USDS to help numerous states make their systems more accurate and
    efficient – increasing monthly auto-renewal, or *ex parte,* rates by
    an average of 21% and decreasing procedural termination rates by an
    average of 10%. In 2024, these improvements are projected to **save
    over two million hours of state worker time** and enable states to
    **renew health coverage with less red tape for over five million
    eligible individuals**.

<!-- -->

-   USDS and CMS discovered and helped states fix a systems issue that
    impacted 29 states and was responsible for improper loss of coverage
    for over **400,000 children and families** in Medicaid and CHIP. As
    a result, improperly disenrolled individuals regained their coverage
    and retroactively had their coverage reinstated for their period of
    improper disenrollment.

<!-- -->

-   In Spring 2024, USDS will launch pilots to improve income
    verification for federal benefit programs. The pilots will test and
    measure new approaches to improve incoming reporting, electronic
    verification for self-employed workers, coordination of federal
    benefit services, and reducing barriers to federal benefit programs.

<!-- -->

-   In April 2024, USDA expects to release the Request for Applications
    for Fiscal Year 2024 Process and Technology Improvement Grants,
    which will award a total of $5 million in grants to between 5 and 12
    awardees to simplify SNAP application and eligibility determination
    systems.

<!-- -->

-   In March 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) launched the new [Direct File Pilot
    Program](https://directfile.irs.gov/) in partnership with USDS to
    help Americans file their taxes for free. Made possible by President
    Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, Direct File provides a free, secure
    option for an estimated 19 million taxpayers in 12 states to file
    their taxes directly with the IRS. Initial users have saved hundreds
    of dollars and reported that the tool is simple and straightforward
    to use.  

<!-- -->

-   USDS partnered with the Social Security Administration (SSA) to
    makes it easier for Americans to use the SSA website to apply for
    benefits, sign up for Medicare, and apply for Supplemental Security
    Income (SSI), resulting in a 52.8% increase in customer satisfaction
    among the 180 million annual visitors to SSA.gov. This work included
    creating a more user-friendly eligibility process so that more SSA
    customers start an online application when they discover they may be
    eligible for benefits.

<!-- -->

-   In 2022, through a partnership between USDS and the U.S. Postal
    Service, the Biden-Harris Administration delivered over 800 million
    COVID-19 test kits for free to households across the U.S. through an
    easy. website.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched a new [Health and
    Benefits mobile
    app](https://mobile.va.gov/app/va-health-and-benefits) that makes it
    easier for Veterans to access benefits, including managing
    disability claims and appeals. The app has more than 2 million
    downloads, with almost a million monthly active users who send over
    300,000 secure messages and refill over a quarter of a million
    prescriptions each month.

**An Agenda for States** **to Improve Access to Safety Net Programs**

While the federal government has a key role to play in improving
benefits delivery, states have a number of opportunities to improve
benefits delivery as well.

State leaders are encouraged to consider the following options to
improve access to **nutrition assistance**:

-   **Adopting SNAP options available under** **current law,** such as
    simplifying reporting requirements and assigning the longest
    certification periods of 12 months for most households and up to 36
    months for some older adults and individuals with disabilities.
    Reducing verification workloads by applying the standard medical
    expense amount for elderly or disabled individuals with expenses
    over $35 without requiring receipts, and opting in to USDA’s
    national SNAP Earnings Verification Service (EVS) contract through
    the Work Number, which provides access to two commercial databases
    as a lower cost way to conduct income verification services in order
    to verify earned income sources and amounts for SNAP applicants and
    recipients. 

<!-- -->

-   **Streamlining eligibility verification processes by implementing
    data sharing agreements** with other state agencies to verify
    eligibility and circumstances. Implementing [data sharing
    agreements](https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/data-sharing) necessary to
    allow state agencies that administer Medicaid, TANF, and SNAP to
    automatically enroll eligible people in WIC.

<!-- -->

-   **Aligning asset limit for SNAP** **Households with TANF-funded
    benefits** to reduce the burden of providing numerous verifications
    for the same data that add time and complexity to the eligibility
    determination process, and to avoid discouraging households from
    building savings that support financial security. Thirty-seven
    states and the District of Columbia have aligned their SNAP asset
    limits with programs that do not have asset limits for most
    recipients and four states have aligned their assets limits with
    programs that have higher asset limits. Other states have also
    aligned their SNAP gross income limit up to 200 percent of the
    federal poverty line to remove participation barriers for low-income
    households with high housing and dependent care expenses, streamline
    caseload processing, and bring additional federal funding into their
    communities.

<!-- -->

-   **Implementing new WIC flexibilities that allow for more flexibility
    in providing services remotely** to increase convenience, such as
    allowing for WIC benefits and nutrition education to be delivered
    virtually.

State leaders can further improve customers’ experience of benefit
programs by taking the following steps to improve access to **health**
**programs**:

-   Use SNAP administrative data to automatically certify Medicaid
    eligibility.

<!-- -->

-   Use Social Security data on enrollment in Medicare, Supplemental
    Security Income, and the Low-Income Subsidy as an application for
    Medicare Savings Programs (MSP), in compliance with the 2023 final
    rule to streamline MSP application and enrollment.

Sustained improvement in benefits access and customer experience
requires changes across policy, operations, technology, staffing,
procurement, and more. Best practices include integrated access through
a common application for multiple programs and automating participant
renewals using available data to pre-populate renewal forms. They also
include implementing organizational and systemic improvements like using
behavioral science and human-centered design methods for process
streamlining, supporting culture change across staff that centers on
high standards for customer experience (CX), and facilitating
cross-agency collaboration to coordinate common efforts that improve
benefits access.
