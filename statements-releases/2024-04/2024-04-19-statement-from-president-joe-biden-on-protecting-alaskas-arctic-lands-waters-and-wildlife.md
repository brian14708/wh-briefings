title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Protecting Alaska\u2019s Arctic Lands,\
  \ Waters, and\_Wildlife"
---
 
Alaska’s majestic and rugged lands and waters are among the most
remarkable and healthy landscapes in the world, sustaining a vibrant
subsistence economy for Alaska Native communities. These natural wonders
demand our protection. I am proud that my Administration is taking
action to conserve more than 13 million acres in the Western Arctic and
to honor the culture, history, and enduring wisdom of Alaska Natives who
have lived on and stewarded these lands since time immemorial. From
safeguarding sacred lands near the Grand Canyon to protecting Alaskan
treasures, my Administration has conserved more than 41 million acres of
lands and waters. But as the climate crisis imperils communities across
the country, more must be done. My Administration will continue to take
ambitious action to meet the urgency of the climate crisis, protect
America’s lands and waters, and fulfill our responsibility to the next
generation of Americans.
