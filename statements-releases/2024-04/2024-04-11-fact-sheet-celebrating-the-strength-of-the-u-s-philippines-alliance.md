---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden welcomed President Ferdinand R. Marcos,
Jr. of the Philippines back to the White House. The two Presidents
marked the unprecedented strength of the Alliance between the United
States and the Philippines and underscored the historic achievements in
bilateral relations since they last met at the White House in May 2023. 
President Biden and President Marcos intend to continue the momentous
investments into the special friendship between our two nations.
         
    
**PROMOTING INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH**  
   
The United States and the Philippines are working together to promote
inclusive economic growth in both our countries, including through the
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) launched in 2022.
The two leaders celebrate significant achievements in our economic
partnership:   
 

-   **Investing in High-Quality Infrastructure: ** Today, Japan, the
    Philippines, and the United States announced the first Partnership
    for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) corridor in the
    Indo-Pacific—the Luzon Economic Corridor—which will support
    connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila, and Batangas in the
    Philippines. Through this corridor, part of the PGI-IPEF Investment
    Accelerator, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States commit to
    accelerating coordinated investments in high-impact infrastructure
    projects, including rail; ports modernization; clean energy and
    semiconductor supply chains and deployments; agribusiness; and
    civilian port upgrades at Subic Bay.  
-   Over the last year, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)
    announced new activities that will leverage over $500 million from
    the public and private sector to develop high-quality infrastructure
    in the Philippines. These activities support renewable energy, smart
    grids, vessel traffic management system upgrades, customs and supply
    chain modernization, healthcare solutions, and aviation
    infrastructure. To further these and future efforts, USTDA opened a
    new office at the U.S. Embassy in Manila in early 2024.  
-   The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is
    committed to mobilizing private sector investment in the
    Philippines, especially in priority sectors like infrastructure,
    critical minerals, and renewable energy. DFC is proud to announce a
    new $20 million loan to promote affordable housing throughout the
    country, bringing DFC’s total commitments in the Philippines to $80
    million. DFC also intends to open a regional office in the
    Philippines to facilitate further investment across the country.  
-   **Presidential Trade and Investment Mission:** Following through on
    the commitment made when the two leaders met in May 2023, U.S.
    Secretary of Commerce Raimondo led a Presidential Trade and
    Investment Mission (PTIM) to Manila in March 2024. The delegation of
    22 U.S. companies and organizations highlighted more than $1 billion
    in combined investments that promote the Philippines’ innovation
    economy, clean energy transition, and supply chain resilience.  
-   **Indo-Pacific Business Forum:** The United States and the
    Philippines will co-host the Indo-Pacific Business Forum (IPBF) in
    Manila on May 21, 2024. The IPBF is the U.S. government’s premier
    business event in the Indo-Pacific region and will include over 500
    senior business executives and government officials from across the
    region, supporting infrastructure in the region’s emerging economies
    and highlighting the economic ties that have contributed to
    prosperity and interconnectedness in the Indo-Pacific.  
-   **Semiconductors Cooperation:** In November 2023, the United States
    began a new partnership with the Philippines to explore
    opportunities to grow and diversify the global semiconductor
    ecosystem under the International Technology Security and Innovation
    (ITSI) Fund, created by the CHIPS Act of 2022. The United States has
    since partnered with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
    Development to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the
    Philippines’ existing semiconductor ecosystem, as well as with
    Arizona State University to bolster workforce capacity and create a
    pipeline of new talent for the semiconductor sector in the
    Philippines.  
-   **Critical Minerals:** USTDA is supporting a grant to Eramen
    Minerals Inc. to develop an ore-to-nickel and cobalt processing
    plant for the production of critical minerals that are key elements
    in the supply chain for batteries and energy storage systems.  The
    State Department, under its Energy and Mineral Governance Program,
    provides technical assistance on nickel sector policy
    considerations, copper commercialization, fiscal regime development,
    and environmental and data management of the Philippine critical
    minerals sector. In addition, $5 million in USAID programming is
    helping to improve the Philippine business environment and
    governance standards to facilitate investments in minerals
    processing and other downstream industries.  
-   **Support from U.S. Industry:**  Private sector investment is a key
    element to promote economic development and growth in the
    Philippines. Our two countries are enhancing economic and commercial
    ties and welcome recent private sector investments in the
    Philippines to include:  
-   **Meta’s** announcement of its investment in the Pacific Light Cable
    Network international submarine cable system intends to support the
    Philippine government’s new National Fiber Backbone Phase 1. This
    project would connect the United States with locations on the
    Philippine island of Luzon, the most populous island and home to
    Manila. The National Fiber Backbone Phase 1 is estimated to be
    launched on April 19, 2024 and is planned to be one of the longest
    direct cable systems in the world, strengthening the digital
    connection between the United States and the Philippines.  
-   **United Parcel Service (UPS)**, a PTIM participant, announced in
    March that it had agreed with the Luzon International Premiere
    Airport Development Corporation to expand its operations at Clark
    International Airport in the Philippines. The move is expected to
    strengthen UPS’ portfolio of integrated express, supply chain, and
    healthcare logistics services, enhancing time in transit and
    improving service reliability. Construction of the new Clark hub is
    expected to begin in February 2025, and it is expected to be
    operational in late 2026.   
-   **GreenFire Energy, Inc.,** a geothermal energy systems developer
    and PTIM participant, is implementing a letter of intent signed in
    February 2024 to supply Philippine steel company SteelAsia with
    geothermal power from GreenFire’s projects in the Philippines.  
-   **Astranis**, which builds telecommunications satellites, plans to
    launch a communications satellite in summer 2024. The company’s
    Philippines-based partner, Orbits Corp, plans to use the satellite
    to bring digital connectivity to rural and remote sites across the
    Philippines. Astranis is building, testing, and readying the
    satellite—named Agila, for the Philippine national bird—for its
    summer launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

**INVESTING IN CLEAN ENERGY AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES**  
  
The United States and the Philippines recognize the need to deepen
technology cooperation, advance the clean energy transition, address and
mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, and meet the emerging
opportunities of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The two leaders welcome
recent milestones in advancing our clean energy and technology
partnership:  

-   **Supporting Secure and Reliable Networks:**  The United States,
    subject to Congressional notification, and Japan, with support from
    Japanese industry, intend to provide at least $8 million for Open
    Radio Access Network (RAN) field trials and the Asia Open RAN
    Academy based in Manila, to enable future commercial deployment and
    an open, interoperable, secure, reliable, and trusted information
    communications technology ecosystem in the Philippines. This builds
    on prior U.S. and Japanese investment of over $9 million for these
    projects in the Philippines.  
-   **Civil-Nuclear Cooperation:** In November 2023, our two countries
    signed a “123” civil-nuclear cooperation agreement, which, once in
    force, will facilitate U.S.-Philippine civil-nuclear energy
    cooperation and support climate and clean energy transition goals
    while securing the Philippine’s energy future. In addition, to
    support the Philippines civil nuclear sector, the Philippine
    Department of Energy intends to sign a memorandum of understanding
    with the Philippine-American Educational Foundation to promote
    capacity building and workforce development through scholarships and
    academic exchanges through the Fulbright Program. Under the
    Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular
    Reactor Technology (FIRST) program, the United States and Japan plan
    to co-host a nuclear energy study tour in Japan for nuclear experts
    and policy decision-makers from the Philippines and other FIRST
    partner countries.  
-   **Increasing Renewable Energy Capacity:** As part of the
    Philippines’ efforts to address its energy needs, USAID and the
    Philippines have partnered and launched the Green Energy Auction
    Program (GEAP). The first and second round of auctions held under
    GEAP resulted in 5,300 megawatts of renewable energy projects that
    will be developed between 2024 to 2026, increasing the Philippines’
    renewable energy capacity by 65 percent. USAID and the U.S.
    Department of Energy are also working with the Philippines to
    develop the next phase of competitive renewable energy zones by
    supporting transmission planning to unlock the Philippines’
    tremendous offshore wind potential. In addition, USTDA supported
    renewable energy activities across the Philippines, including two
    grants for the Philippines Energy Development Corporation to develop
    geothermal energy, a grant to Aboitiz Renewables focused on offshore
    wind power, a grant to the Rural Electrification Finance Corporation
    for utility-scale solar power plants with energy storage systems,
    and funding for an upcoming trade mission to the United States
    focused on advanced grid technologies.  
-   **Cyber-Digital Cooperation: ** The Philippines joined the
    International Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI), the largest cyber
    partnership in the world, in April 2024. The CRI builds collective
    resilience and helps design policy approaches to combat ransomware.
    The United States and the Philippines plan to hold their first
    bilateral Cyber-Digital Dialogue in July 2024 in Washington. This
    dialogue focuses on helping strengthen the Philippines’ resilience
    against cyber intrusions from state-backed and criminal
    organizations and advance an open, interoperable, secure, reliable,
    and trusted information communications technology ecosystem in the
    Philippines. Supporting this work, USTDA is providing a grant to NOW
    Telecom Company, Inc., for a feasibility study to help develop a
    secure nationwide 5G network in the Philippines utilizing equipment
    from trusted vendors. Also, USAID has established eight community
    digital networks to expand internet access to remote locations in
    the Philippines, bringing 1,470 households online for the first
    time.  
-   **U.S.-Philippines Space Dialogue:**  The United States and the
    Philippines plan to hold our first bilateral space dialogue in May
    2024 to advance cooperation on using space-based technology for
    disaster management, mapping of resources, pollution monitoring, the
    use of space for maritime domain awareness, and other areas.

**EXPANDING DEFENSE AND SECURITY COOPERATION**  
  
U.S.-Philippine defense and security ties serve as the cornerstone of
our alliance. As the United States and the Philippines work to ensure a
free and open Indo-Pacific region, the two leaders herald advancements
in our cooperation:  

-   **EDCA Sites Advancing Mutual Security and Local Investments:**
    Since signing the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) in
    2014, the Department of Defense has allocated $109 million toward
    infrastructure projects at EDCA sites, including more than $59
    million for airfield improvement at Basa Air Base, which will
    increase interoperability with the Armed Forces of the Philippines
    (AFP) and enable Basa to serve as a logistics hub for humanitarian
    assistance, disaster relief, and other crisis response. The
    President’s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2025 includes an
    additional $128 million for infrastructure projects.  USAID will
    launch a new initiative in the next year to preposition humanitarian
    relief commodities at an EDCA site for Philippine civilian disaster
    response authorities to help provide urgent assistance to the
    Filipino people if needed in times of crisis. Prepositioning of
    commodities, combined with strengthened Philippines’ humanitarian
    assistance and disaster response capacity, including for
    EDCA-hosting communities, will contribute to greater crisis
    resilience and more effective crisis response. In partnership with
    DoD, USAID will also increase civilian-military disaster response
    trainings to enhance fluency with response systems between
    Philippine and U.S. civilian and military agencies and international
    humanitarian organizations. In addition, USAID has several ongoing
    projects in and around communities hosting EDCA sites, as it does
    throughout the Philippines, in the areas of health, education,
    economic growth, and environment.  
-   **Bolstering Maritime Cooperative Activities:** Over the past year,
    the United States and the Philippines increased their cooperation in
    the South China Sea to historic levels, including a complex
    multilateral maritime cooperative activity between Australia, Japan,
    the Philippines, and the United States.  Additionally, U.S. and
    Philippine forces conducted their first-ever combined intelligence,
    surveillance, and reconnaissance mission over the South China Sea. 
    Our joint efforts demonstrate resolve, strengthen bilateral security
    ties, and expand multilateral cooperation and training among
    likeminded partners.  
-   **Implementing Trilateral Coast Guard Exercises:** The Philippine
    Coast Guard hosted coordinated port visits by USCG Cutter *Stratton*
    and Japan Coast Guard vessel *Akitsushima* in Manila in June 2023.
    Following the port visit and underway preparations, the visiting
    ships joined Philippine Coast Guard vessels for the first-ever
    trilateral at-sea coast guard exercise. As part of this first-ever
    exercise, our three countries held interoperability drills in
    communications and search and rescue activities. In the coming year,
    the United States looks forward to welcoming Philippine and Japan
    Coast Guard members onto a U.S. Coast Guard vessel during a patrol
    in the Indo-Pacific and our coast guards also plan to conduct an
    at-sea trilateral exercise and other maritime activities in the
    Indo-Pacific to improve interoperability and advance maritime
    security and safety.  
-   **Enhancing Coast Guard Cooperation and Training:** The U.S.
    Department of State, Department of Defense, and Coast Guard
    inaugurated a technical training center for the Philippine Coast
    Guard Fleet in September 2023. The center has hosted approximately
    200 students for various vessel-related training courses since its
    opening and builds Philippine capacity and capabilities in operating
    and maintaining its rapidly expanding inventory of vessels deployed
    throughout the country and in the South China Sea.

**INVESTING IN PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE TIES**  
  
Our two countries benefit from unique, shared bonds of friendship and
community, to include the millions of Filipino-Americans who enrich
communities across the United States and serve as the bedrock of our
relationship. The two leaders are proud of recent achievements in our
people-to-people ties:     

-   **Investing in the Next Generation of Philippines Leaders:** State
    Department educational and cultural exchange programs provide
    learning and networking opportunities to emerging Filipino leaders.
    The Philippines’ Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative Network
    (YSEALI PH) has grown to over 31,000 members, spanning a broad range
    of Philippine geographic regions and professional areas. This
    includes increasing numbers of YSEALI affiliated local government
    leaders, with 80 YSEALI alumni currently serving in local
    governments nationwide. The YSEALI Academic Fellowship will have 38
    participants from the Philippines in 2024, and the Southeast Asia
    Youth Leadership Program (SEAYLP) will include six participants from
    the Philippines. Our 9,000 exchange alumni include high-level
    Philippine leaders, including Vice President Sara Duterte, two
    sitting senators, and leaders of numerous prominent Philippine
    institutions from academic institutions to startups.  
-   **Higher-Education Partnerships:** USAID launched UPSKILL, a
    five-year activity in February 2024, intended to strengthen higher
    education institutions in the Philippines, and make them key drivers
    of growth by improving their innovation, workforce development, and
    community extension work. UPSKILL creates partnerships between
    Philippine universities and U.S. universities such as Arizona State
    University, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State
    University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  
-   **Friends, Partners, Allies Reporting Tour:** The United States
    plans to host an exchange program of ten Filipino journalists for a
    reporting tour in May 2024. The delegation will visit Washington,
    D.C., Los Angeles, and Honolulu to deepen their knowledge of
    people-to-people ties, economic partnerships, and security
    cooperation.

    Agency provided funding for scholarship and training programs in the
    fields of space science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in
    addition to related fields such as space law and policy, business,
    economics, international relations and diplomacy, and
    communications. These initial resources are intended to support
    approximately eight students and scholars to pursue study and
    research in these fields at educational institutions in the United
    States.

**ADVANCING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND LABOR RIGHTS**  
  
The United States and the Philippines are committed to our shared values
of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights, labor rights, and
the rule of law. These values form the foundation of our bilateral
relationship.  

-   **U.S.-Philippines Democracy Dialogue:** Following through on our
    commitment from 2023, the United States and the Philippines intend
    to convene a bilateral Democracy Dialogue in 2024. The Dialogue
    provides a platform for the United States and the Philippines to
    institutionalize discussions on human rights and democracy issues,
    as well as identify initiatives that can be pursued jointly to
    complement national efforts on the promotion and protection of human
    rights.  
-   **U.S.-Philippines Labor Working Group:** Under the U.S.-Philippines
    Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, the United States and the
    Philippines created a Labor Working Group to accelerate
    implementation of internationally recognized labor rights and
    facilitate dialogue among the Philippine and U.S. governments and
    labor unions. The Labor Working Group had its first meeting in
    December 2023 and plans to hold its next meeting in Manila in May
    2024.  
-   **U.S. Support for the BARMM Peace Process:** In March 2024, the
    U.S. Department of State and the Government of the Philippines
    launched the Peace Accords Matrix Mindanao program which emphasizes
    the importance of respecting human rights and seeks to protect the
    rights of those living in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim
    Mindanao (BARMM) by fully implementing the 2014 Peace Agreement.
    Implemented by the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies
    with the Joint Normalization Committee and the Presidential Advisor
    on Peace Reconciliation and Unity, the Peace Accords Matrix program
    will train civil society to monitor and accelerate implementation of
    the Peace Agreement before the first-ever elections for the BARMM
    Parliament and the “Exit Agreement,” both scheduled for 2025.
