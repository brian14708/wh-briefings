Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer hosted Colombian
Acting Foreign Minister Luis Murillo and his delegation at the White
House on April 11, 2024 for the United States-Colombia High-Level
Strategic Dialogue. Mr. Finer was joined by Assistant Secretary Brian
Nichols of the Department of State, Assistant Secretary Blas Nunez-Neto
of the Department of Homeland Security, and National Security Council
Senior Director for Western Hemisphere Affairs Daniel Erikson.  The
delegations discussed ways to strengthen their collaboration on
migration, peace and security, and reviewed recent regional
developments, including in Venezuela.  During the meeting, Mr. Finer
thanked Colombia for its leadership on migration issues, including its
plans to provide new lawful pathways to reduce irregular migration in
the region.  Mr. Finer also welcomed Colombia’s extension of the three
Safe Mobility Offices (SMOs) in Colombia, an initiative that the
Biden-Harris Administration launched in June 2023 to facilitate
safe, orderly, and lawful migration to the United States and other
countries.  The United States-Colombia High-Level Strategic Dialogue
helped further our shared bilateral goals across a diverse set of topics
of mutual interest in advance of the United States-Colombia High-Level
Dialogue in Bogota planned for May.
