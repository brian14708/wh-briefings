title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Protect\
  \ U.S. Steel and Shipbuilding Industry from China\u2019s Unfair\_Practices"

*Call to triple the tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from
China*

*United States Trade Representative to investigate China’s unfair
shipbuilding practices*

President Biden knows that steel is the backbone of the American
economy, and a bedrock of our national security. American steel fueled
the country’s industrialization and helped build the middle class.
American-made steel remains critical for our economic and national
security. American companies must lead the future of more sustainable
steel. This green steel will fortify the infrastructure that supports
our communities, form the ocean vessels that transport American goods,
power the electric vehicles of our clean-energy future, and support
thousands of hardworking American families.  
   
President Biden is making historic investments in American steel and
manufacturing that are a sharp contrast with the previous
Administration. While the previous Administration failed to deliver an
infrastructure bill, President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act are spurring hundreds
of billions of dollars in private-sector manufacturing and clean energy
investments. Under President Biden, investments in construction of new
factories have more than doubled—after falling under the previous
Administration even before the pandemic—while nearly 800,000
manufacturing jobs have been created and construction employment is at a
record high. Our trade deficit with China is the lowest it’s been in
over a decade—lower than any year under the previous Administration.
President Biden’s strategic trade and investment agenda protects
workers, consumers, and businesses from unfair competition.  
   
At the same time, American workers in the steel and aluminum industries
face a significant challenge from Chinese exports of steel and aluminum
which are among the most emissions-intensive products in the world.
China’s overcapacity and non-market investments in the steel and
aluminum industries mean high-quality U.S. products have to compete with
artificially low-priced alternatives produced with higher carbon
emissions.  
   
Steel is a critical input for our domestic shipbuilding industry—from
the commercial shipping vessels that carry American products, to the
U.S. naval vessels that keep global seas safe. Commercial shipyards
provide industrial capacity for maintaining the U.S. Navy’s dominance
and support thousands of suppliers and jobs.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes growing concerns that unfair
Chinese trade practices, including flooding the market with
below-market-cost steel, are distorting the global shipbuilding market
and eroding competition. These concerns were outlined in a
[petition](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/march/statement-ambassador-katherine-tai-petition-filed-under-section-301-related-peoples-republic-chinas)
to the U.S. Trade Representative from five labor unions requesting an
investigation into Chinese acts, policies, and practices in the
maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors.  
   
In response to China’s unfair practices, today the Biden-Harris
Administration is taking new, historic actions to support American steel
manufacturing and shipbuilding.  

-   **President Biden is calling on the USTR to consider tripling the
    existing 301 tariff rate on Chinese steel and aluminum.** The
    current average tariff on certain steel and aluminum products is
    7.5% under Section 301. American workers continue to face unfair
    competition from Chinese imports of steel and aluminum products,
    which are among the world’s most emissions-intensive. Chinese
    policies and subsidies for their domestic steel and aluminum
    industries means high-quality U.S. products are undercut by
    artificially low-priced Chinese alternatives produced with higher
    emissions. To the extent consistent with the United States Trade
    Representative’s (USTR) review of Section 301 tariffs and findings
    of her investigation, President Biden is calling for USTR to
    consider enhancing the effectiveness of tariffs on Chinese steel and
    aluminum products by tripling them.

-   **President Biden’s Department of Commerce is taking action against
    countries and importers that do not play by the rules and flood the
    market with cheap products.** Since President Biden took office, the
    Department of Commerce has imposed over 30 anti-dumping and
    countervailing duties on steel-related products. These are tariffs
    on steel imports that are priced below the fair and competitive
    value. The Department of Commerce has also conducted nearly 27
    investigations into anti-competitive actions by Chinese exporters
    and efforts by countries like China to evade trade rules.

-   **President Biden is directing his senior team to work with Mexico
    to jointly prevent China’s and other countries’ evasion of tariffs
    on steel and aluminum that is imported from Mexico into the United
    States. **This is a growing challenge that must be addressed to
    prevent Chinese and others’ steel exports from gaining access to the
    U.S. market and evading Section 232 or Section 301 tariffs.
    President Biden recently sent senior members of his administration
    to Mexico to address this issue.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States Trade Representative is initiating an
    investigation into China’s unfair trade practices in shipbuilding,
    maritime and logistics sectors.** This investigation follows a
    petition filed by the United Steelworkers (USW) and four other
    unions who claim the Government of China’s drive to dominate the
    global shipbuilding, maritime, and logistics sector is built on
    non-market policies that are far more aggressive and interventionist
    than any other country. President Biden believes it is critical to
    understand China’s uniquely aggressive set of interventions in these
    sectors, and to take actions that address distortions to the global
    market for commercial vessels, maritime shipping, and logistics that
    harm American workers and shipbuilders.

<!-- -->

-   **President Biden is committed to maintaining strong American steel
    companies powered by American steel workers.** In light of the
    proposed sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel, President Biden will
    continue to make clear that U.S. Steel has been an iconic American
    steel company for more than a century, and that it is vital for it
    to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and
    operated.

-   **President Biden is investing in clean American-made steel.**
    Today’s announcements build on the Administration’s commitments to
    green steel production. The Biden-Harris Administration, through the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act,
    recently
    [announced](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-6-billion-transform-americas-industrial-sector)
    up to $1.5 billion for six clean iron and steel projects as part of
    a historic broader investment to lower emissions from
    energy-intensive industries. These projects are set to demonstrate
    innovative technologies that can eliminate the vast majority of
    emissions from steelmaking, and enable the industry to phase out
    more traditional carbon-intensive production methods. They will
    support the economic comeback of steel communities in Pennsylvania,
    Ohio, and the South and Midwest, so the U.S. steel industry can
    remain competitive as the global leader in low-carbon iron and steel
    products.  
      
    These investments include up to $75 million for the only
    high-silicon grain oriented electrical steel plant in the U.S. in
    Lyndora, Pennsylvania that is sustaining more than 1,000 United
    Autoworker jobs at the Cleveland-Cliffs Butler Works plant and up to
    $500 million for the Cleveland-Cliffs plant in Middletown, Ohio to
    produce clean steel for the auto supply chain.
