title: "Readout of White\_House State Legislators Convening on Junk\_Fees"
---
 
Today, the White House convened state legislative leaders to discuss
state-level actions to address junk fees, building on the Biden-Harris
Administration’s unprecedented efforts to crack down on junk fees across
the economy to lower costs for Americans. National Economic Advisor Lael
Brainard, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra, Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) Chair Lina Khan, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, and state
legislators from across the country participated.  
  
President Biden is committed to taking on hidden junk fees that
companies sneak onto customer bills, and which the Council of Economic
Advisers estimates amount to more than $90 billion every year. These
fees occur across industries, from apartment rentals to concert tickets
to health insurance. Since the first [White House State Convening on

last March, the Administration has taken landmark actions to increase
transparency and eliminate these fees, including:

-   The CFPB [finalized a
    rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-bans-excessive-credit-card-late-fees-lowers-typical-fee-from-32-to-8/)
    capping credit card late fees at $8, saving the 45 million Americans
    who are charged these fees an average of $220 per year and $10
    billion overall. In January 2024, the agency proposed rules that
    would [bring overdraft
    fees](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-close-bank-overdraft-loophole-that-costs-americans-billions-each-year-in-junk-fees/)
    down to as low as $3 and [prohibit non-sufficient funds
    fees](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-stop-new-junk-fees-on-bank-accounts/)
    on transactions declined right at the swipe, tap, or click.  These
    actions build upon [more than $6.1 billion in annual
    savings](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/data-spotlight-overdraft-nsf-revenue-in-2023-down-more-than-50-versus-pre-pandemic-levels-saving-consumers-over-6-billion-annually/)
    in reduced and eliminated overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees as
    a result of the CFPB’s work.  Since the CFPB heightened its
    supervisory attention on overdraft and NSF fees in 2022, financial
    institutions have agreed to refund over $240 million to consumers  
-   The FTC [proposed a
    rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/10/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-junk-fees)
    that would prohibit companies from charging hidden and misleading
    fees and require that they display the full-price up front, and
    [finalized a
    rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/ftc-announces-cars-rule-fight-scams-vehicle-shopping)
    to ban hidden junk fees and bait-and-switch fees in car buying.  
-   Today, the Department of Transportation [finalized
    rules](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-rules-to-deliver-automatic-refunds-and-protect-consumers-from-surprise-junk-fees-in-air-travel/)
    that would require airlines to [clearly
    disclose](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-final-rule-protect-consumers-surprise-airline)
    baggage fees, change fees, and cancellation fees up front, and
    require airlines to
    [refund](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-final-rule-requiring-automatic-refunds-airline)
    for flight cancellations or significant delays.  
-   The Federal Communication Commission [finalized a
    rule](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401215A1.pdf)
    requiring that cable and satellite TV providers provide consumers
    with the “all-in” price for video programming services. In the same
    month, the agency [proposed a
    rule](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400915A1.pdf) that
    would ban bulk billing arrangements by internet, cable, and
    satellite service providers. In addition, the FCC has proposed rules
    to ban early termination fees for cable and TV satellite provides,
    and as of this month, large internet providers are [required to
    display
    labels](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-397551A1.pdf) at
    the point of sale for internet services that show the prices, fees,
    speeds, and other critical information under a new FCC rulemaking,
    so that consumers know what they are paying for up front.  
-   Last month, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and
    Treasury [finalized
    rules](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/03/2024-06551/short-term-limited-duration-insurance-and-independent-noncoordinated-excepted-benefits-coverage)
    to combat “junk health insurance” plans that deceive Americans into
    believing they have comprehensive coverage while leaving them on the
    hook for thousands of dollars in medical bills. Under the new rules,
    health insurance companies now have to provide consumers with a
    clear disclaimer explaining the limits of the services they cover
    and how much they cover.

Actions taken by the Administration will save Americans [over $20
billion per year on junk
fees](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/03/05/the-price-isnt-right-how-junk-fees-cost-consumers-and-undermine-competition/#:~:text=CEA%20estimates%20that%20ten%20specific,household%20per%20year%20on%20average.),
according to the Council of Economic Advisers. While the President is
committed to using every tool at his disposal to combat unfair and
deceptive pricing, he also believes that state-level actions are an
essential part of this mission. This legislative year, at least 12
states introduced legislation to curb junk fees and during the convening
state leaders shared steps they are taking to address junk fees in their
home states. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has introduced sweeping
price transparency legislation this session and called on the General
Assembly to bring it to a vote last month. Legislators in Arizona,
Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois have introduced
far-reaching legislation to combat hidden and misleading fees, and many
discussed progress in advancing legislation and the strong support from
constituents to tackle these issues. These bills combat junk fees across
multiple industries, protecting consumers in every corner of the
economy. White House officials thanked the state leaders for their work
and ongoing partnership on behalf of American families.
