Today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan convened the U.S.-Israel
Strategic Consultative Group (SCG) to consult on a series of issues in
the wake of Iran’s unprecedented missile and drone attack against
Israel. The Israeli side was led by Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron
Dermer and National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi. The discussion
began in a small group format to discuss the Iran attack and the
collective efforts to further enhance Israel’s defense through advanced
capabilities as well as cooperation with a broad coalition of military
partners. Mr. Sullivan also briefed the Israeli side on new sanctions
and other measures that began today, in coordination with Congress and
G7 capitals, following on the President’s call with G7 leaders held the
morning after Iran’s attack.

The two sides then broadened to include interagency delegations to
discuss Rafah. The two sides agreed on the shared objective to see Hamas
defeated in Rafah. U.S. participants expressed concerns with various
courses of action in Rafah, and Israeli participants agreed to take
these concerns into account and to have further follow up discussions
between experts, overseen by the SCG. Participants will meet again
soon.
