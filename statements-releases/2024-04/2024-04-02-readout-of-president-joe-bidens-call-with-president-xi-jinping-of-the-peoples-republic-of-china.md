  \ People\u2019s Republic of\_China"
---
 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Xi Jinping of
the People’s Republic of China (PRC).  The call follows the two leaders’
meeting in Woodside, California in November 2023.  The two leaders held
a candid and constructive discussion on a range of bilateral, regional,
and global issues, including areas of cooperation and areas of
difference.  They reviewed and encouraged progress on key issues
discussed at the Woodside Summit, including counternarcotics
cooperation, ongoing military-to-military communication, talks to
address AI-related risks, and continuing efforts on climate change and
people-to-people exchanges.  
   
President Biden emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait and the rule of law and freedom of
navigation in the South China Sea.  He raised concerns over the PRC’s
support for Russia’s defense industrial base and its impact on European
and transatlantic security, and he emphasized the United States’
enduring commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula.  President Biden also raised continued concerns about the
PRC’s unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices, which
harm American workers and families.  The President emphasized that the
United States will continue to take necessary actions to prevent
advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national
security, without unduly limiting trade and investment. The two leaders
welcomed ongoing efforts to maintain open channels of communication and
responsibly manage the relationship through high-level diplomacy and
working-level consultations in the weeks and months ahead, including
during upcoming visits by Secretary Yellen and Secretary Blinken.
