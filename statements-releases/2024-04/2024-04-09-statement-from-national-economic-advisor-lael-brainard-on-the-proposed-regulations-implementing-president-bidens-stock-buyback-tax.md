title: "Statement from National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard on the Proposed Regulations\
  \ Implementing President\_Biden\u2019s Stock Buyback\_Tax"

The Trump tax cuts’ giveaways to large corporations led to record high
stock buybacks. President Biden’s stock buyback tax will encourage
companies to invest in workers and the U.S. economy, rather than paying
out stock buybacks to wealthy investors, and make corporations pay more
of their fair share. The Treasury Department’s [proposed
regulations](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2244) are a
key step toward implementing President Biden’s tax fairness agenda.
