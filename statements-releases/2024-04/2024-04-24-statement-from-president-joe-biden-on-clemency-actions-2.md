title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Clemency\_Actions"
---
 
America is a Nation founded on the promise of second chances. During
Second Chance Month, we reaffirm our commitment to rehabilitation and
reentry for people returning to their communities post incarceration. We
also recommit to building a criminal justice system that lives up to
those ideals and ensures that everyone receives equal justice under law.
That is why today I am announcing steps I am taking to make this promise
a reality.

I am using my clemency power to pardon 11 individuals and commute the
sentences of 5 individuals who were convicted of non-violent drug
offenses. Many of these individuals received disproportionately longer
sentences than they would have under current law, policy, and practice.
The pardon recipients have demonstrated their commitment to improving
their lives and positively transforming their communities. The
commutation recipients have shown that they are deserving of forgiveness
and the chance at building a brighter future for themselves beyond
prison walls.

Like my other clemency actions, these pardons and commutations reflect
my overarching commitment to addressing racial disparities and improving
public safety. While today’s announcement marks important and continued
progress, my Administration will continue to review clemency petitions
and deliver reforms in a manner that advances equal justice, supports
rehabilitation and reentry, and provides meaningful second chances.
