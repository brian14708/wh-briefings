title: "Readout of Vice President Harris\u2019s Call with President Herzog of\_Israel"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with President Isaac Herzog of
Israel. She extended Passover greetings to him and the people of Israel.
The Vice President noted that this Passover—a holiday when the history
of persecution of Jews is recounted—is especially painful and resonant
given the brutal Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, during which Hamas
killed more than 1200 innocent people, including 44 Americans, took 240
people hostage, including Americans, and committed horrific acts of
sexual violence.

They discussed developments in the Middle East and the Vice President
underscored the Biden-Harris Administration’s unwavering commitment to
Israel’s security, including international efforts to ensure Israel can
defend itself against Iran and its proxies, and welcomed the
supplemental funding package passed by the House of Representatives. The
Vice President reiterated her deep concerns about the humanitarian
situation in Gaza and discussed steps to increase the flow of
life-saving humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians and ensure its
safe distribution. The Vice President reaffirmed that we are working to
establish an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza as part of a deal
that releases hostages and enables the delivery of additional
humanitarian aid. Following her meeting earlier this month with families
of Americans taken hostage on October 7, the Vice President underscored
our commitment to secure the release of all hostages and bring home the
remains of those deceased.

The Vice President and President Herzog discussed recent developments in
the United States, including deplorable cases of harassment and calls
for violence against Jews. The Vice President condemned this
reprehensible Antisemitism as well as the rise in Antisemitism around
the world, and she underscored her and President Biden’s commitment to
speak out against it. The Vice President and President Herzog agreed to
work together to combat Antisemitism and hate in all forms.
