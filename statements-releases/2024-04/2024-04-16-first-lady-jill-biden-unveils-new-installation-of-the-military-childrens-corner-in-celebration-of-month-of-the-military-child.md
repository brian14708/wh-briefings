*As part of Dr. Biden’s Joining Forces initiative, The Military
Children’s Corner features artwork from ten military-connected children*

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In honor of Month of the Military Child, First Lady
Jill Biden announced today a new installment of ***The Military
Children’s Corner,* **an art display at the White House dedicated to our
nation’s military children. Titled *A View from My Window, *Dr. Biden’s
second installation features artwork created by ten military children
that depicts their unique experiences serving alongside their parent or
family member in uniform.

“Through every new deployment, neighborhood, and school, military
children serve alongside their parents. In the artwork we feature in
*The Military Children’s Corner*, we see a glimpse of the world through
their eyes,” **said First Lady Jill Biden.** “This Month of the Military
Child – and every month – may we recognize their service and sacrifice,
and continue giving military children the recognition, support, and
opportunities they deserve.”

Unveiled in September 2023, *[The Military
Children’s Corner ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/26/first-lady-jill-biden-announces-new-white-house-art-display-dedicated-to-military-children/)*is
part of Dr. Biden’s [*Joining
Forces*](http://whitehouse.gov/joiningforces) initiative to support
military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. This is a
continuation of Dr. Biden’s tradition of leveraging art as an
educational tool to help Americans learn about the experiences of the
four million military-connected children whose parents are active-duty
service members, National Guard or reservists, or veterans. *A View from
my Window* was created in partnership with the [National Military Family
Association](https://www.militaryfamily.org/) (NMFA)
and [Bloom,](https://www.bloommilitaryteens.org/) a program of NMFA
dedicated to elevating the voices of military teens.

*The Military Children’s Corner *features artwork from the following
military children:

-   **Addison**, age 14, Joint Base Charleston – Summerville, SC 
-   **Ayslin**, age 15, White Sands Missile Range – Farmington, NM
-   **Elisabeth**, age 16, Fort Leavenworth – Leavenworth, KS
-   **Elyse**, age 13, Army Garrison Wiesbaden – Wiesbaden, Germany 
-   **Evelyn**, age 17, United Nations Command Korea – Seoul, South
    Korea 
-   **Gabriella**, age 17, U.S. Army – Flower Mound, TX
-   **Hannah**, age 16, Naval Base Kitsap – Silverdale, WA 
-   **Lara**, age 15, Pentagon – Arlington, VA 
-   **Sammi**, age 13, Pentagon – Arlington, VA

*Images of The Military Children’s Corner are available to download

*The Military Children’s Corner* is located in the East Colonnade and is
among the first displays visitors see when they enter the East Wing of
the White House. The display case was designed to replicate the look and
feel of bulletin boards commonly found in elementary schools, making
this White House display welcoming to visitors of all ages.

As a military mom and educator for more than 30 years, Dr. Biden has
previously debuted temporary art installations at the White House to
help Americans learn more about the unique experiences of our
military-connected families. In April 2022, to celebrate the Month of
the Military Child, Dr. Biden partnered with Military Child Education
Coalition to create a display in the East Wing featuring artwork created
by military-connected children across the country and those stationed
around the world. In April 2023, Dr. Biden debuted an installation
inspired by a poem called “My Military Suitcase,” which featured
miniature wooden suitcases designed by military and veteran children to
reflect their journeys as military-connected families. In September
2023, Dr. Biden unveiled a permanent White House art display dedicated
to military-connected children.

***Background on the First Lady’s Joining Forces initiative ***

*Joining Forces* is Dr. Biden’s initiative to support military and
veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. Guided by the life
experiences and the perspectives voiced during in-person and virtual
listening sessions with military-connected families and stakeholders,
the work and priorities of *Joining Forces* centers on the needs of this
population in the areas of: Economic Opportunity; Military Child
Education; and Health and Well-Being.

As First Lady, Dr. Biden has visited over 25 military installations;
worked with *Joining Forces* partners to support over 30 events with the
military-connected community; and helped coordinate the Administration’s
efforts to increase and raise awareness of resources and support for
military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.
