---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with Philippine
National Security Advisor Eduardo M. Año.  Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Ano
discussed preparations for the visit of Philippine President Marcos to
the White House and the historic Japan-Philippines-U.S. trilateral
leaders’ summit.  Mr. Sullivan also emphasized U.S. support for the
Philippines following the PRC Coast Guard and maritime militia’s
dangerous actions on March 23 obstructing a lawful Philippine resupply
mission to Second Thomas Shoal.  Mr. Sullivan underscored the ironclad
U.S. alliance commitments to the Philippines under the U.S.-Philippines
Mutual Defense Treaty, which extends to armed attacks on Philippine
armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft—to include those of its Coast
Guard—anywhere in the South China Sea.
