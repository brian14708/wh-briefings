title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the March Jobs\_Report"
---
 
Today’s report marks a milestone in America’s comeback. Three years ago,
I inherited an economy on the brink. With today’s report of 303,000 new
jobs in March, we have passed the milestone of 15 million jobs created
since I took office. That’s 15 million more people who have the dignity
and respect that comes with a paycheck.

My plan is growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up,
investing in all Americans, and giving the middle class a fair shot.
Unemployment has been under 4% for the longest stretch in more than 50
years. Wages are going up. Inflation has come down significantly.

We’ve come a long way, but I won’t stop fighting for hardworking
families. I’m taking action to lower costs, from bringing down the price
of insulin and inhalers and prescription drugs, to eliminating junk
fees. I’m calling on large corporations to pass along their record
profits to consumers. And I’ll continue to stand against Congressional
Republicans’ efforts to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and
to enact massive tax giveaways for the wealthy and big corporations.
