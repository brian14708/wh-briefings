title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Upcoming Vote\
  \ on Reauthorization and Reform of FISA Section\_702"

We applaud Senate leadership for moving swiftly toward a vote on H.R.
7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act, which would
reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act – a
critical intelligence collection authority – before it expires on April
19.  This legislation, which passed the House with robust bipartisan
support, ensures that the U.S. government has the tools to protect our
national security, while dramatically enhancing protections for privacy
and civil liberties. We call on the Senate to quickly send the bill to
the President’s desk. 

As the Senate considers this legislation, we urge the Senate to reject
mischaracterizations of an amendment to the definition of “electronic
communications service provider” that was adopted by a bipartisan
majority in the House. This amendment is a technical fix designed to
account for changing technological realities – the definition of
“electronic service providers” adopted when Section 702 was first
enacted in 2008 does not account for the technologies of 2024. This
provision is also directly responsive to encouragement from a federal
appellate court to update the definition of the private-sector companies
with which the U.S. Government can work, under supervision of federal
judges and with extensive oversight by four congressional committees, to
obtain the communications of non-Americans abroad. 

Furthermore, it is important to remember the limits on Section 702
collection.  Section 702 authorizes the targeting of foreigners outside
the United States.  Americans, as well as foreigners in the United
States, cannot be targets of such collection.  Adding yet additional
protections, the amendment explicitly carves out a wide range of
entities such as a “dwelling,” “community facility,” “public
accommodation facility,” “food service establishment,” and more, from
the revised definition of electronic communication service provider.

To be clear: nothing in this amendment changes the fundamentals of
Section 702, which can be used to target for collection *only* the
communications of non-Americans located outside the United States.  That
will remain unchanged—period.  The Senate should pass immediately the
Section 702 reauthorization and reform bill sent over by the House,
before the current law lapses on April 19.
