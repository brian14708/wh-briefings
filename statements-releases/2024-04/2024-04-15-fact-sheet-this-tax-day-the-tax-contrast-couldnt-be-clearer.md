*House Republicans Want the Tax Code to Work for the Wealthy; President
Biden Wants It to Work for the Middle Class*

This Tax Day, President Biden is fighting for hardworking families,
while House Republicans continue to side with the wealthy and big
corporations. Since taking office, President Biden has made the tax
system fairer: cutting taxes for families and workers, enacting a
minimum tax on billion-dollar corporations, and investing in the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so that it can better serve taxpayers and
crack down on wealthy tax cheats. If Congress enacted President Biden’s
tax plan, tens of millions of workers and families would have their
taxes cut, nobody making less than $400,000 would pay a penny more in
taxes, and the wealthy and big corporations would finally pay their fair
share—which would fully pay for the President’s tax cuts and investment
agenda.

In sharp contrast, the Republican Study Committee—which represents 80%
of House Republicans and 100% of their leadership—just released an
extreme budget that sides with the wealthy and large corporations, with
$5.5 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the richest Americans, doubling down
on the failed approach of the Trump tax cuts. If their extreme proposals
became law, millions of families would face higher taxes and higher
costs, and receive worse customer service from the IRS. Meanwhile,
billionaires and the biggest corporations would get huge tax cuts and
get away with cheating on their taxes. House Republicans would help
billionaires while hurting families by cutting Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and other programs
hardworking Americans count on.

**President Biden Would Make the Wealthy and Big Corporations Pay Their
Fair Share, While Cutting Taxes for Working Families and the Middle
Class**

The President’s plan would build on his progress to date, including
proposals to:

-   Make corporations pay their fair share by raising the corporate tax
    rate to 28% and the Inflation Reduction Act’s corporate minimum tax
    on billion-dollar corporations to 21%, cracking down on tax
    avoidance by large multinationals and Big Pharma, denying corporate
    tax breaks for multi-million-dollar executive compensation,
    quadrupling the stock buybacks tax, and cracking down on corporate
    jet loopholes.
-   Make the wealthy pay their fair share by requiring billionaires to
    pay at least 25% of their income in taxes, modestly raising taxes on
    the wealthy to fund the Medicare trust fund permanently, and ending
    the Trump tax cuts for the richest taxpayers.
-   Cut taxes for working families and the middle class by increasing
    the Child Tax Credit for 66 million children, which would lift 3
    million children out of poverty; cutting taxes for 19 million
    working-class Americans by strengthening the Earned Income Tax
    Credit; and making permanent the expanded Affordable Care Act
    premium tax credits that are lowering health insurance premiums by
    about $800 per year for millions of Americans. These tax cuts are
    fully paid for by making the wealthy and big corporations pay their
    fair share.
-   Make sure the IRS works for Americans by continuing to improve
    customer service and crack down on wealthy tax cheats. [This filing
    season](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2250), the
    IRS has achieved a 3-minute call wait time, saved taxpayers 1.4

    increased in-person tax preparation support by more than 200,000

    hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue over the next
    decade.
-   Ensure no one earning less than $400,000 a year sees a tax increase,
    while rejecting plans to extend tax cuts or restore tax breaks for
    those making more than $400,000 a year, and fully paying for all tax
    cut extensions by making the wealthy and big corporations pay their
    fair share, not tax increases on the middle-class or magical growth
    assumptions.

**House Republicans Would Slash Taxes for the Wealthy and Big
Corporations, Raise Taxes on Millions of Americans, and Cut Social
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid**

The extreme Republican budget proposes $5.5 trillion in tax cuts skewed
to the wealthy and big corporations, including:

-   Cutting taxes for the wealthy by making Trump tax cuts permanent,
    resulting in an
    [average](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/make-individual-income-tax-and-estate-tax-provisions-2017-tax-act-permanent-1)
    tax cut of at least $175,000 a year for the top 0.1 percent and
    costing $3 trillion.
-   Cutting taxes for businesses by more than $600 billion on top of the
    massive Trump tax cuts, which have completely
    [failed](https://patrick-kennedy.github.io/files/TCJA_KDLM_2024.pdf)
    to trickle down to workers.
-   Cutting taxes for billionaires and worsening wealth inequality by
    eliminating the estate tax, which currently applies to only the
    wealthiest 0.1% of Americans, those with assets over $13.6 million
    per person ($27.2 million per couple).
-   Reversing two of President Biden’s major achievements for tax
    fairness: a 15% minimum tax on billion-dollar corporations and a tax
    on stock buybacks that encourages companies to invest in their
    workers and the American economy rather than windfalls for
    investors.
-   Blocking the President’s global minimum tax agreement in order to
    [keep taxes
    low](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/14/the-congressional-republican-agenda-on-prescription-drugs-giveaways-to-big-pharma-and-higher-costs-for-seniors-and-families/)
    for big multinationals, including Big Pharma.
-   Rewarding wealth, not work, by cutting capital gains taxes,
    overwhelmingly benefitting the wealthiest Americans.
-   Making it easier for the wealthy and big corporations to cheat on
    their taxes by eliminating the Inflation Reduction Act’s investment
    in the IRS.

While cutting taxes for billionaires, the extreme Republican budget
would make devastating cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the
Affordable Care Act, and other programs hardworking Americans count on,
and raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, including:

-   Eliminating the expanded Affordable Care Act premium tax credit
    would raise the cost of health insurance for millions of Americans
    by an average of about $800 per year, including older people and
    self-employed workers.
-   Repealing the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits,
    which would raise taxes by thousands of dollars for families
    installing a heat pump or solar panels.
-   Making it harder for honest Americans to pay their taxes by
    rescinding the funding that has
    [enabled](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/building-on-filing-season-2023-success-irs-continues-to-improve-service-pursue-high-income-individuals-evading-taxes-modernize-technology)
    the IRS to reduce phone wait times from 28 minutes to just 3
    minutes, answer nearly 3 million more calls than two years ago, and
    serve 200,000 more taxpayers in person.
