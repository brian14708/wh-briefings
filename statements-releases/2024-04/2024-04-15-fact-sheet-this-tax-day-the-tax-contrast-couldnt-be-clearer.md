*House Republicans Want the Tax Code to Work for the Wealthy; President
Biden Wants It to Work for the Middle Class*

This Tax Day, President Biden is fighting for hardworking families,
while House Republicans continue to side with the wealthy and big
corporations. Since taking office, President Biden has made the tax
system fairer: cutting taxes for families and workers, enacting a
minimum tax on billion-dollar corporations, and investing in the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so that it can better serve taxpayers and
crack down on wealthy tax cheats. If Congress enacted President Biden’s
tax plan, tens of millions of workers and families would have their
taxes cut, nobody making less than $400,000 would pay a penny more in
taxes, and the wealthy and big corporations would finally pay their fair
share—which would fully pay for the President’s tax cuts and investment
agenda.

In sharp contrast, the Republican Study Committee—which represents 80%
of House Republicans and 100% of their leadership—just released an
extreme budget that sides with the wealthy and large corporations, with
$5.5 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the richest Americans, doubling down
on the failed approach of the Trump tax cuts. If their extreme proposals
became law, millions of families would face higher taxes and higher
costs, and receive worse customer service from the IRS. Meanwhile,
billionaires and the biggest corporations would get huge tax cuts and
get away with cheating on their taxes. House Republicans would help
billionaires while hurting families by cutting Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and other programs
hardworking Americans count on.

**President Biden Would Make the Wealthy and Big Corporations Pay Their
Fair Share, While Cutting Taxes for Working Families and the Middle
Class**

The President’s plan would build on his progress to date, including
proposals to:

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Make corporations pay their
    fair share</span> by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the
    Inflation Reduction Act’s corporate minimum tax on billion-dollar
    corporations to 21%, cracking down on tax avoidance by large
    multinationals and Big Pharma, denying corporate tax breaks for
    multi-million-dollar executive compensation, quadrupling the stock
    buybacks tax, and cracking down on corporate jet loopholes.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Make the wealthy pay their
    fair share</span> by requiring billionaires to pay at least 25% of
    their income in taxes, modestly raising taxes on the wealthy to fund
    the Medicare trust fund permanently, and ending the Trump tax cuts
    for the richest taxpayers.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cut taxes for working
    families and the middle class</span> by increasing the Child Tax
    Credit for 66 million children, which would lift 3 million children
    out of poverty; cutting taxes for 19 million working-class Americans
    by strengthening the Earned Income Tax Credit; and making permanent
    the expanded Affordable Care Act premium tax credits that are
    lowering health insurance premiums by about $800 per year for
    millions of Americans. These tax cuts are fully paid for by making
    the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Make sure the IRS works for
    Americans </span>by continuing to improve customer service and crack
    down on wealthy tax cheats. [This filing

    tax increases on the middle-class or magical growth assumptions.

**House Republicans Would Slash Taxes for the Wealthy and Big
Corporations, Raise Taxes on Millions of Americans, and Cut Social
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid**

The extreme Republican budget proposes $5.5 trillion in tax cuts skewed
to the wealthy and big corporations, including:

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cutting taxes for the
    wealthy by making Trump tax cuts permanent</span>, resulting in an
    [average](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/make-individual-income-tax-and-estate-tax-provisions-2017-tax-act-permanent-1)
    tax cut of at least $175,000 a year for the top 0.1 percent and
    costing $3 trillion.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cutting taxes for
    businesses by more than $600 billion</span> on top of the massive
    Trump tax cuts, which have completely
    [failed](https://patrick-kennedy.github.io/files/TCJA_KDLM_2024.pdf)
    to trickle down to workers.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cutting taxes for
    billionaires and worsening wealth inequality by eliminating the
    estate tax</span>, which currently applies to only the wealthiest
    0.1% of Americans, those with assets over $13.6 million per person
    ($27.2 million per couple).
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reversing two of President
    Biden’s major achievements for tax fairness</span>: a 15% minimum
    tax on billion-dollar corporations and a tax on stock buybacks that
    encourages companies to invest in their workers and the American
    economy rather than windfalls for investors.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Blocking the President’s
    global minimum tax agreement </span>in order to [keep taxes

    for big multinationals, including Big Pharma.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Rewarding wealth, not work,
    by cutting capital gains taxes,</span> overwhelmingly benefitting
    the wealthiest Americans.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Making it easier for the
    wealthy and big corporations to cheat</span> on their taxes by
    eliminating the Inflation Reduction Act’s investment in the IRS.

While cutting taxes for billionaires, the extreme Republican budget
would make devastating cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the
Affordable Care Act, and other programs hardworking Americans count on,
and raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, including:

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Eliminating the expanded
    Affordable Care Act premium tax credit would raise the cost of
    health insurance</span> for millions of Americans by an average of
    about $800 per year, including older people and self-employed
    workers.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Repealing the Inflation
    Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits</span>, which would raise
    taxes by thousands of dollars for families installing a heat pump or
    solar panels.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Making it harder for honest
    Americans to pay their taxes</span> by rescinding the funding that

    [enabled](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/building-on-filing-season-2023-success-irs-continues-to-improve-service-pursue-high-income-individuals-evading-taxes-modernize-technology)
    the IRS to reduce phone wait times from 28 minutes to just 3
    minutes, answer nearly 3 million more calls than two years ago, and
    serve 200,000 more taxpayers in person.
