title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Attacks Against\_Israel"
---
 
Iran has begun an airborne attack against Israel.  President Biden is
being regularly updated on the situation by his national security team
and will meet with them this afternoon at the White House.  His team is
in constant communication with Israeli officials as well as other
partners and allies.  This attack is likely to unfold over a number of
hours.  President Biden has been clear: our support for Israel’s
security is ironclad.  The United States will stand with the people of
Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran.
