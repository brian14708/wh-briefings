On this day 30 years ago, a brutal and systematic campaign of slaughter
began in Rwanda. In the 100 days that followed, more than 800,000 women,
men, and children were murdered. Most were ethnic Tutsis; some were
Hutus and Twa people. It was a methodical mass extermination, turning
neighbor against neighbor, and decades later, its repercussions are
still felt across Rwanda and around the world. 

Today, as Rwanda begins its annual Kwibuka period of remembrance, the
United States stands with the people of Rwanda in their grief. We honor
the victims who died senselessly and the survivors who courageously
rebuilt their lives. And we commend all Rwandans who have contributed to
reconciliation and justice efforts, striving to help their nation bind
its wounds, heal its trauma, and build a foundation of peace and unity.
Those efforts continue to this day. 

We will never forget the horrors of those 100 days, the pain and loss
suffered by the people of Rwanda, or the shared humanity that connects
us all, which hate can never overcome.
