Following the devastating collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge,
President Biden has launched a whole-of-government effort to provide
immediate response, reopen the port, rebuild the bridge, and support the
people of Baltimore. President Biden and his team have worked with
Governor Moore, Senator Cardin, Senator Van Hollen, Congressman Mfume,
Mayor Scott, and numerous state and local officials. The President’s
message has been clear: This Administration will be with the people of
Baltimore every step of the way. This tragedy has had a devastating
impact on the victims and their families, and as the President has said,
our prayers are with them. The victims were fathers, husbands, and
friends in their homes, work, and communities. The Administration will
continue to work alongside our state and local partners to attend to the
needs of the families and to assist in the ongoing search and recovery
efforts of those still missing.    
   
***<u>Working Safely and Quickly to Clear Wreckage and Reopen the
Port</u>***  
   
Clearing the wreckage will be a complex and highly coordinated effort,
as teams determine how to precisely cut the bridge’s steel trusses into
movable pieces; develop plans to safely extract the cargo ship, which is
weighed down by thousands of tons of wreckage; and as divers navigate
murky waters with little to no visibility. The Biden Administration has
taken decisive action to deploy federal resources to begin work to clear
the wreckage and reopen the port as quickly and safely as possible.  
 

-   **Immediately standing up a Unified Command:** The U.S. Coast Guard
    immediately deployed following the collapse to support local
    emergency personnel. Federal agencies are working closely with the
    State of Maryland to survey the wreckage in the channel and allow
    the Port of Baltimore to reopen as soon as humanly possible. Through
    the Unified Command, the U.S. Coast Guard is coordinating this
    effort, in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
    (USACE), the State of Maryland, and others, leveraging a unique
    coordinating function the Coast Guard is trained to perform in
    circumstances like this. The Unified Command brings order to a
    response with multiple stakeholders, prioritization of tasks,
    integration of skills and resources as needed, and prompt access to
    additional Federal resources as emerging needs are identified.   
-   **Completing initial survey work:** Dive teams continue to work in
    extremely hazardous conditions, rain, choppy cold water, and little
    to no visibility so that surveys can be completed in order to start
    removing wreckage from within the federal channel.  Using these
    surveys, USACE is developing a plan to open a deeper draft channel
    to allow limited cargo traffic to start transiting to the Port which
    will be a key step in the recovery process.  This is an
    extraordinarily complicated process and will be executed with the
    safety of all personnel as the top priority.  
-   **Deploying assets for wreckage removal:** Hundreds of personnel
    from the USACE, Coast Guard, Navy, and the State of Maryland are
    supporting efforts on the ground. Highly trained salvage crews
    successfully cut and removed the first pieces of steel wreckage from
    outside the federal channel on Saturday, March 30. The Unified
    Command has a fleet of six heavy lift crane barges to conduct
    wreckage removal within the federal channel, including the
    Chesapeake 1000, the largest crane barge on the East Coast – which
    is nearly 200 feet long and can lift 1,000 tons. This will be a
    critical asset in clearing large wreckage from across the bow of the
    stranded MV Dali. Earlier this week, the Unified Command was able to
    open two small alternate channels for essential vessels supporting
    wreckage removal to better access the area, marking the first time
    vessels have been able to cross the harbor since the bridge
    collapse.  
-   **Announcing a timeline for reopening:** After detailed studies and
    engineering assessments, the USACE announce yesterday that they
    tentatively expect to open a limited access channel for barge
    container service and some vessels that move automobiles and farm
    equipment by the end of April and to restore the port to normal
    capacity by the end of May. More information is available
    [here](https://www.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Releases/News-Release-Article-View/Article/3731723/us-army-corps-of-engineers-develops-tentative-timeline-to-reopen-fort-mchenry-c/).

***<u>Providing Necessary Resources to Rebuild the Bridge</u>***  
  
The Port of Baltimore is essential to the regional economy and the
national supply chain, and the I-695 corridor, of which the Francis
Scott Key Bridge was a part, provides a vital connection for people and
goods traveling along the East Coast. Over 30,000 vehicles crossed the
bridge daily.  

-   **Quickly releasing emergency funds:** Within hours of receiving the
    request, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway
    Administration (FHWA) [announced the immediate
    availability](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-60-million-emergency-work-wake-collapse-francis)
    of $60 million in “quick release” Emergency Relief funds for the
    Maryland Department of Transportation. These funds serve as a down
    payment toward initial costs, and additional Emergency Relief
    program funding will be made available as work continues. These
    “quick release” Emergency Relief funds are an initial installment to
    help with costs associated with wreckage removal efforts, restore
    essential transportation and design and reconstruction on I-695 and
    the bridge. FHWA is also providing technical assistance, conducting
    site assessments, and administering emergency contracts for the new
    bridge.  
-   **Covering the costs of repair:** The President has also been clear
    since day one about his commitment that the Federal government
    should cover any needed costs for reconstructing the bridge. While
    we continue to assess those costs alongside our Federal and state
    partners, [the Biden-Harris Administration is asking Congress to
    join
    us](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/04/05/letter-regarding-authorizing-language-for-rebuilding-francis-scott-key-bridge/)
    in demonstrating our commitment to aid in recovery efforts by
    authorizing a 100 percent Federal cost share for rebuilding the
    bridge. This authorization would be consistent with past
    catastrophic bridge collapses, including in 2007, when Congress
    acted in a bipartisan manner within days of the I-35W bridge
    collapse in Minnesota.  
-   **Holding the responsible parties accountable:** President Biden
    also made clear that as the Administration pursues its work to clean
    up wreckage, clear the channel, and rebuild the bridge, it will
    continue to pursue all avenues to recover costs of past, current,
    and future work, and ensure that any compensation for damages or
    insurance proceeds collected will reduce costs for the American
    people.

***<u>Supporting the Workers and Businesses of Baltimore and Mitigating
Economic Impacts</u>***  
  
The Port of Baltimore is one of the nation’s largest shipping hubs and
the Francis Scott Key Bridge is critical to travel in the Northeast
Corridor. The Biden Administration, in coordination with State of
Maryland and other partners, has been working around the clock to
mitigate the economic impacts of this temporary disruption, including:  
  
**Supporting industry to mitigate supply chain disruptions.** Since the
collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the President’s Supply Chain
Disruptions Task Force has engaged extensively with state and local
officials, Port of Baltimore leaders, industry, labor unions, ocean
carriers, rail and trucking companies, and ports along the East Coast to
minimize economic disruptions. As a result of these discussions and
collective efforts, import and export disruptions have been minimized.
This work has included:  

-   **Supporting the continued movement of autos and farm machinery
    through Baltimore.** In 2023, Baltimore was the busiest port
    nationwide for handling of cars and light trucks, and is a hub for
    transporting other vehicles and machinery, all of which can require
    specialized equipment and facilities to load and unload. Over the
    past week, DOT has been working closely with the Port of Baltimore,
    Baltimore County, and the private Tradepoint Atlantic terminal
    operator to facilitate handling of additional “roll-on/roll-off”
    cargo at Sparrows Point, the only portion of the Port of Baltimore
    that is still accessible and operational following the bridge
    collapse. Additionally, to expand operations during this time, DOT
    is amending a previously awarded $8.26-million grant to help
    Tradepoint Atlantic take on permanent additional capacity that will
    also assist in handling vessels that are unable to access the other
    terminals at the Port of Baltimore. This funding will be reallocated
    to support paving of at least 10 acres, which will allow the
    Terminal to more than double its prior capacity of 10,000 autos per
    month to be able to handle over 20,000 autos per month. Tradepoint
    Atlantic estimates the new facility will be operational later this
    month.  
-   **Encouraging East Coast port coordination and streamlining of rail
    service to Baltimore.** Because of close coordination and
    collaboration among East Coast ports, ocean carriers, and others,
    dozens of vessels unable to dock at Baltimore have been successfully
    diverted to other East Coast ports for unloading so that Americans
    can get the goods they need. To help get that cargo to Baltimore for
    processing and storage as seamlessly as possible, the Supply Chain
    Disruptions Task Force worked with Norfolk Southern Railway Company
    to launch a dedicated new service between Elizabeth Marine Terminal
    at the Port of New York and New Jersey and the Seagirt Marine
    Terminal in Baltimore. This service is in addition to the service
    that rail company CSX has announced between New York and Baltimore.

**Receiving commitments from businesses to support workers and
Baltimore.** The Port of Baltimore is a bedrock for the Baltimore
economy, generating over $70 billion in economic impact for the State of
Maryland in 2023 as it handled record cargo. Around 8,000 people work at
the Port of Baltimore facility, many of them union members. Thousands
more work nearby and depend on the port, including employees at small
businesses in Baltimore. Businesses large and small over the past week
have rallied to make clear that they will stick with Baltimore and its
workers through this temporary disruption. Specific commitments made
this week include:  

-   **Keeping workers on payroll**. Major local employers, including
    UPS, Amazon, Domino Sugar, Home Depot, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, and
    Floor & Decor, are committing to retain their workers—amounting to
    thousands of jobs—in their Port of Baltimore facilities.  
-   **Providing work and relief to longshoremen and stevedores.** On
    April 5, the port’s collective bargaining parties will make lump-sum
    payments to over 1,200 longshore workers valued at between 1 and 4
    weeks of salary. This scheduled payment represents vacation pay
    earned under the collective bargaining agreement during the previous
    six months. Additionally, Ports America Chesapeake, one of the
    largest employers at the Port of Baltimore, has committed to provide
    temporary work to hundreds of longshoremen who would otherwise go
    without hours or pay with no new shipments through the port. The
    Biden Administration, in coordination with State of Maryland
    counterparts, will continue to work closely with the International
    Longshoremen’s Association, the Teamsters, and other unions to
    monitor risks of layoffs and income loss.  
-   **Committing to resume business at the Port of Baltimore.** As
    companies temporarily reroute shipments to other East Coast ports,
    companies and manufacturers have committed to take steps to try to
    return key cargo operations to the Port of Baltimore once it
    reopens. These companies include the Port of Baltimore’s top four
    largest automobile importers Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, and
    Mitsubishi Motors, as well as Amazon.

**Standing strong with the people and businesses of Baltimore.**
President Biden has made clear that his Administration will move heaven
and earth to fully reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as
humanly possible, and to stick with the people of Baltimore every step
of the way. An outpouring of support has come in this week to support
the victims’ families, affected workers and businesses, and broader
recovery efforts. And, the federal government is working with its
Maryland government counterparts to make every tool available for these
efforts. These efforts include:   

-   **Promoting the Maryland Tough Baltimore Strong Alliance**. The
    Biden Administration has partnered with Governor Moore, Baltimore
    Mayor Scott, Baltimore County Executive Olszewski, and Anne Arundel
    County Executive Pittman to support the Maryland Tough Baltimore
    Strong Alliance. Through organizations like the Greater Baltimore
    Committee, Maryland Chamber of Commerce, Baltimore Community
    Foundation, and Baltimore Civic Fund, the Alliance has collected
    commitments to support impacted workers, families, organizations,
    and businesses that rely on the Port of Baltimore.    
-   **Supporting the Building Bridges to Recovery Initiative.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration and state and local partners are working
    with the Maryland Chamber of Commerce to support the Building
    Bridges to Recovery coalition. This broad-based coalition includes
    the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Greater
    Baltimore Committee, World Trade Center Institute, Greater
    Washington Partnership, along with regional and local chambers,
    economic development organizations, industry associations,
    neighborhood groups and others united to assist businesses across
    Maryland impacted by the bridge collapse and partial closure of the
    Port of Baltimore. Through this collaborative effort, businesses
    gain access to vital information and resources while having a
    powerful platform to share their experiences, articulate their
    needs, and ensure robust advocacy efforts are provided to rebuild
    and strengthen Maryland’s economy in the wake of these
    disruptions.  
-   **Providing relief for displaced workers.** The U.S. Department of
    Labor (DOL) released an initial tranche of [$3.5 million from its
    Dislocated Worker Grants
    Program](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20240405) for
    employment services and temporary jobs to assist with clean-up in
    the wake of the Key Bridge disaster—and approve up to $25 million in
    overall funding. These funds can be used for worker training, and to
    pay or subsidize wages for those who lost their jobs and are engaged
    in post-disaster relief employment. This initial tranche of funding
    is in response to the State of Maryland’s request, and DOL expects
    to release additional funds as Maryland implements its grant
    activities.  
-   **Assisting workers in accessing benefits:** DOL is working closely
    with the State of Maryland to launch ‘Worker Support
    Centers’—in-person services that will offer support to port workers
    and others to access all of the benefits that they are entitled to.
    The first center launched yesterday and Maryland is committed to
    ensuring these centers expand across the impacted counties in the
    state and to cover vulnerable workers.  
-   **Supporting small businesses in need**. In the days following the
    accident, the Small Business Administration quickly approved a
    disaster declaration that will provide low-interest disaster loan
    assistance available to eligible businesses in need. These loans
    will provide up to $2 million to overcome any temporary loss of
    revenue stemming from the bridge collapse and may be used to pay
    normal operating expenses such as fixed debts, payroll, accounts
    payable and other bills that can’t be paid because of the
    disruption.  SBA has also set up two Business Recovery Centers to
    provide on-the-ground assistance to business owners in completing
    their applications and received over 550 applications. Yesterday,
    SBA approved the first four loans totaling $159,100, with more
    expected in the coming days.    
-   Additionally, the Baltimore Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses
    team has committed to work on the ground in Baltimore to connect
    impacted small businesses with resources, navigate federal funding
    opportunities, organize network alumni, and connect impacted workers
    with temporary hiring opportunities.
