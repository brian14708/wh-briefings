title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Final Rule to Protect Nonpartisan Civil\_\
  Servants"
---
 
Today, my Administration is announcing protections for 2.2 million
career civil servants from political interference, to guarantee that
they can carry out their responsibilities in the best interest of the
American people. Day in and day out, career civil servants provide the
expertise and continuity necessary for our democracy to function. They
provide Americans with life-saving and life-changing services and put
opportunity within reach for millions. That’s why since taking office, I
have worked to strengthen, empower, and rebuild our career workforce.
This rule is a step toward combatting corruption and partisan
interference to ensure civil servants are able to focus on the most
important task at hand: delivering for the American people.
