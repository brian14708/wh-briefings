title: "Readout of the White\_House Convening on Gun Violence Emergency Response\_\
  Protocol"
---
 
On Friday, April 19, the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention
(OGVP) convened agencies from across the federal government as a part of
the Administration’s gun violence emergency response protocol.  The
in-person convening took place in the Roosevelt Room at the White House
and included the Office of the Vice President and the Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs, as well as participation from the following
agencies:

-   Department of Justice
-   Department of Homeland Security
-   Small Business Administration
-   Department of Education
-   Department of Health and Human Services
-   Department of Housing and Urban Development
-   Department of Veteran Affairs

Prior to this first in-person convening, OGVP has regularly convened
federal agencies to help coordinate federal resources available to
communities following mass shooting incidents, like the tragic shooting
in Lewiston, Maine, as well helping communities experiencing
concentrations of community violence.

Overseen by Vice President Harris, OGVP has also led regular listening
sessions with communities that have experienced mass shootings and
surges in gun violence including Buffalo, Uvalde, Parkland, Brooklyn
Homes in Baltimore, Highland Park and Columbine, to better understand
their specific and unique needs in the wake of these tragedies.

During Friday’s convening, OGVP Deputy Director Gregory Jackson briefed
agency officials on the Administration’s gun violence emergency response
protocol, as well as measures to help communities prevent future
violence through community violence intervention, safe storage
requirements, and funding available from the single largest investment
in student mental health in history that is helping to hire and train
more than 14,000 school mental health professionals. Agencies also
briefed out on the various resources they have made available to
communities following shooting tragedies, including victim services and
resiliency centers.

This convening comes on the heels of the [Biden-Harris Administration
announcing a new
rule](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-action-to-implement-bipartisan-safer-communities-act-expanding-firearm-background-checks-to-fight-gun-crime/) that
will save lives by reducing the number of firearms sold without
background checks. This action implements the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act — the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years
— and is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s strategy to stem the
flow of illegally acquired firearms into our communities and hold
accountable those who supply the firearms used in crime.
