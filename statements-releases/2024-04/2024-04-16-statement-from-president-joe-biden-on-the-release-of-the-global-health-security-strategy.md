title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Release of the Global Health Security\_\
  Strategy"

Today, I am proud to announce that my Administration is releasing a new
Global Health Security Strategy—outlining actions the United States will
take over the next five years to prevent, detect, and effectively
respond to biological threats wherever they emerge.

This has been a priority for me since day one. Every American
experienced the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. And every
American saw how this global health challenge had local consequences—on
our hospitals, our schools, our businesses, and our communities. No
sector of society was immune. That’s why—as my Administration worked to
end the COVID-19 pandemic—we’ve also focused on ensuring our nation is
prepared for any future pandemic, outbreak, or biological threat.

This new Global Health Security Strategy lays out how we will deliver on
this goal. It will help drive comprehensive and cohesive efforts across
our government, while generating greater support from foreign partners,
the private sector, and civil society to ensure long-term impact. It
will help protect people—across our nation and around the world—from
security threats, particularly those posed by infectious diseases. And
it will make the United States stronger, safer, and healthier than ever
before at this critical moment.
