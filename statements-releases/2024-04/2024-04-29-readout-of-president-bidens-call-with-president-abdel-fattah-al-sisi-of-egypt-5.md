President Biden spoke today with President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi of
Egypt.  The two leaders discussed the deal now on the table to secure
the release of hostages together with an immediate ceasefire in
Gaza.  The President confirmed that the United States together with
Egypt and Qatar would work to ensure the full implementation of its
terms.  He urged President Al-Sisi to exert all efforts to secure the
release of hostages held by Hamas as this is now the only obstacle to an
immediate ceasefire and relief for civilians in Gaza.  The President
further reiterated the importance of protecting civilian lives and
ensuring that Palestinians are not displaced to Egypt or any other
location outside of Gaza.  The two leaders reviewed ongoing initiatives
to increase the flow of life-saving assistance to the people of Gaza and
the President thanked President Al-Sisi for his personal commitment to
those efforts throughout the crisis.  They agreed to remain closely
coordinated directly and through their teams over the coming days.
