THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank
you.  Please, sit down.

Before I begin, I want to say something to the kids here.  Your mom and
dad, they owe you big for being here.  (Laughter.)  So —

(The President addresses children in the audience.)  (Inaudible.)

Where’s one of my team?  You know the deal when I got two young men over
here making a sacrifice?  You know what we’re going to do, right?

AIDE:  Yes, sir.

THE PRESIDENT:  (The President addresses children in the audience.)
 (Inaudible) my staff is going to come over and give you 5 bucks so you
can buy ice cream for yourselves, or you can make mom and dad pay if
they (inaudible).  All right?  Okay?  All right.

Okay.  I got that settled.  (Applause.)

You know, I — I look out at these beautiful children, and I think to
myself, “They’re having to stand here and listen to some guy they have
no idea what the heck he’s talking about.”  (Laughter.)  And I think of
— you know, they think when you — when you have — when you’re elected to
office, it’s great to have — your children have a great opportunity. 
It’s a pain in the neck for them.  (Laughter.)  My kids had to stand for
so many meetings.  I — anyway, I owe them big.  
   
Look, first of all, thank you, thank you, thank you for being here. 
Thank you for all you’re doing.  And it means a great deal.  Florida — I
think Florida is in play, nationally.  (Applause.)  
   
And Nikki is doing a hell of a job as your state chairman.  (Applause.) 
And I made her promise she’s going to run again, I hope.  (Laughter and
applause.)  
   
Look, a couple of things I want to say.  You know, one of the things
that earlier today I spoke about — up in Washington and — and, actually,
also last week — talking about that this election is a basic,
old-fashioned election.  It’s about getting out the votes.  It’s about
putting together campaigns the old-fashioned way.  Not — not that we
don’t use all the technology available, but just everything from
knocking on doors to putting up road signs to make sure that we get
people to the polls and all those things.   
   
And, you know, it’s a — we’ve got to — there are some animated issues. 
Obviously, choice is one of the biggest ones.  But it’s not the only
one.   
   
You know, I know you’re reading in the press lately that there’s a great
concern among — I’ve been doing this for a couple years.  (Laughter.) 
Well, it’s hell turning 50.  You know what I mean?  (Laughter.)   
   
And as — and I’ve spent an awful lot of my time dealing with foreign
policy because I was chairman of that committee and because that’s why
Barack asked me to — for eight years, to handle portions of that.  And
one of the things that people don’t understand, I don’t think, fully, is
we are the essential nation.   
   
No, not a joke.  It’s not hyperbole.  It’s not bragging.   
   
It’s — think of it this way: If the United States stepped off the world
stage, like Trump wants us to do, who would lead the world?  Who would
lead the world?   
   
And one of the things that’s happening now is that — and I’ve — say this
in front of the press that — they’ve heard me say it before.  Every
international meeting I attend with other heads of state — whether it’s
the G7, the G20, all these international meetings — before I leave,
literally, almost every one will walk up to me and wait to get me in a
corner alone and grab my arm and say, “You’ve got to win.”  Not because
of me, but because of the alternative.  And they say, “Because my
democracy depends upon it,” meaning their democracy.  
   
So, the whole world is looking, and they’re looking to see how we handle
ourselves in this election — not just on whether we win or not but how
we handle ourselves.  
   
And one of the things that — you know, for me, I got involved when I was
a kid in electoral politics out of the Civil Rights Movement.  And it
all got down to one person at a time — I mean it sincerely —
organizing.   
   
My state, to its great shame, was segregated by law.  That’s why I got
involved as a kid when I got out of high school and into college.  And
it’s about just doing the basic things: talking to people — literally,
talking to people.  
   
And, for example, we’re — I’m really excited.  We’ve raised almost a
half a billion dollars so far.  (Applause.)  
   
But here’s what excites me: So far, we have 1.6 million contributors —
1.6 million contributors — 550,000 more than we had last time at this
stage of the game.  But here’s the deal.  Of those 1.6 million
contributors, 97 percent contributed less than $200.  Think of all the
numbers that that means.  
   
We’re in a situation where they have — and as I said, where we raised
almost — we’re headed toward a half a billion dollars.  And that’s all
about ma- — being able to do the things we have to do in a campaign,
especially one that’s as hard-fought as this and one that is so full of
lies, so full of misrepresentations being made.  
   
I think — you know, whether the press thinks I’m good, bad, or
indifferent, I think they acknowledge that there’s less than truth that
comes out of the other guy’s mouth.  And, you know, you wouldn’t know it
from what you read and hear, but, you know, we’re in pretty good shape
in the polls.  The — and I know you’re all activists, so that’s why I’m
bothering to tell you this: The polls don’t win you an election. 
(Applause.)  
   
But in the last 23 national polls, I’ve been ahead in 10 of them, Trump
has been ahead in 8, and we’ve been tied in 5.  More importantly, the
momentum is clearly in our — our favor.  
   
For example, we moved eight points in the latest Marquette poll and
seven points in the Echelon poll.  And the Marist Poll now has us up by
three nationwide.   
   
The point I’m making is, people are beginning to listen.  This is a time
people begin to focus and listen.  They have generic impressions up to
now, but now they’re l- — they’re listening.  And they’re beginning to
listen.  
   
And so, this campaigns — how many offices have we opened now, total? 
Where — where is my —  
   
AIDE:  A hundred and thirty-three.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  A hundred — we — we’ve opened a hundred — (applause) — a
hundred and thirty-three offices.   
   
And here you are.  That’s — that’s the note I had.  Yeah.   
   
And here in Florida, we’re opening coordinated offices, hiring staff,
and recruiting volunteers as well.  
   
But, you know, I know we can do this, but I’ve never been more
optimistic.  I know — I’ve been saying this for a long time: I’ve never
been more optimistic about America than I am today.   
   
You know, when I w- — I wasn’t going to run in 2020, because I had lost
my son in Iraq — because of Iraq in — in 19- — anyway, in 2015.   
   
But what happened was, remember when, in — down in — in Virginia, those
folks came out of the woods carrying torches and with Nazi banners and
singing?  For real.  It’s hard to make it up — make it up.  And — and it
just was astounding to me.  And a young woman was killed — I spoke to
her mom — who was a bystander.   
   
And they asked then-President Trump what he thought, and he said there
were — “I think there are very fine people on both sides.”  That’s when
I decided I had to run, for real, because our democracy is also at stake
— literally, the democracy is at stake.  
   
But the way to make sure people understand that is to go out and find
out what’s on their minds, see what they need.  What is it they’re most
concerned about?  And, you know, we — you know, we’ve — we’ve had
enormous success when we’ve actually asked people — when we go out and
do it the old-fashioned way.  And we’re just really kicking it up now.  
   
We’re, you know — we’re getting toward the end here.  Last time out, we
ran and we m- — we raised the vast majority of the money we made in the
last three months.  That’s when people began to focus.   
   
But we’re going to do — we’re going to be — we have to be really
organized in a big way.  But it’s basic organization; it’s not rocket
science.  It’s — it’s knocking on doors.  It’s sending out postcards. 
It’s getting on the telephone.  It’s going around and making sure people
have rides to the polls, all those things.   
   
And, by the way, when I ran this time, I made it real clear what I was
going to do.  I said I was going to change the way our economy works,
instead of trickle-down economics where they go — where the very wealthy
get all the tax breaks and all that will trickle down and grow the
economy.  I’m a capitalist.  I don’t care if you — if you make a billion
bucks.  Just pay your taxes.  (Applause.)  
   
No, I — I really mean it.  You know what the average tax rate for
someone making — there’s — we have a thousand billionaires in America. 
You know what their average tax rate is?  8.3 percent.  It’s not a
joke.  8.3 percent.  Anybody want to trade with their tax rate?   
   
AUDIENCE:  Yes!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  But, look, everything we’ve done because of your help
you’ve provided over the last three and a half years, he wants to undo. 
He’s made no bones about it — all of it.  Just like you have a — Scott
wants to get rid of Social Security.  You know, these guys are for
real.   
   
But look at what we’ve done.  We built — we’ve got a lot — we’ve got a
lot more work to do, but we built the strongest economy in the world. 
We got to get inflation even further down.  There’s a lot more we have
to do.

And, by the way, I know a lot of people got — got a little frustrated
with me when I said I’m going to be the most pro-union president in
American history.  Well — (applause) — well, guess what?  I asked the
Treasury Department to do a study: With all the union help we’re getting
and all the union support that we’re — they’re h- — they’re getting,
what — what’s the impact?  Everybody does better.  Everybody does
better, even the people who are \[not\] paying for the union dues,
because guess what?  I mean, paying the union wage — because they get
the best workers in the world.  
   
So, my — my generic point is there’s a lot we have going.  There’s no
reason why we can’t — we can’t reclaim our heritage and who we are as
the most generous, leading nation in the world and still grow.   
   
So, there’s a lot more to say, but I’m already saying too much.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  No, you’re not.  No, you’re not, Mr. President.  No,
you’re not.  (Applause.)   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Teamster in the house.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Teamsters in the house, that’s the — I tell you what. 
They better damn well be in the house, man.  (Laughter and applause.)  I
tell you what.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  The only reason I have a pension —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  — is because of you, sir.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Is that right?  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  The only reason I have a pension is because of you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we did get that done.  (Applause.)     
   
Anyway.  Besides, I used to drive an 18-wheeler.  You know what I did?  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible) you helped negotiate.    
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s exactly right.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thirty-billion-dollar contract with one of the largest
employers in America: UPS.  You stood strong with us, and we’ll stand
strong with you, sir.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
I mean, look, I’m getting a little off course here.  But the bottom line
is this — (laughter) — it matters to ordinary people.   
   
When I said, when I got elected, I was going to build an economy from
the middle out and the bottom up, because that way the poor have a
chance, the middle class grow, and the wealthy still do very well.  They
still do very well.   
   
And it’s working.  We’ve — we have 16 million new employ- — I mean, we —
it’s working.   
   
We still have to deal with inflation, and there’s a lot of costs out
there for ordinary people.  We’re going to be getting you a lot of
information to get to the folks out there.  
   
But, for example, we’re in a situation now where you have a circumstance
where there’s a lot of junk fees.  For example, you have a bank
overdraft, they charge you 37 bucks instead — but guess what?  Now they
can only charge you eight.  (Applause.)  Because they’re supposed —
because it ju- — I don’t want to cost them money, but that — exorbitant
prices they’re charging.  
   
Same with credit card overdrafts.  Same — a whole range of things that
affect people.   
   
My dad — I’ll end with my dad.  My dad used to say — my dad was a really
well-read man who never got a chance to go to college because of World
War Two.  And his in- — he’d always say, “Joey, a job is about a lot
more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about respect. 
It’s about being able to look your kid” — he meant it — “being able to
look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and
mean it.”  
   
The only thing we’re about as Democrats, in my view, is giving everyone
a shot.  Everyone gets a fair shot.  
   
And I’ll be damned if we’re not going to do that this time out. 
(Applause.)  
   
So, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
Good seeing you.    
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
(Inaudible.)  
   
Hey —  
   
AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) 10 bucks?   
   
AIDE:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Okay.  Hey, kids, remember what I told you
now?  (Laughter.)  Remember our deal?  
   
All right.  Anyway, thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)
