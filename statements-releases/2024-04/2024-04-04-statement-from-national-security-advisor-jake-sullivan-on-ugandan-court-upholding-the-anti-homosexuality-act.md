title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Ugandan Court Upholding\
  \ the Anti-Homosexuality\_Act"
---
 
The Uganda Constitutional Court’s decision to uphold most aspects of the
Anti-Homosexuality Act is deeply disappointing, imperils human rights,
and jeopardizes economic prosperity for all Ugandans.  
   
While the Court overturned some clauses of the law, in failing to fully
overturn the Act, the Court has left LGBTQI+ persons vulnerable to
hate-fueled violence, discrimination, persecution, life imprisonment, or
even the death penalty – simply for existing as they are. As President
Biden [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/29/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-enactment-of-ugandas-anti-homosexuality-act/) when
this legislation was enacted: “No one should have to live in constant
fear for their life or being subjected to violence and discrimination.
It is wrong.”  
   
As directed by President Biden, the United States continues to assess
implications of the AHA on all aspects of U.S. engagement with the
Government of Uganda and has [taken significant
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/11/fact-sheet-the-united-states-response-to-ugandas-anti-homosexuality-act-and-persistent-human-rights-abuses/) thus
far. The United States will continue to hold accountable individuals and
entities that perpetrate human rights abuses in Uganda, both
unilaterally and with partners around the world.  
   
Yesterday’s ruling is a missed opportunity for Uganda—not only to uphold
the human rights of all Ugandans, but also to reaffirm the importance of
dignity, compassion, and tolerance for all. The United States remains
committed to the Ugandan people and has the greatest respect for
Uganda’s human rights defenders that are bravely fighting for the rights
of all. We will continue to work to strengthen democratic institutions,
protect human rights, and accelerate the fight against corruption, in
Uganda, at home, and globally.
