title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting on the Ongoing Response to the Collapse of\
  \ the Francis Scott Key\_Bridge"

Earlier this week, senior officials from the White House, U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Transportation and
Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works met with
Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Maryland Secretary of Transportation
Paul Wiedefeld to discuss progress and continued collaboration in
response to the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.

The White House underscored President Biden’s commitment to stand with
Baltimore every step of the way in this recovery. White House officials
thanked participants for the collaboration and partnership between teams
at the federal and state level. The meeting focused on updates on
removing wreckage from the channel, supporting impacted workers and the
families of the victims, reopening the port to vessel traffic, and
rebuilding the bridge.

The group discussed progress towards reopening a limited access channel,
including Tuesday’s major milestone of removing a significant section of
the bridge from the water. The limited access channel is expected to be
complete by the end of April. Participants emphasized the need for a
smooth return of cargo traffic to the port as the channel is reopened
and went over the standard operating procedures for reopening maritime
traffic after incidents. The group also discussed efforts to support
impacted workers, including the launch of the Port of Baltimore Worker
Retention Program and the PORT Act, and the group’s shared support for
the families of workers who lost their lives in the bridge collapse.
Participants also highlighted efforts at the state and federal level to
ensure a rapid rebuild of the bridge. 

The White House will continue to work in lockstep with state and federal
partners to minimize the impacts of the devastating collapse and to
support affected communities.
