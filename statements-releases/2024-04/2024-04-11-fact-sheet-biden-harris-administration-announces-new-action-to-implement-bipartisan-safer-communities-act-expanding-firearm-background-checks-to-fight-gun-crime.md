  \ Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, Expanding Firearm Background Checks to Fight\
  \ Gun\_Crime"

*New Department of Justice final rule sets strong standard for gun
sellers who have to get a license and conduct background checks*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a new rule that
will save lives by reducing the number of firearms sold without
background checks. This final rule implements the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act’s expansion of firearm background checks—the only
significant expansion of the background check requirement since
then-Senator Biden helped shepherd the Brady Bill over the finish line
in 1993. This action is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
strategy to stem the flow of illegally acquired firearms into our
communities and hold accountable those who supply the firearms used in
crime.

*Statement from the President:* “I’ve spent hours with families who’ve
lost loved ones to gun violence. They all have the same message: ‘Do
something.’ Today, my Administration is taking action to make sure fewer
guns are sold without background checks. This is going to keep guns out
of the hands of domestic abusers and felons. And my Administration is
going to continue to do everything we possibly can to save lives.
Congress needs to finish the job and pass universal background checks
legislation now.”

*Statement from the Vice President:* “Every year, thousands of
unlicensed gun dealers sell tens of thousands of guns without a
background check, including to buyers who would have failed one –
domestic abusers, violent felons, and even children. This single gap in
our federal background check system has caused unimaginable pain and
suffering. Today, as the head of the White House Office of Gun Violence
Prevention, I am proud to say that all gun dealers must conduct
background checks no matter where or how they sell.”

The federal gun background check system is one of the best tools we have
to keep guns out of the hands of individuals prohibited from purchasing
or possessing firearms, including domestic abusers and other violent
criminals. But the loopholes in America’s background check laws have
enabled domestic abusers, school shooters, violent criminals, and gun
traffickers to illegally acquire firearms. Over the past 20 years, there
have been numerous failed efforts to close these loopholes and expand
background checks, including a bipartisan attempt in 1999 that followed
the shooting at Columbine High School, and another bipartisan attempt in
2013 that followed the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

In 2022, President Biden accomplished what many had tried for the past
20 years—he succeeded in expanding background checks by signing into law
the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This law broadened the category of
gun sellers required to become licensed dealers and run background
checks. In 2023, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence-and-make-our-communities-safer/)
to accelerate implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,
including by directing the Attorney General to move the U.S. as close to
universal background checks as possible without additional legislation
by clarifying the new Act. The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) final rule
clarifies the type of conduct that requires a person to get a license to
sell guns and to conduct background checks. By setting clear standards
for when someone is dealing firearms, the rule provides the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) with proactive tools to
enforce the law and keep our communities safe.

**Background Check Loopholes Have Deadly Consequences**

Since 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers
to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon.
These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more
than three million individuals who are prohibited from purchasing or
possessing firearms. Despite the law, a growing number of unlicensed
sellers continue to sell firearms for profit to complete strangers they
meet at gun shows and online marketplaces, which has been a critical gap
in the background check laws.

For the past 30 years, individuals who could not pass a background check
sought out unlicensed sellers in order to evade the background check
system. One investigation found that [1 in 9
people](https://everytownresearch.org/report/unchecked-an-investigation-of-the-online-firearm-marketplace/)
who respond to online ads from unlicensed sellers would fail a
background check. Tragic consequences of this unlawful conduct include:

-   In
    [1999](https://winknews.com/2018/05/03/since-unthinkable-happened-columbine-gun-show-loophole-still-exists/),
    the school shooters from the Columbine High School shooting were
    both under 18 and too young to purchase firearms legally. The
    shooters had their acquaintance purchase firearms for them at a gun
    show through an unlicensed seller to avoid a background check.
-   In
    [2012](https://winknews.com/2018/05/03/since-unthinkable-happened-columbine-gun-show-loophole-still-exists/),
    a domestic abuser was barred from possessing firearms following a
    restraining order taken out by his estranged wife. The day before
    the abuser killed his wife and two others, and injuring four at the
    Azana Salon in Wisconsin, he purchased a gun from an unlicensed
    seller he met online without a background check.
-   In
    [2019](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2020/09/07/one-year-later-will-midland-odessa-shooting-spur-changes-to-background-check-laws/42529967/),
    a man shot and killed seven people and wounded dozens more after a
    multiple-location shooting in Midland and Odessa, Texas. The shooter
    had previously tried to purchase a gun from a sporting goods store
    but was stopped by a background check because of his mental health
    history. He was ultimately able to purchase an AR-15 assault-style
    rifle without a background check from an unlicensed seller he met
    online.

Unlicensed dealers who do not conduct background checks are also [the
largest
source](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-publication-third-volume-national-firearms-commerce-and)
of firearms that are illegally trafficked into our communities. In an
assessment of its gun trafficking investigations from 2017 to 2021, ATF
[identified](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/nfcta-volume-iii-part-iii/download)
sales by unlicensed dealers as the most frequently used gun trafficking
channel. Moreover, unlicensed dealers were the source of more than half
of the firearms identified as having been trafficked during the
five-year study period—a total of more than 68,000 illegally trafficked
firearms.

**Final Rule Implements New Law, Expanding Background Check Requirement
to Tens of Thousands of Gun Sales**

The Department of Justice’s final rule implements the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act—the largest expansion of background checks since the
Brady Bill became law.

The final rule makes clear when a person needs to become a licensed
dealer and run background checks, and gives the Department of Justice
additional tools to crack down on individuals illegally selling guns
without background checks. Specifically, the final rule:

-   **Lists the types of commercial activity indicating that a person
    must become a licensed dealer and run background checks**, absent
    evidence showing they are in fact not engaged in the business of
    firearms dealing. For example, if a person is repetitively selling
    guns of the same or similar make and model within one year of their
    purchase, they are supposed to become a licensed dealer. If a person
    repetitively sells firearms within thirty days of purchasing those
    firearms, or selling firearms and tells potential buyers that they
    can acquire additional firearms for that buyer to purchase, the
    seller is supposed to become a licensed dealer.
-   **States that the gun show or online sale loopholes do not exist.**
    If you are conducting business that in a brick-and-mortar store
    would require you to become a licensed dealer, you have to become a
    licensed dealer and run background checks. It does not matter
    whether you are dealing firearms at a gun show, online, in your
    home, in the trunk of a car, at a flea market, or anywhere else—you
    must obtain a license and run background checks results. Evidence
    that a person placed ads online or reserved a table at a gun show
    shows that the person is intending to profit from the sale.
-   **Prevents people from evading the licensing and background check
    requirements by claiming that they are just selling a few guns.**
    The final rule clarifies that even a single firearm transaction may
    be sufficient to require a license, if there is other behavior to
    suggest commercial activity. For example, a person selling just one
    gun and then saying to others they are willing and able to purchase
    more firearms for resale may be required to obtain a license and run
    background checks.
-   **Prevents people from falsely claiming that guns are part of a
    personal collection in an attempt to evade the law.** The statute
    explicitly states that making occasional sales of a firearm from a
    personal collection or liquidating collection does not require a
    federal firearms license or background checks. However, people have
    evaded the background check requirement by falsely claiming they are
    selling their personal collection. The final rule makes clear that a
    personal collection of firearms is limited to collections acquired
    for specific reasons like study; comparison; exhibition; or for a
    hobby, like hunting or sport shooting. A bona fide personal
    collection is not the same as business inventory.
-   **Closes the so-called firesale loophole.** Gun dealers who have had
    their licenses revoked have sometimes then sold their former
    business inventory without running background checks. The final rule
    makes clear that a business inventory may not be transferred to a
    person’s personal collection after a license is revoked. Instead, a
    business could dispose of this inventory through another licensed
    seller who runs background checks.

  
There are over 80,000 licensed gun dealers in America. The Department of
Justice estimates that there are over 20,000 unlicensed sellers who are
selling firearms through online advertisements, gun shows, and other
means. These unlicensed sellers should be licensed under the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act and the new rule, and therefore conducting
background checks. An alternative estimate based on survey data
estimates that the new rule could affect gun sales being made by over
80,000 individuals. Legal limitations on tracking firearms make such
estimates difficult to quantify.

**Final Rule Builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s Commitment to
Stopping the Illegal Flow of Guns**

The Biden-Harris Administration has deployed a historic effort to
partner with state and local law enforcement and keep communities safe
by addressing the illegal sources of guns. The strategy is focused not
just on the person who pulled the trigger of a firearm, but also on all
of the links in the chain that led to the firearm being in the wrong
hands, including the gun trafficker, the source of the gun trafficker’s
firearms, rogue gun dealers who are willfully violating the law, and
ghost gun manufacturers. Key Administration actions to stop the illegal
flow of guns into our communities include:

-   **Gun Trafficking Law Enforcement**:  In 2021, the Justice
    Department launched five [new law enforcement strike
    forces](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-launches-firearms-trafficking-strike-forces-address-violent-crime-crack) focused
    on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that have
    diverted guns to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and
    Washington, D.C. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act also enacted
    the first ever federal gun trafficking law and federal straw
    purchasing law. The new gun trafficking law has been used to charge
    more than 300 people and led to the seizure of over 1,500 firearms.
-   **Cracking Down on Rogue Gun Dealers**:  The Justice Department
    enacted a new policy to [maximize the
    efficacy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/#:~:text=Maximizing%20the%20efficacy%20of%20ATF%20resources%20to%20crack,taken%20against%20dealers%20in%20violation%20of%20federal%20law.)
    of ATF resources to crack down on rogue gun dealers violating our
    laws and [underscored zero
    tolerance](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-biden-administration-s-gun-crime) for
    willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers
    that put public safety at risk. The new ATF inspection policies have
    led to 245 license revocations over the past two years, which is the
    highest two-year total in nearly twenty years.
-   **Stopping Gun Manufacturers Illegally Selling Ghost Guns**:  The
    Justice Department issued a [final
    rule](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-new-rule-modernize-firearm-definitions) to
    rein in the proliferation of ghost guns, which are unserialized,
    privately made firearms that are increasingly being recovered at
    crime scenes. According to ATF, the recovery of ghost guns by law
    enforcement increased [1,083
    percent](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/nfcta-volume-ii-part-iii-crime-guns-recovered-and-traced-us/download)
    between 2017 and 2021. The Biden-Harris Administration cracked down
    on ghost guns by [making
    clear](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/frame-and-receiver-rule-goes-effect)
    that businesses manufacturing the most accessible ghost guns,
    including “buy-build-shoot” kits and [certain polymer handgun
    frames](https://www.atf.gov/rules-and-regulations/docs/open-letter/all-ffls-dec2022-open-letter-impact-final-rule-2021-05f/download)
    (including certain Polymer80 handgun frames) must comply with
    federal firearm laws requiring background checks, a federal license,
    and markings, such as serial numbers.
-   **Senate Confirmed ATF Director**:President Biden secured the
    confirmation of ATF Director Steve Dettelbach, the first permanent
    ATF Director in over seven years to lead the agency tasked with
    enforcing our nation’s gun laws.
-   **Crime Gun Intelligence Centers**: ATF works with state and local
    law enforcement to establish crime gun intelligence centers, which
    uses the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN)
    and crime gun tracing to provide investigative leads to solve
    shootings and identify gun trafficking channels.
-   **New Analysis on Gun Trafficking**: In 2021, President Biden
    announced that the ATF would publish the first gun trafficking
    analysis in twenty years. ATF has published three volumes, with the
    most recent volume showing that the most frequent type of
    trafficking channel identified in ATF gun trafficking investigations
    was unlicensed firearms dealing by private persons at 40.7 percent.
    These investigations accounted for over half of the firearms
    identified as trafficked in ATF investigations. The second most
    frequent trafficking channel was straw purchasers.

**Call for Congress to Act**

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is moving as close as possible to
universal background checks without additional legislation. President
Biden and Vice President Harris continue to call on Congress to enact
universal background checks and finish the job.

The President and Vice President also continue to call on Congress to
increase funding for the ATF so the agency can continue its life-saving
work to stop the flow of illegal firearms into our communities. The
President requested $2 billion for ATF as part of his FY 25 budget
request.
