title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Holding Iran Accountable\
  \ for Unprecedented Attack on\_Israel"
---
 
Following Iran’s unprecedented air attack against Israel, President
Biden is coordinating with allies and partners, including the G7, and
with bipartisan leaders in Congress, on a comprehensive response. In the
coming days, the United States will impose new sanctions targeting Iran,
including its missile and drone program as well as new sanctions against
entities supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and
Iran’s Defense Ministry. We anticipate that our allies and partners will
soon be following with their own sanctions. In addition, we continue to
work through the Department of Defense and U.S. Central Command to
further strengthen and expand the successful integration of air and
missile defense and early warning systems across the Middle East to
further erode the effectiveness of Iran’s missile and UAV capabilities. 

These new sanctions and other measures will continue a steady drumbeat
of pressure to contain and degrade Iran’s military capacity and
effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic
behaviors. Over the last three years, in addition to missile and
drone-related sanctions, the United States has sanctioned over 600
individuals and entities connected to terrorism, terrorist financing and
other forms of illicit trade, horrific human rights abuses, and support
for proxy terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and
Kataib Hezbollah. The pressure will continue. We will not hesitate to
continue to take action, in coordination with allies and partners around
the world, and with Congress, to hold the Iranian government accountable
for its malicious and destabilizing actions.
