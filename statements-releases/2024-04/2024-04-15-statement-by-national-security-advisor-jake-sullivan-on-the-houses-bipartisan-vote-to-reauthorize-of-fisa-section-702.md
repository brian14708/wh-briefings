title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the House\u2019s Bipartisan\
  \ Vote to Reauthorize of FISA Section\_702"
---
 
We applaud the House’s bipartisan passage of legislation to reauthorize
one of our nation’s most critical intelligence authorities, Section 702
of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).  The Reforming
Intelligence and Securing America Act ensures that the Intelligence
Community has the tools that it needs to identify and disrupt threats to
the American people from hostile nation states, terrorist organizations,
hackers, spies, and more.  It also includes some of the most significant
reforms in the history of FISA to strengthen oversight of how the
authority is used and to protect privacy.  We encourage the Senate to
swiftly pass this bill before the authority expires on April 19.
