title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Arizona Supreme Court Decision to Uphold\
  \ Abortion Ban from\_1864"
---
 
Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and
dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their
health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest. This cruel ban
was first enacted in 1864—more than 150 years ago, before Arizona was
even a state and well before women had secured the right to vote. This
ruling is a result of the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials
who are committed to ripping away women’s freedom.  
   
Vice President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of Americans
who support a woman’s right to choose. We will continue to fight to
protect reproductive rights and call on Congress to pass a law restoring
the protections of Roe v. Wade for women in every state.
