title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Iran\_Sanctions"
---
 
Less than a week ago, Iran launched one of the largest missile and drone
attacks the world has ever seen against Israel. Together with our allies
and partners, the United States defended Israel. We helped defeat this
attack. And today, we are holding Iran accountable—imposing new
sanctions and export controls on Iran.  
   
The sanctions target leaders and entities connected to the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran’s Defense Ministry, and the Iranian
government’s missile and drone program that enabled this brazen assault.
As I discussed with my fellow G7 leaders the morning after the attack,
we are committed to acting collectively to increase economic pressure on
Iran. And our allies and partners have or will issue additional
sanctions and measures to restrict Iran’s destabilizing military
programs.  
   
During my Administration, the United States has sanctioned over 600
individuals and entities—including Iran and its proxies, Hamas,
Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Kataib Hezbollah. And we will keep at it.
I’ve directed my team, including the Department of the Treasury, to
continue to impose sanctions that further degrade Iran’s military
industries.  
   
Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran’s attacks: The
United States is committed to Israel’s security. We are committed to the
security of our personnel and partners in the region. And we will not
hesitate to take all necessary action to hold you accountable.
