title: "Readout of White\_House Event Announcing Overtime and Retirement Security\_\
  Rules"
---
 
Today, National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard, Domestic Policy Council
Director Neera Tanden, and Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su led a
White House event announcing two new rules to support workers and grow
the American economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

Senior administration officials were joined by workers, union leaders,
and advocates to discuss new Department of Labor (DOL) actions to update
the outdated overtime threshold and protect Americans from hidden fees
that eat into their retirement savings. First, DOL’s overtime rule will
extend overtime protections to millions of workers, fulfilling the
promise that a hard day’s work leads to a fair day’s pay. The rule will
also ensure that the threshold for determining overtime eligibility
rises with wage growth in the future. Additionally, DOL’s new retirement
rule will save Americans billions of dollars as they prepare for
retirement by ensuring that savers receive retirement advice in their
best interest, rather than in the interest of retirement professionals.
By preventing hard-earned savings from being lost in hidden fees from
bad advice, Americans can save up to 20% more in retirement savings.

Specifically, the new rules will:

-   **Extend Overtime Pay Eligibility:** For more than 80 years,
    salaried workers earning less than a certain threshold have been
    entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours
    per week. However, the threshold that helps determine eligibility
    for overtime pay has risen far slower than wage growth, excluding
    many lower-paid salaried workers from overtime protections. DOL’s
    rule will raise the minimum salary threshold for the overtime
    exemption for executive, administrative, and professional employees
    in two stages, and provide for increases every 3 years to ensure the
    threshold keeps up with wage growth. This change will extend
    overtime protections to nearly 1 million workers based on an initial
    salary increase to $43,888 ($844 per week) on July 1, up from
    $35,568 ($684 per week). And it will extend protections to about 3
    million more workers on January 1, 2025 based on a second increase
    to $58,656 per year ($1,128 per week).

-   **Enhance** **Retirement Security:** DOL’s rule will protect the
    millions of Americans who are diligently saving for retirement when
    they rely on advice from trusted professionals on how to invest
    their savings. For example, hidden fees from bad advice on just a
    single product—fixed index annuities—is currently [costing savers as
    much as $5 billion per
    year](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/10/31/retirement-rule/).
    The rule will require trusted investment advice providers to give
    prudent, loyal, and honest advice, and prevent them from providing
    recommendations that favor the investment advice providers’
    interests—financial or otherwise—at retirement savers’ expense.
    These new safeguards will save tens or even hundreds of thousands of
    dollars per impacted middle-class saver.
