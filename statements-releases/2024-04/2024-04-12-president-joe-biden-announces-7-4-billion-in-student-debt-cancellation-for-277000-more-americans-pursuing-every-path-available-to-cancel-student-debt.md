title: "President Joe\_Biden Announces $7.4 Billion in Student Debt Cancellation for\
  \ 277,000 More Americans, Pursuing Every Path Available to Cancel Student\_Debt"
---
 
*New debt cancellation for borrowers enrolled in SAVE, other
Income-Driven Repayment plans, and Public Service Loan Forgiveness comes
on the heels of President Biden announcing new plans that could benefit
tens of millions of Americans.*

Today, President Biden announced that 277,000 more Americans will get
their student debt canceled, bringing the total debt relief approved by
the Biden-Harris Administration to $153 billion for 4.3 million
Americans through various actions. This latest round of debt
cancellation comes on the heels of President Biden announcing new plans
that, if implemented, would cancel student debt for over 30 million
Americans when combined with actions the Administration has taken over
the last three years. This week’s announcements reinforce the
President’s commitment to using every path available to deliver student
debt relief to as many borrowers as possible through various actions.  
  
The 277,000 Americans receiving this latest round of debt relief are
borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan, other borrowers enrolled in
Income-Driven Repayment plans, and borrowers receiving Public Service
Loan Forgiveness. The Biden-Harris Administration fixed Income-Driven
Repayment (IDR) and launched the SAVE Plan last year – the most
affordable repayment plan ever. Already 8 million borrowers are enrolled
in SAVE, 4.5 million of those borrowers have a monthly payment of $0,
and over 1 million additional borrowers have a monthly payment of less
than $100. And if borrowers took out low balances of loans, the SAVE
Plan puts them on a faster path to debt relief after at least ten years
of payments.  
  
Since President Biden took office, his Administration has approved over
$54 billion in debt cancellation for 1.3 million borrowers enrolled in
income-driven repayment plans, including the new SAVE Plan. This builds
on additional actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to
cancel debt for nearly 900,000 public service workers, 1.3 million
borrowers cheated by their schools or borrowers covered by related court
settlements, and nearly 550,000 borrowers with a total and permanent
disability, including many veterans.  
  
While the Administration continues to cancel Americans’ student debt
through improving existing forgiveness programs and through the SAVE
Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration is also pursuing new plans that,
if implemented, would cancel student debt for tens of millions more.
Earlier this week, the President announced his Administration’s
alternative path to debt cancellation in the wake of last year’s Supreme
Court decision. Learn more about these plans at
