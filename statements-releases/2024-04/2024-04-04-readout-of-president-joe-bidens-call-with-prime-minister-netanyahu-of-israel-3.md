President Biden spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Netanyahu. The
two leaders discussed the situation in Gaza. President Biden emphasized
that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian
situation are unacceptable. He made clear the need for Israel to
announce and implement a series of specific, concrete, and measurable
steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety
of aid workers. He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will
be determined by our assessment of Israel’s immediate action on these
steps. He underscored that an immediate ceasefire is essential to
stabilize and improve the humanitarian situation and protect innocent
civilians, and he urged the Prime Minister to empower his negotiators to
conclude a deal without delay to bring the hostages home. The two
leaders also discussed public Iranian threats against Israel and the
Israeli people. President Biden made clear that the United States
strongly supports Israel in the face of those threats.
