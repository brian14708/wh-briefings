title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Final Rule to Strengthen Privacy Protections\
  \ for Reproductive Health\_Care"
---
 
Today, my Administration is strengthening privacy protections under the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act as part of our
efforts to help protect access to reproductive health care. No one
should have their medical records used against them, their doctor, or
their loved one just because they sought or received lawful reproductive
health care.

Privacy and confidentiality have always been essential to high-quality
health care. But today’s rule comes at a time when access to
reproductive health care is under attack following the Supreme Court’s
decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade*. In addition to being forced to
travel hundreds of miles for care or having their fertility services
interrupted because of Republican officials’ extreme out-of-touch
agenda, women and their families live in fear that their deeply personal
medical information will be disclosed—simply because of the type of care
they needed.

The new protections that my Administration is putting in place are an
important step forward in our fight to protect access to reproductive
health care and ensure patient privacy and peace of mind. By
safeguarding patient information, the new rule will help health care
providers give complete and accurate information to patients and improve
the quality of health care.

Vice President Harris and I will continue to call on Congress to restore
the protections of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law, and my Administration
will keep taking action to protect patients and ensure access to
high-quality health care.
