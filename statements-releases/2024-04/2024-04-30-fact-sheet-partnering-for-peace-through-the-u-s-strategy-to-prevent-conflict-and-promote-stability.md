title: "FACT SHEET: Partnering for Peace through the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict\
  \ and Promote\_Stability"
---
 
The Biden Administration marks the first year of implementation of
ten-year plans to advance the[U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and
Promote
Stability](https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/) (the
“Strategy”).   An innovative, long-term, and locally-driven approach to
conflict prevention and stabilization, the Strategy aims to bolster
partnerships with Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the
Coastal West African countries of Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea,
and Togo.  The United States is advancing these partnerships through
ten-year country or regional plans that leverage the full range of U.S.
Government tools across new and existing diplomatic, defense, and
development efforts.  Together, the United States and our partners are
elevating shared approaches to promoting peace and stability.  At the
same time, the Administration has deepened cooperation with likeminded
countries, multilateral and regional organizations, civil society, and
other stakeholders to address drivers of conflict and break costly
cycles of instability.  The Administration is also investing in
evidence-based, adaptive, and innovative programs at the local level,
aimed at strengthening social inclusion, government responsiveness,
service delivery, and security. 

***Promoting Peace and Preventing Violent Extremism in Coastal West
Africa***

-   Working with Congress, the Administration has committed more than
    $300 million to advance implementation of the ten-year plan to
    promote stability in the region.  As part of this effort, the U.S.
    and Germany are pursuing a multi-donor partnership in Benin, Ghana,
    and Togo to counter violent extremism and build trust between
    communities, governments, and security forces.
-   USAID partners with more than one hundred local organizations across
    Benin, Ghana, and Togo to reduce violent conflict by investing in
    community-based approaches, such as inter-ethnic savings and loans
    associations and mediation committees.  These communities report a
    41 percent increase in peacefully resolved conflicts and improved
    engagement on community stability by local authorities. 
-   The Department of Defense advances civil-military engagement in this
    priority region with the addition of two persistent Civil Affairs
    Teams as well as engagements with Benin and Togo through the State
    Partnership Program.  The Department of State has also significantly
    increased security cooperation with Benin and Côte d’Ivoire to
    address terrorist threats.  The United States became a contributing
    board member of the multilateral International Counterterrorism
    Academy based in Côte d’Ivoire which facilitates learning and
    sharing of best practices among regional security actors. 
-   The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is continuing to advance
    economic growth to promote stability in Coastal West Africa by
    developing and expanding critical infrastructure and related
    sectors. Last year, MCC and the Government of Benin celebrated the
    completion of the $423 million Benin Power Compact to expand access
    to energy, which is expected to benefit 11 million people over the
    next 20 years.  MCC is currently developing a Regional Transport
    Compact with the Government Benin, which is contributing $204
    million to complement MCC’s investment of $202 million, to reduce
    transportation costs along the economic corridor extending from the
    Port of Cotonou.  In addition, MCC is currently implementing a $525
    million compact with Cote d’Ivoire to grow the education and
    transportation sectors and a $35 million Threshold Program with Togo
    to improve citizens’ access to high quality and affordable
    Information and Communications Technology services.
-   Treasury is also facilitating exchanges between USAID, the
    Department of State, and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to
    advance AfDB’s new country strategy for Ghana.

***Strengthening Recovery and Resilience in Mozambique***

-   The ten-year plan aims to support the Government of Mozambique’s
    plans to promote reconciliation, recovery, and inclusive and
    sustainable development in historically marginalized and
    conflict-affected northern areas.
-   In January, USAID and the Swiss Agency for Development and
    Cooperation joined efforts to marshal more than $32 million to
    promote market-based farming in Mozambique’s Nacala Corridor.  This
    partnership is expected to increase incomes and jobs, particularly
    for women and youth in conflict-affected northern Mozambique.
-   MCC is currently implementing a $537 million Connectivity and
    Coastal Resilience Compact with the Government of Mozambique, which
    is expected to benefit an estimated 57 million people with inclusive
    economic growth, strengthened climate and coastal resilience, and
    improved agricultural value chains and transportation
    infrastructure.
-   The Department of Defense provides training and equipment towards
    maritime security, counter narcotics, and illicit trafficking, aimed
    at supporting more resilient and responsive security forces.  These
    activities build upon existing regional maritime security programs
    advancing maritime domain awareness and logistics and sustainment.
    The Department of State has increased assistance with the Mozambican
    military to address terrorist threats and maritime security. 

***Addressing Immediate Needs While Advancing Community Engagement to
Increase Security and Prosperity in Haiti***

-   The Haiti ten-year plan recognizes the critical need to address the
    immediate security crisis as part of its phased approach to
    long-term stability.  Helping Haiti restore security and democracy,
    especially at this critical moment, remains a top priority for the
    Biden Administration. 
-   In alignment with the plan’s phased approach, the U.S. continues to
    support the expeditious deployment of the Multinational Security
    Support (MSS) mission to Haiti. 
-   The United States also continues to support Haitians in advancing
    their political process to pave a path towards free and fair
    elections through programs aimed at strengthening citizen security,
    community development and resilience, addressing sexual violence,
    advancing Women, Peace, and Security, and encouraging meaningful
    dialogue.

***Accelerating Grassroots, Bottom-up Stabilization Initiatives in
Libya***

-   In addition to addressing the current state of Libya’s political
    impasse at the national level, the ten-year plan targets
    sub-national opportunities to promote reconciliation,
    reconstruction, citizen engagement, economic empowerment, and local
    governance, particularly in the historically marginalized south.
-   In the southern battle-scarred town of Murzuq, the United States has
    been instrumental in supporting a community-led reconciliation
    process.  This led to the creation of a Roadmap for Peace and
    Reconciliation and establishment of the Steering Committee that
    serves as Murzuq’s governing authority.
-   The United States is continuing to support efforts to promote
    transparent, accountable, and inclusive service delivery and capital
    investment planning – critical in fostering stability and supporting
    the development of Murzuq’s reconstruction. 
-   USAID supports Libyan entrepreneurs; micro, small, and medium
    enterprises; and historically marginalized groups to promote
    innovation, stronger business practices, and workforce skills that
    directly respond to market demands. 

***Elevating the Rights and Roles of Women and Youth for Sustainable
Peace in Papua New Guinea***

-   Through the ten-year plan, the United States elevates the rights and
    roles of women and youth in target communities in Papua New Guinea. 
    Overcoming the marginalization and disempowerment of women and youth
    provides a critical opportunity for peacebuilding while addressing a
    key risk for instability.   
-   USAID supports programs to strengthen communities’ capabilities to
    respond to violence while also supporting equitable livelihood
    opportunities.  The Department of State invests in efforts to
    address gender-based violence (GBV), including by improving law
    enforcement capacity on case management, increasing utilization of
    police services for GBV survivors, and improving services for GBV
    survivors.
-   The Department of State is expanding the Academy for Women
    Entrepreneurs into Papua New Guinea and is currently recruiting the
    inaugural cohort for the global exchange program that equips women
    with the practical skills needed to create sustainable businesses
    and enterprises. 
-   The Department of Defense is delivering Women, Peace, and Security
    courses to train and develop a gender advisory workforce with the
    Papua New Guinea Defence Force focused on gender-based violence
    prevention and response.

*“Cooperation and long-term investments in conflict prevention and
stabilization are needed now more than ever to build peace across
divided communities and boundaries.  We must collectively bolster
societal resilience to prevent and reduce the heavy human and financial
costs of conflicts that undermine global peace, security, and
sustainable development.”*

-   President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
