On March 27, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the
Office of Public Engagement hosted 30 local elected officials and
community leaders from across the state of Hawaiʻi as part of its
“Communities in Action” event series.

During the half-day forum, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials
highlighted the impacts of the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act on communities across
Hawaiʻi. Speakers also discussed the Administration’s robust
whole-of-government response to support immediate and long-term healing,
recovery, and rebuilding efforts following the devastating fires in
Maui.

Participants included local elected officials, Native Hawaiian elders
(kūpuna), educators, labor leaders, environmental experts, community
leaders, and Maui wildfire survivors who work to leverage the historic
investments from the President’s Investing in America agenda to create
and expand opportunities for working families.

The forum was the twenty-ninth in a series of “Communities in Action”
events that the White House hosts with state and local leaders to
demonstrate how the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering critical
progress for the American people. The White House Senior Liaison for the
Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities hosted
a special in-person session on Oʻahu to lift up the voices and
experiences of Native Hawaiian leaders who were not able to travel to
Washington D.C. for this event.

Administration officials included Federal Emergency Management Agency
Administrator Deanne Criswell, Director of Public Engagement Stephen
Benjamin, National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi, National Security Council
Senior Director for Resilience Jennifer DeCesaro, Department of Commerce
External Affairs Director Molly Ritner, Deputy Director of Gun Violence
Prevention Greg Jackson, Senior Advisor for Public Engagement Kota
Mizutani, and Assistant Press Secretary Michael Kikukawa.
