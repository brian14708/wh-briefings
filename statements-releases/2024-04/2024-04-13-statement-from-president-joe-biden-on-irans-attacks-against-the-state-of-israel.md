Earlier today, Iran—and its proxies operating out of Yemen, Syria and
Iraq—launched an unprecedented air attack against military facilities in
Israel. I condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms.

At my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the U.S. military
moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region
over the course of the past week.  Thanks to these deployments and the
extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down
nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles. 

I’ve just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to reaffirm America’s
ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.  I told him that Israel
demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even
unprecedented attacks – sending a clear message to its foes that they
cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel.

Tomorrow, I will convene my fellow G7 leaders to coordinate a united
diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack.  My team will engage with
their counterparts across the region.  And we will stay in close touch
with Israel’s leaders.  And while we have not seen attacks on our forces
or facilities today, we will remain vigilant to all threats and will not
hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people.
