title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Death of World Central Kitchen\
  \ Workers in\_Gaza"
---
 
I am outraged and heartbroken by the deaths of seven humanitarian
workers from World Central Kitchen, including one American, in Gaza
yesterday. They were providing food to hungry civilians in the middle of
a war. They were brave and selfless. Their deaths are a tragedy.  
  
Israel has pledged to conduct a thorough investigation into why the aid
workers’ vehicles were hit by airstrikes. That investigation must be
swift, it must bring accountability, and its findings must be made
public.   
  
Even more tragically, this is not a stand-alone incident. This conflict
has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid
workers have been killed. This is a major reason why distributing
humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult – because Israel has not
done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed
help to civilians. Incidents like yesterday’s simply should not
happen. Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians. The United
States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military
operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid
civilian casualties.   
  
The United States will continue to do all we can to deliver humanitarian
assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, through all available
means. I will continue to press Israel to do more to facilitate that
aid. And we are pushing hard for an immediate ceasefire as part of a
hostage deal. I have a team in Cairo working on this right now.  
  
Earlier today, I spoke with my friend Chef José Andrés, the founder of
World Central Kitchen, to convey my deepest condolences for the deaths
of these courageous aid workers and to express my continued support for
his and his team’s relentless and heroic efforts to get food to hungry
people around the globe.   
  
May God bless the humanitarian workers killed yesterday and comfort
their families and loved ones in their grief.
