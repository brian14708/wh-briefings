title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on $7.4 Billion in Student Debt Cancellation\
  \ for 277,000 More\_Borrowers"
---
 
Today, my Administration is canceling student debt for 277,000 more
people, bringing the total number of Americans who have been approved
for debt relief so far under my Administration to 4.3 million borrowers
through various actions. These 277,000 borrowers are enrolled in my
Administration’s SAVE Plan, or were approved for relief because of fixes
we made to Income-Driven Repayment Plans and Public Service Loan
Forgiveness.

Today’s announcement comes on top of the significant progress we’ve made
for students and borrowers over the past three years. That includes:
providing the largest increases to the maximum Pell Grant in over a
decade; fixing Public Service Loan Forgiveness so teachers, nurses,
police officers, and other public service workers get the relief they
are entitled to under the law, and holding colleges accountable for
taking advantage of students and families.   And, earlier this week, I
laid out my Administration’s new plans that would cancel student debt
for more than 30 million Americans when combined with everything we’ve
done so far.

From day one of my Administration, I promised to fight to ensure higher
education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.
I will never stop working to cancel student debt – no matter how many
times Republican elected officials try to stop us.
