Today’s report shows the American economy remains strong, with continued
steady and stable growth. The economy has grown more since I took office
than at this point in any presidential term in the last 25
years—including 3% growth over the last year—while unemployment has
stayed below 4% for more than two years. But we have more work to do.
Costs are too high for working families, and I am fighting to lower
them. I took on Big Pharma to lower prescription drug and health care
costs. I’m banning hidden junk fees that corporations use to rip off
families in air travel and banking. And I have a plan to lower housing
costs by building 1 million new homes. Congressional Republicans have no
plan to lower costs. They are fighting to give the wealthy and big
corporations more tax cuts while cutting programs like Social Security,
Medicare and the Affordable Care Act. They think the best way to grow
the economy is from the top down. The American people know we need to
build it from the middle out and the bottom up, so the middle class has
a fair shot and no one is left behind.
