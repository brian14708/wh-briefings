  \ in\_Kenya"
---
 
I offer my deepest condolences to President William Ruto, the Kenyan
Defence Forces, and the Kenyan people on the loss of Chief of Defence
Forces General Francis Omondi Ogolla and several other passengers in a
helicopter crash earlier today. During his nearly four decades of
service, General Ogolla was a valuable partner in Kenyan-U.S. relations,
dedicating his life to making his country – and all of us – safer and
more secure. From combatting terrorist threats posed by al-Shabaab to
leading efforts to bolster regional cooperation across a range of
domains, he has left an indelible mark. Throughout his career, the
United States enjoyed a close relationship with General Ogolla, who
received pilot training alongside our own officers in the United States
and developed strong relationships with U.S. diplomatic and defense
leaders, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, U.S.
Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman, and U.S. Africa Command Commander
General Langley. Our hearts go out to General Ogolla’s family and the
loved ones of all the victims in today’s crash. We share Kenya’s grief
for this tragedy and offer our resolute support in the days ahead.
