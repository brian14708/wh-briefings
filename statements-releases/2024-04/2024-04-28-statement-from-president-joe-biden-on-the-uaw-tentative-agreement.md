title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the UAW Tentative\_Agreement"
---
 
I applaud the UAW and Daimler for reaching a tentative agreement for a
record contract. The UAW workers at Daimler are building the trucks
and school buses of the future right here in America.

My Investing in America agenda will continue to create good jobs. This
agreement is a testament to the power of collective bargaining and shows
that we can build a clean energy economy with strong, middle-class union
jobs.
