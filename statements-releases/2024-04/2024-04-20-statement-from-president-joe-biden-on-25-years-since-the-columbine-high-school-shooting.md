title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on 25 Years Since the Columbine High School\_\
  Shooting"
---
 
Twenty-five years ago today, two students walked into Columbine High
School with assault weapons and other firearms they obtained without
background checks. They killed twelve of their fellow students and one
teacher, injuring nearly two dozen others, and transforming classrooms
into crime scenes. Jill and I continue to pray for the survivors and
families impacted by this traumatic event, as well as a community that
was forever changed. We know that pain never goes away.   
  
Since Columbine, over 400 school shootings have exposed over 370,000
students to the horrors of gun violence. From Newtown to Parkland to
Uvalde, we have seen communities across the nation be torn apart by
senseless violence. Students across the country now learn how to duck
and cover before they learn how to read and write. This violence must
end.   
  
I’ve met with countless families who’ve lost loved ones because of gun
violence. Their message is always the same: do something.  
  
My Administration has answered their call. We created the first-ever
White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice
President Kamala Harris. I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act, the most significant gun safety legislation in decades.
Last week, my Administration implemented the largest expansion of the
gun background check requirement since 1993, addressing the loophole
that allowed the Columbine shooters to obtain guns. This action means
fewer guns will end up in the hands of domestic abusers, felons, minors
prohibited from purchasing firearms, and other dangerous individuals.  
  
My Administration will continue taking action, but Congress must do
their part. We need universal background checks, a national red flag
law, and we must ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We
need Congress to do something—do something—so that communities won’t
continue to suffer due to the epidemic of gun violence.
