  \ Marcos\_Jr."

President Biden met today at the White House with President Ferdinand R.
Marcos, Jr. of the Philippines. The two Presidents welcomed the
unprecedented momentum in U.S.-Philippines relations and reviewed new
initiatives to enhance economic and energy security; bolster maritime
cooperation; invest in critical infrastructure; reinforce their shared
commitment to promote democracy, human rights, and labor rights; and
deepen people-to-people ties.

President Biden and President Marcos underscored their commitment to
international law in the South China Sea. President Biden reinforced the
ironclad U.S. alliance commitment to the Philippines under the
U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty, which extends to armed attacks
on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft—to include those
of its Coast Guard— in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South
China Sea.
