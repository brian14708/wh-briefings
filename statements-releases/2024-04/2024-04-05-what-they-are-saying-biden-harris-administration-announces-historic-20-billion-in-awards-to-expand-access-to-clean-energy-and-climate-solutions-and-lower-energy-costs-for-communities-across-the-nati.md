---
 
Yesterday, as part of President Biden’s historic climate agenda, Vice
President Kamala Harris and Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Michael Regan [announced $20 billion in awards to expand
access to clean
energy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/04/biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-20-billion-in-awards-to-expand-access-to-clean-energy-and-climate-solutions-and-lower-energy-costs-for-communities-across-the-nation/)
and climate solutions and lower energy costs for communities across the
nation. This investment, made possible by President Biden’s Inflation
Reduction Act, will stand up a first-of-its-kind national network that
will finance tens of thousands of climate and clean energy projects
across the country, especially in low-income and disadvantaged
communities.

*Leaders from across the country praised the announcement. Here’s what
they’re saying:*

**<u>Environmental Leaders</u>**

**Ben Jealous, Executive Director, Sierra Club:** “Today’s announcement
is a game-changer in ensuring meaningful clean energy and clean
technology investments are possible in every community in America —
particularly in low-income communities, communities of color, and areas
that far too often are overlooked. By making this kind of capital
available, the Biden-Harris administration is showing that a clean
energy future that puts people first is a reality that is within our
grasp. This is another major victory for President Biden’s Inflation
Reduction Act and one of the many reasons the Sierra Club fought so hard
to make this law a reality. I thank Vice President Harris and
Administrator Regan for their continued work in implementing this
landmark law.”
\[[Statement](https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2024/04/sierra-club-celebrates-20-billion-clean-technology-financing-made-possible),
04/04/2024\]

**Margie Alt, Director, Climate Action Campaign**: “We congratulate the
EPA and today’s awardees. These funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Fund (GGRF) will be put to work across the country to fight climate
change in our communities, including in our own backyards. This program
will provide funding for important projects to combat climate change,
reduce pollution, help accelerate our transition to a clean energy
economy, and create new jobs. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is an
example of the impactful, forward-thinking investing that Americans want
and that President Biden, EPA Administrator Michael Regan, and the
Democrats in Congress have delivered. This is smart investing in people
who are close to the problems and can implement appropriate solutions
that cut costs, save energy, and propel us toward a clean energy
future.”
\[[Statement](https://www.actonclimate.com/post/climate-action-campaign-on-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-awardee-announcement/),
04/04/2024\]

**Manish Bapna, President and CEO, Natural Resources Defense Council:**
“This is an unprecedented investment in communities that have been
overlooked for far too long. Neighborhoods and regions around the
country are primed to see significant benefits; from new jobs and
business growth to notable energy savings, putting money back in the
pockets of hard-working people’. It’s a sizeable down payment on cleaner
air, improved livelihoods and a safer climate.”
\[[Statement](https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/epa-issues-awards-crucial-clean-energy-finance-program),
04/04/2024\]

**Maite Arce, President and CEO, Hispanic Access Foundation:**
“Addressing air quality is a matter of public health and economic
strength. Recent decades have seen a rise in pollutants, affecting all
Americans, with profound impacts on Latino communities facing
socioeconomic challenges. The deterioration of air quality over the last
century presents undeniable challenges, impacting public health, and
economic stability. These issues hit hardest in vulnerable communities,
including many where industry and agriculture, vital sectors of our
economy, are integral. In terms of health, children, seniors and people
with chronic illnesses are suffering from health conditions, such as
heart disease, aggravated asthma and decreased lung function exacerbated
by polluted air. Economically, Latinos are often faced with financial
strain as they try to address these health conditions at clinics and
hospitals.”
\[[Statement](https://hispanicaccess.org/news-resources/news-releases/item/3021-hispanic-access-statement-on-the-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund),
04/04/2024\]

**Trevor Higgins, Senior Vice President for Energy and Environment,
Center for American Progress: “**The administration today is standing up
major new investment programs to make climate and clean energy projects
a reality for communities across the country. These awards offer
dedicated funding for the underserved and low-income communities that
need it most. House Republicans voted countless times in a futile
attempt to block this funding from being put to good use, but the Biden
administration has now moved this vital program beyond the reach of
partisan politics. It will fund programs that have the flexibility and
permanence to deliver on the benefits of the clean energy economy for
years and years to come.”
\[[Statement](https://www.americanprogress.org/press/statement-caps-trevor-higgins-lauds-announcement-of-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/),
04/04/2024\]

**Matthew Davis, Vice President of Federal Policy, League of
Conservation Voters:** “The Biden-Harris administration is continuing to
deliver on their promise to accelerate our country’s progress towards a
clean energy future and ensure that a healthier, more prosperous future
benefits communities previously left out…these investments from the
historic Inflation Reduction Act will jumpstart local projects and help
cut energy costs for families, create clean energy jobs, and decrease
pollution in communities disproportionately impacted by the climate
crisis and volatile fossil fuel prices. We look forward to these
investments catalyzing building energy efficiency and clean energy
projects on the ground and are thrilled that over half of these projects
will go to historically excluded communities, including communities of
color, communities with low wealth, and rural communities.”
\[[Statement](https://www.lcv.org/media-center/lcv-chispa-and-nclcv-applaud-biden-harris-announcement-of-20b-for-clean-energy-projects-in-historically-excluded-communities/),
04/04/2024\]

**LaTricea D. Adams, Founder, CEO, and President, Young, Gifted & Green,
and White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council Appointee:**
“This announcement is a game-changer for communities that have
historically been left behind and burdened by pollution. By targeting
low-income and disadvantaged communities, this funding will not only
reduce harmful climate pollution but also improve air quality, lower
energy costs, and create good-paying jobs. It is a testament to the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to equity and environmental
justice.”
\[[Statement](https://www.younggiftedgreen.org/young-gifted-green-celebrates-biden-harris-administrations-historic-20-billion-investment-in-clean-energy-and-climate-solutions/),
04/04/2024\]

**Estefany Carrasco González, Senior Director, Chispa:** “Chispa is
excited to welcome the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund investments. These
will address critically needed green energy funding for our communities
of color that need it most, resulting in cleaner air, lower energy costs
for all, and more local jobs. With local improvements such as
community-owned solar, small business loans for local employers to
electrify their vehicles, and home loans for families to improve their
home’s comfort and energy efficiency, we’re starting to see an inclusive
green energy future for all as a reality.”
\[[Statement](https://www.lcv.org/media-center/lcv-chispa-and-nclcv-applaud-biden-harris-announcement-of-20b-for-clean-energy-projects-in-historically-excluded-communities/),
04/04/2024\]

**Rev. Susan Hendershot, President, Interfaith Power & Light:** “The
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), established by the
Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, will provide critical funding
to create jobs, reduce pollution, and lower energy costs for families.
This funding represents an important step forward toward a more
equitable clean energy future by ensuring that two-thirds of this
funding is directed to communities that have historically struggled to
gain access to capital. Interfaith Power & Light celebrates today’s
announcement and the efforts by the Administration and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to invest in protecting our communities and our
Sacred Earth.” \[Statement, 04/04/2024\]

**Rev. Dr.** **Ambrose Carroll, Founder, Green the Church:** “We
celebrate the announcement of the awardees for the Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Fund (GGRF). Our communities across the country are going to
receive an infusion of investments helping to accelerate the transition
to clean energy in their homes, towns, and businesses, fueling economic
opportunity and job creation, and revitalizing communities across the
country, especially in places that have long been neglected. The GGRF
builds on the successful track records of green and community-based
lenders across the country and will provide federal funding to help
scale projects that push us closer to a pollution-free nation. This
announcement is especially important for African American congregations
and communities historically overburdened by pollution. The Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Fund is one way the Biden administration is meeting its
commitment to the Justice40 principles, and Green the Church is grateful
to the EPA for such action!” \[Statement, 04/04/2024\]

**Reed Hundt, CEO and Co-Founder, Coalition for Green Capital**: “The
EPA’s awards of $20 billion compose the largest single capitalization of
green banks in any country in the world. The United States now can lead
all nations in showing how public-private investment can deliver cheap
clean power faster than anyone has predicted – and can focus this new
investment primarily on transforming the power platform in every
low-income and disadvantaged community. With our pipeline of more than
$30 billion in demand for public capital, we at CGC look forward to
partnering with the agency, with other award winners, and with all other
community lenders that either did not apply for funds or were not
selected. Five billion dollars in capitalization is a really good
start.”
\[[Statement](https://coalitionforgreencapital.com/epa-selects-coalition-for-green-capital-for-an-award-of-5-billion-to-establish-national-green-bank/),
04/04/2024\]

**Andrew Reagan, Executive Director, Clean Energy for America:** “The
Biden Administration is cutting pollution and bringing new jobs and
consumer savings right where it’s needed most, thanks to today’s
announcement. Delivering on their commitments, $14 billion dollars is
going to low-income and disadvantaged communities, to help them make the
switch to cost-saving clean energy. It’s more proof that we can and must
decarbonize our economy in an equitable way that benefits all Americans.
The Biden administration’s continued commitment to clean energy will
help communities across the country. The Inflation Reduction Act will
continue to advance local climate solutions. And today’s announcement
will cut carbon pollution, save people money, and create good-paying
clean energy jobs nationwide.”
\[[Statement](https://www.ceforamerica.org/news/clean-energy-for-americas-statement-on-historic-greenhouse-gas-fund-investment),
04/04/2024\]

to clean and affordable energy is foundational to a sustainable future
for cities. This unique fund will allow cities to fully leverage
community and private sector partnerships to make historic strides in
creating green jobs, reducing air pollution and lowering energy bills
for residents. We thank the Biden Administration for making that a
possibility, and providing an additional tool to help our Mayors
continue to lead the way towards a brighter future.’”
\[[Statement](https://climatemayors.org/statement-ggrf/), 04/04/2024\]

**Christian Brock, CEO, Elected Officials to Protect America:** “No one
should have to suffer the injustice of living on the frontlines of the
climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Fund (GGRF) recognizes the power of federal funding to ensure worthy
projects are scaled up to levels where their impact can make major
differences for communities across the country who for far too long have
been neglected. Elected Officials to Protect America is grateful and
excited to see the GGRF empower leaders in Justice40 communities to
create economic opportunities with good paying jobs, while transitioning
to a clean energy economy for all.” \[Statement, 04/04/2024\]

**Jessica Buendia, VP of Sustainability and Green For All National
Director, Dream.Org**: “Dream.Org commends the Coalition for Green
Capital (CGC) on their $5 billion award to create a national green bank.
Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, we have worked
with the EPA, our partners, and thousands of supporters to shape GGRF
programs to center disadvantaged communities. We will continue to work
together to prioritize community engagement and technical assistance in
this next phase of implementation. Today marks the beginning of a new
era for climate finance where communities most impacted by climate
change will finally have access to the financing they need for the
solutions they deserve. Our vision is for this funding to flow to Black
and Brown communities and through minority-owned businesses to create
unprecedented work and wealth opportunities that create a greener world
for all.”
\[[Statement](https://dream.org/news-articles/statement-ggrf-award-announcement/),
04/04/2024\]

**Deneine Powell, Executive Director, Urban Sustainability Directors
Network:** “Sustainability, climate resilience, and equity are the
pillars of a future where every community can thrive. Through the EPA’s

**Justin Balik, State Program Director, Evergreen Action**: “We are
thrilled to see the awards announced today are headed to recipients
poised to build a clean energy lending ecosystem that will support
deployment across the country for years to come. $20 billion in awards
is already a major investment, but it’s only a fraction of the impact
that these programs will have, as the green banks and investment funds
awarded today stand up new revolving finance supports that attract even
more private capital. This initial investment to fund future clean
energy projects will be felt well beyond the 10-year window that applies
to most IRA programs. By focusing on communities that have been
historically locked out of traditional financing pathways and giving
communities the flexibility to design projects that meet their unique
needs, these funds will fill in the gaps left by the private sector and
allow for creativity in tackling our biggest sources of climate
pollution.”

04/04/2024\]

**Kate Johnson, Head of U.S. Federal Affairs, C40 Cities**: “The
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is a historic opportunity to invest in
communities and create a cleaner and more just energy system for all.
Cities are uniquely positioned to ensure that the projects funded by
GGRF recipients deliver the maximum benefit to people on the ground –
cleaner air, good paying jobs, and lower energy bills. C40 applauds the
EPA’s action, and encourages all GGRF recipients to partner with mayors
to advance transformative, community-driven projects that will improve
people’s lives.”
\[[Statement](https://climatemayors.org/statement-ggrf/), 04/04/2024\]

**Antonieta Cadiz, Deputy Executive Director,** **Climate Power En
Acción**: “Today’s announcement will help people get the resources they
need to make a difference in their communities. President Biden’s clean
energy plan is already creating new opportunities across America, and
there is so much more work to be done. Today’s awardees have the deep
knowledge and experience to bring the clean energy future to life,
particularly in low-income, Black, and brown communities — those who are
on the frontlines of the climate crisis. President Biden knows that the
climate crisis has disproportionately affected marginalized communities,
and their leadership is crucial to right the wrongs of historic
environmental injustice and inaction. The investments announced today
will bring cleaner air, lower energy costs, and quality jobs to the
communities most impacted by the toxic legacy of corporate polluters.”

**Maggie Monast, Senior Director for Climate-Smart Agriculture,
Environmental Defense Fund:** “Farmers and ranchers are essential allies
in generating climate solutions, but they need the right kind of
financial support to do so. Funding from the National Clean Investment
Fund will de-risk and catalyze replicable, scalable and equitable
financial solutions that accelerate climate-smart agriculture
implementation. The EPA’s announcement is a major step forward and will
generate benefits for farms, ranches and rural communities across the
nation.” \[Statement, 04/04/2024\]

**Chris Espinosa, Legislative Director for Climate and Energy,
Earthjustice:** “We applaud the Biden Administration for today’s
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards and especially commend them for
ensuring that 70 percent of this funding will benefit low-income and
disadvantaged communities. As we quickly transition to a clean energy
economy, we cannot leave large parts of the country behind. The
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is a critical piece of the IRA to invest
directly in low-income and disadvantaged communities that have long
faced the disproportionate burden of pollution, energy development, and
the worst impacts of climate change. These investments, plus the major
private capital investments they will leverage, will spur sustainable
development and job growth, lower energy costs for families, and empower
communities with the funding they need to fight climate change and clean
up their air, water, and land. While celebrating these funds, we look
forward to upcoming awards under the Fund’s $7 billion Solar for All
program, which dedicates 100 percent of its funding to low-income and
disadvantaged communities.”** **

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund provides a lifeline, offering a chance for
a cleaner, healthier future where every Latine family can access clean
air and sustainable energy. For too long, our communities have suffered
from pollution and environmental disparities, hindering our dreams and
well-being. This fund provides the crucial financial support needed to
deploy clean energy and pollution reduction projects, offering cleaner
air, safer neighborhoods, and economic opportunities. Facing potential
cuts, we must unite to defend this program, ensuring our community
thrives in a pollution-free world, now and for future generations.”
\[Statement, 04/04/2024\]

**Steve Clemmer, Director of Energy Research and Analysis, Union of
Concerned Scientists:** “Establishing the National Clean Investment Fund
is pivotal in catalyzing the transition to an equitable, decarbonized
economy. Using seed money from public funding to unlock additional
private sector investment and new low-cost financing is a cornerstone in
the transition to clean energy, and this program ensures the associated
benefits are accessible to all. It is hopeful to see a list of
non-profits that have a proven track record of financing clean energy in
low-income and disadvantaged communities.”

to North Carolina and announcing the launch of the Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Fund; and it couldn’t come at a better time. According to the
latest US climate assessment, North Carolina is one of the top five
states facing the most expensive climate disasters. But North Carolina
has also ranked first in the nation for business two years in a row, and
first in the nation in rural clean energy jobs. If we want this success
to continue, we must address the climate crisis. This announcement
addresses the heart of the climate crisis and will help ensure North
Carolina continues to be a great place for families and businesses to
thrive.” \[Statement, 04/04/2024\]

**Sandy Bahr, Arizona Chapter Director, Sierra Club**: “Sierra Club is
excited to see today’s announcement of the awardees for the Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Fund, which will help communities throughout the U.S. with
investments to facilitate a more rapid transition to clean energy. These
dollars will be focused on Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and other
communities that have experienced the worst impacts of pollution.
Scaling up clean energy via this program will help to reduce pollution
and energy costs, while improving the health of everyone, especially
those in these overburdened communities.” \[Statement, 04/04/2024\]

**Shelbie Swartz, Executive Director, Institute for a Progressive
Nevada:** “Today’s announcement is a watershed moment for climate and
clean energy funding in this country. Communities nationwide –
especially Black, Latinx and other communities that have for decades
faced the brunt of pollution – are going to see an injection of federal
investments that will help accelerate the necessary and crucial
transition to clean energy. That transition will happen in their homes,
their towns, their businesses – building on a track record of successful
green and community-based lenders across the country. The federal
funding will help scale projects that push us closer to a pollution-free
future, reduce energy costs, and improve the health of all Americans.
The GGRF is one way the Biden administration is meeting its commitment
to the Justice40 principles, and we are excited to see these investments

Action**: “Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action (MiCCA) celebrates the
announcement of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. It is a significant step towards
prioritizing the health and well-being of communities across the nation.
This key component of President Biden’s climate and clean energy plan
provides important resources in our fight against climate change and its
detrimental impacts on public health.

By directing funding towards projects aimed at reducing pollution and
lowering energy costs for families, the GGRF is fostering a cleaner and
healthier environment for all. Given the disproportionate health impacts
of those living closest to fossil fuel pollution, it is appropriate that
a significant portion of this funding be allocated to communities that
have historically struggled to access capital for pollution-reducing
projects, including communities of color, low-income, rural, Tribal, and
energy transition communities.” \[Statement, 04/04/2024\]

**Mikaela Curry, Regional Field Manager, Sierra Club:** “The Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Fund offers an incredible opportunity to equip communities
with the tools they need to reduce pollution and improve health through
meaningful investments. I am excited for the potential of this fund to
bring real dollars to real people, especially for communities that are
too often overlooked and underfunded, and have been disproportionately
burdened by pollution.”

**Deirdre Nieves, Director of Climate Solutions and Justice, West
Michigan Environmental Action Council:** “Today’s announcement of the
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) awardees marks another significant
step in the right direction for West Michigan and environmental justice
communities nationwide. With $20 billion allocated to green finance
programs, including the National Clean Investment Fund and Clean
Communities Investment Accelerator, the GGRF will empower individuals,
nonprofits, small businesses, and lenders to drive impactful projects.

two-thirds of GGRF funding will prioritize communities historically
marginalized in accessing capital for pollution-reduction projects. This
underscores the GGRF’s commitment to advancing environmental justice and
catalyzing inclusive economic growth. As we celebrate this milestone,
let us recognize it as another step in the right direction towards a
more sustainable and prosperous future for all.” \[Statement,
04/04/2024\]

**James Neal, Senior Manager for Finance Initiatives, Efficiency
Maine**: “The Efficiency Maine Green Bank is grateful for and excited

**Senator Chuck Schumer (NY):** “The investments Democrats made are
paying off for the American people. By providing $20 billion that will
flow to tens of thousands of green and climate friendly projects across
the country, today’s historic announcement, made possible by our
Inflation Reduction Act, is ushering in the clean energy revolution. I
am especially proud that EPA has secured commitments from today’s
awardees that over 70 percent of the capital – over $14 billion – will
go to low-income and disadvantaged communities. These investments mean
cleaner communities, lower energy costs, and jobs, jobs, jobs. I’m proud
of this bold investment in communities across America and New York and
confident today’s announcement will have positive reverberations for
generations to come.

For decades – low-income and disadvantaged communities have been
disproportionally affected by climate change and environmental
disasters. Now, we are pairing public dollars with private investment –
mobilizing almost $7 of private capital for every $1 of federal funding
with these populations in mind – to create good-paying union jobs, rid
communities of pollution, and lower the cost of energy. Americans are
already feeling the effects of the transformative Inflation Reduction
Act, and today’s announcement of the initial funding for two of the
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund’s programs – the National Clean Investment
Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator – will only accelerate
our country’s transition to a climate friendly and more equitable
future.

Delivering on environmental justice was one of my north stars while
writing the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Fund is poised to be one of the most significant vehicles for delivering
lasting support to our environmental justice communities. When you
invest in renewable energy and clean buildings, you are investing in the
technologies of the future and a better world for our children and
grandchildren. I am proud to have led this historic program to passage
in the Inflation Reduction Act to lower costs for families and creating
good paying jobs securing America’s energy independent future.”

disadvantaged communities. Historically, those are the places least able
to attract private capital, and we need to change that. These
investments will lower energy costs for everyone and create good-paying
jobs, and I applaud the EPA for moving quickly to implement this
program. Congratulations to the eight recipients who will bring us one

Reduction Fund will draw on the experience of public, semi-public, and
non-profit community leaders to unleash tens of billions of dollars to
deliver more than money, but also justice, to disadvantaged communities
in Massachusetts and across the country.

As the single largest climate investment in the Inflation Reduction Act,
the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will cut emissions, protect health,
and create job and economic opportunities so that communities won’t just
survive, but thrive, for generations to come. Even more than money, the
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is delivering hope – hope for justice and
for a livable future. I applaud the Environmental Protection Agency’s
work to quickly stand up this critical program while ensuring
transparency and collaboration.”

**Representative Frank Pallone (NJ-06): “**This fund, created as part of
the Inflation Reduction Act, is critical to ensuring that nobody is left
behind as we transition to clean energy. For years, underserved
communities that have tried to invest in clean energy have repeatedly
run into obstacles accessing the necessary capital. The Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Fund is designed to fix that problem by building sustainable
community lending capacity so everyone can benefit from clean energy. 

The Inflation Reduction Act included $27 billion for EPA to build the
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. EPA is still implementing the fund and
working through the award selection process for each of the three
funding opportunities announced last year.

This program is a game-changer. Third-party estimates project that
investments made through the fund could save Americans more than $100
billion and create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs over the
next decade—particularly in low-income and disadvantaged communities.
This is what investing in America looks like. Good paying jobs today for
a cleaner and healthier tomorrow. This is exactly the kind of thing this
Committee should be getting behind. But not one Republican supported the
Inflation Reduction Act, and now, true to form, they are already
attacking it. 

Their attacks are unwarranted. EPA has already put in important
safeguards to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent properly. Each
funding opportunity from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund includes
mandatory reporting requirements that apply to any award or subaward, so
that EPA can assess award performance and the progress on meeting key
milestones. EPA also included annual audits that allow it to monitor how
recipients are using their awards in order to make certain that funds
are being spent appropriately. EPA also has the flexibility to make
final awards contingent upon recipients taking additional steps that
mitigate award-specific risks identified in the selection process.

These are strong oversight requirements that EPA has put into place to
help ensure that every dollar goes toward accomplishing the fund’s
goals. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is critical to our efforts to
meet the environmental and economic challenges we face today. The
worsening climate crisis continues to wreak havoc across the nation,
costing families their homes, their livelihoods, and their lives.
Wildfires and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change are
ravaging our communities. Just last year, Americans experienced more
billion-dollar disasters than any other year on record and natural
disasters linked to climate change cost Americans more than $92 billion.
By drastically cutting our emissions, we can aggressively combat the
climate crisis, protect our communities, grow our economy through the
clean energy transition, and save money in the long-term. 

I am always disappointed when Republicans say they care about oversight
but then make it clear at hearings that their only intention is to tear
down programs that they oppose. They don’t want the Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Fund to work because they don’t want anything to undermine
their agenda of putting polluters over people. 

The size and scope of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is very large,
but so is the challenge of combating climate change. Constructive
congressional oversight can enhance EPA’s efforts to mitigate program
risks and make certain that every dollar has the greatest possible
impact. For the future of our nation and our world, we should be doing
everything we can to ensure that this program succeeds. I look forward
to hearing from the witness today on how we can best accomplish that.”

**Senator** **Chris Van Hollen (MD):** \[Thread\] “🚨 NEWS: Today the
Biden Admin announced the official launch of our Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Fund—the $20 billion ‘Green Bank’ we created with the
Inflation Reduction Act to turbocharge green innovation.

This is a major milestone in an effort I’ve worked on for over a
decade.🧵

This national Green Bank Network includes thousands of nonprofits,
companies, and individuals who will invest these funds in green
innovation & clean energy projects — accelerating our clean energy
transition nationwide.

Grantees will leverage private investments into green transportation
networks, buildings, and energy in MD and across the country — reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.

They will also build capacity among community lenders to drive
investments in underserved areas.

Overall, our public investment will leverage up to 7x more private
investment — ensuring a self-sustaining fund for generations to come.

It’ll also bolster our economy with thousands of green jobs & put more
money in consumers’ pockets as we lower the cost of clean energy.

Importantly, we’re aiming for 70% of the $$ from this Green Bank to
ensure that underserved communities are not left behind in the clean
energy revolution. They have felt the brunt of the devastating impact of
climate change & should have a seat at the table in this fight.

It’s been 15 years since I first put pen to paper on a bill to create
this Green Bank, and two years since we finally got it done with the
Inflation Reduction Act. With today’s milestone, the Green Bank will get
up and running — and the entire world will benefit.” \[[Thread on
