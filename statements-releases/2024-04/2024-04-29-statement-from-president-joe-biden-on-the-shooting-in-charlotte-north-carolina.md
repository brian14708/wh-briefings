  Carolina"

Earlier today, four brave law enforcement officers – including a Deputy
U.S. Marshal – were killed in the line of duty. They are heroes who made
the ultimate sacrifice, rushing into harm’s way to protect us. We mourn
for them and their loved ones. And we pray for the recoveries of the
courageous officers who were wounded.  
   
When a law enforcement officer puts on that shield in the morning and
heads out the door, their family members dread the phone call – the very
call that came today. It’s like losing a piece of your soul. To the
families of those we lost: Jill and I, and all Americans, are here for
you. And we will always be here for you.  
   
We must do more to protect our law enforcement officers. That means
funding them – so they have the resources they need to do their jobs and
keep us safe. And it means taking additional action to combat the
scourge of gun violence. Now. Leaders in Congress need to step up so
that we ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe
storage of guns, and pass universal background checks and a national red
flag law. Enough is enough.  
   
May God Bless these fallen heroes.
