title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Senate\u2019\
  s Vote on the Reauthorization and Reform of FISA Section\_702"
---
 
We applaud the Senate’s passage of H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence
and Securing America Act.  This legislation, which passed the House last
week and the Senate tonight with broad bipartisan support, will renew
and reform Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
(FISA) – one of the United States’ most vital intelligence collection
tools. The Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act will retain
essential authority to understand and protect against a wide range of
dangerous threats to Americans while enhancing safeguards for privacy
and civil liberties through the most robust set of reforms ever included
in legislation to reauthorize Section 702.

The President will swiftly sign the bill into law, ensuring that our
security professionals can continue to rely on Section 702 to detect
grave national security threats and use that understanding to protect
the United States.
