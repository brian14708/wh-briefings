title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Armenian Remembrance\_Day"
---
 
Today, we pause to remember the lives lost during the *Meds Yeghern*—the
Armenian genocide—and renew our pledge to never forget.

The campaign of cruelty began on April 24, 1915, when Ottoman
authorities arrested Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in
Constantinople. In the days, months, and years that followed, one and a
half million Armenians were deported, massacred, or marched to their
deaths—leaving families forever broken, and generations forever changed.

As we mourn this tragedy, we also honor the resilience of the Armenian
people. After enduring one of the darkest chapters in human history,
survivors began forging a better future for our world. With courage and
commitment, they rebuilt their lives. They preserved their culture. They
strengthened the fabric of nations around the world—including our own.
And they told their stories to ensure that the mass atrocities that
began on this day 109 years ago are never again repeated.

This remains our solemn vow. Today—and every day—the United States will
continue to stand up for human rights and speak out against intolerance.
We will continue to meet hate and horror with hope and healing. And, we
will continue to stand with all those who seek a future where everyone
can live with dignity, security, and respect.
