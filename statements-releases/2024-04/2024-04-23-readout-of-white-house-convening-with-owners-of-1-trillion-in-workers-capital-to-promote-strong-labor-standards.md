title: "Readout of White\_House Convening with Owners of $1 Trillion in Worker\u2019\
  s Capital to Promote Strong Labor\_Standards"
---
 
Today, National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard and Acting Secretary of
Labor Julie Su convened asset owners representing over $1 trillion in
public and pension fund capital who have committed to strong labor
standards in their private equity investments. The White House also
launched an initiative to promote strong labor commitments among funds,
assets managers, and companies. A
[survey](https://46eop.my.site.com/Surveys/survey/runtimeApp.app?invitationId=0Ki3d00000094vQ&surveyName=private_equity_and_labor_principles_survey&UUID=0decfe5e-2ae4-49b8-b2fd-6c7a50dc39ea)
is live for investors and companies to share their commitments to strong
labor principles.  
  
President Biden made it clear that he is leading the most pro-labor and
pro-union Administration in history. The White House is demonstrating it
will use all of its tools to promote the free and fair choice to join a
union. Capital providers are making commitments as well. These
commitments from asset owners are an important step toward ensuring
workers’ capital helps grow our economy from the bottom up and the
middle out.   

State government, public, and labor union pension funds are the savings
of hardworking Americans and their economic security in retirement.  The
Biden-Harris Administration believes that it is critical that their
funds, as they maximize risk-adjusted financial returns, emphasize the
interests and goals of workers. Fund managers recognize this as well,
which is why five key funds with over $1 trillion in assets have
convened today in support of labor principles in their private equity
investments. These principles include guaranteeing the free and fair
choice to join a union, freedom of association and the recognition of
the rights to collectively bargain, equal opportunity, a safe and
healthy workplace, and the elimination of forced and compulsory labor,
including child labor.

Additionally, to the extent in line with their fiduciary duty, funds
will encourage their portfolio companies to remain neutral when workers
seek to exercise the freedom to join together in a union; and when
applicable, enter into neutrality agreements with labor organizations
that include voluntary or card-check recognition, reasonable timelines
to first contract, and a commitment to non-interference in union
organizing. These funds are taking a public stance that workers’ rights
are foundational to a healthy economy, and affirm the President’s
commitment to worker empowerment and worker organizing.
