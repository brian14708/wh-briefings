President Biden spoke today with European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen to discuss their steadfast support for Ukraine as it
defends against Russian aggression. President von der Leyen
congratulated President Biden on the House of Representatives’ recent
passage of the national security supplemental, which will be essential
to helping meet Ukraine’s urgent battlefield needs once it passes the
Senate and President Biden signs it into law. They spoke about
how sustained international support is vital to Ukraine’s fight for
freedom.
