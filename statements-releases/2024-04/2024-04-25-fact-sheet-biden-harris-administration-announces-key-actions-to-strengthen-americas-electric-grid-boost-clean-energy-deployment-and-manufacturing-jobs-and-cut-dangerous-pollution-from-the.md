title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Key Actions to Strengthen\
  \ America\u2019s Electric Grid, Boost Clean Energy Deployment and Manufacturing\
  \ Jobs, and Cut Dangerous Pollution from the Power\_Sector"
---
 
Since Day One, President Biden has led and delivered on the most
ambitious climate and environmental justice agenda in history, including
securing the largest-ever climate investment. The power sector, which is
responsible for a quarter of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, now
has more tools than ever – including unprecedented financial support,
efficient permitting, and long-term regulatory certainty – to reduce
pollution and upgrade the grid to support more factories, electric
vehicles, and other growing sources of electricity demand. Today, the
Biden-Harris Administration is announcing key actions to build on this
momentum and deliver clean electricity to more homes and businesses,
helping lower energy costs for American families and power the U.S.
manufacturing renaissance driven by President Biden’s Investing in
America agenda, while providing cleaner air and water to communities
long overburdened by pollution from fossil fuel power plants.  
   
Today, **the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a suite
of standards to cut greenhouse gas emissions as well as toxic air
pollution, water pollution, and land contamination from fossil fuel
power plants**. EPA’s greenhouse gas emission standards will avoid 1.38
billion metric tons of carbon pollution through 2047, equivalent to the
annual emissions of 328 million gas cars, and together with the other
standards will provide hundreds of billions of dollars in climate,
environmental justice, and public health benefits, including fewer
premature deaths, asthma cases, and lost work and school days. The
standards announced today will ensure that power companies use modern,
cost-effective technologies to reduce pollution and protect the health
and wellbeing of communities, including communities historically
overburdened by pollution.  
   
The **Department of Energy (DOE) is announcing up to $331 million
through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for a new
transmission line that will be built with union labor** – the latest
awards from the Administration’s $30 billion investment in strengthening
America’s electric grid infrastructure. A capacity contract from the
Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP) will support a new 285-mile
transmission line from Idaho to Nevada, bringing more than 2,000
Megawatts of needed transmission capacity to the region. The Southwest
Intertie Project-North is expected to provide hundreds of jobs to
workers with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.  
   
Alongside this critical investment, DOE is releasing a **final rule to
make federal permitting of new transmission lines more efficient,**
ensuring meaningful engagement with Tribes, local communities, and other
stakeholders. The rule establishes the Coordinated Interagency
Transmission Authorization and Permits (CITAP) program, which aims to
improve coordination across agencies, create efficiencies, and establish
a standard two-year timeline for federal transmission authorizations and
permits. The CITAP program gives transmission developers a new option
for a more efficient review process, a major step to provide increased
confidence for the sector to invest in new transmission lines.  
   
**DOE is also issuing a final rule to create an even faster track for
completing environmental reviews of upgrades to existing transmission
lines,** which will increase reliability and lower energy costs. The
rule creates a categorical exclusion, the simplest form of review under
the National Environmental Policy Act, for projects that use existing
transmission rights of way, such as reconductoring projects, as well as
for solar and energy storage projects on already disturbed lands.  
   
Additionally, today, the **Administration is launching an effort to
mobilize public and private sector leaders to expand the capacity of the
existing U.S. transmission network, setting an ambition to upgrade**
100,000 miles of transmission lines over the next five years. The
Administration has made funding available through the Grid Resilience
and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program to support upgrades to
existing transmission lines, and DOE’s categorical exclusion issued
today will speed up the process to upgrade existing lines. The power
sector can achieve this ambition primarily by deploying modern grid
technologies like high-performance conductors and dynamic line ratings
that enable existing transmission lines to carry more power. As a
complement to building new lines, deploying solutions like these offer
fast and cost-effective ways to unlock hundreds of gigawatts of
additional clean energy, increase system reliability and resilience,
reduce grid congestion, and cut energy costs.  
   
These efforts all work in tandem – historic investments from President
Biden’s Investing in America agenda that are making America a magnet for
clean energy investment; continued permitting progress to get projects
up and running; and smart standards to provide rules of the road for
power companies, enabling them to seize the unprecedented opportunities
to deliver clean electricity across the country. These steps – which are
part of a broader slate of Earth Week
[announcements](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-marks-earth-day-2024-with-historic-climate-action/#:~:text=Throughout%20Earth%20Week%2C%20the%20Biden,focus%20on%20steps%20to%20cut)
– build on President Biden’s actions since Day One to tackle the climate
crisis and advance environmental justice.  
   
**<u>Upgrading the Electric Grid for Reliability and Resilience</u>**  
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is delivering the largest
investment in grid infrastructure in history—more than $30 billion from
the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These
investments will help deliver reliable, affordable electricity to
families and businesses, prepare for worsening natural disasters that
strain the grid, and unlock the economic and environmental benefits of
clean energy. To help expand the transmission system at the pace
necessary to confront the climate crisis, today’s actions and additional
recent steps will help streamline permitting and overcome financial
hurdles:  
 

-   **Completing a New Transmission Line:** Today the Department of the
    Interior (DOI) is celebrating the completion of the Ten West Link
    transmission line from Arizona to California. The line began
    transmitting electricity today and will increase reliability and
    unlock more than 3,200 megawatts of capacity from solar projects.
    DOI
    [approved](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-clean-energy-transmission-project-arizona-and)
    the construction of this project in 2022.  
-   **Continuing to Invest in Grid Upgrades:** Last week applications
    closed for up to $2.7 billion in DOE grant funding under the second
    round of the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP)
    program for projects to upgrade and modernize the transmission and
    distribution system to increase reliability and resilience. This
    builds upon [$3.46 billion in projects
    selected](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/grid-resilience-and-innovation-partnerships-grip-program-projects)
    for grid upgrades in October 2023, which are funded by President
    Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  
-   **Charting the Future of the Grid to Meet Emerging Challenges:**
    Last week DOE
    [released](https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/new-doe-report-outlines-solutions-meet-increasing-electricity-demand-and-cut)
    the 2024 Future of Resource Adequacy Report to lay out solutions to
    meet increasing electricity demand while cutting emissions and
    maintaining affordability. DOE also
    [released](https://liftoff.energy.gov/innovative-grid-deployment/)
    the Innovative Grid Deployment Liftoff Report to chart pathways to
    deployment of modern, commercially available transmission and
    distribution technologies that could support 20 to 100 gigawatts of
    peak demand.

**<u>Revitalizing U.S. Manufacturing and Securing Clean Energy Supply
Chains</u>**  
Thanks to incentives from President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the clean energy future will be made in
America. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, private companies have
[invested](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
almost $80 billion in clean energy manufacturing. Strengthening U.S.
clean energy supply chains not only benefits American workers but also
makes it easier to deploy clean energy even faster to cut emissions.
Recent actions continue the progress to build and secure domestic supply
chains and ensure that the U.S. will lead the world in clean energy
manufacturing:

-   **Expanding U.S. Clean Energy Manufacturing and Creating Good-Paying
    Jobs:** The Treasury Department and DOE recently announced $4
    billion in Inflation Reduction Act tax credit allocations for [over
    100 manufacturing projects across 35
    states](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-first-projects-receiving-clean-energy-manufacturing)
    under the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit (48C). This
    includes projects to manufacture transformers and grid components,
    electric vehicle components and chargers, and transmission cables,
    produce clean steel, and process critical minerals and materials.
    These allocations include $1.5 billion for projects in historic
    energy communities that have experienced closure of coal mines and
    power plants.  
-   **Securing the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain:** Last week, DOE
    [announced](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/biden-harris-administration-takes-action-secure-nuclear-fuel-supply-chain-equip)
    several milestones on the path to establish a domestic fuel supply
    chain for nuclear energy and reduce our reliance on imports. DOE
    recently closed the requests for proposal to purchase high-assay
    low-enriched uranium (HALEU) needed for advanced nuclear reactors,
    which is part of a $700 million program secured through the
    Inflation Reduction Act. Moreover, an enrichment plant (located in
    Piketon, Ohio) produced the first 100 kilograms of civilian HALEU
    ever in the United States with future plans to expand to 900
    kilograms. U.S. capabilities will increase further thanks to an
    additional $2.7 billion made available from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law in the Fiscal Year 2024 Energy and Water
    Development, which, when paired with $2.2 billion from France and
    the United Kingdom meets and exceeds a commitment made last fall at
    COP28 to pool funds to develop a safe and secure global supply
    chain.

**<u>Deploying Clean Energy to Meet America’s Power Needs</u>**  
The President’s Investing in America agenda has unleashed [unprecedented
investment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) in
deployment of clean energy technologies, attracting hundreds of billions
of dollars in private sector investment and creating over 270,000 new
clean energy jobs. The Administration is taking additional steps to
accelerate buildout of clean energy and remove roadblocks to deployment
to ensure that new clean energy resources can come online fast to meet
growing demand. Recent actions include:

-   **Accelerating Offshore Wind Deployment:** Yesterday [DOI
    announced](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-announces-new-five-year-offshore-wind-leasing-schedule)
    plans for the next five years of offshore wind leasing, as well as a
    [final rule to modernize offshore
    wind](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-finalizes-rule-streamline-and-modernize-offshore-renewable-energy)
    regulations. Over the next 20 years, the final rule is expected to
    result in cost savings of roughly $1.9 billion to the offshore
    renewable energy industry, savings that can be passed onto consumers
    or used to invest in additional job-creating clean energy projects.
     Additionally, DOE released the [Offshore Wind Liftoff
    Report](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-releases-offshore-wind-liftoff-report-and-48-million-new),
    charting a path to success for the next wave of projects through
    continued innovation and cost reductions, along with DOE’s latest
    steps to support offshore wind manufacturing and transmission
    development.  Through these actions, the Biden-Harris Administration
    continues to support state leadership and use every tool available
    to responsibly grow an American offshore wind industry that will
    create thousands of good-paying jobs, including [federal
    investments](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/DOE-BOEM-Fed-Offshore-wind-v3_w150.updated.pdf)
    and approvals under President Biden’s leadership of [10
    gigawatts](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-eighth-offshore-wind-project)
    of commercial-scale offshore wind projects, with the first two
    already providing power to the grid, as well as over 1 million acres
    newly leased to provide offshore wind opportunities for years
    ahead.  
-   **Promoting Development of Renewable Energy on Public Lands:** This
    month DOI issued a [final
    rule](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-delivers-historic-milestones-new-actions-clean-energy)
    to reduce fees for solar and wind projects on public lands by 80
    percent and announced that DOI has now permitted more than 25
    gigawatts of clean energy projects on public lands, surpassing a
    major milestone ahead of 2025.  
-   **Speeding Up Process to Connect New Power Plants to the Grid:**
    Last week DOE released the Transmission Interconnection Roadmap, a
    [first-of-its-kind
    report](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-first-ever-roadmap-accelerate-connecting-more-clean-energy-projects-nations)
    laying out solutions to accelerate the process to connect clean
    energy projects to the grid and reduce wait times for new solar,
    wind, and battery projects. The Roadmap complements $10 million that
    DOE recently made available for analytical tools and other
    approaches to accelerate the interconnection process. Additionally,
    the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is moving forward to
    implement a series of major transmission reforms, including a [final
    rule](https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-affirms-generator-interconnection-rule-acts-compliance-filings)
    to streamline the interconnection process.  
-   **Taking Advantage of Extensive Geothermal Energy Resources:**  Last
    week DOI adopted categorical exclusions to [expedite the review and
    approval of geothermal energy
    exploration](https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-adopts-categorical-exclusions-expedite-geothermal-energy-permitting)
    on public lands. In addition, DOE recently
    [released](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-unveils-roadmap-next-generation-geothermal-power)
    a new Pathways to Commercial Liftoff report on geothermal power,
    which showed how U.S. geothermal energy production could grow by a
    factor of 20 to 90 Gigawatts by 2050.  
-   **Improving the State and Local Renewable Energy Siting Process:**
    Last week DOE opened a [funding
    opportunity](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/funding-notice-12-million-available-expand-capacity-renewable-energy-planning-siting)
    for state-based collaboratives to build capacity to improve
    renewable energy planning and siting processes. This funding,
    supported by the Inflation Reduction Act, will accelerate the siting
    process to bring renewable energy online faster while improving
    outcomes for host communities, local governments, and disadvantaged
    communities.

**<u>Ensuring All Communities Benefit from Clean Energy</u>**  
From Day One, President Biden has prioritized ensuring that all
communities benefit from clean energy deployment, including the energy
communities and workers that have powered our nation for generations and
the low-income households that are burdened with high energy bills. The
Administration has followed through on these commitments—not just
talking about coal and power plant communities but investing in them.
The President’s Investing in America agenda is creating good-paying and
union jobs in energy communities, bringing solar energy to low-income
households to reduce energy bills, supporting community engagement and
improved outcomes for state and local permitting, and increasing grid
reliability and resilience through distributed energy solutions. The
President’s Justice40 Initiative sets a goal that 40% of the overall
benefits of certain federal in climate, clean energy, and other
investments flow to disadvantaged communities that have been
marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Recent
actions continue this progress:

-   **Reducing Energy Bills for Low-Income Households:** This week the
    EPA
    [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-marks-earth-day-2024-with-historic-climate-action/#:~:text=Throughout%20Earth%20Week%2C%20the%20Biden,focus%20on%20steps%20to%20cut)
    $7 billion to deploy solar energy for low-income communities through
    the Solar for All program, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.
    The 60 selections will provide funding to support 60 states,
    territories, Tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofits to
    enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from
    solar, cutting annual electricity bills by more than $350 million
    for low-income households, creating an estimated 200,000 jobs, and
    increasing grid reliability.  
-   **Deploying Clean Energy in Energy Communities:** DOE recently
    [announced](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-475-million-investment-support-clean-energy)
    up to $475 million for five projects in Arizona, Kentucky, Nevada,
    Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to accelerate clean energy
    deployment on current and former mine lands. The projects, supported
    by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will deploy
    geothermal, pumped-storage hydropower, solar, and battery storage
    and will spur new economic opportunities in communities that have
    helped power the nation for generations.  
-   **Building Opportunities for Coal and Power Plant Communities to
    Continue Powering America:** DOE recently
    [released](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/coal-nuclear-transitions-information-guide)
    an information guide and technical study for communities and
    stakeholders who are considering replacing their coal plants with
    nuclear. Coal-to-nuclear transition can significantly reduce the
    cost of nuclear plant construction, while creating new high-paying
    jobs, increasing community income and revenue, and improving public
    health. DOE’s study found that, with adequate planning and training
    support, most workers at an existing coal plant should be able to
    transition to work at a replacement nuclear plant.  
-   **Building a National Network to Finance Local Clean Energy
    Projects:** This month the EPA
    [announced](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-20-billion-grants-mobilize-private-capital-and)
    $20 billion in grant awards under two competitions from the
    Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to create a national network to fund
    tens of thousands of climate and clean energy projects across
    America, especially in communities historically left behind and
    overburdened by pollution. One selectee, the Green Bank for Rural
    America, will help bring clean energy to rural America and energy
    communities, with a particular focus on Appalachia, helping ensure
    that the communities that have powered the nation for a century do
    not get left behind in the energy transition.  
-   **Funding Microgrids for Tribal Communities:**  DOE recently
    [announced](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-viejas-microgrid-build-renewable-utility-scale#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Department%20of,the%20Kumeyaay%20Indians%20near%20Alpine%2C)
    a $72.8 million conditional commitment to fund a solar-plus-storage
    microgrid on the Tribal lands of the Viejas Band of the Kumeyaay
    Indians. This will reduce the cost of energy, power local commercial
    business, create 250 construction jobs prioritizing Tribal, minority
    and veteran-owned contractors, and enhance the Tribal energy
    sovereignty.  
-   **Advancing Environmental Justice:** Through the Justice40
    Initiative, [518 programs across 19 federal
    agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/11/29/biden-harris-administration-continues-to-accelerate-environmental-justice-in-disadvantaged-communities-through-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
    are being reimagined and transformed to ensure the benefits reach
    the communities that need them most. Federal agencies are making
    this happen with the [Climate and Economic Justice Screening
    Tool](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en), which is used to
    identify communities that benefit from the Justice40 Initiative.
