Today, the President and First Lady released their 2023 federal income
tax return. After restoring the bipartisan tradition of sharing
presidential tax returns with the public, President Biden has now shared
a total of 26 years of tax returns with the country. Once again
demonstrating his commitment to being transparent with the American
people, President Biden has released the most tax returns of any
commander-in-chief while in office.  
   
President Biden believes that all occupants of the Oval Office should be
open and honest with the American people, and that the longstanding
tradition of annually releasing presidential tax returns should continue
unbroken.  
   
The President and First Lady filed their income tax return jointly and
reported federal adjusted gross income of $619,976. They paid $146,629
in federal income tax, and their 2023 effective federal income tax rate
is 23.7 percent.  
   
The President and First Lady also reported contributions of $20,477 to
17 different charities. Among those gifts to charity was a $5,000
contribution to the Beau Biden Foundation, a public charity dedicated to
ensuring that all children are free from the threat of abuse. They also
donated to St. Joseph on the Brandywine, their home parish, the Tragedy
Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), and the National Fraternal
Order of Police Foundation, among other charities.  
   
The President and First Lady also released their Delaware income tax
return and reported paying $30,908 in Delaware income tax. The First
Lady also released her Virginia income tax return and reported paying
$3,549 in Virginia income tax.
