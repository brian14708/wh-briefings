title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Florida Supreme Court\_Decision"
---
 
Yesterday’s extreme decision puts desperately needed medical care even
further out of reach for millions of women in Florida and across the
South. The Court not only upheld Florida’s current ban on women being
able to make their own reproductive choices, it will likely trigger
Governor DeSantis’ even more extreme law that would prevent women from
accessing care before many even know they are pregnant. It is
outrageous.

Florida’s bans – like those put forward by Republican elected officials
across the country – are putting the health and lives of millions of
women at risk. These extreme laws take away women’s freedom to make
their own health care decisions and threaten physicians with jail time
simply for providing the medical care that they were trained to provide.

Vice President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of Americans
who support a woman’s right to choose, including in Florida, where
voters will have the opportunity to make their voices heard in support
of a reproductive freedom ballot initiative this November. We remain
steadfast in our commitment to protecting reproductive freedom in
Florida and across the nation and will continue to call on Congress to
pass a law restoring the protections of *Roe v. Wade* in every state.
