title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on House Passage of the National Security\_\
  Package"
---
 
Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our
national security interests and send a clear message about the power of
American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection
point, they came together to answer history’s call, passing
urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for
months to secure.  
   
This package will deliver critical support to Israel and Ukraine;
provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, Sudan, Haiti, and
other locations impacted by conflicts and natural disasters around the
world; and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. It comes
at a moment of grave urgency, with Israel facing unprecedented attacks
from Iran, and Ukraine under continued bombardment from Russia. I want
to thank Speaker Johnson, Leader Jeffries, and the bipartisan coalition
of lawmakers in the House who voted to put our national security first.
I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can
sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to
Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs.
