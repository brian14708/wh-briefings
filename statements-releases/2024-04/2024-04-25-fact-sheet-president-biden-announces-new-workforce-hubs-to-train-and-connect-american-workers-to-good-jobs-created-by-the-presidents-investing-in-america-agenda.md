title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces New Workforce Hubs to Train and Connect\
  \ American Workers to Good Jobs Created by the President\u2019s Investing in America\_\
  Agenda"
---
 
Today, President Biden will announce four new Workforce Hubs to ensure
all Americans can access the good jobs created by the President’s
Investing in America agenda, which includes the American Rescue Plan,
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the
Inflation Reduction Act. President Biden will make the announcement
during his visit to Syracuse, New York, to highlight a CHIPS and Science
Act preliminary agreement with Micron to dramatically expand
semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. The Upstate New York
region will be one of the four new Workforce Hubs, in addition to
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the state of
Michigan.  
  
Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, private
companies have announced over [$825
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-workforce-hubs-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-good-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
in manufacturing and clean energy investments, on top of $478 billion
already announced by the Administration for clean energy and
infrastructure projects funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and
Inflation Reduction Act. These investments are projected to create
hundreds of thousands of good jobs—many of which do not require a
college degree. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring
that all workers—including women, people of color, veterans, and those
that have been historically left behind–have equitable access to those
job opportunities and the training and skills needed to fill them.  
   
Today’s announcement also builds on the inaugural five Investing in
America Workforce Hubs in Columbus, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Augusta, and
Phoenix that First Lady Jill Biden
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strategies-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
last May. Over the last year, the inaugural Hubs have generated dozens
of significant commitments to create pipelines to good jobs, including
an initiative to train 10,000 skilled construction workers in Columbus,
Ohio, the first-ever registered apprenticeship program in semiconductor
manufacturing at TSMC in Phoenix, and project labor agreements on $9
billion worth of infrastructure projects across Maryland. In each of the
four new Hubs, the Administration will expand the successful models
developed in the first round of Workforce Hubs and will continue to
collaborate with state and local elected officials and community leaders
to drive effective place-based workforce development efforts that are
essential to the President’s vision of building an economy from the
bottom up and the middle out.  
   
The next four Investing in America Workforce Hubs are:  

-   **Upstate New York:** Upstate New York has emerged as a growing hub
    for semiconductor manufacturing, with record-breaking investments
    throughout the region. To date, companies have announced hundreds of
    billions of dollars in private-sector investments to regain American
    leadership in chips manufacturing since President Biden signed his
    CHIPS and Science Act. And today, President Biden is announcing a
    $6.1 billion preliminary agreement of terms with Micron to invest in
    semiconductor manufacturing in New York and Idaho, which will create
    over 70,000 jobs. The Department of Commerce, with support from the
    Departments of Education and Labor, will stand up a Workforce Hub to
    help meet the training needs of this nascent industry and related
    investments in the region by fostering collaborations with partners
    such as labor unions, employers, and education and training
    providers.
-   **Michigan:** The state of Michigan has long been the engine of the
    American auto industry — and the good-paying union jobs that built
    the American middle class. As the country accelerates into an
    electric vehicle (EV) future, President Biden is committed to
    ensuring that the workers, unions, and businesses that have
    historically powered the auto industry lead the next generation of
    clean vehicles. President Biden strongly believes that auto
    companies transitioning to new technology should retool, reboot, and
    rehire in the same factories and in the same communities with
    comparable wages. Building on significant efforts underway –
    including President Biden’s [$15.5 billion
    investment](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-155-billion-support-strong-and-just-transition)
    in the retooling of existing auto plants and rehiring of existing
    workers for the EV transition –  the Department of Energy and
    Department of Labor will partner with the State of Michigan to
    launch an Electric Vehicle Workforce Hub.
-   **Milwaukee:** Last December, the City of Milwaukee announced
    that—thanks to funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law and in response to proposed rulemaking from the
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)— the City would reduce its
    timeline for replacing 100% of its lead pipes from 60 years to the
    10 years outlined in the proposed rule. This announcement aligns
    with President Biden’s broader goal to remove all lead pipes across
    the nation within a decade. The EPA, with support from the
    Department of Transportation (DOT), will stand up a Workforce Hub to
    ensure the city has the skilled workers needed to accomplish this
    ambitious lead pipes replacement project and invest in clean water
    infrastructure in Milwaukee.
-   **Philadelphia**: The City of Philadelphia has received billions of
    dollars in funding for public infrastructure—including clean water
    infrastructure and improved roadway safety. DOT and EPA will co-lead
    this Hub to ensure the city has strong workforce pipelines for all
    residents to access good jobs replacing lead pipes and investing in
    construction and infrastructure.

These new Workforce Hubs will align with the [Roadmap to Support Good
Jobs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/biden-harris-administration-roadmap-to-support-good-jobs/),
the Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive approach to ensure that
every American—whether they go to college or not—has equitable access to
high-quality training, education, and services that provide a path to a
good career without leaving their community. A [new
analysis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2024/04/25/following-up-on-the-four-priorities-of-president-bidens-workforce-strategy/)
released today from the Council of Economic Advisors outlines the
economics behind the Administration’s workforce strategy and underscores
how it has led to record-breaking job growth.  
  
**<u>Progress to Date</u>**  
The Investing in America Workforce Hubs build on the Biden-Harris
Administration’s existing whole-of-government effort to advance
high-quality workforce development, including:  
*Building new pipelines to connect Americans to good jobs*

-   The Administration has invested more than $440 million since the
    President took office  to expand Registered Apprenticeships and
    pre-apprenticeships, supporting the education and training needs of
    more than 1 million apprentices.
-   President Biden signed a [Registered Apprenticeship Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-scaling-and-expanding-the-use-of-registered-apprenticeships-in-industries-and-the-federal-government-and-promoting-labor-management-forums/)
    to bolster apprenticeships in the federal workforce.
-   The Department of Education launched the first-ever Career-Connected
    High School grants program, supporting 19 districts and states
    reimagining the high school experience to better connect to career
    pathways.
-   The Department of Labor has provided $200 million in Strengthening
    Community College grants since 2021, supporting quality workforce
    programs around the country.
-   The Department of Labor released the [High Road Training Program
    Map](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/high-road-to-the-middle-class?_ga=2.238148357.463320814.1708019025-448780732.1700248951)
    to spotlight high-quality training programs and show where they are
    located relative to projects mobilized by the [Investing in
    America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
    agenda.
-   In January, the White
    House [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-new-commitments-toward-equitable-workforce-development-in-advanced-manufacturing/) new
    commitments to its Advanced Manufacturing Sprint, including 150 new
    advanced manufacturing-related Registered Apprenticeship programs
    and occupations have been created or are newly under development,
    and more than 4,700 new apprentices hired in advanced manufacturing
    occupations.

*Making place-based workforce investments so every community can meet
its foundational labor needs*  
In addition to the nine Investing in America Workforce Hubs that are
training residents for growing industries like clean energy and
manufacturing, the Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   [Announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-31-regional-tech-hubs-to-spur-american-innovation-strengthen-manufacturing-and-create-good-paying-jobs-in-every-region-of-the-country/)
    the designation of 31 communities across the country as Regional
    Innovation and Technology Hubs (Tech Hubs).
-   [Announced](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/12/biden-harris-administration-announces-22-recompete-pilot-program)
    the 22 finalists of the Distressed Area Recompete Pilot Program.
    Recompete will invest $200 million in economic and workforce
    development projects that connect workers to good jobs in
    geographically diverse and persistently distressed communities
    across the country. 
-   Stood up the National Semiconductor Training Center, which will
    deploy $5 billion in semiconductor-related research, development,
    and workforce needs to deliver on the CHIPS and Science Act.
-   Invested tens of billions of dollars from the American Rescue Plan
    in workforce development strategies. Through the State and Local
    Fiscal Recovery Fund, which provided funding to every single local
    government across the country, more than 2,000 state and local
    governments have invested over $13 billion in workforce development
    and worker supports projects.
-   Funded 32 coalitions across the country through the American Rescue
    Plan’s $500 million Good Jobs Challenge. As of December 2023, over
    11,000 participants have entered training programs as a direct
    result of the program and thousands of workers have secured good,
    quality jobs in high-demand industries like construction,
    manufacturing, clean tech, forestry, and healthcare.

*Boosting job quality to support recruitment and retention*

-   For the first time in nearly 40 years, the Department of Labor
    [updated](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/davis-bacon/Final-Rule_Updating-the-Davis-Bacon-Related-Acts.pdf) its
    Davis-Bacon regulations to modernize and strengthen prevailing wage
    rates for workers on federally funded construction projects, which
    will raise wages for 1 million construction workers over time.
-   The National Labor Relations Board issued
    a [decision](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-issues-decision-announcing-new-framework-for-union-representation) announcing
    a new framework for union representation proceedings—where if an
    employer commits any unfair labor practices during a representation
    election, the Board will order the employer to recognize and bargain
    with the union, rather than re-running the election.
-   The Department of Energy is requiring grant applicants to submit
    Community Benefits Plans to access Investing in America funding.
-   Nearly all of the significant construction programs contained in
    President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science
    Act, and Inflation Reduction Act require or strongly incentivize the
    use of Davis-Bacon prevailing wages.
-   The Inflation Reduction Act offers incentives that increase the
    value of clean energy tax credits by five times if employers pay
    prevailing wages and employ registered apprentices.
-   The Department of Commerce required major CHIPS and Science Act
    awardees provide high-quality child care to their employees.
-   The American Rescue Plan provided $24 billion to help child care
    providers keep their doors open – including over $2 billion for
    higher pay, hiring or retention bonuses, or other expanded benefits
    for care workers. [Recent
    analysis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/11/07/child-care-stabilization/)
    shows that this funding led to an increase in the labor force
    participation rate of mothers with young children of about 3
    percentage points relative to similar groups.
