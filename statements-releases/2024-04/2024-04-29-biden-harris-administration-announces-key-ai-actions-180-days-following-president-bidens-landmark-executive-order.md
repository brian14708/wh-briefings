title: "Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Key AI Actions 180 Days Following\
  \ President\_Biden\u2019s Landmark Executive\_Order"
---
 
Six months ago, President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order to
ensure that America leads the way in seizing the promise and managing
the risks of artificial intelligence (AI). Since then, agencies all
across government have taken vital steps to manage AI’s safety and
security risks, protect Americans’ privacy, advance equity and civil
rights, stand up for consumers and workers, promote innovation and
competition, advance American leadership around the world, and more.  
   
**Today, federal agencies reported that they completed all of the
180-day actions in the E.O. on schedule, following their recent
successes completing each 90-day, 120-day, and 150-day action on time.**
Agencies also progressed on other work tasked by the E.O. over longer
timeframes.  
   
Actions that agencies reported today as complete include the
following:  
   
**<u>Managing Risks to Safety and Security:</u>**  
Over 180 days, the Executive Order directed agencies to address a broad
range of AI’s safety and security risks, including risks related to
dangerous biological materials, critical infrastructure, and software
vulnerabilities. To mitigate these and other threats to safety, agencies
have:  

-   **Established a framework for nucleic acid synthesis screening to
    help prevent the misuse of AI for engineering dangerous biological
    materials.** This work complements in-depth study by the Department
    of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Energy (DOE) and Office of
    Science and Technology Policy on AI’s potential to be misused for
    this purpose, as well as a DHS report that recommended mitigations
    for the misuse of AI to exacerbate chemical and biological threats.
    In parallel, the Department of Commerce has worked to engage the
    private sector to develop technical guidance to facilitate
    implementation. Starting 180 days after the framework is announced,
    agencies will require that grantees obtain synthetic nucleic acids
    from vendors that screen.  
-   **Released for public comment draft documents on managing generative
    AI risks, securely developing generative AI systems and dual-use
    foundation models, expanding international standards development in
    AI, and reducing the risks posed by AI-generated content.** When
    finalized, these documents by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) will provide additional guidance that builds
    on NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework, which offered individuals,
    organizations, and society a framework to manage AI risks and has
    been widely adopted both in the U.S. and globally.  
-   **Developed the first AI safety and security guidelines for critical
    infrastructure owners and operators.** These guidelines are informed
    by the completed work of nine agencies to assess AI risks across all
    sixteen critical infrastructure sectors.  
-   **Launched the AI Safety and Security Board** to advise the
    Secretary of Homeland Security, the critical infrastructure
    community, other private sector stakeholders, and the broader public
    on the safe and secure development and deployment of AI technology
    in our nation’s critical infrastructure. The Board’s 22 inaugural
    members include representatives from a range of sectors, including
    software and hardware company executives, critical infrastructure
    operators, public officials, the civil rights community, and
    academia.   
-   **Piloted new AI tools for identifying vulnerabilities in vital
    government software systems.** The Department of Defense (DoD) made
    progress on a pilot for AI that can find and address vulnerabilities
    in software used for national security and military purposes.
    Complementary to DoD’s efforts, DHS piloted different tools to
    identify and close vulnerabilities in other critical government
    software systems that Americans rely on every hour of every day.

**<u>Standing up for Workers, Consumers, and Civil Rights</u>**  
The Executive Order directed bold steps to mitigate other risks from
AI—including risks to workers, to consumers, and to Americans’ civil
rights—and ensure that AI’s development and deployment benefits all
Americans. Today, agencies reported that they have:

-   **Developed bedrock principles and practices for employers and
    developers to build and deploy AI safely and in ways that empower
    workers.** Agencies all across government are now starting work to
    establish these practices as requirements, where appropriate and
    authorized by law, for employers that receive federal funding.  
-   **Released guidance to assist federal contractors and employers
    comply with worker protection laws as they deploy AI in the
    workplace.** The Department of Labor (DOL) developed a
    [guide](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/ai/ai-eeo-guide) for
    federal contractors and subcontractors to answer questions and share
    promising practices to clarify federal contractors’ legal
    obligations, promote equal employment opportunity, and mitigate the
    potentially harmful impacts of AI in employment decisions. DOL also
    provided
    [guidance](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/fab/fab2024_1.pdf)
    regarding the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act and other
    federal labor standards as employers increasingly use of AI and
    other automated technologies in the workplace.  
-   **Released resources for job seekers, workers, and tech vendors and
    creators on how AI use could violate employment discrimination
    laws.** The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s resources
    clarify that existing laws apply the use of AI and other new
    technologies in employment just as they apply to other employment
    practices.  
-   **Issued guidance on AI’s nondiscriminatory use in the housing
    sector.** In two guidance documents, the Department of Housing and
    Urban Development affirmed that existing prohibitions against
    discrimination apply to AI’s use for tenant screening and
    advertisement of housing opportunities, and it explained how
    deployers of AI tools can comply with these obligations.  
-   **Published guidance and principles that set guardrails for the
    responsible and equitable use of AI in administering public benefits
    programs.** The Department of Agriculture’s guidance explains how
    State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments should manage
    risks for uses of AI and automated systems in benefits programs such
    as SNAP. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released
    a plan with guidelines on similar topics for benefits programs it
    oversees. Both agencies’ documents prescribe actions that align with
    the Office of Management and Budget’s policies, published last
    month, for federal agencies to manage risks in their own use of AI
    and harness AI’s benefits.  
-   **Announced a final rule clarifying that nondiscrimination
    requirements in health programs and activities continue to apply to
    the use of AI, clinical algorithms, predictive analytics, and other
    tools.** Specifically, the rule applies the nondiscrimination
    principles under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act to the use
    of patient care decision support tools in clinical care, and it
    requires those covered by the rule to take steps to identify and
    mitigate discrimination when they use AI and other forms of decision
    support tools for care.  
-   **Developed a strategy for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of
    AI deployed in the health care sector.** The strategy outlines
    rigorous frameworks for AI testing and evaluation, and it outlines
    future actions for HHS to promote responsible AI development and
    deployment.

**<u>Harnessing AI for Good</u>**  
President Biden’s Executive Order also directed work to seize AI’s
enormous promise, including by advancing AI’s use for scientific
research, deepening collaboration with the private sector, and piloting
uses of AI. Over the past 180 days, agencies have done the following:

-   **Announced DOE** [**funding
    opportunities**](https://science.osti.gov/ascr/-/media/grants/pdf/foas/2024/DE-FOA-0003264-000001.pdf)
    **to support the application of AI for science**, including
    energy-efficient AI algorithms and hardware.   
-   **Prepared convenings for the next several months with utilities,
    clean energy developers, data center owners and operators, and
    regulators in localities experiencing large load growth.** Today,
    DOE
    [announced](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-new-actions-enhance-americas-global-leadership-artificial-intelligence)
    new actions to assess the potential energy opportunities and
    challenges of AI, accelerate deployment of clean energy, and advance
    AI innovation to manage the growing energy demand of AI.  
-   **Launched pilots, partnerships, and new AI tools to address energy
    challenges and advance clean energy.** For example, DOE is piloting
    AI tools to [streamline permitting
    processes](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/policyai) and improving
    siting for clean energy infrastructure, and it has developed other
    powerful [AI
    tools](https://www.energy.gov/cet/doe-advancing-ai-innovation-ecosystem)
    with applications at the intersection of energy, science, and
    security. Today, DOE also published a
    [report](https://www.energy.gov/cet/articles/ai-energy) outlining
    opportunities AI brings to advance the clean energy economy and
    modernize the electric grid.  
-   **Initiated a sustained effort to analyze the potential risks that
    deployment of AI may pose to the grid.** DOE has started the process
    of convening energy stakeholders and technical experts over the
    coming months to collaboratively assess potential risks to the grid,
    as well as ways in which AI could potentially strengthen grid
    resilience and our ability to respond to threats—building off a new
    [public
    assessment](https://energy.gov/ceser/articles/doe-delivers-initial-risk-assessment-artificial-intelligence-critical-energy).  
-   **Authored a report on AI’s role in advancing scientific research to
    help tackle major societal challenges,** written by the President’s
    Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

**<u>Bringing AI Talent into Government</u>**  
**The AI and Tech Talent Task Force has made substantial progress on
hiring through the AI Talent Surge.** Since President Biden signed the
E.O., federal agencies have hired over 150 AI and AI-enabling
professionals and, along with the tech talent programs, are on track to
hire hundreds by Summer 2024. Individuals hired thus far are already
working on critical AI missions, such as informing efforts to use AI for
permitting, advising on AI investments across the federal government,
and writing policy for the use of AI in government.
