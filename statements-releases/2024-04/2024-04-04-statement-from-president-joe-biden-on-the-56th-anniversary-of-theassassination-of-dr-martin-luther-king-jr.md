  \ of Dr. Martin Luther King,\_Jr."

 Fifty-six years ago today, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his last
breath in the cause to redeem the soul of our nation. He was in Memphis
to march with sanitation workers rightly demanding safer working
conditions, fairer wages, and basic dignity as part of the larger quest
to make real the promise of America for all Americans.  
   
But then, an extremist – armed with a rifle in his hands and fueled by
the poison of white supremacy in his heart – shot and killed a great
American who loved his country so deeply to make it better – even
greater – even when it didn’t always love him back. Dr. King and
generations of foot soldiers known and unknown embody a patriotism that
continues to inspire generations of Americans, including me.  
   
Dr. King is one of my political heroes. I was just out of law school
when my hometown of Wilmington, Delaware was among the many cities
engulfed in turmoil in the wake of his assassination. His unfinished
mission inspired me to leave a prestigious law firm to become a public
defender and begin a career in public service.  
   
Since then, I’ve seen the push and pull and progress and setback on
everything he stood for from voting rights to jobs and justice for all
Americans. I’ve had the greatest honor to serve as Vice President to the
first Black President and now President with the first woman Vice
President, as we carry forward his vision of a beloved community.  
   
But on this day, and in this time, we all do well to remember another
essential lesson about Dr. King’s life and legacy. All Americans –
regardless of party or background – should be able to reject political
violence and hate-fueled violence in any form. We must condemn it, not
condone it. We must confront it, not whitewash it. As we do, we must
teach history and make history, not erase history. We must choose
community over chaos.  
   
Jill and I send our love to the entire King family. We especially keep
in our hearts the legacy of Mrs. Coretta Scott King, who we all miss
dearly and who did so much in her own right to redeem the soul of our
nation.  
   
May God bless Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
