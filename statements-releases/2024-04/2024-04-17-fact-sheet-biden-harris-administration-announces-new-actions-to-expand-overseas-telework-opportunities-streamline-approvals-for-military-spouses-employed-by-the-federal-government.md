*April 17, 2024*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a permanent
memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the Department of Defense (DoD)
and State Department to strengthen the Domestic Employees Teleworking
Overseas (DETO) program for military spouses who work for the federal
government. As directed by President Biden’s [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/09/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-sweeping-executive-actions-to-strengthen-economic-opportunity-for-military-and-veteran-spouses-caregivers-and-survivors/)
(EO) on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses,
Military Caregivers, and Survivors, this MOA will help military spouses
who are Federal employees maintain their careers and keep their families
together when their servicemembers are stationed overseas. Later today,
First Lady Jill Biden will be joined by Deputy Secretary of Defense
Kathleen Hicks and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma to sign the
MOA during a ceremony at the White House.

With this Agreement:

-   DoD and the State Department will work together to facilitate
    approval of DETO arrangements for federal employees who are spouses
    of military and DoD civilian employee sponsors, and who plan to work
    remotely from their military-managed residences while overseas;
-   DoD will provide a range of security services normally carried out
    by Regional Security Officers at U.S. embassies and consulates, such
    as emergency planning, evacuation assistance, and initial incident
    response for serious incidents—streamlining residential safety and
    security screening requirements by eliminating State Department
    inspections of military housing, significantly shortening the DETO
    approval process; and,
-   The State Department will now accept DoD safety and security
    standards where DoD has approved accompanied assignments and
    Military Housing Offices (MHOs) serving the military installation
    community, easing the burden on military families by ensuring that
    all required security or safety upgrades are covered by existing
    housing allowances.

The President and First Lady, as a military family, recognize the
commitment and resilience of military families as essential to the
recruitment, retention, and readiness of our Armed Forces. Since Day One
of the Biden Administration, Dr. Biden, through her [*Joining
Forces*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/joiningforces/) initiative, has
worked to eliminate barriers to employment and increase economic
opportunity for military families. Meeting the economic, social, and
emotional needs of our military and veteran families, caregivers, and
survivors is a national security imperative.

Although military spouses are talented, diverse, and resilient, they
find themselves facing a 21 percent unemployment rate, a rate that has
not significantly changed over the past decade. With more than 16,000
military, veteran, and surviving spouses working for Federal departments
and agencies, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking comprehensive
steps to enable the Federal government to be the model employer for
military spouses. Since President Biden signed the EO last June, the
First Lady’s *Joining Forces* initiative, together with the National
Security Council staff and federal departments and agencies, have made
significant progress implementing the nearly twenty new actions aimed at
enhancing career stability, expanding employment resources, and
improving transition assistance support for military-connected spouses.
Key actions to-date include:

-   **Increased Federal Agencies’ Promotion of Military Spouse Hiring
    Authorities on USAJobs.** As of April 2024, the Office of Personnel
    Management (OPM) reports that 84% of federal agencies are
    advertising jobs with the military spouse hiring authority, up from
    70% in December 2023. Under the EO, OPM is developing a data-driven
    approach to increase transparency and accountability in hiring and
    retention — including by encouraging agencies to: set goals for
    hiring under the Military Spouse Noncompetitive Appointment
    Authority established by 5 U.S.C. 3330d and for hiring individuals
    eligible for derivative preference, to use data internally to
    improve performance, and to use data to publicly report on progress.

<!-- -->

-   **Launched the Fast-Track Action Committee on Data about
    Military-Connected Federal Employees, Led by Military Spouses**. In
    March 2024, the National Science and Technology Council established
    a Fast-Track Action Committee to identify ways for agencies to
    expand Federal datasets to track outcomes for military and veteran
    spouses, military caregivers, and survivors employed by the Federal
    government. This committee is led by military spouses with deep
    expertise in data, including the Deputy U.S. Chief Technology
    Officer for Tech Capacity, a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and a
    Program Director in OPM. Its membership includes data practitioners
    from ten Federal agencies, most of whom are themselves
    military-connected. The Committee’s work will enable Federal
    agencies to better use data to expand opportunities for
    military-connected Federal employees. 

<!-- -->

-   **Released the First-ever Government-Wide Military-Connected
    Strategic Plan**. In February 2024, OPM published the
    Government-Wide Military-Connected [Strategic
    Plan](https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/FY24-28%20Gwide%20Military-Connected%20Strategic%20Plan%202-27-24.pdf),
    the first whole-of-government hiring and retention strategy focused
    on leveraging the talent of military and veteran spouses, military
    caregivers, and survivors. This plan includes guidance to help
    federal departments and agencies: set standard metrics of success
    for the recruitment and retention of military-connected families;
    leverage existing tools to retain military-connected employees in
    federal careers; eliminate barriers to hiring military-connected
    employees; increase understanding of the talent, experience, and
    diversity of military-connected employees; and track specific data
    on hiring and retention of military-connected employees.

<!-- -->

-   **Published the Guide to Recruiting and Hiring Military Spouses.**
    In February 2024*, Joining Forces* released a
    [Guide](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Military-Spouse-Hiring-Toolkit_PDF-1.pdf)
    *to Recruiting and Hiring Military Spouses* to: equip federal hiring
    managers and their staff with the knowledge, tools and resources to
    strengthen their recruitment of military spouses; build their
    understanding of the diverse skillsets and strengths of military
    spouses; and, share leading hiring and retention practices from
    successful teams across the Federal government. OPM has published
    this new guide on
    the [FedsHireVets](https://www.opm.gov/fedshirevets/hiring-officials/reference-materials/) website
    and is providing the resource as part of annual training for agency
    human resources personnel and hiring managers.

-   **Established Tax-Free Dependent Care Spending Accounts for Service
    members**. In January 2024, DoD began implementing [Dependent Care
    Flexible Spending
    Accounts](https://www.militaryonesource.mil/benefits/dependent-fsa/) to
    allow servicemembers and their families to use their pretax dollars
    to help cover the cost of child care and adult dependent care.

<!-- -->

-   **Reduced Child Care Costs for Military Families**. In January 2024,
    DoD
    [reduced](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3662171/dod-reduces-on-base-child-care-fees-for-military-families/)
    the amounts that lower-earning servicemembers pay out of pocket for
    child care, lowering child care costs for the families of more than
    32,000 children aged 0-12 enrolled in installation Child Development
    Programs. Military families earning $45,000 would see a 34% decrease
    in the amount they pay for child care.

<!-- -->

-   **Released Chief Human Capital Officer Guidance Memo**. In November
    2023, the Office of Personnel Management issued a Chief Human
    Capital Officer Guidance
    [Memo](https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-support-executive-order-14100%E2%80%94advancing-economic-security-military-and-veteran)
    encouraging federal agencies to improve work-place policies to help
    strengthen the recruitment and retention of military-connected
    federal employees.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanded the Military Spouse Employment Partnership**. In October
    2023, DoD inducted 130 new businesses as partners in the [Military
    Spouse Employment
    Partnership](https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/Story/Article/3558394/military-spouses-to-gain-more-job-ops-thanks-to-growing-employment-partnership/)
    (MSEP), a recruitment and employment initiative that directly
    connects companies looking to grow their workforce with military
    spouses looking for work. Since MSEP launched in 2011, it has grown
    to include members from more than 700 businesses, nonprofits and
    federal agencies, which have collectively hired more than 275,000
    military spouses.  

<!-- -->

-   **Launched Entrepreneurship Training Course for Military Spouses.**
    In July 2023, the Small Business Administration launched the
    [Military Spouse Pathways to Business
    Program](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/07/17/biden-harris-administration-introduces-new-entrepreneurship-training-course-military-spouses),
    which provides a tailored curriculum through online and in-person
    courses to assist military spouses in starting and maintaining their
    small businesses as they transition duty-stations or relocate due to
    their spouses’ military service.

These actions represent the Biden-Harris Administration’s holistic
commitment to ensuring that the Federal government is a leader among
employers, modeling approaches to recruit, hire, and retain military
spouse talent—but our work is not done. The First Lady’s *Joining
Forces* initiative, in partnership with the National Security Council,
will continue to lead federal departments and agencies in implementing
the Executive Order on Advancing Economic Security for Military and
Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors. President Biden and
Dr. Biden recognize that the commitment and resilience of military
spouses and their families are essential to the recruitment, retention,
and readiness of our Armed Forces. As Commander-in-Chief, the President
will keep fighting for the economic, social, and emotional needs of our
military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.
