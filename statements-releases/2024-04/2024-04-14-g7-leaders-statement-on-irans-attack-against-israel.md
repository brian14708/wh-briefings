title: "G7 Leaders\u2019 Statement on Iran\u2019s Attack Against\_Israel"
---
 
We, the Leaders of the G7, unequivocally condemn in the strongest terms
Iranâ€™s direct and unprecedented attack against Israel. Iran fired
hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israel. Israel, with the help of
its partners, defeated the attack.

We express our full solidarity and support to Israel and its people and
reaffirm our commitment towards its security.

With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the destabilization of
the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation.
This must be avoided. We will continue to work to stabilize the
situation and avoid further escalation. In this spirit, we demand that
Iran and its proxies cease their attacks, and we stand ready to take
further measures now and in response to further destabilizing
initiatives.

We will also strengthen our cooperation to end the crisis in Gaza,
including by continuing to work towards an immediate and sustainable
ceasefire and the release of hostages by Hamas, and deliver increased
humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in need.
