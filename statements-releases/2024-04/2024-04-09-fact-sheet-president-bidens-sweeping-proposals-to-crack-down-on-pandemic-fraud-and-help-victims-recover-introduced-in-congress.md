*Major New Legislation Introduced by Senators Peters, Durbin, and Wyden
Includes Key White House Proposals to Address Systemic Pandemic Fraud
and Prevent Future Schemes*

Today, Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee
Chairman Gary Peters, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, and
Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden are introducing major new legislation,
the Fraud Prevention and Recovery Act—modeled on President Biden’s
[Sweeping Pandemic Anti-Fraud
Proposal](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-president-bidens-sweeping-pandemic-anti-fraud-proposal-going-after-systemic-fraud-taking-on-identity-theft-helping-victims/)
highlighted in the [Fiscal Year (FY) 2025
Budget](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-for-fiscal-year-2025/)—to
crack down on systemic pandemic fraud across government programs and
help victims of identity theft recover.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding economic crisis devastated
families, workers and businesses nationwide. Past underinvestment in
basic government technology and the crush of demand during the pandemic
combined with ill-considered decisions to take down basic fraud controls
at the onset of the pandemic led to a significant degree of fraud and
identity theft of emergency benefits. While millions of Americans
scraped by, bad actors exploited this national emergency, siphoning
taxpayer-funded resources from small businesses and struggling families
when they needed them most. This systemic fraud particularly impacted
the small business programs and the new and expanded unemployment
benefits that originated in early 2020.

Fortunately, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan led to a historic
recovery across the country, with 15 million jobs created and the
longest streak of sub-4% unemployment in more than 50 years. While this
critical legislation and the initial pandemic legislation in 2020 were
essential to mitigating the health and economic impacts of this
unprecedented pandemic, the President has continued to call for further
action to punish those who engaged in major and systemic fraud against
the American people at the onset of the pandemic, to put in place
stronger fraud and identity theft prevention measures going forward, and
to protect Americans who were innocent victims of identity theft.

***President Biden strongly supports this new legislation, as well as
separate bipartisan legislation, that would enact his proposals to***:

-   Provide hundreds of millions of dollars for investigation and
    prosecution of those engaged in major or systemic pandemic fraud.
-   Invest in fraud prevention to help prevent identity theft and major
    fraud involving public benefits programs.
-   Help victims of identity theft who find themselves facing hardship,
    credit score deterioration, tax liability, and extreme stress and
    helplessness through no fault of their own.

**This legislation is the latest in a series of bills—including several
that are bipartisan—that would enact the President’s comprehensive
pandemic anti-fraud proposal. This legislation, along with other
bipartisan proposals, would:**

**<u>I. Prosecute & Recover: Ensuring That Oversight and Enforcement
Bodies Have the Resources to Prosecute Major Pandemic Fraud & Recoup
Taxpayer Dollars:</u>** We must empower law enforcement to investigate,
pursue, prosecute, and recover money from those who have engaged in
major or sophisticated fraud—from individuals who egregiously stole
hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars from taxpayers to
sophisticated criminal syndicates engaging in systemic identity theft.
The oversight and law enforcement communities need both the time to
prosecute the most serious and sophisticated cases and the resources to
hire law enforcement and investigators for multi-year assignments.
That’s why this legislation:

-   **<u>Provides $300 million to triple the COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force
    teams</u>** created by the Department of Justice (DOJ) “Chief
    Pandemic Fraud Prosecutor.” These “strike forces” have been highly
    effective, having worked with DOJ attorneys across the country to
    [seize or forfeit over $1.4 billion in stolen COVID-19 relief
    funds](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-results-nationwide-covid-19-fraud-enforcement-action).
    This additional funding will ensure that the Department has the
    necessary resources to prosecute the full range of pandemic fraud,
    bring to justice the most egregious and sophisticated offenders, and
    recover additional stolen funds for the American people.
-   **<u>Increases the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act cap to $1
    million,</u>** ensuring that all remedies are available to recapture
    large, six-figure fraud that might otherwise fall below the
    prioritization threshold for prosecution. Supported by the heads of
    both the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Pandemic
    Response Accountability Committee (PRAC), this reform will raise the
    administrative claims cap from $150,000 to $1 million.
-   **<u>Provides $250 million to the Small Business Administration
    (SBA) and Department of Labor (DOL) Offices of Inspectors General
    (OIGs),</u>** ensuring they have the resources needed to identify
    and recover billions of dollars in fraudulent payments. This funding
    is provided for the express purpose of long-term hiring of
    investigators to pursue special cases of organized pandemic fraud
    and supporting the interagency strike forces led by the DOJ Chief
    Pandemic Fraud Prosecutor.
-   **<u>Continues the Department of Labor (DOL) OIG’s access to
    expanded unemployment insurance (UI) datasets that can be used to
    detect instances of multi-state and coordinated fraud,</u>** where
    the same identity is inappropriately used to apply for benefits in
    multiple states. The expanded authorities in this legislation ensure
    continued access to datasets that will help DOL OIG detect and
    investigate criminal syndicates that have defrauded state UI systems
    across the country.
-   **<u>Wyden-Crapo proposal to raise</u>** **<u>statute of limitations
    for pandemic UI fraud to 10 years:</u>** In addition to the
    Peters-Durbin-Wyden legislation proposed today, Senate Finance
    Committee Chair Ron Wyden and Ranking Member Mike Crapo [introduced
    a bipartisan legislative
    framework](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/08/statement-from-senior-advisor-and-american-rescue-plan-coordinator-gene-sperling/)
    that, like the President’s March 2023 Anti-Fraud proposal, would
    extend the statute of limitation to 10 years. This proposal was also
    highlighted in the President’s FY 2025 budget. It will provide
    extended time for prosecutors to investigate and prosecute complex
    criminal syndicates. This provision goes hand-in-hand with the
    additional funding provided in today’s legislation, ensuring
    investigators and prosecutors have both enough time and enough
    resources to identify, investigate, and prosecute the criminals who
    stole billions in pandemic relief dollars.

**<u>II. Prevent & Safeguard: Investing in Fraud and Identity Theft
Prevention Going Forward:</u>** The pandemic exposed significant
vulnerabilities in our government benefits systems, especially regarding
preventing systemic identity theft. Reliance on historic knowledge-based
verification (e.g., Social Security number, date of birth) is more and
more susceptible to attacks given the widespread ease of access by
criminal syndicates to individuals’ personal information, which can be
bought on the dark web for pennies. We also know that identity theft
exacts a devastating toll on its victims. Ever-evolving and increasingly
sophisticated identity theft schemes cause significant tax and credit
harms to the victims of identity fraud as well as equally serious
challenges in resolving those harms. That’s why this legislation:

**Invests in Major Fraud Prevention Strategy:  
  
**

-   **<u>Provides $25 million and new authorities to expand Treasury’s
    Do Not Pay Service.</u>** Building on the Administration’s
    significant progress in adding the most comprehensive source of
    death data to Do Not Pay earlier this year to prevent payments to
    deceased individuals, this legislation will add new funds,
    authorities, and datasets to Treasury to increase Do Not Pay’s
    capacity to identify, prevent, and recover improper payments and
    related fraudulent activity.
-   **<u>Provides $75 million for privacy-preserving validation of key
    identity attributes.</u>** This attribute validation system,
    operated by the Social Security Administration, will allow agencies
    to validate that a provided name, date of birth, and Social Security
    number—three critical pieces of identity information—match official
    government records while preserving the privacy of individuals by
    providing just a “yes” or “no” response. This system will help
    reduce government reliance on data brokers while increasing access
    and ensuring individual privacy.
-   **<u>Peters-Romney Extension of a Cutting-Edge Anti-Fraud Analytics
    Platform – the Pandemic Analytics Center for Excellence
    (PACE)</u>**: In addition to the Peters-Durbin-Wyden legislation
    announced today, Senators Gary Peters and Mitt Romney recently
    introduced [bipartisan
    legislation](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/dems/peters-and-romney-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-strengthen-oversight-of-government-spending/)
    to enact the President’s call to expand and make permanent the
    PRAC’s Pandemic Analytics Center of Excellence (PACE). The
    President’s March 2023 plan called for the extension of PACE. The
    PACE’s cutting-edge analytics capabilities, developed and refined
    during the pandemic, provide analytic, audit, and investigative
    support to the Inspector General community. The President supports a
    permanent anti-fraud data and analytics capability analogous to the
    PACE for the IG community, and, given the ever-evolving nature of
    fraud, strongly supports expanding this effort in the future to
    focus increasingly on up-front detection and prevention of fraud,
    covering all Federal spending.
-   **<u>Upcoming Death Master File Legislation:</u>** In addition to
    the Peters-Durbin-Wyden bill announced today, the President looks
    forward to the movement of legislation to make Treasury Do Not Pay’s
    access to the Death Master File permanent. Earlier this year, the
    Administration successfully added the Death Master File—the most
    comprehensive source of death data—to Treasury’s Do Not Pay,
    allowing all agencies to easily check against it. However, Do Not
    Pay’s access to this data expires in 2026. This legislation will
    permanently extend Treasury’s access to this information, ensuring
    that deceased individuals are not paid government benefits.

**Makes Critical Investments in Identity Theft Safeguards and Assistance
for Victims of Identity Theft**:  
  

-   **<u>Provides $275 million to prevent identity theft in public
    benefits,</u>** enabling agencies to upgrade and modernize their
    identity verification and fraud prevention systems to protect
    against systemic identity theft and stop organized criminal
    syndicates from exploiting government benefits programs. Agencies
    will use these funds to implement critical lessons learned from the
    pandemic in fraud prevention and ensure that government systems are
    prepared to securely serve constituents in an increasingly digital
    world.
-   **<u>Provides $25 million to pilot an identity theft early warning
    system</u>** that will notify individuals when their identity
    information is verified to access a federally- or state-administered
    public benefits program and give them the option to stop potentially
    fraudulent transactions before they occur and report such
    transactions to law enforcement entities.
-   **<u>Provides $200 million to enhance IdentityTheft.gov and create a
    one-stop remediation experience for victims.</u>** These funds will
    support FTC’s enhancement of IdentityTheft.gov, which will provide
    individuals a one-stop-shop experience to both report identity
    crimes and receive personalized identity theft recovery assistance,
    coordinating, as appropriate, with state and local non-profit legal
    services and community-based organizations.
-   **<u>Provides $175 million in grants for additional services for
    victims of identity theft.</u>** Additional funding will be made
    available to state and local non-profits and legal services
    organizations that provide direct services to victims of identity
    theft. These grants will be administered by DOJ’s Office for Victims
    of Crime and will help scale on-the-ground support for victims and
    existing partnerships.
