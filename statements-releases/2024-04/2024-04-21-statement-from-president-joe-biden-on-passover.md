Tomorrow night, Jews around the world will celebrate Passover,
recounting their miraculous Exodus story from hundreds of years of
enslavement in Egypt and their journey to freedom. This holiday reminds
us of a profound and powerful truth: that even in the face of
persecution, if we hold on to faith, we shall endure and overcome.  
   
As Jews mark Passover with storytelling, songs, and rituals, they will
also read from the Haggadah how, in every generation, they have been
targeted by those who would seek to destroy them. This year, those words
carry deeper resonance and pain in the wake of Hamas’ unspeakable evil
on October 7th – the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the
Holocaust. More than 1,200 people were brutally massacred. Women and
girls were subjected to appalling sexual violence. More than 250
innocents were taken hostage, including Americans. We can never forget
the horror of Hamas’ despicable atrocities.  
   
Jews around the world are still coping with the trauma of that day and
its aftermath. This Passover falls particularly hard on hostage families
trying to honor the spirit of the holiday – a story centered on freedom
– while their loved ones remain in captivity. Our hearts are with all
the victims, survivors, families, and friends whose loved ones have been
killed, taken hostage, wounded, displaced, or are in harm’s way.  
   
My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of
Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is
ironclad. My Administration is working around the clock to free the
hostages, and we will not rest until we bring them home. We are also
working to establish an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza as a
part of a deal that releases the hostages and delivers desperately
needed humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians. We will continue to
work toward a two-state solution that provides equal security,
prosperity, and enduring peace for Israelis and Palestinians. And we are
leading international efforts to ensure Israel can defend itself against
Iran and its proxies, including by directing the U.S. military to help
defend Israel against Iran’s unprecedented attacks last weekend.  
   
The ancient story of persecution against Jews in the Haggadah also
reminds us that we must speak out against the alarming surge of
Antisemitism – in our schools, communities, and online. Silence is
complicity. Even in recent days, we’ve seen harassment and calls for
violence against Jews. This blatant Antisemitism is reprehensible and
dangerous – and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or
anywhere in our country. My Administration will continue to speak out
and aggressively implement the first-ever National Strategy to Counter
Antisemitism, putting the full force of the federal government behind
protecting the Jewish community.  
   
This year, let us remember the central Passover theme that even in the
darkest of times, the promise of God’s protection will give us strength
to find hope, resilience, and redemption. To all those celebrating this
Festival of Freedom: Jill and I wish you a Happy Passover, Chag Sameach.
