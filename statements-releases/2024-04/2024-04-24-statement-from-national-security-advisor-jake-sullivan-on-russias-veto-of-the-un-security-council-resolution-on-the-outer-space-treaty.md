title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Russia\u2019s Veto\
  \ of the UN Security Council Resolution on the Outer Space\_Treaty"
---
 
Today, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution, proposed jointly
by the United States and Japan, that would have reaffirmed the
fundamental obligation of States Parties to the Outer Space Treaty not
to place nuclear weapons in orbit around the Earth. The resolution also
would have called on all Member States not to develop nuclear weapons
specifically designed to be placed in orbit. Placement by a State Party
of a nuclear weapon in orbit would not only violate the Outer Space
Treaty, but would threaten the vital communications, scientific,
meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services
that any and all satellites provide to societies around the globe. As we
have noted previously, the United States assesses that Russia is
developing a new satellite carrying a nuclear device. We have heard
President Putin say publicly that Russia has no intention of deploying
nuclear weapons in space. If that were the case, Russia would not have
vetoed this resolution.
