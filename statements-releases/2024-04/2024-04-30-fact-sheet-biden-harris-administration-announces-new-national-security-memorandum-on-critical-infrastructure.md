title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New National Security\
  \ Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure"

*President Biden takes new actions to protect U.S. critical
infrastructure*

  
Today, President Biden signed a National Security Memorandum (NSM) to
secure and enhance the resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure. The
NSM will replace a decade-old [presidential policy
document](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/presidential-policy-directive-critical-infrastructure-security-and-resil)
on critical infrastructure protection and launch a comprehensive effort
to protect U.S. infrastructure against all threats and hazards, current
and future.  
   
Thanks to the President’s Investing in America Agenda, as well as the
emergence of new technologies like artificial intelligence, America has
a historic opportunity to build for the future. Good investments require
taking steps to manage risk, and for our infrastructure, that means
building in resilience to all hazards upfront and by design. Through the
President’s Investing in America Agenda, the Biden-Harris Administration
has announced $448 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding –
including over 51,000 infrastructure projects – and spurred $825 billion
in private sector investment in industries including clean power,
biomanufacturing, and clean energy manufacturing. Under the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law alone, the President has delivered $50 billion for
infrastructure resilience specifically, including $8.7 billion from the
PROTECT program to improve the resilience of transportation
infrastructure and $4.5 billion through FEMA to fortify a range of
infrastructure against hazards. Through this $50 billion in resilience
funding, the Administration has launched over 4,000 infrastructure
resilience projects nationwide.  
   
The NSM will help ensure U.S. critical infrastructure can provide the
Nation a strong and innovative economy, protect American families, and
enhance our collective resilience to disasters before they happen –
strengthening the nation for generations to come. This NSM
specifically:  

-   Empowers the **Department of Homeland Security** to lead the
    whole-of-government effort to secure U.S. critical infrastructure,
    with the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency acting as
    the National Coordinator for Security and Resilience. The Secretary
    of Homeland Security will be required to submit to the President a
    biennial National Risk Management Plan that summarizes U.S.
    government efforts to manage risk to the Nation’s critical
    infrastructure.

<!-- -->

-   Directs the **U.S. Intelligence Community**, consistent with the
    goals outlined in the 2023 National Intelligence Strategy, to
    collect, produce and share intelligence and information with Federal
    departments and agencies, State and local partners, and the owners
    and operators of critical infrastructure. The NSM recognizes private
    sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure are often our
    first line of defense against adversaries who target the Nation’s
    most critical assets and systems.

<!-- -->

-   Reaffirms the designation of 16 critical infrastructure sectors and
    a federal department or agency as the **Sector Risk Management
    Agency (SRMA)** for each **sector.** SRMAs have the day-to-day
    relationships and sector specific expertise to lead risk management
    and coordination within the designated sectors. The named SRMAs for
    each sector can be found below.

<!-- -->

-   Elevates the importance of **minimum security and resilience
    requirements** within and across critical infrastructure sectors,
    consistent with the [National Cyber
    Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf),
    which recognizes the limits of a voluntary approach to risk
    management in the current threat environment.

   
The Nation faces an era of strategic competition in which nation-state
actors will continue to target American critical infrastructure – and
tolerate or enable malicious activity conducted by non-state actors. In
the event of crisis or conflict, America’s adversaries may attempt to
compromise our critical infrastructure to undermine the will of the
American public and impede the functioning of the economy and projection
of U.S. military power abroad. Resilience, particularly for our most
sensitive assets and systems, is the cornerstone of homeland defense and
security.  
   
Further, the growing impact of climate change, including changes to the
frequency and intensity of natural hazards, as well as supply chain
shocks and the potential for instability, conflict, or mass
displacement, places a strain on the infrastructure that Americans
depend upon for their lives and livelihoods. This NSM seeks to fulfill
the U.S. government’s sacred obligation to the American people to
protect our infrastructure and the prosperity and security of the
Nation.
