  Supplemental"

I strongly support this package to get critical support to Israel and
Ukraine, provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Palestinians in
Gaza, and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Israel is
facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine is facing continued
bombardment from Russia that has intensified dramatically in the last
month.

The House must pass the package this week and the Senate should quickly
follow. I will sign this into law immediately to send a message to the
world: We stand with our friends, and we wonâ€™t let Iran or Russia
succeed.
