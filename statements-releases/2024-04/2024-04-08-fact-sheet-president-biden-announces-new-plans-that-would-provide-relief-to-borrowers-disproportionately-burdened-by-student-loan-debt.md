title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces New Plans that would Provide Relief\
  \ to Borrowers Disproportionately Burdened by Student Loan\_Debt"
---
 
From Day One President Biden vowed to fix the Federal student loan
program and make sure higher education is a ticket to the middle class –
not a barrier to opportunity. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration
has taken historic action to approve debt cancellation for 4 million
borrowers, helping these borrowers get more breathing room in their
daily lives, access economic mobility, buy homes, start businesses, and
pursue their dreams. **Today, President Biden is announcing his
Administration’s new plans that, if finalized as proposed, would provide
debt relief to over 30 million borrowers when combined with actions the
Administration has taken over the last four years.** These plans would
not only help create more financial stability for millions of working
and middle-class families, they would also help address the
disproportionate debt burden on communities of color and advance racial
equity.

These actions are expected to provide significant relief to Black and
Latino borrowers, borrowers who attended community college, and
borrowers who are financially vulnerable because they took out debt but
never had the chance to complete their degree. Not only are Black
students more likely to take on student loans than their white peers,
but they also end up holding nearly twice as much debt as their white
peers four years after graduation.  And Latino borrowers are also more
likely to default on their student loans compared to white borrowers.

The plans President Biden is announcing today, if finalized as proposed,
would deliver some amount of relief to:

-   **Borrowers who owe more than they did at the start of repayment.**
    Millions of borrowers across the country owe more than they did when
    they started repaying because of accrued and capitalized interest.
    [Black](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-white-disparity-in-student-loan-debt-more-than-triples-after-graduation/#:~:text=And%20nearly%20half%20of%20black,situation%20known%20as%20negative%20amortization).)
    and Latino borrowers are likelier to experience growth in their
    student loan balances due to excessive interest accumulation. Four
    years after graduation, Black bachelor’s degree borrowers [on
    average](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=900) owe more
    than they borrowed.
-   **Borrowers who are otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness, but
    have not yet applied.** Borrowers face administrative burdens with
    completing loan forgiveness applications. Many borrowers would
    receive automatic debt relief for loan forgiveness programs that
    they are eligible for but have not successfully applied for, such as
    the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan, Public Service Loan
    Forgiveness, or other forgiveness programs.
-   **Borrowers who first entered repayment many years ago.** Many
    borrowers are repaying their loans decades after leaving school. The
    Administration’s new plan would cancel debt for all borrowers with
    only undergraduate student debt who entered repayment 20 or more
    years ago and cancel loans for borrowers with any graduate student
    debt that first entered repayment 25 or more years ago.  
-   **Borrowers who enrolled in low-financial-value programs.** Thosewho
    attended institutions or programs that failed accountability
    measures or failed to provide students with sufficient financial
    value would be eligible for relief, including those whose
    institutions closed prior to the finalization of such
    determinations.  Black and Latino borrowers make up a
    disproportionately larger share of students enrolled in these
    programs.
-   **Borrowers experiencing hardship paying back their loans.**
    Millions of borrowers could be eligible for relief if they are
    experiencing hardship in their daily lives that prevent them from
    fully paying back their loans now or in the future. Black and Latino
    borrowers have [higher default
    rates](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2023/eb_23-12#:~:text=Despite%20the%20financial%20benefits%20that,10%20percent%20of%20White%20graduates.)
    than white borrowers, undermining their ability to build
    generational wealth, start businesses, buy homes, and more.

**The plans announced today would address the disproportionate debt
burden on borrowers of color and other vulnerable borrowers.**

***Black borrowers***

-   In order to afford a college education, Black families—already
    disadvantaged by generational wealth disparities—rely more heavily
    on student debt than white families do.
-   Twenty years after first enrolling in school, the typical Black
    borrower who started college in the 1995-96 school year still
    owed [95%](https://heller.brandeis.edu/iere/pdfs/racial-wealth-equity/racial-wealth-gap/stallingdreams-how-student-debt-is-disrupting-lifechances.pdf) of
    their original student debt.
-   After 20 years of starting school, just
    [26%](https://heller.brandeis.edu/iere/pdfs/racial-wealth-equity/racial-wealth-gap/stallingdreams-how-student-debt-is-disrupting-lifechances.pdf)
    of Black borrowers were able to pay off all of their loans.
-   A disproportionate number of students at for-profit colleges are
    [Black](https://heller.brandeis.edu/iere/pdfs/racial-wealth-equity/racial-wealth-gap/stallingdreams-how-student-debt-is-disrupting-lifechances.pdf),
    and many of these students have attended low-quality programs,
    leaving them with unaffordable debts and low prospects.

***Latino Borrowers***

-   Latino borrowers have lower household incomes and significantly less
    wealth than their white counterparts, causing them greater
    difficulty in paying off loans.
-   Latino students are also more likely not to complete college, making
    them more likely to have debt with no degree.
-   Latino borrowers are also more likely to default on their student
    loans compared to white borrowers, with 15% of those in repayment in
    default and 29% in serious delinquency.
-   Latino students are also a
    [disproportionate](https://heller.brandeis.edu/iere/pdfs/racial-wealth-equity/racial-wealth-gap/stallingdreams-how-student-debt-is-disrupting-lifechances.pdf)
    number of students enrolled in for-profit programs.

***Community college borrowers***

-   Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s SAVE Plan, 85% of community
    college borrowers are projected to be debt-free within 10 years.
-   Latino students make up a disproportionately
    [larger](https://nscresearchcenter.org/current-term-enrollment-estimates/)
    share of community college students, making up 23% of community
    college enrollees but only 18% of the overall undergraduate
    population.
-   The share of community college students who are Latino and Black
    students is also increasing, with 2023 community college
    [enrollment](https://nscresearchcenter.org/current-term-enrollment-estimates/)
    increasing by 2.1% for Black students, 5.5% for Hispanic students,
    and decreasing by 2.0% for white students.

The plans announced today, together with the Administration’s past
actions, will provide relief to more than 30 million borrowers.  These
plans would fully eliminate accrued interest for 23 million borrowers,
cancel the full amount of student debt for over 4 million borrowers, and
provide more than 10 million borrowers with at least $5,000 in debt
relief or more.  With disproportionately high debt burdens, Black and
Latino borrowers will get substantial benefits from this relief.
