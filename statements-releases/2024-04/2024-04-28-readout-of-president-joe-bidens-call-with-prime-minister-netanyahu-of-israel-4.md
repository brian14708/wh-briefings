President Biden spoke earlier today with Prime Minister Netanyahu. The
President reaffirmed his ironclad commitment to Israel’s security
following the successful defense against Iran’s unprecedented missile
and drone attack earlier this month. They also reviewed ongoing talks to
secure the release of hostages together with an immediate ceasefire in
Gaza. The President referred to his statement with 17 other world
leaders demanding that Hamas release their citizens without delay to
secure a ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza. The President and
the Prime Minister also discussed increases in the delivery of
humanitarian assistance into Gaza including through preparations to open
new northern crossings starting this week. The President stressed the
need for this progress to be sustained and enhanced in full coordination
with humanitarian organizations. The leaders discussed Rafah and the
President reiterated his clear position.
