title: "Readout of White\_House State Legislative Convening on Paid Family and Medical\_\
  Leave"
---
 
Last week, Tom Perez, Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President and
Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and
Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender
Policy Council, convened state leaders to discuss legislative efforts to
pass paid family and medical leave for workers as well as to learn from
states that have implemented successful programs.  

During the convening, leaders from states with paid family and medical
leave programs and states with proposed paid leave legislation spoke
with White House officials about their advocacy and work implementing
these programs. White House officials thanked the legislators for their
leadership in paving the way on this important issue and highlighted the
Administration’s continued commitment to this work.

This convening comes as the Administration marks “Month of Action on
Care” in April, which the President designated [Care Workers Recognition
Month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/31/a-proclamation-on-care-workers-recognition-month/#:~:text=BIDEN%20JR.%2C%20President%20of%20the,as%20Care%20Workers%20Recognition%20Month) last
year when he signed the historic [Executive Order on Increasing Access
to High-Quality Care and Supporting
Caregivers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/). 
It also follows the release of President Biden’s FY 2025 Budget, which
proposes a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program
to ensure that all workers can take the time they need to bond with a
new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own
serious illness; address circumstances arising from a loved one’s
military deployment; find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault,
or stalking; or grieve the death of a loved one.  The Administration
applauds the thirteen states and the District of Columbia that have
passed paid leave laws, and continues to call for a national paid family
and medical leave program.

Participating state leaders included:

-   New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development Director of
    Strategic Outreach and Partnerships Holly Low
-   Hawaii Senate President Ronald Kouchi
-   Hawaii State Representative Scot Matayoshi
-   Maine State Senator Mattie Daughtry
-   Maine State Representative Kristen Cloutier
-   Michigan State Representative Jasper Martus
-   Minnesota State Senator Erin Maye Quade
-   New Mexico State Representative Linda Serrato
-   New Mexico State Representative Patricia Roybal Caballero
