title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Hosts First-Ever White\_House\
  \ Summit for Sustainable and Healthy\_Schools"
---
 
President Biden’s [Investing in America Agenda](/www.invest.gov%3c) is
providing unprecedented resources for K-12 schools to invest in
healthier, more sustainable buildings and infrastructure—from removing
lead pipes, to installing clean, reliable solar energy, to purchasing
electric school buses. Schools across the country are putting these
funds to use to cut harmful air pollution, including climate pollution,
and invest in equitable, healthy, resilient, and sustainable schools. To
ensure that schools have access to the many resources and technical
assistance available to them through the President’s Investing in
America agenda, the Administration is today **hosting the first-ever
White House Summit for Sustainable and Healthy K-12 School Buildings and
Grounds**.  
   
Over 90 students, teachers, advocates, school administrators, facilities
and grounds experts, and labor leaders will come together at the White
House alongside the U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Department of
Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss deployment of
the unprecedented levels of federal funding available for school
infrastructure, clean energy, and healthy schools. The White House
Summit will highlight stories from schools across America where
communities are taking action to create more sustainable buildings and
grounds that tackle the climate crisis, improve learning, and protect
children’s health. The Summit will also underscore the opportunities for
good-paying, union jobs—including jobs that don’t require a college
degree—made available by the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic
clean energy agenda. Participants will also have the opportunity to join
an in-person workshop on the new “direct pay” provisions in the
Inflation Reduction Act, which are helping schools to directly access
the benefits of clean energy tax credits for the first time ever.  
   
**<u>Promoting Efficient and Healthy Schools</u>**  
Alongside the Summit, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing the
[**2024 White House Toolkit for Sustainable and Healthy K-12
Schools**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-24-Toolkit-for-Sustainable-and-Healthy-Schools.pdf).
Designed for use by schools, the toolkit provides an overview of school
infrastructure funding, programs, and technical assistance made
available by the Biden-Harris Administration to support schools,
teachers, and students in achieving energy efficiency, resilience to
extreme weather, and cleaner air, water, and transportation. These
include programs like the Department of Energy’s **Renew America’s
Schools** **Prize**, which is providing $500 million to make energy
efficiency, clean energy, and clean vehicles accessible for schools
across the country—and is [open for applications
now](https://www.energy.gov/scep/renew-americas-schools). It also
includes EPA’s **Clean School Bus Program**, which is providing [$5
billion through](https://www.epa.gov/cleanschoolbus) the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to replace polluting diesel school buses with zero-
and low-emissions models. The program has already funded over 5,000
clean school buses, providing cleaner air for communities and protecting
children from asthma.  
   
These programs also advance President Biden’s [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
which set a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain
federal climate, clean energy, clean transit, and other investments flow
to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment
and overburdened by pollution.  
   
**<u>Recognizing Climate Leaders in Schools Across America</u>**  
Today the U.S. Department of Energy is also announcing honorees for its
Efficient and Healthy Schools Program. This program recognizes and
assists school districts seeking to implement high-impact indoor air
quality and efficiency improvements—like **Livonia Public Schools** in
Michigan, which was honored for optimizing their operations to improve
building performance. Others, like **Broward County Public Schools** in
Florida, received recognition for implementing efficient and effective
HVAC retrofits and other energy-saving measures, while **Canajoharie
Central School District** in New York was honored for developing a
comprehensive energy plan. These improvements will reduce energy bills
and improve student and teacher health in schools across the country.  
   
To date, 202 school districts in 45 states have joined the program,
representing over 5 million students in over 8,400 individual
schools—70% of which qualify for Title 1 federal funding on the basis of
serving a high percentage of low-income students. The full list of 2024
U.S. Department of Energy Efficient and Healthy Schools Honorees can be
found
[here](https://efficienthealthyschools.lbl.gov/20232024-recognition)**. **Additionally,
earlier today U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona
[announced](https://youtu.be/bSdk1mUHz0s) the 2024 [U.S. Department of
Education Green Ribbon
Schools](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/green-ribbon-schools/index.html),
District Sustainability Awardees, and Postsecondary Sustainability
Awardees. 41 schools, 10 districts, three postsecondary institutions,
and one early learning center from 24 states are being
[honored](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/green-ribbon-schools/performance.html)
for their innovative efforts to reduce environmental impact and utility
costs, improve health and wellness, and offer effective sustainability
education. Over the past decade, the award has recognized the work of
over 750 schools, districts, and postsecondary institutions across 47
states. Learn more about the 2024 U.S. Department of Education Green
Ribbon Schools Honorees

**Today’s Summit and announcements build on the Biden-Harris
Administration’s actions to build healthier, more sustainable schools:**

-   **Direct Pay for Clean Energy. ** In March, the Treasury
    Department [finalized
    rules](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2157) for direct
    pay (officially known as “elective pay”) of certain tax credits. By
    authorizing direct pay, the Inflation Reduction Act for the first
    time makes tax-exempt entities, including schools, eligible to
    access clean energy tax credits and to fully participate in building
    and owning new clean energy projects. Schools can leverage these tax
    credits for clean energy investments such as solar, wind,
    geothermal, and storage, as well as for purchasing clean school
    buses and other clean vehicles. For example:
    -   **Manchester Public Schools (CT)** anticipates receiving $2.5
        million in tax credits from the IRS for installing ground source
        heat pumps and solar panels at Bowers Elementary School in 2023.
    -   **Seattle Public Schools (WA)** anticipates receiving $7.5
        million in tax credits from the IRS for installing ground source
        heat pumps and solar panels at 3 elementary schools in 2023.
    -   **Williamsfield Schools (IL)** anticipates receiving $100,000 in
        tax credits from the IRS for 7 Electric School Buses funded
        through the EPA Clean School Bus rebates and 11 Electric Vehicle
        charging stations that were put into service in 2023.  
         
-   **Clean School Buses.** In January, EPA preliminarily selected 67
    applicants to receive nearly $1 billion in funding under the 2023
    [Clean School Bus Program](https://www.epa.gov/cleanschoolbus)
    Grants Competition. Selected applicants will purchase over 2,700
    clean school buses in 280 school districts, serving over 7 million
    students across 37 states. To date, the EPA Clean School Bus Program
    has awarded nearly $2 billion and funded approximately 5,000
    electric and low-emission school buses nationwide. EPA anticipates
    announcing the awards for the 2023 Clean School Bus Program Rebates
    Competition in May 2024.  
     
-   **Replacing Lead Pipes for Clean Drinking Water.** The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law invests $15 billion toward President Biden’s
    commitment to replace every toxic lead pipe in the country within a
    decade, protecting children and schools from lead exposure that can
    cause irreversible harm to cognitive development and hamper
    children’s learning. In February, Vice President Harris traveled to
    Pittsburgh to [announce $5.8 billion for clean water
    projects](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-6-billion-for-clean-drinking-water-and-wastewater-infrastructure-as-part-of-investing-in-america-tour/)
    nationwide, including lead pipe replacement. Earlier this year, EPA
    announced $58 million in 2024 grant funding to protect children from
    lead in drinking water at schools and childcare facilities.  
     
-   **Investing in Disadvantaged Communities and Environmental
    Justice.** EPA is currently [accepting
    applications](https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/inflation-reduction-act-community-change-grants-program)
    for $2 billion in [Community Change
    Grants](https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/inflation-reduction-act-community-change-grants-program)
    that can be used by schools to reduce pollution, increase community
    climate resilience, and other environmental and climate justice
    activities that benefit disadvantaged communities, such as facility
    improvements that improve air quality. Dedicated technical
    assistance is available to eligible applicants for application
    support, project planning, and more.  
     
-   **Improving Indoor Air Quality. ** Later this year, EPA will also
    award [$32 million in grant
    funding](https://www.epa.gov/iaq-schools/grant-funding-address-indoor-air-pollution-schools)
    to up to 6 organizations that will help K-12 schools in low-income,
    disadvantaged, and Tribal communities across the country develop and
    implement comprehensive indoor air quality (IAQ) management plans
    that address air pollution and improve energy efficiency of school
    facilities.  
     
-   **Launching the 2024 Renew America’s School Prize.** In March, DOE’s
    Office of State and Community Energy Programs launched its second
    round of funding under the [2024 Renew America’s Schools
    Prize](https://www.energy.gov/scep/renew-americas-schools), a $180
    million investment to support improvements like HVAC upgrades,
    renewable energy installations, lighting, alternative-fuel vehicle
    infrastructure, and more in K-12 public schools. In particular, the
    prize focuses on schools that serve disadvantaged communities.
    Submissions for the 2024 Renew America’s Schools Prize are [due by
    June 13](https://www.energy.gov/scep/renew-americas-schools). This
    prize builds on the first round of funding, which awarded $178
    million in 2023 to over 90 school facilities across the country,
    impacting approximately 74,000 students and 5,000 teachers.  
     
-   **Supporting America’s School Infrastructure.** In November, the
    Department of Education
    [awarded](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-47-million-new-funding-support-school-infrastructure-investments)
    over $40 million in funding to eight [Supporting America’s School
    Infrastructure](https://oese.ed.gov/offices/school-infrastructure-programs-sip/supporting-americas-school-infrastructure-grant-program-sasi/)
    (SASI) state grantees to conduct school facility needs assessments
    in high-need school districts, hire new staff, and develop or
    improve public school infrastructure data systems, among other
    actions.
