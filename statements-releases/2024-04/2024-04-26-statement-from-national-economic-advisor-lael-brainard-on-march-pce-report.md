title: "Statement from National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard on March PCE\_Report"
---
 
While inflation has fallen more than 60% from its peak, today’s report
reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down.
President Biden is fighting to lower the biggest bills families face.
The President has secured legislation to lower costs for health care,
prescription drugs, and insulin. He has called on Congress to pass his
plan to lower housing costs by building one million new homes. And he is
banning hidden junk fees and calling on corporations with record profits
to pass their savings on to consumers. That’s a sharp contrast with
Congressional Republicans, who are fighting for measures that raise
costs for health care, housing, and utility bills while cutting taxes
for the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.
