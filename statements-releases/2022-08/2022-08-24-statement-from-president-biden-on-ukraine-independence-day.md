title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Ukraine Independence\_Day"
---
 
On behalf of all Americans, I congratulate the people of Ukraine on
their Independence Day. Over the past six months, Ukrainians have
inspired the world with their extraordinary courage and dedication to
freedom.  They have stood resolute and strong in the face of Russia’s
full scale invasion of Ukraine. And today is not only a celebration of
the past, but a resounding affirmation that Ukraine proudly remains –
and will remain – a sovereign and independent nation.

The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of
Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty. As part
of that commitment, I am proud to announce our biggest tranche of
security assistance to date: approximately $2.98 billion of weapons and
equipment to be provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative.  This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems,
artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and
radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.

I know this independence day is bittersweet for many Ukrainians as
thousands have been killed or wounded, millions have been displaced from
their homes, and so many others have fallen victim to Russian atrocities
and attacks. But six months of relentless attacks have only strengthened
Ukrainians’ pride in themselves, in their country, and in their
thirty-one years of independence. Today and every day, we stand with the
Ukrainian people to proclaim that the darkness that drives autocracy is
no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people
everywhere. The United States, including proud Ukrainian-Americans,
looks forward to continuing to celebrate Ukraine as a democratic,
independent, sovereign and prosperous state for decades to come.
