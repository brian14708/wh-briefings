title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the U.S. District Court\
  \ for the Northern District of Texas Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act\_\
  Decision"
---
 
Today’s decision is a blow to Texans. Texas filed this suit to ensure
that it can block medical providers from providing life-saving and
health-preserving care. Because of this decision, women in Texas may now
be denied this vital care—even for conditions like severe hemorrhaging
or life-threatening hypertension. It’s wrong, it’s backwards, and women
may die as a result. The fight is not over. The President will continue
to push to require hospitals to provide life-saving and
health-preserving reproductive care.   
   
Congress must listen to the will of the American people and pass a law
restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade. That is ultimately the only
way right now to secure a woman’s right to choose, but the President
will continue to take meaningful action now to protect women’s access to
reproductive health care. What’s at stake is a choice between a national
abortion ban – as Republicans in Congress have already called for – and
even more radical attacks on fundamental rights, versus standing up for
the rights to which Americans have been entitled for almost fifty years.
The President will continue to defend the rights of women who need
access to emergency reproductive care but the challenge for Americans
across the country is to go out and use their voices to restore the
rights that were protected by *Roe*.
