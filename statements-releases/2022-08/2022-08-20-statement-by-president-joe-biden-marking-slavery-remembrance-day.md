title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden\_Marking Slavery Remembrance\_Day"
---
 
More than 400 years ago, twenty enslaved Africans were forcibly brought
to the shores of what would become the United States. Millions more were
stolen and sold in the centuries that followed, part of a system of
slavery that is America’s original sin.

Great nations don’t hide from their history. They acknowledge their
past, both the triumphs and the tragedies. Today is a day to reflect on
the terrible toll of slavery, and on our nation’s profound ability to
heal and emerge stronger. Despite the horrors they faced, these men and
women and their descendants have made countless contributions to the
building of this nation and the continuous effort to realize the
American ideal.  I was honored last year to declare Juneteenth a
national holiday, another moment to reflect and rededicate ourselves to
becoming a more perfect union. And it’s why my Administration will
continue the hard, ongoing work to bring true equity and racial justice
to our country.

I’m grateful for the efforts of Congress—in particular, Representative
Al Green and Senator Elizabeth Warren—to recognize the significance of
this day.
