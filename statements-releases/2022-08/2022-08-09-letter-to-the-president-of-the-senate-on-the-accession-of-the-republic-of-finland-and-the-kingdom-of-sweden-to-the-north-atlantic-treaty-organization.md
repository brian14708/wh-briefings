Dear Madam President:

Consistent with the conditions set forth in the Senate resolution of
advice and consent to ratification of the Protocols to the North
Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of Finland and
the Kingdom of Sweden of August 3, 2022, and based on the recommendation
of the Department of State, I hereby certify to the Senate that:

\(i\)   the inclusion of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of
Sweden in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will not have
the effect of increasing the overall percentage share of the
United States in the common budgets of NATO; and

\(ii\)  the inclusion of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of
Sweden in NATO does not detract from the ability of the United States to
meet or to fund its military requirements outside the North Atlantic
area.

                               Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
