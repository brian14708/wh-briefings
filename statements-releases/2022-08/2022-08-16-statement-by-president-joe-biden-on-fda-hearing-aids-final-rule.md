title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on FDA Hearing Aids Final\_Rule"
---
 
For millions of Americans, hearing aids and the doctor’s visit to get
them prescribed are too expensive. In the executive order I issued last
year to increase competition in key industries and lower costs, I called
on the FDA to finally make hearing aids available over the counter.

Today, the FDA is doing just that. As early as mid-October, Americans
will be able to purchase more affordable hearing aids over the counter
at pharmacies and stores across the country. This action makes good on
my commitment to lower costs for American families, delivering nearly
$3,000 in savings to American families for a pair of hearing aids and
giving people more choices to improve their health and wellbeing. And,
it’s the latest action we are taking to make our economy more
competitive and less concentrated. When too few companies dominate,
American consumers pay higher costs. We’re finally building an economy
that works for working families.
