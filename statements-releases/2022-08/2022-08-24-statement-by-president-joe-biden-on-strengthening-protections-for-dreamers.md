title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Strengthening Protections for\_Dreamers"
---
 
Dreamers are part of the fabric of this nation. They serve on the
frontlines of the pandemic response. They are students, entrepreneurs,
and small business owners. Many serve bravely in our military. They’ve
only ever known America as their home.

Ten years ago, I stood by President Obama as he announced one of our
proudest accomplishments — creating the Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program has transformed the lives
of hundreds of thousands of young Dreamers by allowing them to live here
and contribute their talents to this great country without fear of
removal. Today, we are fulfilling our commitment to preserve and
strengthen DACA by finalizing a rule that will reinforce protections,
like work authorization, that allow Dreamers to live more freely and to
invest in their communities more fully.

I will do everything within my power to protect Dreamers, but
Congressional Republicans should stop blocking a bill that provides a
pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. It is not only the right thing to
do, it is also the smart thing to do for our economy and our
communities.
