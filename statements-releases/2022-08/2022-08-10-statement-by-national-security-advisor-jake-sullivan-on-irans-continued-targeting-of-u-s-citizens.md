title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Iran\u2019s Continued\
  \ Targeting of U.S.\_Citizens"
---
 
Today the Department of Justice unsealed charges against an individual
affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  The charging
document outlines allegations regarding Iran’s continued attempts to
carry out an assassination against former National Security Advisor John
Bolton on American soil.

We have said this before and we will say it again:  the Biden
Administration will not waiver in protecting and defending all Americans
against threats of violence and terrorism.  Should Iran attack any of
our citizens, to include those who continue to serve the United States
or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences.  We
will continue to bring to bear the full resources of the U.S. Government
to protect Americans.

We commend the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for their diligence and professionalism in this matter.
