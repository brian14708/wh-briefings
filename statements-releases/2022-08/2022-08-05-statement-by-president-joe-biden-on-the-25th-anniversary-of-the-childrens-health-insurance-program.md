Parents should never have to worry about what happens when their kid
gets sick or if they can afford a prescription or doctor’s visit.
Twenty-five years ago, President Clinton signed the Children’s Health
Insurance Program into law to make that a reality. I was proud to vote
for this landmark legislation in the Senate, where Senators Ted Kennedy
and Orrin Hatch worked across the aisle to achieve a significant
expansion of health care for children.  
   
In 1997, before CHIP was created, 15 percent of our nation’s children
lacked health insurance. Thanks to CHIP, Medicaid, and the Affordable
Care Act (ACA), today only 4 percent are uninsured. My Administration is
building on that progress. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and our
efforts to expand access to affordable, quality health care through the
ACA, one million children have gained health care coverage since I
became president, helping to reverse the coverage losses during the
previous Administration. Seven million children and pregnant women
enrolled in CHIP now have the peace of mind that health insurance
brings, and their families no longer have to lay awake at night
wondering how they’ll cover their child’s procedure or pay for a
hospital bill.  
   
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will build on our efforts to make
quality, affordable health care accessible. This legislation will extend
the ACA improvements we started with the American Rescue Plan, locking
in an average $800 a year savings in health insurance premiums for 13
million Americans and preventing 3 million Americans from becoming
uninsured. Congress should pass this legislation quickly to lower health
care costs and make health insurance more accessible for families and
children across America.
