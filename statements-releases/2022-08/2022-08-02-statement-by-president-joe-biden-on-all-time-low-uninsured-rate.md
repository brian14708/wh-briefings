title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on All-Time Low Uninsured\_Rate"
---
 
Every American has the right to the peace of mind that comes with access
to affordable, quality health care.  No one should worry about whether
they can pay for their doctor or choose between paying rent and filing a
prescription. Today, we are closer than ever to making that principle a
reality. The lowest percentage of Americans are uninsured today – eight
percent – in history.

This progress did not happen by accident. More than 35 million Americans
are enrolled in Affordable Care Act related coverage – the highest total
on record.  This includes over 21 million people who are enrolled in the
ACA’s expansion of Medicaid, coverage that is denied to nearly four
million Americans who live in states that have refused to expand
Medicaid. And, since the beginning of my Administration, 5 million more
people have gained health insurance coverage – in significant part
because of the improvements to the ACA in the American Rescue Plan.

When I ran for office, I said we needed to protect and build on the
Affordable Care Act. The Inflation Reduction Act will do just that – it
will lock in an average $800 a year savings in health insurance premiums
for 13 million Americans and prevent 3 million Americans from becoming
uninsured. I urge Congress to pass this legislation swiftly to lower
health care costs and make health insurance coverage more accessible for
families across the country.
