title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Third Anniversary of the El Paso\_\
  Shooting"
---
 
Three years ago, on a tragic, painful day in our nation’s history, we
lost 23 souls and 22 others were injured when a gunman full of rage and
hate targeted the people of El Paso and the rich Hispanic heritage of
the people within it. We will never forget the lives lost, or the
courage and resilience of those injured and the loved ones they left
behind.

Together with partners in Congress and countless advocates across this
country, we have made progress to confront both hate and gun violence.
We’ve acted to reduce gun violence – taking more executive action to
reduce gun violence than any other Administration at this point, and
bringing together Republicans and Democrats to enact the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction
legislation in 30 years. I signed bipartisan legislation to improve hate
crimes reporting and enhance training for law enforcement to identify
and respond to hate crimes. And last year, my Administration laid out
our country’s first-ever comprehensive effort to counter the threat
posed by domestic terrorism.

We know there’s more work to do. The House recently passed a bill that
would ban the weapons of war like the one the El Paso gunman and so many
others have used to take and injure so many innocent lives in a matter
of minutes. The Senate needs to act on that critical piece of
legislation.  
  
I’m not going to stop fighting to make communities across the country
safer. We owe it to the families and community in El Paso, and to so
many communities like El Paso.
