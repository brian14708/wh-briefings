title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on World Humanitarian\_Day"
---
 
Today, on World Humanitarian Day, we honor the humanitarian workers
around the world who need our protection and support more than ever as
they carry out their life-saving work. Nineteen years ago, a terrorist
bombing claimed the lives of humanitarian aid workers in Baghdad. On
this day, we remember them as well as the sacrifice made by the
thousands of aid workers who have been killed, injured, or kidnapped
since then.    

This year, the world faces unprecedented humanitarian need. More than
300 million people need assistance accessing clean water, emergency
medicine, shelter, food and nutrition, protection and other services;
more than 100 million are forcibly displaced; and hundreds of millions
are experiencing hunger. Humanitarian workers are rising to this
challenge, undertaking everyday acts of heroism around the globe.

In nearly every circumstance, the first responders to international
disasters – both natural and manmade – are also those directly affected.
Local humanitarian aid workers perform the bulk of the response and bear
the highest risks to selflessly answer the call to help their neighbors.
That’s why my Administration committed nearly $13 billion in
humanitarian funding last year, to support the efforts of global,
national, and local humanitarians, including those delivering food and
relief items to Ukrainians under attack, supporting basic needs of the
Afghan people, racing to combat growing child malnutrition in Somalia,
supporting traumatized survivors of gender-based violence in Tigray,
welcoming millions of refugees in Jordan, Bangladesh, and Colombia, and
offering life-saving health care in Yemen.

The United States is the world’s largest humanitarian donor, but we know
that funding is not enough. It is unacceptable that each year hundreds
of aid workers – the majority local responders – are killed, kidnapped,
or injured and their work obstructed. It is unconscionable that many of
the worst drivers of displacement and humanitarian need, including
conflict and climate change, continue unabated. And it is imperative
that we collectively strengthen our humanitarian response—our funding
and how we employ it. On this World Humanitarian Day, let us honor
humanitarians with a renewed commitment to ensure their protection,
redouble our efforts for a more equitable, peaceful and stable world,
and strengthen the ability of the global humanitarian community to
address suffering around the world.
