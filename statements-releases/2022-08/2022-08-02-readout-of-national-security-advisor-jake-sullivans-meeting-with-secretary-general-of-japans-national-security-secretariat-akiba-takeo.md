National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Akiba Takeo,
Secretary General of Japan’s National Security Secretariat, to discuss
the U.S.-Japan alliance, the cornerstone of peace and security in the
Indo-Pacific. The two discussed the importance of timely investment in
our joint strategic vision of our modernized security alliance to
promote a free and open Indo-Pacific. They reiterated the importance of
maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and reinforced
their resolve to stand united against Russia’s unjust and unprovoked war
on Ukraine and united in support of the Ukrainian people. They
recognized the importance of progress in bilateral and regional
coordination to strengthen the rules-based economic order, including to
create more resilient supply chains and to enhance energy security.
