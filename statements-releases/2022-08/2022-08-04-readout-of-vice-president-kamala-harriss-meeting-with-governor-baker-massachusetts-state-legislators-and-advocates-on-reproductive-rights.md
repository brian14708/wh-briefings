title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Governor Baker,\
  \ Massachusetts State Legislators, and Advocates on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today Vice President Kamala Harris convened state legislators and
advocates in Boston, Massachusetts to discuss the fight to protect
reproductive rights and freedoms. She was joined by Governor Charlie
Baker (R-MA). 

The participants shared important steps that Governor Baker and
Massachusetts state legislators have taken to protect reproductive
health care, and they stressed the urgency of other states taking action
to protect abortion access following the Supreme Court overturning *Roe
v. Wade.* The Vice President applauded the leaders for their bipartisan
work defending reproductive health care, including expanding access and
protecting patients and providers. She called Massachusetts a national
model for protecting reproductive rights on the state level, and she
encouraged the leaders to support state legislators across the country
who are fighting for abortion protections.  
  

The Vice President conveyed that reproductive rights are not a partisan
issue, reiterating that a majority of Americans believe that a woman
should have the right to make decisions about her body and her life
without government interference. The state leaders thanked the Vice
President for the Administration’s leadership on the issue of
reproductive care, and they said they look forward to working in
partnership to stand up for women’s health. 

Massachusetts is the seventh state that the Vice President has traveled
to in recent weeks to convene state legislators about protecting
reproductive health care. She has visited Florida, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, and Indiana. She also convened
legislators from Montana, Indiana, Florida, South Dakota, and Nebraska
in Washington D.C. And she has convened health care providers,
constitutional law experts, faith leaders, state attorneys general,
disability rights leaders, and advocates over the last three months.
