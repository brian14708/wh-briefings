title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Attack on Salman\_Rushdie\u200B"
---
 
Jill and I were shocked and saddened to learn of the vicious attack on
Salman Rushdie yesterday in New York. We, together with all Americans
and people around the world, are praying for his health and recovery. I
am grateful to the first responders and the brave individuals who jumped
into action to render aid to Rushdie and subdue the attacker. 

Salman Rushdie—with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense
for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced—stands for
essential, universal ideals. Truth. Courage. Resilience. The
ability to share ideas without fear. These are the building blocks of
any free and open society. And today, we reaffirm our commitment to
those deeply American values in solidarity with Rushdie and all those
who stand for freedom of expression.
