title: "FACT SHEET:\_Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Brings High-Speed, Affordable\
  \ Internet to Tribal\_Communities"
---
 
*Department of Commerce announces $146 million in awards through the
Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, with another $1 billion in
funding now available*

In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, access to affordable, high-speed
internet is no longer a luxury: American families need high-quality
internet to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care,
and stay connected. But far too many Tribal communities remain
unconnected: by one definition, over 30 percent of the population on
Tribal lands do not have access to broadband infrastructure that
provides minimally adequate speeds.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has set a clear goal of bringing
affordable, reliable, high-speed internet to every American. To help
make this goal a reality, President Biden secured a historic $65 billion
investment to expand internet access through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and has mobilized additional resources from across
the federal government, including programs created by the American
Rescue Plan.  
   
These investments are already making a difference in Tribal communities,
bringing new internet service to Native American, Alaska Native, and
Native Hawaiian households and businesses. Through all of its work with
Tribal communities, including broadband infrastructure programs, the
Biden-Harris Administration is committed to honoring the
Nation-to-Nation relationship with Tribal governments, conducting robust
tribal consultation, and investing in the resilience and prosperity of
Tribal communities.  
   
**Today, the Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and
Information Administration (NTIA) announced $146 million in awards to
bring high-speed internet to Tribal communities in New Mexico through
the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program. Throughout August, NTIA will
announce additional awards, totaling more than $500 million. Funding
will serve Tribes across the country including in**
[**Alaska**](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=45decfdffd&e=0ca263633c)**,
Nebraska, South Dakota, Arizona, California, and more states, in
addition to today’s awards in New Mexico.**  
   
**NTIA has also announced that it is making an** [**additional
$1 billion in
funding**](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=a59fbb725c&e=0ca263633c)
**available to Tribal communities.** This $1 billion from President
Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will fund additional Tribal
broadband applications already submitted to NTIA, bringing the total
available under the funding opportunity announced in June 2021 to $1.98
billion. NTIA received more than 300 applications during the application
window for over $5 billion in requested funding, demonstrating the
significant infrastructure needs in Tribal communities. Making an
additional $1 billion available under the current funding opportunity
will allow the Department of Commerce to quickly allocate these funds to
communities in need, without requiring Tribes to reapply.  
   
This additional $1 billion at NTIA comes on top of other funding for
high-speed internet available to Tribal communities—including $1 billion
in funding currently available through the Department of Agriculture’s
Reconnect Program, as well as $100 million currently available through
the Department of the Treasury’s Capital Projects Fund.  
   
But making internet available is not enough: families must be able to
afford service and have the skills, technology, and capacity to take
advantage of the opportunities that the internet offers. That’s why the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $2.75 billion to promote [digital
equity and
inclusion](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=c52fcfcfb4&e=0ca263633c),
aiming to ensure that all people and communities can reap the full
benefits of the digital economy.  
   
**Tribal governments are ready to lead this work: 470 Tribes in 28
states – over 80 percent of federally-recognized Tribes – have indicated
that they would like to participate in the Digital Equity Planning Grant
program**, the first phase of the digital equity programs. In the coming
months, the Department of Commerce will work with Tribes to submit
applications and then award funds to Tribes to develop digital equity
plans to help their communities adopt and use high-speed internet.  
   
Moving forward, the Administration will continue to invest in internet
access and digital equity for Tribal communities. NTIA will develop
another opportunity to apply for funding under the Tribal Broadband
Connectivity Program, and the Administration will coordinate resources
across government to meet connectivity needs in Tribal communities. For
example, [NTIA and the Department of the
Interior](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=d4537b1203&e=0ca263633c)’s
Bureau of Indian Affairs have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to
coordinate responsibilities for ensuring compliance with environmental,
historic preservation, and cultural resources requirements in the
program, bringing additional expertise and coordination to efforts to
increase Tribal connectivity.  
   
   
**<u>BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS TO BRING HIGH-SPEED, AFFORDABLE
INTERNET TO TRIBAL COMMUNITIES</u>**  
   
Today’s announcement is part of a government-wide effort to deliver
high-speed internet infrastructure to Tribal communities, create more
low-cost internet service options, and address digital equity and
inclusion needs to ensure that Native American, Alaska Native, and
Native Hawaiian families can take full advantage of the opportunities
offered by internet service. Steps taken by the Administration in recent
months include:  
 

-   **In July, the Department of Agriculture announced** [**nearly $117
    million in rural broadband
    awards**](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=2d17615cec&e=0ca263633c)
    **that will serve Native communities or Tribal lands.** These funds
    through the ReConnect Program will bring fiber broadband
    infrastructure and affordable internet service to 4,300 people in
    Alaska, 1,000 people in Montana, and 200 people in Arizona. The
    ReConnect Program brings high-speed internet infrastructure to
    underserved rural communities. The Department of Agriculture
    recently announced that $1 billion is now available under the
    ReConnect Program, with [applications accepted beginning on
    September
    6<sup>th</sup>](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=815ca9ed01&e=0ca263633c).

-   **The Department of the Treasury has awarded** [**87 Tribal
    governments**](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=c859838c0d&e=0ca263633c)
    **$14.6 million from the Capital Projects Fund for projects to
    expand internet access and increase connectivity, **and continues to
    review increasing Tribal applications****. The Capital Projects Fund
    provides a total of $100 million to Tribal governments for capital
    projects that increase access to work, education, and health
    services, including through reliable, affordable high-speed internet
    access. For example, some Tribal governments are using these funds
    to help families or local libraries purchase laptops, install public
    WiFi access points, or expand community centers that offer computer
    labs and internet access. Treasury will make additional awards on a
    rolling basis. **<u>Tribal governments are each entitled to an
    allocation of about $167,500 but must claim their funds by</u>**
    [**submitting a request for
    funding**](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=59e219401d&e=0ca263633c)
    **<u>to the Treasury Department. In response to Tribal leader
    feedback, Treasury provided a second extension of the submission
    deadline to October 14, 2022.</u>**

<!-- -->

-   **In July, the Department of Commerce announced** [**over $10
    million**](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=3eb314d2f3&e=0ca263633c)
    **in grants to expand high-speed internet to minority-serving
    colleges and universities.** The Connecting Minority Communities
    Program expands internet access at Tribal Colleges and Universities,
    Minority-Serving Institutions, and Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities by supporting the purchase of broadband internet
    access, eligible equipment, or hiring and training information
    technology personnel. So far, the program has awarded $2.9 million
    to Diné College to improve educational and economic opportunity for
    the Navajo Nation and $1.9 million to Tohono O’odham Community
    College to address the lack of broadband access, adoption, and
    equity at the college and in the surrounding anchor communities in
    Tohono O’odham Nation. The program will announce additional awards
    on a rolling basis.

-   **Over 185,000 households on Tribal lands are saving up to $75 per
    month on their internet bills through the Affordable Connectivity
    Program (ACP)**. Created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, ACP
    provides a discount of up to $75 per month on internet bills for
    households on Tribal lands (or a discount of up to $30/month for
    other households), as well as a one-time $100 discount on a
    connected device. To further lower costs, President Biden and Vice
    President Harris announced commitments from 20 internet service
    providers across the country to offer high-speed plans that are
    fully covered by the ACP—meaning millions of working families can
    now get high-speed internet without paying a dime.  
      
      
    Households are eligible if they earn 200 percent of the Federal
    Poverty Guidelines or less (currently $55,500 for a family of four)
    or if they already participate in certain federal programs,
    including a wide range of Tribal assistance programs. Specifically,
    households participating in the following Tribal assistance programs
    are automatically eligible for ACP: Bureau of Indian Affairs General
    Assistance, Tribal Head Start (if the household meets the relevant
    income qualifying standard), Tribal Temporary Assistance for Needy
    Families, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian
    Reservations.  
      
    While millions of households across the country have signed up to
    save, many more are eligible. **Households can check their
    eligibility, find a fully-covered plan, and sign up at**
    [**GetInternet.gov**](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=efb64f0958&e=0ca263633c)**.**  
     

Moving forward, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to take
bold, concerted action to expand internet access and digital equity in
Tribal communities.  
 

-   **Throughout the month of September, the Biden-Harris Administration
    will host the** [**2022 Tribal Broadband
    Summit**](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=5399ad3f78&e=0ca263633c)**.**
    The virtual summit – coordinated and hosted jointly by the
    Department of the Interior, the Institute of Museum and Library
    Services, the Department of Agriculture, and NTIA – will provide an
    opportunity for leaders across the broadband development ecosystem
    to share best practices, new ideas, and lessons learned from their
    experience of bringing high-speed internet to Tribal
    communities. Federal partners, Tribal and Native Hawaiian Community
    broadband industry experts, and other participants will discuss how
    to coordinate and make the best use of federal funding and how to
    plan for the future of digital economies on Tribal Lands and across
    Native Hawaiian communities.

<!-- -->

-   **Additional investments in internet access and digital equity
    through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will build on the progress
    to date.** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law establishes a $42.45
    billion [Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD)
    Program](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=ba454aa9db&e=0ca263633c)
    to expand high-speed internet access to areas currently unserved or
    underserved by funding planning, infrastructure deployment, and
    adoption programs. State action plans for how to use BEAD funds must
    be informed by collaboration with Tribal governments, including
    through Tribal consultation, if there are Tribal Nations located
    within the state.

<!-- -->

-   **The Federal Communications Commission is also taking action to
    prevent digital discrimination**, under a Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law requirement for rules to ensure all people benefit from equal
    access to broadband internet service. The FCC [launched
    work](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=016099b0d9&e=0ca263633c)
    on these rules in March.

   
The Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to Indian Country goes well
beyond high-speed internet. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a
[historic investment of $13 billion in dedicated funding for
Tribes](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=910c6b7bf5&e=0ca263633c),
as well as hundreds of billions of dollars that Tribes can apply for on
a competitive basis. To date, more than $2.6 billion in Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Tribal
communities. This year alone, Tribes will receive more than $800 million
in set aside funds for transportation to invest in roads, bridges, and
public transit and over $150 million set aside for clean water. By the
time implementation is complete, the law will have made the largest
single investment in Tribal infrastructure ever in United States
history.
