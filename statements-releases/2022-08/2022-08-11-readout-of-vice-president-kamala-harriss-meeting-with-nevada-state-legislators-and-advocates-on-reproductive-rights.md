title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Nevada State\
  \ Legislators and Advocates on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
The Vice President emphasized that access to safe and legal reproductive
health care is not a partisan issue. The state legislators and advocates
discussed ways that they have safeguarded reproductive health care and
abortion access in Nevada. They noted the prevalence of misinformation
and disinformation surrounding reproductive health care and shared other
challenges facing women in their state. They also discussed the unique
impact of *Dobbs* on women service members and veterans. Vice President
Harris expressed concern about how other rights may be at stake
following *Dobbs*, including access to contraception and same sex
marriage. The Vice President, state legislators, and advocates committed
themselves to fighting to protect access to abortion.  
   
The Vice President is bringing together leaders from across the nation
who are on the frontlines fighting to protect a woman’s right to make
her own reproductive health decisions. As part of that work, the Vice
President has recently met with state legislators from 17 states to
discuss protecting reproductive rights, including Arizona, Florida,
Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Nebraska,
Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas,
Utah, and Virginia. She has also convened health care providers,
constitutional law experts, faith leaders, state attorneys general,
disability rights leaders, higher education leaders, and advocates.
