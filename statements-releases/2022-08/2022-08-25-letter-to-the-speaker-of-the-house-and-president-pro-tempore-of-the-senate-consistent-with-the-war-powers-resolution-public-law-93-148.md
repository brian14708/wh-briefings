Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)

At my direction, on August 23, 2022, United States forces conducted
precision strikes against a facility in eastern Syria.  The facility was
used by militia groups affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps that have been involved in a series of unmanned aerial
vehicle, rocket, and mortar attacks against United States personnel and
facilities in Syria.  Two attacks on August 15, 2022, by Iran‑backed
militia groups targeted al-Tanf Garrison and Mission Support Site Green
Village, both U.S. bases in Syria.  These August 15 attacks followed a
series of attacks by Iran-backed militia groups on U.S. forces and
facilities in Iraq and Syria in the last 6 months.  These attacks have
threatened the lives of United States and Coalition personnel. 

I directed the August 23 strikes in order to protect and defend the
safety of our personnel, to degrade and disrupt the ongoing series of
attacks against the United States and our partners, and to deter the
Islamic Republic of Iran and Iran-backed militia groups from conducting
or supporting further attacks on United States personnel and
facilities.  In support of these aims, the precision strikes were
directed at a facility used by groups involved in these ongoing attacks
for logistics and ammunition storage.

I directed this discrete military action consistent with my
responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad
and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief
and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations.  The
United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent
with international law, and in the exercise of the United States’
inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action,
as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks. 

I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  Additional information is provided in a classified annex.  I
appreciate the support of the Congress in this action. 

                            Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
