title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Senate Passage of the Inflation Reduction\_\
  Act"
---
 
Today, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special
interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health
insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while
making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share.  I ran
for President promising to make government work for working families
again, and that is what this bill does — period.   
   
This bill caps seniors’ out of pocket spending for prescription drugs at
$2000 per year – no matter what their drug bills would otherwise be,
seniors will not have to spend more than $2000.  In addition, 13 million
Americans, covered under the Affordable Care Act, will see their health
insurance premiums reduced by $800.  
   
This bill tackles inflation by lowering the deficit and lowering costs
for regular families.  
   
This bill also makes the largest investment ever in combatting the
existential crisis of climate change.  It addresses the climate crisis
and strengthens our energy security, creating jobs manufacturing solar
panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles in America with American
workers.  It lowers families’ energy costs by hundreds of dollars each
year.   
   
Finally, it pays for all this by establishing a minimum corporate tax so
that our richest corporations start to pay their fair share.  It does
not raise taxes on those making under $400,000 a year – not one cent.  
                                                                                
I want to thank Leader Schumer and every member of the Senate Democratic
caucus for supporting this bill.  It required many compromises.  Doing
important things almost always does.     
   
The House should pass this as soon as possible and I look forward to
signing it into law.
