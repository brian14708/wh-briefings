  \ Pedro R.\_Pierluisi"

Today, Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves met with Puerto Rico
Governor Pedro R. Pierluisi to announce the intent of the federal
government, in partnership with the government of Puerto Rico, to hold
an Economic Dialogue in Washington, D.C. this fall. As part of the
Administration’s ongoing commitment to Puerto Rico’s economic
prosperity, we are also announcing that Deputy Secretary Don Graves will
serve as the Puerto Rico Economic Growth Coordinator. 

During their meeting, Deputy Secretary Graves and Governor Pierluisi
discussed the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to helping Puerto
Rico prosper, and how the Economic Dialogue will offer mechanisms for
the federal government and the Puerto Rican government to align on
shared policy priorities that benefit all Puerto Ricans given the
recent, unprecedented flow of federal funds to the Island.

The Deputy Secretary and Governor also discussed attracting human
capital and workforce development, leveraging resources from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to develop a resilient infrastructure,
creating a more diversified economy by attracting new business and
facilitating innovation and competition, and building capacity through
data-driven solutions to improve economic growth and create long-term
prosperity for Puerto Rico and its people.
