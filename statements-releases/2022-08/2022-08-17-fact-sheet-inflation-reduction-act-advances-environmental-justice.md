*Most Significant Climate Legislation in U.S. History Delivers for
Overburdened Communities*

By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
his promise to build an economy that works for working families,
including communities that have been underinvested and underserved for
too long. President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back special
interests to pass this historic legislation that lowers energy costs,
advance environmental justice while building a cleaner future, and grows
the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

For far too long, communities across our country have faced
environmental injustices, bearing the brunt of toxic pollution, enduring
underinvestment in infrastructure and critical services, and suffering
disproportionate impacts from climate change. The Inflation Reduction
Act includes historic investments in environmental justice, including
establishing **several new environmental justice grant programs.** The
law will improve public health, reduce pollution, and revitalize
communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by
pollution while increase access to affordable and accessible clean
energy.

The Inflation Reduction Act builds on the historic investments in
President Biden’s [Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-advances-environmental-justice/#:~:text=The%20Bipartisan%20Infrastructure%20Law%20delivers,orphaned%20oil%20and%20gas%20wells.)
and advances his [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
which will deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of climate and
clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities. In total,
[hundreds of federal
programs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2022/07/26/icymi-biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-covered-programs-for-inclusion-in-the-justice40-initiative/),
including those established by the Inflation Reduction Act and
Bipartisan Law, representing historic investments are being reimagined
and transformed to meet the Justice40 goal and maximize benefits to
disadvantaged communities.

*The Inflation Reduction Act will:*

**<u>REDUCE POLLUTION</u>**

All people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live in
healthy communities free from toxic pollutants. However, research shows
that low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribal and
indigenous communities are more likely to live near polluting sites and
face negative health impacts from ongoing pollution and environmental
hazards. The Act invests directly in programs to reduce pollution in
frontline communities, including:

-   **Creating Climate and Environmental Justice Block Grants** to
    support community-led projects in disadvantaged communities and
    address disproportionate environmental and public health harms
    related to pollution and climate change.
-   **Funding for** **fenceline monitoring** near industrial facilities,
    air quality sensors in disadvantaged communities, new and upgraded
    multipollutant monitoring sites, and monitoring and mitigation of
    methane and wood heater emissions.
-   Protecting our children with investments to monitor and reduce
    pollution at **public schools** in disadvantaged communities.

**<u>IMPROVE CLEAN TRANSIT</u>**

Communities living near transportation corridors have been exposed to
toxic pollution which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular harm –
especially in children. The Inflation Reduction Act will clean up
transit systems and provide healthier, sustainable transportation
options for all Americans, including:

-   **Addressing** **diesel emissions** from goods movement facilities
    and speeding their adoption of clean heavy-duty vehicles, a key part
    of the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act.
-   **Cleaning up ports** to reduce the pollution burden faced by
    fenceline communities, jump-starting the transition of ports to
    zero-emissions with funding for clean technology and emissions
    reduction plans.
-   **Creating Neighborhood Access and Equity Grants** to support
    neighborhood equity, safety, and affordable transportation access.
    These grants will reconnect communities divided by existing
    infrastructure, mitigate negative impacts of transportation
    facilities or construction projects on communities, and support
    equitable transportation planning.

**<u>MAKE CLEAN ENERGY MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE</u>**

As the U.S. grows its clean energy economy, no community will be left
behind. The Inflation Reduction Act helps achieve this goal by:

-   **Spurring** **solar project development** in communities with a 20%
    bonus credit for solar projects on federally-subsidized affordable
    housing projects and a 10% bonus credit for solar projects in
    low-income communities.
-   **Creating a new** **Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator**,
    which will seed state and local clean energy financing institutions,
    support the deployment of distributed zero-emission technologies
    like heat-pumps, community solar and EV charging, while prioritizing
    over 50% of its investments in disadvantaged communities.
-   **Creating a new grant program for** **Improving Energy Efficiency
    or Water Efficiency or Climate Resilience of Affordable Housing**,
    which will help cover the cost when families need to replace energy
    appliances and equipment.
-   **Expanding** **access to affordable, clean energy in Indian
    country** with rebates that give families money back when they need
    to purchase efficient electric appliances, bring clean power to
    homes that have never had electricity access, and new investments in
    energy projects and infrastructure through DOE’s Tribal Energy Loan
    Guarantee Program.

**<u>STRENGTHEN RESLIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE</u>**

People of color and low-income communities live in areas most vulnerable
to climate change fueled weather events. The Act will strengthen the
resilience of communities to climate change impacts and leverage the
ecosystems they depend on, including:

-   Boosting the **resilience of Tribal and Native Hawaiian
    communities**, landscapes, and fisheries from the impacts of climate
    change and severe drought.
-   Enabling the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to
    improve the **climate resilience of affordable housing**.
-   Planting trees, establishing **community and urban forests**, and
    expanding green spaces in cities, which combats climate change,
    lowers energy bills and reduces heat-related death and illness.
