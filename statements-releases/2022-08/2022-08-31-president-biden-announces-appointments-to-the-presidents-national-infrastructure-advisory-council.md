  \ Advisory\_Council"
---
 
WASHINGTON – Today, President Biden announced his intent to appoint
highly qualified and diverse industry and government leaders as members
of the President’s National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC),
which advises the White House on how to reduce physical and cyber risks
and improve the security and resilience of the nation’s critical
infrastructure sectors.  

Since its establishment in 2001, the NIAC has conducted dozens of
studies to address problems such as: improving intelligence information
sharing across government and industry; identifying and reducing complex
cyber risks; better preparing for and responding to disruptions that can
ripple across multiple infrastructure systems; facilitating cooperative
decision-making among senior executives and federal leaders during
imminent threats and disaster responses; and addressing the skills gaps
and loss of institutional knowledge in key national workforces.

The Biden-Harris Administration is delivering unprecedented
infrastructure investments in all 50 states and territories to build a
better America that delivers for all communities. The individuals
announced today are leading senior executives with deep experience
across a broad range of sectors including: banking and finance,
