title: "FACT SHEET: White\_House Summit on Building Lasting Eviction Prevention\_\
  Reform"
---
 
Today, the White House and U.S. Department of Treasury are hosting a
White House Summit on Building Lasting Eviction Prevention Reform. As
funds for Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) are beginning to wind down,
the Summit will focus on the need for an all-out effort to build lasting
reform – including through the use of remaining American Rescue Plan
(ARP) funds from ERA and State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF)
assistance. Having created a first-ever national infrastructure for
eviction prevention, now is the time to ensure we build on this progress
and prevent a return to [an eviction system that allowed 3.6 million
eviction filings a year](https://evictionlab.org/), often for small
amounts of funds and without any legal representation or eviction
diversion options. The Summit will feature top Administration officials,
Chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee
Sherrod Brown, Eviction Lab Founder Matthew Desmond, and will include
State Supreme Court Justices and national, state, and local leaders who
have pioneered lasting reform approaches that can serve as national
models (see Appendix).

**The Biden-Harris Administration is also highlighting the most current
data on the impact of the Emergency Rental Assistance available as of
this moment.**

-   **Approximately 7 Million Payments to Renters and Their Families At
    Risk of Eviction While Making Landlords Whole and Meeting Equity
    Goals:** As of July 2022, Treasury estimates show that ERA programs
    have made approximately 7 million payments to provide rental or
    utility assistance to individuals at risk for eviction or housing
    instability across the country. This has prevented evictions,
    utility shut-offs, and the sacrifice of food and medical help in
    order to stay current with rent. Over 80% of assistance has gone to
    very low income renters, defined as renters at or below 50% Average
    Median Income, with [majority-African American communities—who
    historically suffer among the highest rates of evections—seeing the
    largest reductions in
    evictions](https://evictionlab.org/us-eviction-filing-patterns-2021/).
    Moreover, through March 31, 2022, state and local governments have
    served an additional 1.1 million households through rent, mortgage,
    and utility assistance using SLFRF from the American Rescue Plan,
    budgeting $4.5 billion in these funds for additional assistance
    beyond ERA.  
-   **Instead of a Dramatic Eviction Spike Following the End of the
    Eviction Moratorium, Eviction Filings Have Remained 26%
    *<u>Below</u>* Historic Averages Nationally:** Despite projections
    of an eviction “tsunami” following the end of the CDC eviction
    moratorium in August 2021, eviction filings nationally have remained
    26% below historic averages in the 10 months since the end of the
    moratorium, based on an
    [analysis](https://evictionlab.org/us-eviction-filing-patterns-2021/)
    of [data](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/get-the-data/)
    collected by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University.
-   **Assessment of ERA Impact by Pulitzer Prize-Winning Author of
    *Evicted* and Eviction Lab Founder Matthew Desmond:** “The Emergency
    Rental Assistance Program along with the federal eviction moratorium
    formed the most important federal housing policy in the
    last decade. These combined initiatives were the deepest investment
    in low-income renters the federal government has made since the
    nation launched its public housing system. This was a real win, the
    most important eviction prevention policy in American history.” 
-   **The Biden-Harris Administration Push for Reform has Helped
    Contribute to Significant Increases in Eviction Diversion and Right
    to Counsel:** From early after the passage of the American Rescue
    Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration led the initiative to
    encourage lasting reform. This included three [White House Summits
    on Eviction
    Diversion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/30/readout-of-the-white-house-eviction-prevention-summit/);

    also responded to the Administration’s push for reform, including
    efforts by the American Bar Association, National Bar Association,
    Hispanic National Bar Association, National Conference of Bar
    Presidents, Legal Services Corporation, the Association for Pro Bono
    Counsel and Law Firm Antiracism Alliance.
-   **These Efforts Have Contributed to the Following Gains in Lasting
    Eviction Prevention Reform:**
-   **Major Expansion in Eviction Diversion:** Before the pandemic there
    were only a handful of eviction diversion programs. Since the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s push, approximately 180 jurisdictions
    in 36 states developed or enhanced eviction diversion programs with
    ERA. For example, State Supreme Courts in
    [Michigan](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/siteassets/covid/covid-19/2020-08_2021-07-02_formattedorder_amendtofao2020-17.pdf),
    [Indiana](https://www.in.gov/courts/housing/), [New
    Mexico](https://www.nmcourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-Mexico-courts-implementing-Eviction-Prevention-and-Diversion-Program.pdf),
    and [Texas](https://www.tdhca.state.tx.us/TEDP.htm) all adopted
    statewide eviction diversion programs and Philadelphia extended its
    model pre-filing eviction diversion program. In
    [Michigan](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/4a0177/siteassets/covid/covid-19/evictions_scao_publicwebpage-7-14-2022.pdf),
    these efforts have cut the eviction rate in half, from nearly 30% in
    2019 to 14% in 2022. In New Mexico, eviction diversion reduced
    eviction filings to 36% belowhistoric averages across the state and
    41% below historic averages in Albuquerque. In [Philadelphia,
    PA](https://eviction-diversion.phila.gov/#/), [85% of
    cases](https://phlcouncil.com/philadelphias-nationally-acclaimed-eviction-diversion-program-is-now-law/)
    reached a settlement or an agreement to continue negotiation, and
    eviction filing rates have remained 53% of historic averages since
    the national moratorium ended in August 2021.
-   **Increased Right to Counsel for Tenants:** Leading into the
    pandemic, only 5 cities had adopted a legislative right to counsel.
    Today, [three states and fifteen cities have legislatively adopted
    the right to counsel for tenants facing
    eviction](http://civilrighttocounsel.org/uploaded_files/283/RTC_Enacted_Legislation_in_Eviction_Proceedings_FINAL.pdf).
    In addition, nearly sixty cities expanded access to counsel for
    tenants using federal funds. In Michigan, as of June 2022, legal
    representation for tenants increased from 5% to 90-95%, in many
    places across the state, including Detroit. In New Orleans, LA,
    Legal Services Help Desks and Right to Counsel have obtained
    favorable outcomes that increased housing stability in 96% of cases.
    In Cleveland, OH, [93% of represented tenants avoided
    displacement](https://freeevictionhelpresults.org/impressive-fiscal-impacts/)
    and eviction filings dropped to nearly 50% below historic averages
    between August 2021, when the federal eviction moratorium ended, and
    March 2022, the last date of available data.
-   **ARP Supported New Tenant Protections:** According to the National
    Low Income Housing Coalition, since January 2021, [31 states and 67
    localities](https://nlihc.org/tenant-protections) (including
    Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico) have passed or implemented
    policies totaling more than 154 unique tenant protections, including
    pauses on the eviction process while rental assistance applications
    are pending, right to counsel legislation, and eviction record
    sealing laws, among other reform policies.

**The White House Summit Will Highlight Overall Progress of the
Emergency Rental Assistance Program and Top Models of Reform at the
State and Local Court and Government Levels.**

The Summit will feature overall policy views from top Administration
Officials, Matthew Desmond, President and CEO of the National Low Income

Build on the Emergency Rental Assistance Infrastructure to Sustain
Eviction Reform</u>**

**<u>Visionary Court-Led Eviction System Reform</u>**

***<u>Michigan: Adopting Long-Term Court-Based Eviction Diversion to
Prevent Avoidable Evictions</u>***

Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack issued one
of the earliest [standing
orders](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/SysGlobalAssets/migrated/news-events-review/archive/chief-justice-statement-on-eviction-diversion.docx-final.pdf)
during the pandemic to pause the eviction process once a rental
assistance application has been submitted. Building on these best
practices, **the Michigan Supreme Court has proposed a new statewide
order permanently adopting the stay of eviction action** when a tenant
applies for assistance. The proposed order requires a mandatory
pre-trial convening to ensure tenants have access to rights and
resources and prevents default judgments. It also prohibits five-day
eviction orders, offers remote hearings for tenants with barriers to
accessing courts, and attaches detailed information about assistance to
every summons, among other best practices. The state also dedicated ERA
housing stability funds to increase tenant access to legal counsel, with
[Detroit legislatively adopting right to counsel in
2022](https://pub-detroitmi.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=36171).

-   The **eviction rate has been cut in half** from nearly 30% in 2019
    to 14% in 2022.
-   As of June 2022, **legal representation for tenants increased from
    5% to 90-95%**, in many places across the state, including Detroit.
-   According to the annual data collected for 2021 by the [Michigan
    State Bar Foundation](https://www.msbf.org/), **98% of households**
    represented by a legal aid lawyer were able to remain in their
    homes.
-   The Michigan diversion program has **approved applications from
    150,000 households** and **delivered $830 million in** **ERA** to
    struggling tenants and landlords.

***<u>New Mexico: Leveraging American Rescue Plan Funding and
Collaborating with Landlords and Tenants to Design Sustainable Eviction
Diversion Programs</u>***

New Mexico Supreme Court Chief Justice C. Shannon Bacon created a task
force of tenant and landlord groups, ERA program administrators, housing
programs and state and local officials to design and launch **one of the
longest, most successful** [**court-ordered eviction diversion
programs**](https://www.nmcourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-Mexico-courts-implementing-Eviction-Prevention-and-Diversion-Program.pdf)
**in the country**, including a mandatory extension of the lease term
where landlords accept rental assistance. The eviction diversion program
includes increased access to legal representation, mediation, and
financial navigators to provide holistic services to tenants at risk of
eviction. Due to the success of the program in reducing evictions, **the
state will continue to fund the eviction diversion program with state
funds** – initially made possible with American Rescue Plan funds.

-   As of July 2022, **the State has distributed $148 million** in rent
    and utility payments as well as emergency hotel stays and moving
    costs. This funding has **assisted over 44,000 households**.
-   Since the national eviction moratorium ended, eviction filing rates
    have remained well below average filings at **about 64% of historic
    averages** across the state of New Mexico and 59% in Albuquerque.

***<u>New Orleans: Implementing Eviction Diversion and Right to Counsel
to Secure Court-Based Reform</u>***

Chief Judge Veronica Henry developed the First and Second City Courts’
[award-winning Eviction Diversion
Program](https://nola.gov/mayor/news/october-2021/city-of-new-orleans-eviction-diversion-project-wins-the-2021-legal-service-innovation-award/),
a partnership between the City of New Orleans, First and Second City
Courts, [Southeast Louisiana Legal Services,](https://slls.org/)
[Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center
(LFHAC)](https://lafairhousing.org/), [Jane Place Neighborhood
Sustainability Initiative](https://www.jpnsi.org/), and Parochial
Offices of the Court. **The program diverts eviction cases** to on-site
ERA administrators, Eviction Help Desks, the Right to Counsel Program,
and other supportive services to prevent eviction and stabilize housing.
New Orleans built on the diversion program by **legislatively adopting
the** [**right to counsel for tenants facing eviction in
2022**](https://cityofno.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=&event_id=23299&meta_id=581809)
and initially funding the intervention with $2 million in ERA funds.

-   The First and Second City Courts’ Eviction Legal Services Help Desks
    and Right to Counsel Program have **obtained favorable outcomes that
    increase housing stability in 96% of cases**, including dismissals
    of eviction, consent judgments, providing more time to move,
    stipulated repayment arrangements, and other results to stabilize
    tenants.
-   In June 2022, eviction filing rates were 10% below the average
    filing rate in a pre-pandemic year and **default eviction judgments
    had dropped by nearly 20% from 2019 rates.**
-   Between February 2021 and June 2022, the New Orleans City Courts’
    interventions have reached over 5,700 people, including tenants and
    their children, with 84% of households served identifying as African
    American and 72% headed by women.

**<u>State and Local Innovations in Eviction Prevention</u>**

***<u>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Mandating Pre-filing Eviction
Diversion and Prohibiting Harmful Tenant Screening Practices </u>***

Philadelphia Councilmember Helen Gym (At Large) introduced
**the nation’s first city**
[**ordinance**](https://phlcouncil.com/city-council-enacts-emergency-housing-protection-act/)** mandating
pre-filing eviction diversion**, which went into effect in August 2020.
As a result, tenants at risk of eviction receive access to rental
assistance and legal representation and tenants and landlords are
required to participate in a free mediation session with the goal of
resolution through an agreement. The diversion program has changed the
culture to one where **eviction litigation is a last resort**. **The
city is committing long-term funding for rental assistance**, a key
component of diversion. In addition, Philadelphia adopted the [Renters’
Access
Act](https://www.phila.gov/documents/renters-access-act-tenant-screening-guidelines/),
which **prohibits screening of tenants based on certain eviction
filings** and requires landlords to tell tenants why they were rejected
and provide an opportunity to correct errors.

-   The diversion program, in combination with ERA, greatly improved
    housing stability. **85% of cases have resulted in settlement or
    agreement** to continue negotiation.
-   These interventions have had a significant impact on eviction
    outcomes in Philadelphia. The eviction filing rate for Philadelphia
    has remained at **53% of historic averages** since the CDC
    moratorium lifted in August 2021.

***<u>Chicago, Illinois: Access to Legal Services for Tenants and
Landlords and Early Eviction Resolution</u>***

In July 2022, Chicago **dedicated $8 million in ERA** housing stability
funds to adopt a [three-year Right to Counsel
pilot](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/renters/news/2022/april/the-chicago-department-of-housing-announces-right-to-counsel-pil.html#:~:text=The%20Right%20to%20Counsel%20(RTC,eviction%20or%20lockout%20in%20Chicago.).
The city is collaborating with legal service providers – [Lawyers’
Committee for Better Housing](https://www.lcbh.org/), [Legal Aid
Chicago](https://www.legalaidchicago.org/), and
[CARPLS](https://www.carpls.org/) – to provide legal representation and
increase housing stability. The program is expected to **double the
number of tenants who have access to attorneys**, serving 2,000 to 3,000
tenants per year, and greatly reduce eviction orders. Chicago landlords
and tenants have also benefited from the [Cook County Early Resolution
Program](https://www.cookcountycourt.org/Portals/0/Chief%20Judge/General%20Administrative%20Orders/12.14.2020%20GAO%202020-09%20with%20attachments.pdf)
**that diverts eviction cases to mediation and provides free legal aid**
to both tenants and unrepresented landlords. These programs have also
effectively leveraged state law to **seal pandemic-era eviction filing
records** for tenants, preventing the Scarlet E of eviction that results
in a downward move and long-term hardship. 

-   In the first six months after the end of the local eviction
    moratorium, **just 10% of eviction filings resulted in a judgment to
    remove the tenant, compared to 25% in the equivalent period before
    the pandemic** and the Early Resolution Program. That represents a
    reduction of more than 2,000 eviction judgments.
-   The City of Chicago has **served over 19,000 tenants and their
    landlords** with over $150 million in ERA funds.

***<u>Cleveland, Ohio: Permanently Adopting Right to Counsel and Serving
Tenants at Highest Risk of Eviction</u>***

The City of Clevelandwas **among the first cities in the United States
to legislatively adopt** [**right to
counsel**](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/cleveland/latest/cleveland_oh/0-0-0-49335),
immediately prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, initially
funding the program through a public-private partnership including the
City of Cleveland, [United Way](https://www.unitedwaycleveland.org/) and
the [Cleveland Foundation](https://www.clevelandfoundation.org/), among
others. As private funds sunset, **Cleveland has allocated Emergency
Rental Assistance funds** **and is working to sustain right to counsel
with long-term government support and additional American Rescue Plan
funding,** and amplifying its effectiveness through the development of
an eviction diversion program that includes pre-filing mediation. To
ensure services reach those with the greatest need, partners have
combined data analysis with canvassing and door knocking. Zip code data
on eviction rates and the lowest number of requests for assistance
allows partners to identify and target outreach to the most
marginalized, highest risk tenants.

-   These innovations **prevented eviction judgments in 93% of cases**
    and kept eviction filings around **51% of historic averages**
    between August 2021, when the federal eviction moratorium ended, and
    March 2022, the last date of available data.
-   **Right to counsel has saved the City of Cleveland an estimated $4.3
    to $4.7 million** in annual costs related to healthcare savings,
    avoided foster care placements and safety net expenses, and
    preserved residency in Cleveland. Additional savings can be found in
    stable education, employment and family stability that follows
    eviction prevention.

***<u>Colorado: Partnering with Nonprofits to Provide Immediate Eviction
Prevention and Rental Assistance</u>***

In Colorado, the COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project launched the
[Colorado Stability
Fund](https://share.hsforms.com/13fTvpIrKRQGBPANZiuKv3A8nqki), a
**unique revolving rental assistance fund** capable of issuing quick,
accurate ERA payments in less than 24 hours through a new partnership
between the [COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project
(CEDP),](https://cedproject.org/) [Colorado Housing and Finance
Authority (CHFA)](https://www.chfainfo.com/), and [Colorado’s Division
of Housing (DOH).](https://cdola.colorado.gov/housing) The [Stability
Fund](https://cedproject.org/help/) is available to all Colorado renters
and gives those facing eviction **a single point of contact for housing
stability services** and integrates intake and navigation, rapid rental
aid payments, eviction legal defense, and, when necessary, rehousing
support. The initiative is strengthened by partnerships with legal aid
organizations and organizations by and for Black, Indigenous, people of
color (BIPOC) communities to ensure resources reach those at greatest
risk of displacement with deference to cultural context. In Denver, the
program **works seamlessly with the** [**right to counsel**, adopted in
2021](https://denver.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4927148&GUID=1A4A3F9C-A0E2-46ED-A998-FA8B5F022B22&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=21-0529).
To ensure continued eviction prevention, partners are working to sustain
the program long-term with funds from the state and are expanding to
other housing areas, including foreclosure.

-   With over 70 intake staff ready to field requests, the Colorado
    Stability Fund offers a **“fast lane” for displacement prevention**,
    ensuring that services arrive prior to an eviction order.
-   The program has halted thousands of evictions since its inception**,
    served 20,000 people and issued over $50 million in payments**, with
    74% of recipients identifying as BIPOC or Hispanic.

***<u>Oregon: Community Partnerships to Provide Rapid Eviction
Prevention to the Highest Risk Tenants</u>***

Oregon was one of the first states to supplement ERA funds with SLFRF
and state funding. In addition, the state developed and funds the
Eviction Prevention Rapid Response Program, a partnership between the
[Oregon Law Center](https://oregonlawcenter.org/) and the [Oregon
Housing and Community
Services](https://www.oregon.gov/ohcs/pages/index.aspx) (OHCS) that
serves as a critical element of the [Eviction Defense
Project](https://oregonlawcenter.org/eviction-defense-project/). The
program allows for **rapid financial assistance to prevent eviction and
homelessness**, since legal aid can verify tenant eligibility and
provide flexible funds to prevent evictions, including rental
assistance, cleaning services, moving expenses, and more. OHCS also
partners with community-based tenant organizations and nonprofits,
including [Unite Oregon](https://www.uniteoregon.org/),
[Bienestar](https://bienestar-or.org/), and the [Springfield Eugene
Tenants
Association](https://www.springfieldeugenetenantassociation.com/).
During the height of the pandemic, these **trusted community groups
conduct outreach to community members at risk of eviction**, including
engaging in multi-lingual door knocking, and connecting their neighbors
with resources to avoid eviction. As part of ongoing eviction prevention
efforts, OHCS is also partnering with the [Urban League of
Portland](https://ulpdx.org/), [Immigrant and Refugee Organization
(IRCO)](https://irco.org/), and other community organizations statewide
to conduct community outreach and provide critical eviction prevention
services.

-   Oregon also passed **Safe Harbor legislation to seal pandemic
    eviction records** created between April 2020 and February 2022 and
    postpone evictions for Oregonians waiting on rental assistance as
    their applications are processed.
-   In 2021, eviction rates fell from **nearly 1,500 filings a month
    before the pandemic to 377 per month during the first half of the
    year**, with only 17% for nonpayment of rent.
