title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden Marking Ten Years Since the Attack on the\
  \ Sikh Temple in Oak Creek,\_Wisconsin"
---
 
When generations of Sikh-Americans in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, constructed
their own place of worship after years of renting local halls, it was a
sacred place of their own and a connection shared with the broader
community. That sense of peace and belonging was shattered on the
morning of August 5, 2012, when a white supremacist wielding a
semiautomatic handgun arrived at the Gurdwara and began shooting.

The gunman murdered six people and wounded four that day, as well as
another victim who survived his wounds only to succumb to them years
later. Jill and I know that days like today bring back the pain like it
happened yesterday, and we mourn with the victims’ families, the
survivors, and the community devastated by this heinous act.

The Oak Creek shooting was the deadliest attack on Sikh Americans in our
nation’s history. Tragically, attacks on our nation’s houses of worship
have only become more common over the past decade. It is up to all of us
to deny this hate safe harbor. No one should fear for their life when
they bow their head in prayer or go about their lives in America.

Oak Creek has shown us the way. After the attack, the Sikh community
returned to their Gurdwara and insisted on cleaning it themselves. The
son of one of the victims became the first Sikh in American history to
testify before Congress, successfully calling for the federal government
to track hate crimes against Sikhs and other minority groups. Every
year, the congregation now hosts an annual memorial run to honor the
victims. The event bears the words Charhdi Kala, meaning “eternal
optimism.”

Fueled by that spirit of eternal optimism, we must continue to take
steps now to reduce gun violence and keep our fellow Americans safe. We
must do more to protect places of worship, and defeat domestic terrorism
and hate in all its forms, including the poison of white supremacy. We
must ban assault weapons—used in many mass shootings at houses of
worship and other sites across the country—as well as high-capacity
magazines. Last week, the House of Representatives passed a bill to do
just that. As a matter of conscience and common sense, the Senate must
act as well. To stand in defense of religious freedom, we must all stand
together to ban the weapons that terrorize congregations around our
country.
