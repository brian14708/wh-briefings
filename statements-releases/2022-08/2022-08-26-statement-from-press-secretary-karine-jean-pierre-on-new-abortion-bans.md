title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on New Abortion\_Bans"
---
 
Today marks the latest attack against the fundamental rights of
Americans as new abortion bans go into effect in Idaho, Oklahoma,
Tennessee, and Texas. These extreme bans will criminalize abortion, in
some cases without exceptions for rape or incest. These near-total
abortion bans are part of a growing effort by Republican legislators to
roll back the freedoms Americans have relied on for nearly half a
century. Today’s radical steps take away women’s reproductive rights and
put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians instead
of women and their doctors, threatening women’s health and lives.
Americans need to know that these and other fundamental rights,
including the right to contraception and marriage equality, are at risk.
Congress should act immediately to pass a law restoring the protections
of Roe–and people across the country to should make their voices
heard.
