title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Defeat of Kansas Ballot Measure Threatening\
  \ Women\u2019s Right to\_Abortion"
---
 
The Supreme Court’s extreme decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade *put
women’s health and lives at risk. Tonight, the American people had
something to say about it. Voters in Kansas turned out in record numbers
to reject extreme efforts to amend the state constitution to take away a
woman’s right to choose and open the door for a state-wide ban. This
vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that
women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make
their own health care decisions.  
   
Congress should listen to the will of the American people and restore
the protections of *Roe* as federal law. While that is the only way to
secure a woman’s right to choose, my Administration will continue to
take meaningful action to protect women’s access to reproductive health
care. We will continue to act where we can to protect women’s
reproductive rights and access to care.  And, the American people must
continue to use their voices to protect the right to women’s health
care, including abortion.
