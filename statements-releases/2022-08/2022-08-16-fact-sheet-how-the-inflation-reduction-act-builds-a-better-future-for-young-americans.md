title: "FACT SHEET:  How the Inflation Reduction Act Builds a Better Future for Young\_\
  Americans"
---
 
By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
his promise to meet the climate crisis and build an economy that works
for working families. The Inflation Reduction Act makes historic
investments in America’s future while lowering health care and energy
costs. It’s the most aggressive action we have taken to confront the
climate crisis. It’ll lower the deficit and ask the super wealthy and
corporations to pay their fair share. And no one making under $400,000
per year will pay a penny more in taxes.

President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special
interests to pass this historic legislation that builds a brighter
future for young Americans by lowering costs, advancing environmental
justice while building a cleaner future, and growing the economy from
the bottom up and the middle out.

**<u>TACKLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS</u>**

This lawrepresents the single most aggressive action the U.S. is taking
to tackle the climate crisis and create clean energy solutions in
American history. The law will bring down energy costs for families and
create thousands of good jobs, all while reducing climate pollution and
ensuring that we have a clean, secure future energy supply. It will:

**Reduce Pollution:** The law would reduce about a gigaton (a billion
metric tons) of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 and position America to
meet President Biden’s climate goals of cutting climate pollution in
half by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by no later than 2050.

**Advance Environmental Justice: **Climate change disproportionately
impacts low-income communities and communities of color. The Act will
work to alleviate legacy pollution and to ensure that clean energy
opportunities reach all Americans through:

-   Creating new Environmental Justice Block Grants—which will support
    community-led projects across the country, including tackling
    pollution in port communities where air pollution is especially
    deadly.
-   Creating a new Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator that will
    seed state and local clean energy financing banks, which will help
    disadvantaged communities access the benefits of the law.
-   Providing funding for Tribal communities to bring clean,
    zero-emissions power to homes and to boost their climate resilience.

**Cut Energy Costs:** The law makes it more affordable to purchase
energy efficient and electric appliances, home improvements, and more to
bring down energy costs. Overall, the law puts America on track to meet
the President’s climate goals, which will save every family an average
of $500 [per
year](https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf)
on their energy bills, providing support for:

-   Efficient Appliances and Home Upgrades – The law includes direct
    consumer rebates when households need to upgrade furnaces, water
    heaters, stoves, ovens, or other home appliances with more energy
    efficient and electric appliances. Households can save up to 30%
    with tax credits for home construction projects on windows, doors,
    insulation, or other weatherization measures that prevent energy
    from escaping homes. These upgrades can lower future utility bills
    by at least $350 per year.

<!-- -->

-   Home Energy Systems – When households want to install solar on their
    roof they can save up to 30% with tax credits. For example, average
    family installing solar using this credit would save $9,000 on their
    electricity bill over the life of the system, or about $300 per
    year.

<!-- -->

-   Cleaner Cars and Trucks – The law will bring down the sticker price
    of electric vehicles, providing Americans tax credits of up to
    $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used electric vehicle purchases. This
    measure could especially help young Americans buy their first car
    and skip the gas pump forever.

**<u>LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</u>**

Since 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has helped provide quality
health insurance coverage for people who don’t receive coverage through
their jobs. Still, health insurance remains unaffordable for many
Americans. During his campaign, President Biden
[promised](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/) to build on the ACA by
making premium tax credits more generous and lowering health care
premiums for working families. The President’s American Rescue Plan kept
that commitment by improving premium tax credits. However, those
improvements are set to expire at the end of 2022. The *Inflation
Reduction Act* extends them through 2025:

-   **Saving 13 Million Americans Hundreds of Dollars per Year.** About
    [13 million
    Americans](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1647ad29528ee85a48d6ffa9e7bfbc8f/arp-ptc-sunset-impacts-03-22-22%20Final.pdf)
    will save an average of about [$800
    annually](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/36e5e989516728adcc63e398b3e3d23d/aspe-marketplace-coverage-economic-benefits.pdf)
    on health insurance premiums. Young people will also benefit
    significantly, as more than [3.5
    million](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/marketplace-plan-selection-by-age/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D)
    people ages 18-34 are on marketplace health care plans.
-   About 3 million more people will have coverage next year with this
    extension. Although the uninsured rate fell to [the lowest level in
    U.S.
    history](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/f2dedbf8a4274ae7065674758959567f/Uninsured-Q1-2022-Data-Point-HP-2022-23.pdf)
    in early 2022, [young people ages
    18-24](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20210921.302725/full/)
    continue to be the most likely to be uninsured.
-   By increasing access to coverage, the law will improve health
    outcomes; improve financial security by reducing medical debt and
    rent and mortgage delinquencies; and narrow racial disparities in
    health coverage and care access.

**<u>MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</u>**

President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an
unfair tax system worse. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a
critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise
revenue by:

-   Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the
    taxes they already owe.
-   Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get
    away with paying no federal income tax.
-   Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will
    encourage businesses to invest.

The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance
critically needed investments to lower costs and combat climate change,
they are also an important component of building an economy that rewards
work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away
with playing by a separate set of rules.  Millions of working families
will have better access to the benefits they are entitled to under the
tax code and be able to get their questions answered quickly and
efficiently, thanks to the law’s transformational investments in the
Internal Revenue Service. And, no family making less than $400,000 per
year will see their taxes go up by a single cent.
