  United We Stand\u201D\_Summit"

On Thursday, September 15, President Biden will host at the White House
the United We Stand Summit to counter the corrosive effects of
hate-fueled violence on our democracy and public safety, highlight the
response of the Biden-Harris Administration and communities nationwide
to these dangers, and put forward a shared vision for a more united
America.

President Biden decided to run for president after the horror of the
hate-fueled violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.
Since taking office, his Administration has consistently taken steps to
counter hate-motivated violence — from signing the bipartisan COVID-19
Hate Crimes Act, to releasing the first-ever National Strategy for
Countering Domestic Terrorism, to signing the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act, the most significant legislation in three decades to
reduce gun violence.

Even as our nation has endured a disturbing series of hate-fueled
attacks, from Oak Creek to Pittsburgh, from El Paso to Poway, from
Atlanta to Buffalo, Americans remain overwhelmingly united in their
opposition to such violence. The United We Stand Summit will bring
together heroes from across America who are leading historic work in
their communities to build bridges and address hate and division,
including survivors of hate-fueled violence. The summit will include a
bipartisan group of federal, state, and local officials, civil rights
groups, faith and community leaders, technology and business leaders,
law enforcement officials, former members of violent hate groups who now
work to prevent violence, gun violence prevention leaders, media
representatives, and cultural figures. It will feature a keynote speech
from President Biden as well as inclusive, bipartisan panels and
conversations on countering hate-fueled violence, preventing
radicalization and mobilization to violence, and fostering unity.

As President Biden said in Buffalo after the horrific mass shooting
earlier this year, in the battle for the soul of our nation “we must all
enlist in this great cause of America.” The United We Stand Summit will
present an important opportunity for Americans of all races, religions,
regions, political affiliations, and walks of life to take up that cause
together.
