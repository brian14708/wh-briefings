  \ and Science Act of\_2022"

*EO Establishes CHIPS Implementation Steering Council and Implementation
Priorities;*  
*Commerce Department Launches CHIPS.gov*

Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order to implement the
semiconductor funding in the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.
This legislation will lower the costs of goods, create high paying
manufacturing jobs around the country, and ensure we make more critical
technologies at home.  This law builds on more than a year of work from
the Biden-Harris Administration to respond to acute semiconductor
shortages and build more resilient semiconductor supply chains. The
historic funding and incentives in the CHIPS Act will help rebuild our
supply chains, manufacturing, and infrastructure here at home, along
with crucial invests from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and
Inflation Reduction Act.  
  
This Executive Order reflects the Biden-Harris Administration’s
commitment to quickly increase production of semiconductors, strengthen
research and design leadership, and grow a diverse semiconductor
workforce to give the country a competitive edge on the world stage.  
  
Additionally, to ensure transparent and effective communication about
CHIPS Act programs, the Department of Commerce launched CHIPS.gov, a
central resource for stakeholders and interested parties on the $50
billion in manufacturing and research and development funds available
through the Department of Commerce.  
  
**CHIPS Implementation Steering Council**  
  
To coordinate effective implementation of the CHIPS Act across the
Administration, the Executive Order establishes an interagency CHIPS
Implementation Steering Council. The Steering Council will be co-chaired
by National Economic Director Brian Deese, National Security Advisor
Jake Sullivan, and the Acting Director of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy, Alondra Nelson. Other members of the Steering Council
will include:  

-   Department of State, Secretary Antony Blinken
-   Department of Treasury, Secretary Janet Yellen
-   Department of Defense, Secretary Lloyd Austin
-   Department of Commerce, Secretary Gina Raimondo
-   Department of Labor, Secretary Marty Walsh
-   Department of Energy, Secretary Jennifer Granholm
-   White House Office of Management and Budget, Director Shalanda Young
-   Small Business Administration, Administrator Isabel Guzman
-   Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Director Avril
    Haines
-   White House Domestic Policy Council, Director Susan Rice
-   White House Council of Economic Advisers, Chair Cecilia Rouse
-   White House Office of the National Cyber Director, Director Chris
    Inglis
-   National Science Foundation, Director Sethuraman Panchanathan

**CHIPS Act Implementation Priorities**  
The Executive Order establishes six primary priorities to guide
implementation across the federal government:  

-   **Protect taxpayer dollars.** The CHIPS program will include
    rigorous review of applications along with robust compliance and
    accountability requirements to ensure taxpayer funds are protected
    and spent wisely.  
-   **Meet economic and national security needs.** The CHIPS program
    must address economic and national security risks by building
    domestic capacity that reduces U.S. reliance on vulnerable or overly
    concentrated foreign production for both leading-edge and mature
    microelectronics, and increasing United States economic productivity
    and competitiveness. U.S. long-term economic and national security
    requires a sustainable, competitive domestic industry.  
-   **Ensure long-term leadership in the sector.** The CHIPS program
    will establish a dynamic, collaborative network for semiconductor
    research and innovation to enable long-term U.S. leadership in the
    industries of the future. The program will support a diversity of
    technologies and applications along many stages of product and
    process development.  
-   **Strengthen and expand regional manufacturing and innovation
    clusters.** Long-term competitiveness requires large economies of
    scale and investments across the supply chain. Regional clusters
    containing manufacturing facilities, suppliers, basic and
    translational research, and workforce programs, along with
    supporting infrastructure, will be the foundation for a competitive
    industry. The CHIPS program will facilitate the expansion, creation
    and coordination of semiconductor manufacturing and innovation
    clusters that benefit many companies.   
-   **Catalyze private sector investment.** A successful CHIPS program
    will respond to market signals, fill market gaps and reduce
    investment risk to attract significant private capital. The role of
    government in the CHIPS program is to shift financial incentives to
    maximize large-scale private investment in production, break-through
    technologies, and workers. The CHIPS program will encourage new
    ecosystem partnerships that reduce risk, build on U.S. strengths,
    and facilitate such investments.   
-   **Generate benefits for a broad range of stakeholders and
    communities.** A successful CHIPS program will create benefits for
    startups, workers, socially and economically disadvantaged (SEDI)
    businesses, including minority-owned, veteran-owned and women-owned
    businesses and rural businesses, universities and colleges, and
    state and local economies, in addition to supporting semiconductor
    companies. The CHIPS program will encourage linkages to underserved
    regions and populations to draw in new participants to the
    semiconductor ecosystem. 

**CHIPS.gov**  
  
Today, the Department of Commerce launched CHIPS.gov, which will be an
essential channel through which the Department communicates with the
public about CHIPS Program initiatives. The Department of Commerce is
committed to deploying funding as swiftly as possible, while also
ensuring the time needed to perform necessary due diligence. CHIPS.gov
will be a central resource for all information related to the
implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act, and will provide
information about Departmental priorities, funding opportunities,
timelines, requirements and more as the information becomes
available.
