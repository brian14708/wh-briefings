Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan
spoke with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan hosted Israeli
National Security Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata at the White House on August
23 to consult on a broad range of global issues and issues of mutual
concern.  Mr. Sullivan underscored President Biden’s steadfast
commitment to preserve and strengthen Israel’s capability to deter its
enemies and to defend itself by itself against any threat or combination
of threats, including from Iran and Iranian-backed proxies; and our
commitment to ensure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.  Following up
on President Biden’s mid-July trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia, they
exchanged views on advancing regional integration and normalization with
the Arab world.  They discussed plans for the upcoming U.S.-Israel
Strategic High-Level Dialogue on Technology, and ways to expand and
enhance bilateral cooperation on critical and emerging technologies to
further solutions to address global challenges.  Mr. Sullivan also
stressed the need to take continued steps to improve the lives of
Palestinians, which are critical to peace, security and prosperity.
