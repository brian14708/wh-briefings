title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Senate Ratification of the NATO Accession\
  \ Protocols for Sweden and\_Finland"
---
 
Today, the Senate overwhelmingly endorsed our close partners Finland and
Sweden joining NATO. This historic vote sends an important signal of the
sustained, bipartisan U.S. commitment to NATO, and to ensuring our
Alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. I
thank the members of the Senate – especially Majority Leader Schumer,
Minority Leader McConnell, Senator Menendez and Senator Risch — for
their leadership and for quickly advancing the ratification process, the
fastest Senate process for a NATO protocol since 1981. Finland and
Sweden joining the Alliance will further strengthen NATO’s collective
security and deepen the transatlantic partnership.

As I told Prime Minister Andersson and President Niinistö when I hosted
them at the White House in May, the United States remains committed to
the security of Sweden and Finland. We will continue working to remain
vigilant against any threats to our shared security, and to deter and
confront aggression or the threat of aggression.  

I look forward to signing the accession protocols and welcoming Sweden
and Finland, two strong democracies with highly capable militaries, into
the greatest defensive alliance in history.
