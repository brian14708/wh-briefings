title: "FACT SHEET: How the Inflation Reduction Act Helps Rural\_Communities"
---
 
By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
his promise to build an economy that works for working families,
including rural families. The Inflation Reduction Act makes historic
investments in America’s future while lowering health care and energy
costs. It’s the most aggressive action we have taken to confront the
climate crisis. It’ll lower the deficit and ask the super wealthy and
corporations to pay their fair share. And no one making under $400,000
per year will pay a penny more in taxes.  
  
President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special
interests to pass this historic legislation that will build a brighter
future for rural Americans by lowering costs, invests in rural
communities to expand access to affordable clean energy and energy
efficient upgrades, and grows the economy from the bottom up and the
middle out.  
  
**LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS**  
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will build on the success of the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the American Rescue Plan (ARP) by helping
to lower health care costs, including prescription drug costs, and
expanding coverage for millions of Americans.

**Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors:** Because seniors
disproportionately choose to live in rural America, rural Americans
stand to disproportionately benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act as
it lowers prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare. Today,
Americans pay 2-3 times more for their prescription drugs than people in
other wealthy countries. The Inflation Reduction Act increases access to
medication in rural areas by improving prescription drug coverage and
lowering drug prices in Medicare. The law:

-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs
    they buy at the pharmacy at $2,000 a year, giving peace of mind to
    seniors who no longer have to worry about spending thousands and
    thousands more on prescription drugs.
-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for
    a month’s supply.
-   Means that seniors on Medicare will now have access to a number of
    additional free vaccines, including the shingles vaccine.
-   Will further lower prescription drug costs for seniors by allowing
    Medicare to negotiate the price of high-cost drugs and requiring
    drug manufacturers to pay Medicare a rebate when they raise prices
    faster than inflation.

**Lower Health Insurance Premiums and Expand Coverage:** Since the
implementation of the ACA’s coverage expansions, the uninsured rate
among rural Americans decreased by 8%, from about 24 percent in 2010 to
16 percent in 2019. The Inflation Reduction Act continues the American
Rescue Plan’s more generous Affordable Care Act premium tax credits

-   Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, 65 percent (1.3 million) of the
    1.9 million rural uninsured Americans in states using the
    HealthCare.gov had access to a $0-premium health insurance plan
    for 2021. The Inflation Reduction Act will help keep free or
    low-cost health insurance available to rural Americans, with average
    savings of about $800 per person per year. As a result, about [3
    million](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/What%20If%20the%20American%20Rescue%20Plan%20Act%20Premium%20Tax%20Credits%20Expire.pdf)
    more Americans will have health insurance coverage next year,
    compared to without the IRA.

**COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND LOWER ENERGY COSTS**  
This Inflation Reduction Act represents the single largest investment in
climate and clean energy solutions in American history. The law invests
in rural communities to expand access to affordable clean energy and
energy efficiency upgrades, create good-paying jobs through
climate-smart agriculture and conservation, and protect communities from
intensifying climate impacts like wildfires and extreme heat. Because of
this legislation, farmers, ranchers, and foresters will have the tools
they need to adopt practices that recognize the valuable role our lands
provide in tackling the climate crisis.  
  
**Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency:** The Inflation Reduction Act
boosts the long-term resiliency, reliability, and affordability of rural
electric systems, helps families save money on utility bills, and
expands rural opportunities in the clean energy economy. It provides:

-   Rural electric cooperatives, which serve 42 million customers,
    resources to advance clean energy projects, energy efficiency
    improvements, zero-emission systems, and more. And for the first
    time, these co-ops will now be eligible for direct-pay clean energy
    tax credits.
-   An expansion of USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program to support
    clean energy and energy efficiency projects for more than 41,500
    farms and small businesses.
-   Investments to advance biofuel infrastructure to help 4,600
    retailers boost domestic supplies of clean fuels. 

**Support for Farmers, Ranchers, and Forest Landowners:** The Inflation
Reduction Act recognizes the critical role that America’s farmers,
ranchers, and forest landowners play in addressing the climate crisis.
The law will:

-   Invest in helping farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners deploy
    climate-smart practices that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
    increase storage of carbon in soils and trees, and make their
    operations more productive.
-   Support innovative, cost-effective ways to measure and verify
    climate benefits, including through USDA’s Environmental Quality
    Incentives Program, Conservation Stewardship Program, Agricultural
    Conservation Easement Program, Regional Conservation Partnership
    Program, and Conservation Technical Assistance.
-   Help up to 280,000 farmers and ranchers apply conservation to
    approximately 125 million acres of land.

**Strengthening the Resilience of Rural Lands to Climate Impacts**: The
Inflation Reduction Act protects communities from the risks of wildfires
and make public and private lands more resilient in the face of climate
change. These investments will help: 

-   Protect 1.8 million acres of National Forest System Lands from
    wildfire and restore an additional 550,000 acres of federal lands.
-   Increase climate resilience of forests on 280,000 acres of
    non-federal land, support conservation easements on 475,000 private
    acres, and prepare management plans for an additional 1,500,000
    private acres.
-   Strengthen habitats and infrastructure to withstand climate-induced
    extreme weather events in our National Parks, National Wildlife
    Refuges and across our public lands.
-   Address the long-term drought conditions that are afflicting large
    swaths of rural America.  

**Supporting Energy Producing Communities**: The Inflation Reduction Act
invests in revitalizing economies of energy communities across the
country, by create good-paying, union jobs, and supporting workers in
coal, oil and gas, and power plant industries by:

-   Reinstating funding for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which
    provides payments and medical treatment to coal miners suffering
    from breathing and respiratory challenges.
-   Authorizes $250 billion in loans through the Department of Energy’s
    Loan Programs Office to retool legacy energy infrastructure like
    transmission lines, refineries and power plants for the net-zero
    economy.
-   Provides a 10% bonus tax credit for wind and solar projects that are
    developed in places that have seen a coal mine or power plant close
    or have seen employment losses as a result of contractions in the
    fossil fuel economy.
-   Delivers tax credits for clean energy manufacturing projects that
    are developed in energy communities where coal mines and power
    plants have closed with bonus credit for projects creating
    good-paying union jobs.  

**SUPPORT FARMERS AND RANCHERS**  
We need every farmer to contribute to reducing food inflation and
feeding the nation and the world. The Inflation Reduction Act will help
keep distressed farmers farming and provide assistance to farmers who
have experienced discrimination in USDA’s leading programs. The law
includes:

-   Relief for distressed USDA borrowers whose agricultural operations
    are at risk through loan modifications or payments.
-   Financial assistance to farmers who have experienced past
    discrimination in USDA lending programs.  

**MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER  
**President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made
an unfair tax system worse. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a
critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise
revenue by:

-   Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the
    taxes they already owe.
-   Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get
    away with paying no federal income tax.
-   Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will
    encourage businesses to invest.

The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance
critically needed investments to lower costs and combat climate change,
they are also an important component of building an economy that rewards
work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away
with playing by a separate set of rules.   
  
Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits
they are entitled to under the tax code and be able to get their
questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks to the Act’s
transformational investments in the Internal Revenue Service. And, no
family making less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up by
a single cent.
