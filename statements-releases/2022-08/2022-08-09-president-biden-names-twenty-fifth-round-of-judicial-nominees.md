title: "President\_Biden Names Twenty-Fifth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate two federal judicial
nominees—both of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and
devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.

For example, if confirmed, this slate would include:

-   The second woman of color to serve on the United States Court of
    Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
-   The first person of color to serve on the United States Court of
    Appeals for the Tenth Circuit from Kansas

This is President Biden’s twenty-fifth round of nominees for federal
judicial positions and his twelfth slate of nominations in 2022,
bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 134. 

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
