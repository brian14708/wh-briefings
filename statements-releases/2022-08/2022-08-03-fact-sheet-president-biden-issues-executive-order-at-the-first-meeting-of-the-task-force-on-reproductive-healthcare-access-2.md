title: "FACT SHEET:  President\_Biden Issues Executive Order at the First Meeting\
  \ of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare\_Access"
---
 
President Biden will issue an Executive Order on Securing Access to
Reproductive and Other Healthcare Services, building on actions that the
Biden-Harris Administration has taken to protect access to reproductive
healthcare services and defend women’s fundamental rights.  The
President kick off the Vice President’s first meeting of the Task Force
on Reproductive Healthcare Access. At the meeting, the Cabinet will
discuss their progress and the path forward to address the women’s
health crisis in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Dobbs v.
Jackson Women’s Health Organization.*

**EXECUTIVE ORDER ON SECURING ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE AND OTHER
HEALTHCARE SERVICES**

Through today’s Executive Order, the President will announce actions to:

-   **Support Patients Traveling Out of State for Medical Care. ** The
    Executive Order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services
    (HHS) to consider action to advance access to reproductive
    healthcare services, including through Medicaid for patients who
    travel out of state for reproductive healthcare services.  This
    directive is in line with the President and the Attorney General’s
    clear statements on the Administration’s commitment to defending the
    bedrock right to travel across state lines to seek reproductive
    healthcare in states where those services remain legal.

<!-- -->

-   **Ensure Health Care Providers Comply with Federal
    Non-Discrimination Law. ** The Executive Order directs the Secretary
    of HHS to consider all appropriate actions to ensure health care
    providers comply with Federal non-discrimination laws so that women
    receive medically necessary care without delay.  These actions could
    include providing technical assistance for health care providers who
    may be confused or unsure of their obligations in the aftermath of
    the Supreme Court decision in *Dobbs*; convening providers to convey
    information on their obligations and the potential consequences of
    non-compliance; and issuing additional guidance or taking other
    appropriate action in response to any complaints or reports of
    non-compliance with federal non-discrimination laws.

<!-- -->

-   **Promote Research and Data Collection on Maternal Health
    Outcomes. ** To accurately measure the impact that diminishing
    access to reproductive health care services has on women’s health,
    the Executive Order directs the Secretary of HHS to evaluate and
    improve research, data collection, and data analysis efforts at the
    National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention on maternal health and other health outcomes.

**INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE ACCESS**

The President will sign the Executive Order at the first meeting of the
interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access.  After the
President signs the Executive Order, Cabinet heads will report on the
progress they have made in implementing the President’s July 8, 2022
Executive Order on Protecting Access to Reproductive Healthcare
Services, as well as related actions to defend reproductive rights.

Established by Executive Order, the Task Force on Reproductive
Healthcare Access is co-chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, Xavier Becerra, and the Director of the White House Gender
Policy Council, Jennifer Klein.  The Task Force coordinates and drives
efforts across the Federal government to protect access to reproductive
healthcare services and defend reproductive rights.

Offices across the White House – including the Office of the Vice
President, the Office of White House Counsel, the Domestic Policy
Council, the National Economic Council, the National Security Council,
the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and the Office of Science and
Technology Policy –also serve on the Task Force alongside the following

**TODAY’S ANNOUNCEMENTS BUILD ON ADMINISTRATION’S ACTIONS TO PROTECT
ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE**

Today’s announcements build on the actions the Biden-Harris
Administration has already taken to protect access to healthcare,
including abortion and contraception, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s
decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization*.

President Biden continues to call on Congress to codify the right to
abortion into federal law and has
[said](https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1542525374235643904?s=20&t=QgqTYFb2BllRVnQy0xQaow)
he would support changing the filibuster rules to codify *Roe v. Wade*
into law. The White House has also released Statements of Administration

– Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022.

The Administration has also taken immediate action to:

-   **Protect Access to Reproductive Healthcare Services:** The
    President issued an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-protecting-access-to-reproductive-health-care-services/)
    outlining actions to safeguard access to reproductive health care
    services, including abortion and contraception; protect the privacy
    of patients and their access to accurate information; promote the
    safety and security of patients, providers, and clinics; and
    coordinate the implementation of Federal efforts.

<!-- -->

-   **Defend the Right to Travel:** On 6/24/22, President Biden
    [reaffirmed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-court-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/)
    the Attorney General’s
    [statement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s)
    that women must remain free to travel safely to another state to
    seek the care they need. President Biden committed his
    administration to defending “that bedrock right.” Today’s actions
    build upon this commitment and direct HHS to explore supports for
    women traveling out of state to seek medical care.

<!-- -->

-   **Protect Emergency Medical Care:** DOJ filed a lawsuit seeking to
    enjoin Idaho’s abortion prohibition, which makes abortion a crime
    even when necessary to prevent serious risks to the health of
    pregnant patients. The suit asserts that Idaho’s law conflicts with,
    and is therefore preempted by, the Emergency Medical Treatment
    Active Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires providers to offer
    stabilizing treatment, including abortion services if necessary, in
    certain emergency situations. This litigation follows
    [guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/11/following-president-bidens-executive-order-protect-access-reproductive-health-care-hhs-announces-guidance-clarify-that-emergency-medical-care-includes-abortion-services.html)
    issued by HHS affirming EMTALA’s requirements, as well as a
    [letter](https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUQs-2BN3jQcVLX1PF2KeT0WHpjKuEGg9HmpTkm0U662e5MZPUxFHTPmAUcFbW4j1MvV724tEggkjCEA2ZX3gi-2FNyPGJFj8gYazBcTjCojRcpqq8BsK2ApNp1RFmFOQsiu6fA-3D-3DCFjw_gatHLOXVnjS-2Fys-2B7qAyVd81zv1Wap8yT25fZboq0-2BiJx32YthI2zl6rLINVJW-2BIntQ2xHKXC9-2BG6LAj91HsUVwh1AxFPJdA27CeTtZ70weukMTYQr8WctKfx-2BmGuVXIt7NBdKdc5BSZ0vWWNOejTWPEy2AgckfSiYxFle46ealnje2B4V4C0QYRTkcLdfsRU56JahbxdQ2uRxCBEsIaevThQ0x69QHjdNvp4laljWEcd4M0qNQNSgcwU24FhZ1w96ALZQHFywHGvRhge-2F9zNwNaJPGFGZQxR7GEUSGFO-2FX9y-2B1RcBuCXkeyu-2BDztuqiWbfnn1up39qkzdr48HwOg9C6DCFMqDsFLHFH4tFzwcYk-3D)
    from Secretary Becerra to providers making clear that federal law
    preempts state law restricting access to abortion in emergency
    situations. 

<!-- -->

-   **Strengthen Nondiscrimination in Healthcare. ** HHS
    [announced](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/25/hhs-announces-proposed-rule-to-strengthen-nondiscrimination-in-health-care.html)
    a proposed rule to strengthen nondiscrimination in health care. The
    proposed rule implements Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and
    affirms protections consistent with President Biden’s executive
    orders on nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender
    identity.

<!-- -->

-   **Issue Guidance to Retail Pharmacies. ** HHS issued
    [guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/13/hhs-issues-guidance-nations-retail-pharmacies-response-supreme-court-decision-roe.html)
    to roughly 60,000 U.S. retail pharmacies to remind them of their
    obligations under federal civil rights laws to ensure access to
    comprehensive reproductive health care services.  The guidance makes
    clear that as recipients of federal financial assistance, pharmacies
    are prohibited under law from discriminating on the basis of race,
    color, national origin, sex, age, and disability in their programs
    and activities.  This includes supplying medications; making
    determinations regarding the suitability of a prescribed medication
    for a patient; and advising patients about medications and how to
    take them. 

<!-- -->

-   **Take Action Against Illegal Use and Sharing of Sensitive Data.
     **The Federal Trade Commission
    [committed](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/07/location-health-other-sensitive-information-ftc-committed-fully-enforcing-law-against-illegal-use)
    to fully enforcing the law against illegal use and sharing of highly
    sensitive data, including location and health information contained
    in fertility and period tracking data.  The FTC urged companies to
    consider that sensitive data is protected by numerous state and
    federal laws, claims that data is “anonymous” are often deceptive,
    and the FTC has a track record of cracking down on companies that
    misuse consumer data.

<!-- -->

-   **Protect Patient Privacy under HIPAA**.  HHS
    [issued](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/phi-reproductive-health/index.html)
    guidance to address how the HIPAA Privacy Rule protects the privacy
    of individuals’ protected health information, including information
    related to reproductive health care.  The guidance helps ensure
    doctors and other medical providers and health plans know that, with
    limited exceptions, they are not required – and in many cases, are
    not permitted – to disclose patients’ private information, including
    to law enforcement.  HHS also issued a [how-to
    guide](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/cell-phone-hipaa/index.html)
    for consumers on steps they can take to make sure they’re protecting
    their personal data on mobile apps.

<!-- -->

-   **Request Information on Data Privacy from Mobile Providers. ** The
    Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman
    [wrote](https://www.fcc.gov/document/rosenworcel-probes-mobile-carriers-data-privacy-practices)
    to the top 15 mobile providers requesting information about their
    data retention and data privacy policies and general practices,
    consistent with the President’s commitment to protecting Americans’
    privacy.

<!-- -->

-   **Launch a DOJ Reproductive Rights Task Force:** The DOJ
    [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-reproductive-rights-task-force)
    a Reproductive Rights Task Force, which will monitor and evaluate
    state and local actions that infringe on federal protections
    relating to the provision or pursuit of reproductive care, impair
    women’s ability to seek reproductive care where it’s legal, impair
    individuals’ ability to inform and counsel each other about the
    reproductive care that is available in other states, ban medication
    abortion, or impose criminal or civil liability on federal employees
    who provide legal reproductive health services.

<!-- -->

-   **Convene Attorneys to Defend Reproductive Rights. ** The Department
    of Justice and the Office of White House Counsel convened more than
    200 lawyers and advocates from private firms, bar associations,
    legal aid organizations, reproductive rights groups, and law schools
    across the country on Friday, July 29 for the first convening of
    pro-bono attorneys, as called for in the Executive Order. The
    convening closed with a call to action from the Second Gentleman,
    urging firms to commit a minimum of 500 hours to defending
    reproductive rights and justice.

<!-- -->

-   **Provide Access to Accurate Information and Legal Resources.  **HHS
    launched ReproductiveRights.gov, a
    [website](https://reproductiverights.gov/) on people’s right to
    access reproductive health care, including birth control, abortion
    services, other preventive health services, and health insurance
    coverage.  DOJ also launched justice.gov/reproductive-rights, a
    [webpage](https://www.justice.gov/reproductive-rights?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)
    that provides a centralized online resource of the Department’s work
    to protect access to reproductive healthcare services.
