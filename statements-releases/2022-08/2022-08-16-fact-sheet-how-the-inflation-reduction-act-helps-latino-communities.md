title: "FACT SHEET:  How the Inflation Reduction Act Helps Latino\_Communities"
---
 
By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
his promise to build an economy that works for working families,
including Latino communities. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers
prescription drug costs, health care costs, and energy costs. It’s the
most aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate crisis.
It’ll lower the deficit and ask the super wealthy and corporations to
pay their fair share. And no one making under $400,000 per year will pay
a penny more in taxes.

President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special
interests to pass this historic legislation to help communities of
color, including Latinos, who have been at the frontline of climate
change, by lowering costs, advancing environmental justice while
building a cleaner future, and growing the economy from the bottom up
and the middle out.

**<u>LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</u>**

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs,
including prescription drug costs, and expand health insurance coverage
for Latino families. 

**Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors:** Americans pay 2-3 times
more for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy
countries. High prices contribute to racial and ethnic health
inequities. Among adults 65 and older, Latino Medicare beneficiaries
were roughly [1.5
times](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1e2879846aa54939c56efeec9c6f96f0/prescription-drug-affordability.pdf)
as likely as White beneficiaries to have trouble affording medications,
and about [2
times](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1e2879846aa54939c56efeec9c6f96f0/prescription-drug-affordability.pdf)
as likely to not fill needed prescriptions due to cost. For example, a
recent study of shingles vaccination rates among older Americans showed
non-Latino White Americans were over [2
times](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5818280/#:~:text=data%20not%20shown).-,Shingles%20vaccination%20coverage%20among%20adults%20aged%20%E2%89%A560%20years%20was,compared%20with%20non%2DHispanic%20whites.)
as likely to have received the shingles vaccine than Latinos, due in
part to difficulty affording the shingles vaccine. The Inflation
Reduction Act will help close the gap in access to medication by
improving prescription drug coverage and lowering drug prices in
Medicare. The law:

-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs
    they buy at the pharmacy at $2,000 a year, giving peace of mind to
    seniors who no longer have to worry about spending thousands and
    thousands more on prescription drugs.
-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for
    a month’s supply.
-   Provides access to a number of additional free vaccines, including
    the shingles vaccine, for Medicare beneficiaries.
-   Will further lower prescription drug costs for seniors by allowing
    Medicare to negotiate the price of high-cost drugs and requiring
    drug manufacturers to pay Medicare a rebate when they raise prices
    faster than inflation.

**Lower Health Insurance Premiums and Expand Coverage:** Since the
implementation of the ACA’s coverage expansions, the uninsured rate
among Latinos decreased by 11 percentage points, from 30 percent in 2013
to a low of 19 percent in 2017. Despite that progress, almost [10.9
million Hispanic
people](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/)
were uninsured in 2019 before President Biden took office and [640,000
Latinos](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/taking-a-closer-look-at-characteristics-of-people-in-the-coverage-gap/)
fell into the “coverage gap” and were locked out of coverage because
their state refused to expand Medicaid. Since President Biden took
office, the uninsured rate has reached a new historic law: 8% and 5.2
million of Americans have gained health insurance coverage. The
Inflation Reduction Act continues the American Rescue Plan’s more
generous Affordable Care Act premium tax credits.

-   The Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower monthly premiums – 80
    percent of uninsured Latinos had access to a plan for $50 or less
    each month and 69 percent could find a plan for $0 a month in 2021.
-   By continuing the improvements made through ARP, the Inflation
    Reduction Act will help keep free or low-cost health insurance
    available. [Nearly
    700,000](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/What%20If%20the%20American%20Rescue%20Plan%20Act%20Premium%20Tax%20Credits%20Expire.pdf)
    Latinos will have health insurance coverage next year, compared to
    without the IRA.

**<u>COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND LOWER ENERGY COSTS</u>**

The Inflation Reduction Act takes the most aggressive action on climate
and clean energy in American history. The legislation will bring down
energy costs for families and create thousands of good jobs, all while
reducing climate pollution and ensuring that we have a clean, secure
future energy supply. It will:

**Make Home Efficiency Upgrades More Affordable:** The Inflation
Reduction Act will make it more affordable for families to purchase
energy efficient and electric appliances when they need to replace
everyday home appliances and equipment. And, these appliances will save
families money on their utility bills in the long run. 

-   When families need to replace air conditioners, water heaters, or
    furnaces, they can save up to 30% with tax credits for efficient
    heating and cooling equipment that will save them hundreds of
    dollars on utility bills.
-   Households can save up to 30% with tax credits for home construction
    projects on windows, doors, insulation, or other weatherization
    measures that prevent energy from escaping homes.
-   If families need to replace or upgrade stoves, ovens, or other home
    appliances, they can receive direct rebates when buying more energy
    efficient and electric appliances that can lower future utility bill
    by at least $350 [per year](https://resstock.nrel.gov/factsheets/).
-   Families in affordable housing units will benefit from resources to
    support projects that boost efficiency, improve indoor air quality,
    make clean energy or electrification upgrades, or strengthen their
    climate resilience.
-   Overall, families that take advantage of clean energy tax credits
    can save more than $1,000 per year.

**Create Economic Opportunities and Jobs:** The Inflation Reduction Act
creates economic opportunities and jobs that will reach all Americans as
it:

-   Spurs solar project development in environmental justice communities
    by providing a 20% bonus credit for solar projects on
    federally-subsidized affordable housing projects and a 10% bonus
    credit for solar projects in low-income communities.
-   Creates a new Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator that will
    seed state and local clean energy financing institutions, support
    the deployment of distributed zero-emission technologies like
    heat-pumps, community solar and EV charging, while prioritizing over
    50% of its investments in disadvantaged communities.
-   Expands clean energy tax credits for wind, solar, nuclear, clean
    hydrogen, clean fuels and carbon capture include bonus credit for
    businesses that pay workers a prevailing wage and hire using
    registered apprenticeship programs – so that the clean energy we use
    create good paying jobs.

**Protect Public Health:** The Inflation Reduction Act recognizes that
climate change disproportionately impacts low-income communities and
communities of color. The law:

-   Creates Environmental Justice Block Grants, and a dedicated program
    to tackle pollution in port communities – where air pollution is
    especially dense and deadly.
-   Funds a range of programs to reduce air pollution, including for
    fenceline monitoring and screening near industrial facilities, air
    quality sensors in disadvantaged communities, new and upgraded
    multipollutant monitoring sites, and monitoring and mitigation of
    methane and wood heater emissions.
-   Protects our children with investments to monitor and reduce at
    public schools in disadvantaged communities.

**Strengthen Resilience to Climate Change:** The Inflation Reduction Act
bolsters climate resilience, and strengthens the Nation’s infrastructure
and economy against natural disaster and extreme weather events by:

-    Upgrading affordable housing with HUD funding to reinforce homes
    against climate impacts, and increase water and energy efficiency.
-   Expanding USDA’s Urban and Community Forestry Program with
    tree-planting projects that help cool neighborhoods, with a priority
    for projects that benefit underserved communities.
-   Advancing transportation equity and resilience with a new
    Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant program to improve walkability,
    safety, and affordability, including projects to protect against
    extreme heat, flooding, and other impacts.

**Lower Costs for Small Businesses**: The Inflation Reduction Act
includes a number of provisions that will save small business owners
money.

-   Small businesses can deduct up to $1.00 per square foot of their
    business for making high energy efficiency upgrades. The per square
    foot deduction is boosted if the efficiency upgrades are completed
    by workers who are a paid a prevailing wage – helping businesses
    save money and provide good paying jobs.

**<u>MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</u>**

President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an
unfair tax system worse. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a
critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise
revenue by:

-   Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the
    taxes they already owe.
-   Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get
    away with paying no federal income tax.
-   Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will
    encourage businesses to invest.

The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance
critically needed investments to lower costs and combat climate change,
they are also an important component of building an economy that rewards
work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away
with playing by a separate set of rules. 

Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits
they are entitled to under the tax code and be able to get their
questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks to the Act’s
transformational investments in the Internal Revenue Service. And, no
family making less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up by
a single cent.
