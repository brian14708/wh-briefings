title: "BY THE NUMBERS: The Inflation Reduction\_Act"
---
 
The Inflation Reduction Act will lower costs for families, combat the
climate crisis, reduce the deficit, and finally ask the largest
corporations to pay their fair share. President Biden and Congressional
Democrats have worked together to deliver a historic legislative
achievement that defeats special interests, delivers for American
families, and grows the economy from the bottom up and middle out.  
  
*Here’s how the Inflation Reduction Act impacts Americans by the
numbers:*  
  
**<u>HEALTH CARE</u>**  
  
***Cutting Prescription Drug Cost***

-   Today, Americans pay **two to three** times what citizens of other
    countries pay for prescription drugs

    drug costs go down because of the provision allowing Medicare to
    negotiate prescription drug costs.
-   **50 million** Americans with Medicare Part D will have the peace of
    mind knowing their costs at the pharmacy are capped at **$2,000**
    per year, directly benefiting about **1.4 million** beneficiaries
    each year.
-   **3.3 million** Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes will benefit
    from a guarantee that their insulin costs are capped at $35 for a
    month’s supply.

***Lowering Health Care Costs***

-   **13 million** Americans will continue to save an average of
    **$800** per year on health insurance premiums
-   **3 million** more Americans will have health insurance than without
    the law.
-   The uninsured rate is at an all-time low of 8%, which the historic
    law will build on.

***Defeating Special Interests***

-   **$187 million:** The

    [trying](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/us/politics/drug-prices-democrats.html)
    to lower prescription drug costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate
    drug prices.
-   **19 years:** number of years Medicare has been blocked from
    negotiating prescription drug costs

**<u>CLEAN ENERGY</u>**  
  
***Lowering Energy Costs***

    tax credits will save more than **$1,000** per year.
-   **$14,000** in direct consumer rebates for families to buy heat
    pumps or other energy efficient home appliances, saving families at
    least **$350** [per year](https://resstock.nrel.gov/factsheets/).

    roofs with a **30%** tax credit,

    other single piece of legislation ever enacted.

    to [avoid up
    to](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modeling-the-Inflation-Reduction-Act-with-the-US-Energy-Policy-Simulator_August.pdf)

    annually by 2030.

**<u>TAXES</u>**
