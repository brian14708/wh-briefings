President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine. He congratulated Ukraine on its Independence Day
and expressed his admiration for the people of Ukraine, who have
inspired the world as they defended their country’s sovereignty over the
past six months. He reaffirmed the United States’ continued support for
Ukraine and provided an update on the ongoing provision of security
assistance, including yesterday’s announcement of nearly $3 billion to
support Ukraine’s defense capabilities for the long term. The two
leaders also called for Russia to return full control of the
*Zaporizhzhya* Nuclear Power Plant to Ukraine and for International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to the plant.
