  \ on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\_Weapons"

Today, as the world gathers for the Tenth Review Conference for the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the United
States renews its commitment to the world to be a responsible steward of
its nuclear arsenal, and to continue working toward the ultimate goal of
a world without nuclear weapons. That commitment is why the United
States joined together with the other Nuclear Weapons States in January
to affirmatively state our shared belief that a nuclear war cannot be
won and must never be fought, and it is why my administration has
prioritized reducing the role of nuclear weapons in our national
security strategy.  
   
I’ve worked on arms control from the earliest days of my career, and the
health of the NPT has always rested on meaningful, reciprocal arms
limits between the United States and Russian Federation. Even at the
height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were able
to work together to uphold our shared responsibility to ensure strategic
stability. Today, my Administration is ready to expeditiously negotiate
a new arms control framework to replace New START when it expires in
2026. But negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good
faith. And Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression in Ukraine has
shattered peace in Europe and constitutes an attack on fundamental
tenets of international order. In this context, Russia should
demonstrate that it is ready to resume work on nuclear arms control with
the United States. China also has a responsibility as an NPT nuclear
weapons state and a member of the P5 to engage in talks that will reduce
the risk of miscalculation and address destabilizing military dynamics.
There is no benefit to any of our nations, or for the world, to resist
substantive engagement on arms control and nuclear non-proliferation.  
   
The United States is determined to lead by the power of our example.
 Through diplomacy – in coordination with our Allies and regional
partners – we have developed a proposal to secure a mutual return to
full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to ensure
that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. We are working closely with
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure the AUKUS
partnership among Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States
meets the highest nonproliferation standards. And we are re-establishing
our leadership in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, including seeking
to establish the IAEA Additional Protocol as a universal standard for
both international safeguards and for nuclear supply arrangements, and
continuing our efforts to limit the spread of sensitive enrichment and
reprocessing technology.  
   
In this moment of uncertainty and upheaval on the global stage,
reaffirming our shared commitment to the grounding principles of the
global nonproliferation regime has never been more crucial. The world
can be confident that my Administration will continue to support the NPT
and seek to strengthen the nonproliferation architecture that protects
people everywhere.
