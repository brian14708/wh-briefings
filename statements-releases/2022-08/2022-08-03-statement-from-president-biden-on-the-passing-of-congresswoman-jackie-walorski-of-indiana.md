title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Passing of Congresswoman Jackie Walorski\
  \ of\_Indiana"

Jill and I are shocked and saddened by the death of Congresswoman Jackie
Walorski of Indiana along with two members of her staff in a car
accident today in Indiana.  
  
Born in her beloved South Bend as the daughter of a meat-cutter and
firefighter, she spent a lifetime serving the community that she grew up
in – as a journalist, a nonprofit director, a state legislator, and
eventually as a Member of Congress for the past nine and half years.

We may have represented different parties and disagreed on many issues,
but she was respected by members of both parties for her work on the
House Ways and Means Committee on which she served. She also served as
co-chair of the House Hunger Caucus, and my team and I appreciated her
partnership as we plan for a historic White House Conference on Hunger,
Nutrition, and Health this fall that will be marked by her deep care for
the needs of rural America.

We send our deepest condolences to her husband, Dean, to the families of
her staff members, Zachery Potts and Emma Thomson, who lost their lives
in public service, and to the people of Indiana’s Second District who
lost a representative who was one of their own.
