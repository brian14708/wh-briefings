title: "President\_Biden Announces Nineteenth Operation Fly Formula\_Mission"

*Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of 4.3 million
8-ounce bottle equivalents of Danone’s Aptamil Gold Plus Stage 1infant
formula on August 8 and 11*

Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
two flights, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Danone’s Aptamil
Gold Plus Stage 1 infant formula from New Zealand to Chicago, Illinois
on August 8 and 11. These deliveries will include approximately 332,000
pounds of Aptamil Gold Plus Stage 1, the equivalent of 4.3 million
8-ounce bottles. These products will be distributed through top
retailers nationwide.  
  
In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency
is exercising enforcement discretion so that Danone can import
additional infant formula, including Neocate Infant DHA/ARA, Aptamil
First Infant Milk Stage 1, and Aptamil Gold Plus Stage 1. Danone is in
the process of importing approximately 38 million 8-ounce bottle
equivalents into the U.S. market, which also includes their Aptamil baby
formula from Ireland and New Zealand.  
  
President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S.
health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves, hospitals
and home health care providers faster. To date, Operation Fly Formula
has transported nearly 64 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the
U.S.  
  
In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
at whitehouse.gov/formula.
