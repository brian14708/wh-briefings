title: "FACT SHEET: U.S. STRATEGY TOWARD SUB-SAHARAN\_AFRICA"

*[Read the full strategy
here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/U.S.-Strategy-Toward-Sub-Saharan-Africa-FINAL.pdf)*

Sub-Saharan Africa plays a critical role in advancing global priorities
to the benefit of Africans and Americans.   It has one of the world’s
fastest growing populations, largest free trade areas, most diverse
ecosystems, and one of the largest regional voting groups in the United
Nations (UN).  It is impossible to meet today’s defining challenges
without African contributions and leadership.  The region will factor
prominently in efforts to: end the COVID-19 pandemic; tackle the climate
crisis; reverse the global tide of democratic backsliding; address
global food insecurity; promote gender equity and equality; strengthen
an open and stable international system; shape the rules of the world on
vital issues like trade, cyber, and emerging technologies; and confront
the threat of terrorism, conflict, and transnational crime.  

Building on the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions and commitments to
deepen our engagement and partnerships in Africa during the past year,
the strategy articulates our new vision for a 21st Century U.S.-African
Partnership.  It recognizes the tremendous, positive opportunities that
exist to advance shared interests alongside our African partners.  At
the same time, we acknowledge that Africa’s potential will continue to
be challenged as long as deadly conflicts divide societies, corruption
impedes economic progress, food insecurity heightens the risk of famine
and malnutrition, and repression stifles human rights and democratic
expression.  As President Biden noted in his address to the African
Union last year, “none of this is going to be easy but the United States
stands ready now to be your partner, in solidarity, support, and mutual
respect.”

The new U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa represents a reframing
of Africa’s importance to U.S. national security interests.  We will
pursue four main objectives in sub-Saharan Africa:

1\. FOSTER OPENNESS AND OPEN SOCIETIES    
  
The United States has an abiding interest in ensuring the region remains
open and accessible to all and that governments and publics are able to
make their own political choices, consistent with international
obligations.  Open societies are generally more inclined to work in
common cause with the United States, attract greater U.S. trade and
investment, pursue policies to improve conditions for their citizens,
and counter harmful activities by the People’s Republic of China,
Russia, and other actors.  We will foster openness and open societies,
including by:

-   *Promoting government transparency and accountability*
-   *Increasing our focus on rule of law, justice, and dignity*
-   *Assisting African countries to more transparently leverage their
    natural resources for sustainable development*

2\. DELIVER DEMOCRATIC AND SECURITY DIVIDENDS

The region’s commitment and capacity to renew its democracies, as well
as anticipate, prevent, and address emerging and long running conflicts,
can lead to more favorable outcomes for Africans and Americans.  By
simultaneously addressing these challenges and reaffirming that
democracy delivers tangible benefits, the United States can offer
positive choices to Africans as they determine their own future.  We
will help Africa deliver democratic and security dividends, including
by:

-   *Working with allies and regional partners to stem the recent tide
    of authoritarianism and military takeovers*
-   *Backing civil society, empowering marginalized groups, centering
    the voices of women and youth, and defending free and fair
    elections*
-   *Improving the capacity of African partners to advance regional
    stability and security*
-   *Reducing the threat from terrorist groups to the U.S. Homeland,
    persons, and diplomatic and military facilities*

3\. ADVANCE PANDEMIC RECOVERY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY  
  
It is essential to address two of the region’s most pressing problems:
the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant economic and social
consequences.  These challenges have been compounded by supply chain
problems and food insecurity stemming from Russia’s war of aggression in
Ukraine.  The United States is committed to working with regional
governments and international partners to build more stable and
inclusive African economies.  We will advance pandemic recovery and
economic opportunity, including by:

-   *Prioritizing policies and programs to end the acute phase of the
    COVID-19 pandemic and build capacities to increase preparedness for
    the next health threat*
-   *Supporting manufacturing initiatives for vaccines and other medical
    countermeasures*
-   *Promoting a stronger growth trajectory and debt sustainability to
    support the region’s economic recovery, including through the
    Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), Prosper
    Africa, Power Africa, Feed the Future, and a new initiative for
    digital transformation*
-   *Partnering with African countries to rebuild human capital and food
    systems that were further weakened by the pandemic and Russia’s war
    against Ukraine*

4\. SUPPORT CONSERVATION, CLIMATE ADAPTATION, AND A JUST ENERGY
TRANSITION  
  
Africa’s efforts to conserve and restore the continent’s ecosystems and
rich natural resources— while also realizing energy access and energy
security goals, diversifying its energy mix, and building sustainable
supply chains—are central to tackling the global climate crisis. 
Although the region is responsible for extremely low emissions per
capita, it stands to suffer from some of the most severe effects of
climate change.  We will support conservation, climate adaptation, and a
just energy transition, including by:

-   *Partnering with governments, civil society, and local communities
    to conserve, manage, and restore the continent’s rich natural
    ecosystems*
-   *Supporting countries in their efforts to minimize and adapt to the
    impacts of a changing climate, including enhancing community,
    economic, and supply chain resilience *
-   *Working closely with countries to accelerate their just transitions
    to a clean energy future, energy access, and energy security*
-   *Pursuing public-private partnerships to sustainably develop and
    secure the critical minerals that will supply clean energy
    technologies*
