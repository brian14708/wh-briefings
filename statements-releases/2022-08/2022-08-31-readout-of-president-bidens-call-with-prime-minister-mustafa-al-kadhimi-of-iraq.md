President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke today with Prime Minister Mustafa
Al-Kadhimi of Iraq to discuss U.S. support for a sovereign and
independent Iraq.  The President commended Prime Minister Kadhimi’s
personal leadership during escalating tensions and violence over a
24-hour period earlier this week.  He praised the performance of the
Iraqi Security Forces and extended condolences to the families of those
killed in the recent fighting.  The President and the Prime Minister
welcomed the return of security to the streets, and called on all Iraqi
leaders to engage in a national dialogue to forge a common way forward
consistent with Iraq’s constitution and laws. The President finally
offered his full support for Prime Minster Kadhimi’s efforts to
de-escalate tensions in the region through dialogue and diplomacy. The
two leaders agreed to remain in touch over the coming weeks.
