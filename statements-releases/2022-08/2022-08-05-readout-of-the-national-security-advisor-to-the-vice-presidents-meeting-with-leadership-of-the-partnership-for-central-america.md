National Security Advisor to the Vice President Dr. Phil Gordon hosted a
meeting today with Partnership for Central America (PCA) leaders Ajay
Banga and Ray Chambers, CEOs from companies that have responded to the
Vice President’s Call to Action for Northern Central America, and a team
of senior U.S. government officials to chart the path forward on
mobilizing investments to address the root causes of migration. As
follow-up to the Vice President’s engagements at the Summit of the
Americas in Los Angeles, where she announced that the Call to Action has
galvanized more than $3.2 billion in private sector investments to
promote economic opportunity for people in northern Central America, Dr.
Gordon and PCA leadership explored ways to elevate collaboration under
this public-private partnership to foster an ecosystem of opportunity
for people in the region.  The meeting participants agreed to leverage
this partnership to advance broader priorities under the U.S. Strategy
to Address the Root Causes of Migration, including combatting
corruption, promoting respect for human rights and labor rights, and the
rule of law. They also discussed the importance of promoting
opportunities for women and upholding social responsibility in advancing
the root causes strategy and helping the people of the region.
