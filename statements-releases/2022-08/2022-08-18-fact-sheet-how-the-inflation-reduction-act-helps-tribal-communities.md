title: "FACT SHEET: How the Inflation Reduction Act Helps Tribal\_Communities"
---
 
By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
his promise to meet the climate crisis and build an economy that works
for working families, including Tribal nations and American Indian,
Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian families. The Inflation Reduction Act
lowers prescription drug costs, health care costs, and energy costs.
It’s the most aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate
crisis. It’ll lower the deficit and ask the super wealthy and
corporations to pay their fair share. And no one making under $400,000
per year will pay a penny more in taxes.  
  
President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special
interests to pass this historic legislation that includes significant
Tribal-specific provisions, and otherwise helps American Indian, Alaska
Native, and Native Hawaiian communities who have been at the frontline
of climate change, by lowering costs, advancing environmental justice
while building a cleaner future, and growing the economy from the bottom
up and the middle out.  
  
**<u>TRIBAL-SPECIFIC FUNDING</u>**  
  
The Inflation Reduction Act takes the most aggressive action on climate
and clean energy in American history. And it does so by providing
funding specifically for Tribes to plan for and adapt to climate change,
mitigate drought, support fisheries, and shift to clean energy
production and use.  
  
**Support climate resilience and adaptation in Tribal nations and Native
communities.** The Inflation Reduction Act includes Tribal-specific
funding to address climate-related impacts in Native communities,
including investments that support:

-   Tribal climate resilience and adaptation programs at the Bureau of
    Indian Affairs (BIA);
-   Climate resilience and adaptation activities for the Native Hawaiian
    community;
-   Mitigating drought impacts in Tribal communities; and
-   Tribal fish hatchery operations and maintenance programs.

**Fund a** **Tribal electrification program.** The Inflation Reduction
Act includes investments for a Tribal Electrification Program for Tribes
and Tribal organizations to provide electricity to unelectrified Tribal
homes through zero-emission energy systems, and to transition
electrified homes to zero-emission energy systems.  
  
**Support Tribal energy development.** The Inflation Reduction Act
provides additional investments for the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee
Program, and increases loan guarantees for Tribal energy development
from $2 billion to $20 billion.  
  
**<u>COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND LOWER ENERGY COSTS</u>**  
  
In addition to its Tribal-specific funding, the Inflation Reduction Act
will bring down energy costs for families and create thousands of good
jobs, all while reducing climate pollution and ensuring that we have a
clean, secure future energy supply. It will:  
  
**Reduce Pollution:** The law will eliminate about a billion tons of
greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 and position America to meet President
Biden’s climate goals of cutting emissions in half or more by 2030 and
reaching net-zero by no later than 2050.  
  
**Advance Environmental Justice: **Climate change disproportionately
impacts low-income communities and communities of color. The Act will
work to alleviate legacy pollution and to ensure that clean energy
opportunities reach all Americans, including through new Environmental
Justice Block Grants—which will support community-led projects across
the country.  
  
**Make Home Efficiency Upgrades More Affordable:** The Inflation
Reduction Act will make it more affordable for families to purchase
energy efficient and electric appliances when they need to replace
everyday home appliances and equipment. And, these appliances will save
families money on their utility bills in the long run. 

-   When families need to replace air conditioners, water heaters, or
    furnaces, they can save up to 30% with tax credits for efficient
    heating and cooling equipment that will save them hundreds of
    dollars on utility bills.

<!-- -->

-   Households can save up to 30% with tax credits for home construction
    projects on windows, doors, insulation, or other weatherization
    measures that prevent energy from escaping homes.
-   If families need to replace or upgrade stoves, ovens, or other home
    appliances, they can receive direct rebates when buying more energy
    efficient and electric appliances that can lower future utility bill
    by at least $350 [per year](https://resstock.nrel.gov/factsheets/).
-   Families in affordable housing units will benefit from resources to
    support projects that boost efficiency, improve indoor air quality,
    make clean energy or electrification upgrades, or strengthen their
    climate resilience.
-   Overall, families that take advantage of clean energy tax credits
    can save more than $1,000 per year.

**Support Farmers, Ranchers, and Forest Landowners:** The Inflation
Reduction Act recognizes the critical role that America’s farmers,
ranchers, and forest landowners play in the addressing the climate
crisis. The law will:

-   Help farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners deploy climate-smart
    practices that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase
    storage of carbon in soils and trees, and make their operations more
    productive.
-   Support innovative, cost-effective ways to measure and verify
    climate benefits, including through USDA’s Environmental Quality
    Incentives Program, Conservation Stewardship Program, Agricultural
    Conservation Easement Program, Regional Conservation Partnership
    Program, and Conservation Technical Assistance.
-   Help up to 280,000 farmers and ranchers apply conservation to
    approximately 125 million acres of land.

**Strengthen the Resilience of Rural Lands to Climate Impacts**: The
Inflation Reduction Act protects communities from the risks of wildfires
and make public and private lands more resilient in the face of climate
change. These investments will help: 

-   Protect 1.8 million acres of National Forest System Lands from
    wildfire and restore an additional 550,000 acres of federal lands.
-   Increase climate resilience of forests on 280,000 acres of
    non-federal land, support conservation easements on 475,000 private
    acres, and prepare management plans for an additional 1,500,000
    private acres.
-   Strengthen habitats and infrastructure to withstand climate-induced
    extreme weather events in our National Parks, National Wildlife
    Refuges and across our public lands.

**<u>LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</u>**  
The Inflation Reduction Act will lower health care costs, including
prescription drug costs, and expand health insurance coverage for
American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian families.   
  
**Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors:** Americans pay 2-3 times
more for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy
countries. The Inflation Reduction Act increases access to medication in
Tribal communities, especially for Tribal elders, by improving
prescription drug coverage and lowering drug prices in Medicare. The
law:

-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs
    they buy at the pharmacy at $2,000 a year, giving peace of mind to
    seniors who no longer have to worry about spending thousands and
    thousands more on prescription drugs.
-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for
    a month’s supply.
-   Means that seniors on Medicare will now have access to a number of
    additional free vaccines, including the shingles vaccine.
-   Will further lower prescription drug costs for seniors by allowing
    Medicare to negotiate the price of high-cost drugs and requiring
    drug manufacturers to pay Medicare a rebate when they raise prices
    faster than inflation.

**Lowering Health Insurance Premiums and Expanding Coverage:** Almost
[half a million
AI/A](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/)Ns
were uninsured in 2019 before President Biden took office and [over
130,000](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/taking-a-closer-look-at-characteristics-of-people-in-the-coverage-gap/)
 AI/ANs fell into the Medicaid “coverage gap” and were locked out of
coverage because their state refused to expand Medicaid. Since President
Biden took office, the uninsured rate has reached a new historic low: 8%
and over [5 million
Americans](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15c1f9899b3f203887deba90e3005f5a/Uninsured-Q1-2022-Data-Point-HP-2022-23-08.pdf)
have gained health insurance coverage. The Inflation Reduction Act
continues the American Rescue Plan’s more generous Affordable Care Act
premium tax credits.

-   The Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower monthly premiums – about
    [26,000
    uninsured](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/aspe-aian-health-insurance-coverage-ib.pdf)
    AI/ANs had access to a $0-premium plan in 2021.
-   By continuing the improvements made through ARP, the Inflation
    Reduction Act will help keep free or low-cost health insurance
    available. About
    [60,000](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/What%20If%20the%20American%20Rescue%20Plan%20Act%20Premium%20Tax%20Credits%20Expire.pdf)
    more AI/ANs will have health insurance coverage next year, compared
    to without the IRA.

**<u>MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</u>**  
President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an
unfair tax system worse. The Inflation Reduction Act is a critical step
forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise revenue by:  

-   Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the
    taxes they already owe.
-   Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get
    away with paying no federal income tax.
-   Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will
    encourage businesses to invest.

The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance
critically needed investments to lower costs and combat climate change,
they are also an important component of building an economy that rewards
work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away
with playing by a separate set of rules.   
  
Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits
they are entitled to under the tax code and be able to get their
questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks to the Act’s
transformational investments in the Internal Revenue Service. And, no
family making less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up by
a single cent.
