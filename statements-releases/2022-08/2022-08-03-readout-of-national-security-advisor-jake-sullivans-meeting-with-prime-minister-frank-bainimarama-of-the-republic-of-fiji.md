National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Prime Minister
Frank Bainimarama of the Republic of Fiji at the White House to discuss
our bilateral relationship and how we can continue to deepen cooperation
across the Pacific region. They emphasized the need for the U.S. and
Fiji to work in close partnership with each other and to address the
foremost opportunities and challenges for the Pacific, including climate
change; illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; and economic
development by advancing the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to benefit
our two countries, the Pacific Islands, and the Indo-Pacific. They also
reaffirmed the long-lasting historical, cultural, and people to people
ties between our nations as the foundation of our strong partnership now
and into the future.
