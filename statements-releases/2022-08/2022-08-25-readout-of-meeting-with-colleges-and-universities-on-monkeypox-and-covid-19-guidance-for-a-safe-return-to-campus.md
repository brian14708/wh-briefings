  19 Guidance for a Safe Return to\_Campus"
---
 
Yesterday, members of the White House Monkeypox and COVID-19 response
teams, as well as representatives from the CDC, met virtually with
college presidents, campus health officials, and student affairs
professionals from across the country to discuss best practices and
measures for colleges and universities to take to curb the spread of
Monkeypox and COVID-19. The virtual meeting included over 1,000
stakeholders from the higher education community, with additional
participation via livestream. Federal officials offered practical
guidance on how to keep higher education institutions safe this fall,
including strategies colleges can use to identify and stop the spread of
Monkeypox, and answered questions on how to respond to incidents of
Monkeypox and communicate clearly to students on vaccines, testing, and
treatments. The discussion also focused on the need for colleges and
universities to encourage students, staff, and faculty to remain up to
date on their COVID-19 vaccines, including planning to get campus
communities boosted with the upcoming, updated vaccines this fall,
pending FDA and CDC decisions. Today, the CDC also launched a new

Monkeypox.
