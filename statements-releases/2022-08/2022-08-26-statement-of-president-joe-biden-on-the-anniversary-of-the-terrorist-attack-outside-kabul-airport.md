title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Anniversary of the Terrorist Attack\
  \ Outside Kabul\_Airport"

One year ago, 13 proud and patriotic American service members, as well
as more than 100 innocent Afghan civilians, were killed in a heinous
terrorist attack at Abbey Gate outside the Kabul Airport. Many more were
injured and will carry the impact of their wounds and experiences for
the rest of their lives.  
   
Our nation will forever mourn their sacrifice and honor the memory of
those 13 precious souls, stolen from their families, loved ones,
brothers- and sisters-in-arms far too soon while performing a noble
mission on behalf of our Nation:  
Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover;  
Marine Corps Sgt. Johanny Rosario;  
Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee;  
Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez;  
Marine Corps Cpl. Daegan W. Page;  
Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez;  
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. David L. Espinoza;  
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz;  
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee J. McCollum;  
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Dylan R. Merola;  
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui;  
Navy Petty Officer Third Class Maxton W. Soviak; and  
Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss.  
   
They were beloved sons and daughters, brothers and sisters. They came
from all across our land. Each carried with them the pride of their own
unique story and the hopes of the loved ones who nurtured them. But they
were united by a common call—to serve something greater than themselves.
They were heroes, working to save lives as part of the largest airlift
evacuation operation in our history. The example of their bravery and
selflessness will live forever as a testament to the very best of our
American character.  
   
In the wake of the horrific attack outside Kabul airport, we have
redoubled our relentless global campaign against ISIS and other
terrorists who threaten Americans. In February, we took out the global
head of ISIS in Syria, and last month, in Kabul, we eliminated the
leader of al-Qaeda.  We now maintain pressure against terrorist threats
without keeping thousands of troops in harm’s way on the ground in
Afghanistan. And my Administration will continue to hunt down terrorists
who seek to harm the United States, wherever they may be.  
   
Today, I am praying for the families of those 13 fallen warriors, who
lost a piece of their soul one year ago. Our nation can never repay such
incredible sacrifice—but we will never fail to honor our sacred
obligation to the families and survivors they left behind. I am also
holding in my heart all those who lost their child, partner, parent,
sibling, loved one, or battle buddy over our two decades of war in
Afghanistan. 2,461 American troops made the ultimate sacrifice. 20,744
were wounded, so many whose lives are forever marked by their injuries.
It is a painful reminder that there is nothing low-cost or low-grade
about war for those we ask to fight for us.  
   
I am grateful to all the members of our Armed Forces, veterans, and
their families, as well as the diplomats, intelligence professionals,
counterterrorism experts, and development specialists who served in
Afghanistan and who sacrificed so much to make our nation stronger and
safer.
