title: "President\_Biden Intends to Appoint Dr. Monica Bertagnolli as Director of\
  \ the National Cancer\_Institute"
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to appoint Dr. Monica
Bertagnolli as the 16<sup>th</sup>  – and first woman – Director of the
National Cancer Institute (NCI). President Biden’s announcement comes
before he signs the bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson
Honoring our Promises to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of
2022, which expands VA health care and benefits for toxic exposed
veterans facing illnesses like cancer.

Dr. Bertagnolli joins NCI at a time of renewed attention to the Cancer
Moonshot, one of President Biden’s signature initiatives – reignited in
February with bold new goals to reduce the cancer death rate by at least
50 percent in the United States over the next 25 years and create a more
supportive experience for patients and families. Dr. Bertagnolli lends
to this effort one of the most powerful voices in the country for cancer
patients, particularly for those in rural and remote communities, with a
history of advancing patient-focused programs that incorporate learnings
directly from patient experiences to build more inclusive models of
care.

“I look forward to working with Dr. Bertagnolli to advance the
President’s call to end cancer as we know it. Dr. Bertagnolli’s decades
of cancer research expertise around patient-centered care and her work
to create more inclusive clinical trials will be instrumental as we
accelerate the rate of research and innovation to fight cancer,” said
Secretary Xavier Becerra, U.S. Health and Human Services. “Cancer knows
no bounds and neither should our efforts to prevent cancer deaths.
Together, we will reignite and advance the President’s Cancer Moonshot
initiative to save lives.”
