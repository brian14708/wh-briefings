title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Ten-Year Anniversary of Austin Tice\u2019\
  s\_Captivity"
---
 
This week marks a decade since American Austin Tice was abducted in
Damascus, Syria.  Austin served in the United States Marine Corps.  He
is a son, he is a brother, and he is an investigative journalist who put
the truth above himself and traveled to Syria to show the world the real
cost of war.  We know with certainty that he has been held by the
Government of Syria.

We have repeatedly asked the government of Syria to work with us so that
we can bring Austin home.  On the tenth anniversary of his abduction, I
am calling on Syria to end this and help us bring him home.  There is no
higher priority in my Administration than the recovery and return of
Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad.  We must name
them, keep them in our hearts and our minds, and make their recovery and
return a priority.  That is a pledge I have made to the American people
and to Austin’s parents, and it is one that I am determined to uphold.

The Tice family deserves answers, and more importantly, they deserve to
be swiftly reunited with Austin.  We stand with Austin’s many loved
ones, and we will not rest until we bring Austin home.  Ten years is
far, far too long.  So is every additional day.
