title: "STATE FACT SHEETS: How the Inflation Reduction Act Lowers Health Care Costs\
  \ Across\_America"
---
 
Today, the White House released state fact sheets that highlight how the
Inflation Reduction Act lowers health care costs for Americans
nationwide. The fact sheets highlight how millions of Americans across
all 50 states and the District of Columbia will benefit from Medicare
finally having the power to negotiate prescription drug prices, will
gain peace of mind from knowing that their out-of-pocket prescription
drug costs are capped at $2,000 annually in Medicare, and will save
hundreds of dollars per year on health insurance premiums because of the
law. 

After three decades of attempts, the Inflation Reduction Act takes on
one of the most powerful special interests in history – the
pharmaceutical lobby – to deliver cost savings directly to American
families. And, it protects the progress made under the Biden-Harris
Administration to give more Americans access to affordable health
insurance coverage, bringing the uninsured rate to an all-time low. By
signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
his promise to lower prescription drug costs, make health insurance more
affordable, and make the economy work for working families.
