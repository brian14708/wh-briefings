Today, the unemployment rate matches the lowest it’s been in more than
50 years: 3.5%. More people are working than at any point in American
history. That’s millions of families with the dignity and peace of mind
that a paycheck provides. And, it’s the result of my economic plan to
build the economy from the bottom up and middle out. I ran for president
to rebuild the middle class – there’s more work to do, but today’s jobs
report shows we are making significant progress for working families.
