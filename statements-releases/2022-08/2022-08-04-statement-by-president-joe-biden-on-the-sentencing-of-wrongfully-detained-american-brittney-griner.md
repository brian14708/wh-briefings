title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Sentencing of Wrongfully Detained\
  \ American Brittney\_Griner"
---
 
Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that
is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is
wrongfully detaining Brittney. It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia
to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones,
friends, and teammates.  My administration will continue to work
tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul
Whelan home safely as soon as possible.
