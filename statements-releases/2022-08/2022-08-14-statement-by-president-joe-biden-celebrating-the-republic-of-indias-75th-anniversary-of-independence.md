  s 75th Anniversary of\_Independence"

As people around the world, including nearly four million proud
Indian-Americans, celebrate the 75th anniversary of India’s independence
on August 15, the United States joins the people of India to honor its
democratic journey, guided by Mahatma Gandhi’s enduring message of truth
and non-violence.

This year, we also celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic
relations between our great democracies. India and the United States are
indispensable partners, and the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership is
grounded in our shared commitment to the rule of law and the promotion
of human freedom and dignity. Our partnership is further strengthened by
the deep bonds between our people. The vibrant Indian-American community
in the United States has made us a more innovative, inclusive, and
stronger Nation.

I am confident that in the years ahead our two democracies will continue
to stand together to defend the rules-based order; foster greater peace,
prosperity and security for our people; advance a free and open
Indo-Pacific; and together address the challenges we face around the
world.
