  \ White\_House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and\_Health"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration will host the White House Conference on
Hunger, Nutrition, and Health on September 28, 2022 in Washington, DC.
As the [President announced in
May,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU5BeZ3Gtuc) this will be the
first Conference of this kind in more than 50 years.  
   
Millions of Americans are afflicted with food insecurity and
diet-related diseases—including heart disease, obesity, and type 2
diabetes—which are some of the leading causes of death and disability in
the U.S. Lack of access to healthy and affordable foods is one of many
factors impacting hunger and diet-related diseases. The COVID-19
pandemic has exacerbated these challenges further.  
   
The Conference will bring government leaders, academics, activists, and
Americans from all walks of life together to achieve the goal of ending
hunger and reducing diet-related diseases in the U.S. by 2030 – all
while reducing disparities among the communities who are impacted the
most by these issues. We will announce a national strategy at the
Conference that identifies actions the government will take to catalyze
the public and private sectors to drive transformative change and
address the intersections between food, hunger, nutrition, and health.
