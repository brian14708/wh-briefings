title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Higher Education\
  \ Leaders on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris hosted a roundtable to hear from
college and university leaders from across the country about the fight
to protect the health, safety, and well-being of their students
following the Supreme Court decision in *Dobbs*. The Vice President was
joined by Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.  
   
During the roundtable, the participants shared challenges facing their
students in accessing reproductive health care services, including
academic responsibilities, ability to travel, and financial burdens. The
higher education leaders raised the disproportionate rate of sexual
violence against women on college campuses, expressing concern about
their access to necessary reproductive health care. They also discussed
potential harm of the *Dobbs* decision on the institutions’ abilities to
recruit and train the next generation of health care professionals.  
   
The Vice President and the leaders discussed the confusion surrounding
the patchwork of laws across the country, as many states have passed
varying degrees of extreme abortion restrictions and bans. The Vice
President applauded the leaders for their efforts to ensure access to
abortion care for their students despite great difficulty, and she
conveyed her support as they continue to navigate challenges following
the Court’s dismantling of reproductive rights.  
   
The Vice President has met with state legislators from 17 states. She
has visited Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia,
Indiana, and Massachusetts to meet with state legislators about
protecting reproductive rights. In July, she convened a meeting of
legislators from Montana, Indiana, Florida, South Dakota, and Nebraska
at the White House. Last week, she convened a meeting of Latina state
legislators from Kansas, Utah, Texas, Arizona, New York, Illinois, and
Nevada at the White House. Additionally, she has convened health care
providers, constitutional law experts, faith leaders, state attorneys
general, disability rights leaders, and advocates over the last three
months.
