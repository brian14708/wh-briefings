Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.

Following Secretary Lloyd J. Austin’s call with Ukrainian Minister of
Defense Oleksii Reznikov on Friday in which he previewed upcoming
security assistance plans*,* the U.S. officials provided their
counterparts with details of a new package that the Biden Administration
will authorize today to provide Ukraine with additional ammunition for
the HIMARS and artillery systems that are making a difference on the
battlefield.

Both sides welcomed the successful departure of the first vessel
carrying Ukrainian grain from the Port of Odesa today. They expressed
their desire for sustained shipments that will help feed millions of
vulnerable people worldwide and underscored the need for Russia to
adhere to its commitments under the recent grain export deal.

In addition, they discussed the recent appointments of Ukraine’s
Prosecutor General and head of the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s
Office and the importance of Ukraine continuing to implement its reform
agenda despite the challenges caused by the war.
