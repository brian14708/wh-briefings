Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened California state
legislators, local leaders, and advocates to discuss the fight to
protect reproductive health care. She applauded the leaders for their
work protecting abortion access for Californians and encouraged them to
continue standing up for reproductive rights.  
   
The state leaders and advocates shared ways that they have safeguarded
reproductive rights in California and plan to continue expanding rights
in the future. They discussed concerns with data protections and ways to
ensure patient privacy. The participants conveyed the importance of
protecting both patients and providers, noting that every person
deserves access to health care. The Vice President applauded the
legislators for their work being a safe harbor for women from other
states who are seeking reproductive health care despite great challenges
in their own states.   
   
The Vice President shared what she has heard from state legislators
across the country about challenges they are experiencing, and she
encouraged the California leaders to collaborate with leaders in other
states as part of a broad coalition defending reproductive rights and
freedoms.
