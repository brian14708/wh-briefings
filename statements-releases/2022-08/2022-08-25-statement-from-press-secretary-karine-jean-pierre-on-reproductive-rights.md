---
 
Yesterday, a federal Idaho district court determined that women in Idaho
will continue to receive life-saving and health-preserving emergency
care – including abortion care.  The court found that Idaho’s ban on
abortion, scheduled to go into effect today, would prevent women from
getting the care they need in an emergency and is therefore in direct
conflict with a federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor
Act, that protects patients and doctors.  This ruling will prevent
serious harm to women in Idaho.  
  
Yet, just Tuesday, a Texas court issued a devastating decision for women
in that state, who can now be denied this same life-saving care, and who
may die as a result. Republican legislators continue to deny women’s
access to health care. And, they are committed to moving America
backward — with fewer rights and less autonomy. Americans across the
country and of all backgrounds agree that women should have the right to
make their own personal health care decisions and to receive life-saving
medical care, without interference from politicians, and the President
will continue to take action to protect women’s access to lifesaving
health care.
