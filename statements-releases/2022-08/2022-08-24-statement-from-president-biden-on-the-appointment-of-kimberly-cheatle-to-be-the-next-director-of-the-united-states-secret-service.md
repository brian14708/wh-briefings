  \ be the Next Director of the United\_States Secret\_Service"

I am proud to announce that I have selected Kim Cheatle to be the next
Director of the United States Secret Service. Kim has had a long and
distinguished career at the Secret Service, having risen through the
ranks during her 27 years with the agency, becoming the first woman in
the role of Assistant Director of protective operations.

Jill and I know firsthand Kim’s commitment to her job and to the Secret
Service’s people and mission. When Kim served on my security detail when
I was Vice President, we came to trust her judgement and counsel. She is
a distinguished law enforcement professional with exceptional leadership
skills, and was easily the best choice to lead the agency at a critical
moment for the Secret Service. She has my complete trust, and I look
forward to working with her.

We thank Director Murray for his service to this country, and wish him
and his family well as he takes the next step in his career.

Operation’s $133.5M budget and collaborated with ten operational
divisions and the Technical Security Division to research, develop, and
deploy technologies that reduce risks to protectees, protected
facilities, and protected events. She also developed and updated
operational policies; oversaw a special projects team that responds to
operational, technical and administrative issues at all levels of the
organization; and directed staffing and logistical operations for the
directorate and ten operational divisions to ensure divisions and events
are properly resourced.

Prior to serving as Assistant Director, Cheatle served as the Special
Agent in Charge of the Atlanta Field Office, providing oversight for all
mission-related investigations, protective intelligence and protective
visits in the state of Georgia.
