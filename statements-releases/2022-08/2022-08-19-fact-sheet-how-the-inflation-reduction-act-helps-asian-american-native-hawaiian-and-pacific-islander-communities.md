title: "FACT SHEET:  How the Inflation Reduction Act Helps Asian American, Native\
  \ Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander\_Communities"
---
 
By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
his promise to build an economy that works for working families,
including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and
NHPI) families. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug
costs, health care costs, and energy costs. It’s the most aggressive
action we have taken to confront the climate crisis. It’ll lower the
deficit and ask the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair
share. And no one making under $400,000 per year will pay a penny more
in taxes.  
  
President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special
interests to pass this historic legislation that lowers costs for
Americans and their families, advances environmental justice while
building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from the bottom up and
the middle out.  
**   
<u>LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</u>**  
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs,
including prescription drug costs, and expand health insurance coverage
for AA and NHPI families.   
  
**Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors:** Americans pay 2-3 times
more for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy
countries. Nearly [1 in 4
Americans ](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/poll-nearly-1-in-4-americans-taking-prescription-drugs-say-its-difficult-to-afford-medicines-including-larger-shares-with-low-incomes/)struggle
to afford prescription drugs, and high prices contribute to racial and
ethnic health inequities. The Inflation Reduction Act will help close
the gap in access to medication by improving prescription drug coverage
and lowering drug prices in Medicare. The law:

-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs
    they buy at the pharmacy at $2,000 a year, giving peace of mind to
    seniors who no longer have to worry about spending thousands and
    thousands more on prescription drugs.
-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for
    a month’s supply.
-   Provides access to a number of additional free vaccines, including
    the shingles vaccine, for Medicare beneficiaries.
-   Will further lower prescription drug costs for seniors by allowing
    Medicare to negotiate the price of high-cost drugs and requiring
    drug manufacturers to pay Medicare a rebate when they raise prices
    faster than inflation.

Lowering Health Insurance Premiums and Expanding Coverage: Almost [1.5
million AA and
NHPI](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/)
people were uninsured in 2019 before President Biden took office and
[over 1.3 million people of
color](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/taking-a-closer-look-at-characteristics-of-people-in-the-coverage-gap/)
fell into the Medicaid “coverage gap” and were locked out of coverage
because their state refused to expand Medicaid. Since President Biden
took office, the uninsured rate has reached a new historic low: 8% and
over 5 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage. The
Inflation Reduction Act continues the American Rescue Plan’s more
generous Affordable Care Act premium tax credits.

-   The Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower monthly premiums – about
    197,000 AA and NHPI people became newly eligible for premium savings
    last year, with more than 150,000 uninsured AA and NHPI people
    having access to a plan with a $0-premium plan in 2021.
-   By continuing the improvements made through ARP, the Inflation
    Reduction Act will help keep free or low-cost health insurance
    available. About 120,000 more Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and
    Pacific Islanders will have health insurance coverage next year,
    compared to without the IRA.

**<u>COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND LOWER ENERGY COSTS</u>**  
  
The U.S. Pacific Islands region includes more than [2,000
islands](https://archive.epa.gov/epa/sites/production/files/2016-04/documents/aapi-climate-change.pdf)
spanning millions of square miles of ocean. Asian Americans, Native
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders are in every state, especially with
[concentrations](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/29/key-facts-about-asian-americans/)
on the West Coast and in Hawai’I, communities are vulnerable to rising
sea levels or severe wildfires. And, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians,
and Pacific Islanders who live in large cities like New York City,
Boston, Houston, Chicago, and Seattle are also feeling the impacts of
climate change [most
acutely](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-cities-climate-victims/).  
The Inflation Reduction Act takes the most aggressive action on climate
and clean energy in American history. The legislation will bring down
energy costs for families and create thousands of good jobs, all while
reducing climate pollution and ensuring that we have a clean, secure
future energy supply. It will:  
Make Home Efficiency Upgrades More Affordable: The Inflation Reduction
Act will make it more affordable for families to purchase energy
efficient and electric appliances when they need to replace everyday
home appliances and equipment. And, these appliances will save families
money on their utility bills in the long run. 

-   When families need to replace air conditioners, water heaters, or
    furnaces, they can save up to 30% with tax credits for efficient
    furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners and more that will save
    them hundreds of dollars on utility bills.

<!-- -->

-   Households can save up to 30% with tax credits for home construction
    projects on windows, doors, insulation, or other weatherization
    measures that prevent energy from escaping homes and wasting money.
-   If low- or moderate- income families need to replace or upgrade
    stoves or other home appliances, they can receive direct rebates
    when buying more energy efficient and electric appliances that can
    lower future utility bills by at least $350 [per
    year](https://resstock.nrel.gov/factsheets/).
-   Families in affordable housing units will benefit from resources to
    support projects that boost efficiency, improve indoor air quality,
    make clean energy or electrification upgrades, or strengthen their
    climate resilience.
-   Overall, families that take advantage of clean energy and clean
    vehicle tax credits can save more than $1,000 per year.

**Create Economic Opportunities and Jobs**: The Inflation Reduction Act
ensures that the clean energy opportunities reach all Americans as it:

-   Spurs solar project development in environmental justice communities
    by providing a 20% bonus credit for solar projects on federally
    subsidized affordable housing projects and a 10% bonus credit for
    solar projects in low-income communities.

<!-- -->

-   Creates a new Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator that will
    seed state and local clean energy financing institutions, support
    the deployment of distributed zero-emission technologies like
    heat-pumps, community solar and EV charging, while prioritizing over
    50% of its investments in disadvantaged communities.
-   Expands clean energy tax credits for wind, solar, nuclear, clean
    hydrogen, clean fuels and carbon capture to include bonus credit for
    businesses that pay workers a prevailing wage and hire using
    registered apprenticeship programs – so that the clean energy we use
    creates good paying jobs.

**Protect Public Health:** The Inflation Reduction Act recognizes that
climate change disproportionately impacts low-income communities and
communities of color. The law:

-   Creates Environmental Justice Block Grants, a dedicated program to
    tackle pollution in port communities – where air pollution is
    especially dense and deadly.
-   Funds a range of programs to reduce air pollution, including for
    fenceline monitoring and screening near industrial facilities, air
    quality sensors in disadvantaged communities, new and upgraded
    multipollutant monitoring sites, and monitoring and mitigation of
    methane and wood heater emissions.
-   Protects our children and young adults with investments to monitor
    and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants at
    public schools in disadvantaged communities.

**Strengthen Resilience to Climate Change:** The Inflation Reduction Act
bolsters climate resilience and strengthens the Nation’s infrastructure
and economy against natural disaster and extreme weather events by:

-   Upgrading affordable housing to reinforce homes against climate
    impacts, and increase water and energy efficiency.
-   Expanding USDA’s Urban and Community Forestry Program with
    tree-planting projects that help cool neighborhoods, with a priority
    for projects that benefit underserved communities.
-   Advancing transportation equity and resilience with a new
    Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant program to improve walkability,
    safety, and affordability, including projects to protect against
    extreme heat, flooding, and other impacts.

**Lower Costs for Small Businesses:** According to the Small Business
Administration, 2 million Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific
Islander-owned small businesses in the U.S. generate more than $700
billion in revenues and create 3.6 million jobs. The Inflation Reduction
Act includes a number of provisions that will save small business owners
money.

-   Small businesses can receive a tax credit that covers up to 30% of
    the cost of switching over to low-cost solar power – lowering
    operating costs and protecting against the volatile energy prices
    that are currently squeezing small businesses. 
-   Businesses can deduct up to $1.00 per square foot of a commercial
    building for making qualifying high energy efficiency upgrades. The
    per square foot deduction is boosted if the efficiency upgrades are
    completed by workers who are a paid a prevailing wage and the
    project employs apprentices – helping businesses save money and
    providing good paying jobs.

**<u>MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</u>**  
President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an
unfair tax system worse. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a
critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise
revenue by:

-   Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the
    taxes they already owe.
-   Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get
    away with paying no federal income tax.
-   Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will
    encourage businesses to invest.

The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance
critically needed investments to lower costs and combat climate change,
they are also an important component of building an economy that rewards
work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away
with playing by a separate set of rules.   
  
Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits
they are entitled to under the tax code and be able to get their
questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks to the Act’s
transformational investments in the Internal Revenue Service. And, no
family making less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up by
a single cent.
