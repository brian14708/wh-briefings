title: "FACT SHEET: The Inflation Reduction Act Supports Workers and\_Families"
---
 
By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
his promise to build an economy that works for working families.
President Biden is the most pro-worker, pro-union President in history,
and the Inflation Reduction Act builds on that legacy. President Biden
and Congressional Democrats beat back special interests to pass this
historic law that lowers costs for families, creates good-paying jobs
for workers, and grows the economy from the bottom up and the middle
out.  
  
The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs, health care
costs, and energy costs. It’s the most aggressive action on tackling the
climate crisis in American history, which will lift up American workers
and create good-paying, union jobs across the country. It’ll lower the
deficit and ask the ultra-wealthy and corporations to pay their fair
share. And no one making under $400,000 per year will pay a penny more
in taxes.  
  
**CREATE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS**  
  
The Inflation Reduction Act creates good-paying union jobs that will
help reduce emissions across every sector of our economy. As President
Biden promised when running for president, the law includes some of the
strongest labor protections and incentives ever attached to clean energy
tax credit programs. It will:

-   **Incentivize prevailing wages.** The expanded tax credits for
    energy efficient commercial buildings, new energy efficient homes,
    and electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure will include bonus
    credits for businesses that pay prevailing wages and hire registered
    apprentices, ensuring local wages are not undercut by low-road
    contractors.  
-   **Stop companies from ripping off workers.** It will penalize
    companies that promise to pay prevailing wages but don’t follow
    through, and workers who are owed prevailing wages will receive the
    difference, plus interest.  
-   **Make it in America.** For the first time ever, the Inflation
    Reduction Act establishes Make it in America provisions for the use
    of American-made equipment for clean energy production. The law
    provides expanded clean energy tax credits for wind, solar, nuclear,
    clean hydrogen, clean fuels, and carbon capture, including bonus
    credits for businesses that pay workers a prevailing wage and use
    registered apprenticeship programs.

**MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER  
**  
The Inflation Reduction Act will make our tax code fairer by cracking
down on millionaires, billionaires, and corporations that evade their
obligations, and making sure the largest corporations pay their fair
share.  No family making less than $400,000 per year will see their
taxes go up by a single cent. The Inflation Reduction Act will raise
revenue by:

-   Going after tax dodgers, ensuring the wealthy and large corporations
    pay the taxes they already owe.
-   Cracking down on the largest profitable corporations that currently
    get away with paying little to no federal income tax, instituting a
    minimum corporate tax of 15%.
-   Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks, to encourage
    businesses to invest instead of enriching CEOs or funneling profits
    tax-free to shareholders.
-   Making transformational investments in taxpayer service so that
    regular Americans can get their questions answered and access the
    credits and benefits they are entitled to.

The law’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance critically
needed investments to lower costs for working families and combat
climate change, they are also an important component of building an
economy that rewards work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich
and powerful get away with playing by a separate set of rules.  
  
**REVITALIZE AMERICAN MANFACUTURING**  
  
President Biden made a promise to re-energize American manufacturing,
and he kept his promise. The President already has the strongest record
of growing manufacturing jobs in modern history, and this law invests in
American workers and industry. The Inflation Reduction Act will:

-   **Build American clean energy supply chains,** by incentivizing
    domestic production in clean energy technologies like solar, wind,
    carbon capture, and clean hydrogen.  
-   **Support American workers** with targeted tax incentives aimed at
    manufacturing U.S.-sourced products such as batteries, solar, and
    offshore wind components, and technologies for carbon capture
    systems.  
-   **Strengthen America’s manufacturing base.** The Inflation Reduction
    promotes domestic sourcing and American jobs. For example, clean
    energy tax credits are increased if the amount of American steel
    used in wind projects meets the domestic content threshold, and
    bonus credits apply to employers who use of prevailing wages and
    apprenticeships, ensuring that federal tax policy supports
    good-paying, high-skilled jobs.  
-   **Create good-paying union jobs in energy communities.** Clean
    energy tax credits will be increased by 10% if the clean energy
    projects are established in communities that have previously relied
    upon the extraction, processing, transport, or storage of coal, oil,
    or natural gas as a significant source of employment, creating jobs
    and economic development in the communities that have powered
    America for generations.

**LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS  
**  
President Biden has followed through on his promise to lower the cost of
prescription drugs. The Inflation Reduction Act will protect Medicare
recipients from catastrophic drug costs by phasing in a cap for
out-of-pocket costs and establishing a$35 cap for a month’s supply of
insulin. And, as an historic win, Medicare will be able to negotiate
prices for high-cost drugs for the first time ever. For union members or
family members who benefit from the Affordable Care Act, it extends
health insurance premium subsidies.
