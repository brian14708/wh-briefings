title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on the Inflation Reduction\_Act"
---
 
Thanks to President Joe Biden’s leadership, and the hard work of
Majority Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, the Inflation Reduction Act
is off to the President’s desk. 

Because of this, we will lower the cost of prescription drugs for our
seniors and reduce health insurance premiums for 13 million
Americans. We will make the largest investment in our nation’s history
to address the climate crisis, creating good-paying, union jobs in wind,
solar, and electric vehicle manufacturing. We will lower energy bills
for working families and support environmental justice. And, the
legislation is fully paid for by finally ensuring the
wealthiest corporations pay their fair share. This is an historic
achievement for our country that will directly benefit millions of
Americans.

Unfortunately, not a single Republican in Congress voted for the
package. Not a single Republican voted to lower the cost of prescription
drugs, reduce health insurance premiums, make investments to address the
climate crisis, tackle inflation, or require the wealthiest corporations
to pay their fair share. 

In the 18 months since President Biden and I took office, we have
created nearly ten million jobs, and helped to rescue small businesses;
begun upgrading our roads and bridges and removing lead pipes;
and we are making sure high-speed internet is available and accessible
for all Americans. There is more work to do. But it is clear our nation
is moving in the right direction.

These achievements reflect the determination of the American people and
the vision President Biden and I laid out at the beginning of our
Administration to take on the challenges of today and build a strong,
prosperous future for America.
