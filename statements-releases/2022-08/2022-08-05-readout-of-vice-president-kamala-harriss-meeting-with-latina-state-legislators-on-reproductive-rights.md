  \ Legislators on Reproductive\_Rights"

Today Vice President Harris convened Latina state legislators from
Kansas, Utah, Texas, Arizona, New York, Illinois, and Nevada who are on
the frontlines of protecting reproductive rights in their states. They
were also joined by advocates and a health care provider during the
meeting at the White House.  
   
The Vice President thanked the leaders for their work protecting
reproductive rights in their states. The participants shared challenges
facing the Latina community as it relates to accessing reproductive
health care, and they shared stories and experiences about the way that
abortion restrictions are harming women and families. The state leaders
thanked the Vice President for her leadership fighting for the health
and safety of women.  
   
During the meeting, the Vice President and the state leaders reinforced
that you do not need to give up your faith to believe that women should
have the ability to make decisions about their bodies and their lives
without government interference. The Vice President reiterated the
Administration’s commitment to partnering with elected leaders at the
local, state, and federal level to protect reproductive health care. She
encouraged the leaders to continue exploring protections in their states
and said she looks forward to continuing to work alongside them.  
   
The Vice President has visited Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North
Carolina, Virginia, Indiana, and Massachusetts to meet with state
legislators about protecting reproductive rights. She also convened
