title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Legislative Leaders on Extreme\
  \ Risk Protection Order (ERPO)\_Legislation"

Building on President Biden signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act
into law last month, today Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the
President and White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, Stefanie
Feldman, Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and
Rosie Hidalgo, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor on
Gender-Based Violence, convened a meeting on Extreme Risk Protection
Order (ERPO) laws with state legislative leaders from Florida, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, and Texas. ERPOs – sometimes referred to as “red flag”
laws – allow family members, law enforcement, or other responsible
individuals to petition for a court order temporarily barring people in
crisis from accessing firearms if they present a danger to themselves or
others.

The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act includes $750 million for states to
implement crisis interventions such as ERPOs, fulfilling the President’s
repeated call for this funding. Last year, the Justice Department took
action to support states’ efforts to enact these laws by publishing
model red flag legislation. The Department of Justice’s Extreme Risk
Protection Order model legislation can be found
[here](https://www.justice.gov/doj/reducing-gun-violence/commentary-extreme-risk-protection-order-model-legislation).

ERPOs reduce gun violence and save lives – and that is why they have
earned bipartisan support. Currently, 19 states have ERPO laws. With
federal funding on the way, now is the time for more states to pass ERPO
laws and for all states to conduct more education and outreach to ensure
that the public and law enforcement know when and how to seek an ERPO.

During the meeting, legislative leaders from Florida and Maryland shared
how their states successfully passed ERPO laws. Legislative leaders from
Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, and Texas shared their plans for advancing ERPO
legislation. All participants discussed best practices for ERPO
education and outreach campaigns.

State legislative leaders from today’s meeting included:

-   Maryland Speaker of the House Adrienne Jones
-   Kentucky Senate Minority Leader Morgan McGarvey
-   Former Florida Senate President Bill Galvano
-   Florida State Senator Lori Berman
-   Florida State Representative Christine Hunschofsky
-   Maryland State Delegate Vanessa Atterbeary
-   Maryland State Senator Jeff Waldstreicher
-   Minnesota State Representative Kelly Moller
