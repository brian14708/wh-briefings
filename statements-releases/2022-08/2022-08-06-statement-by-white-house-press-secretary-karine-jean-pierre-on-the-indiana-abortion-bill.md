title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Indiana\
  \ Abortion\_Ban"
---
 
The Indiana legislature took a devastating step as a result of the
Supreme Court’s extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate
women’s constitutionally-protected right to abortion. And, it’s another
radical step by Republican legislators to take away women’s reproductive
rights and freedom, and put personal health care decisions in the hands
of politicians rather than women and their doctors.

Yesterday’s vote, which institutes a near-total abortion ban in Indiana,
should be a signal to Americans across the country to make their voices
heard.  Congress should also act immediately to pass a law restoring the
protections of Roe – the only way to secure a woman’s right to choose
nationally. 

Until then, President Biden is committed to taking action to protect
women’s reproductive rights and freedom, and access to care they are
afforded under Federal law.
