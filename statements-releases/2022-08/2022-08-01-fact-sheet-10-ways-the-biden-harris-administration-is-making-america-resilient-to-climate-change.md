title: "FACT SHEET: 10 Ways the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Is Making America\
  \ Resilient to Climate\_Change"
---
 
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been clear
that climate change is a crisis. That is why the Biden-Harris
Administration is taking action to make communities across America more
resilient to climate change, especially as millions of Americans live
under heat advisories, wildfires threaten communities big and small,
over 100 million Americans experience the plight and uncertainty
associated with drought, and communities across the country face
flooding from a season’s worth of rain that falls in a matter of hours. 

We know that the impacts of the climate crisis are here and that we must
invest in building resilience to protect our communities,
infrastructure, and economy. That is why today, **[Vice President Kamala
Harris is in Miami, Florida to announce over $1 billion for 53 states,
territories, and D.C., to improve their infrastructure and make
communities more
resilient](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/08/01/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-1-billion-project-selections-make),**
with an emphasis on increasing resilience to the impacts of climate
change and extreme weather events. These awards, which will be
distributed through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s [Building
Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC)
Program](https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation/building-resilient-infrastructure-communities/after-apply/fy-2021-subapplication-status),
are double the funding from last year’s historic $500 million. Next
year, this funding will more than double to $2.3 billion, boosted by the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Today’s announcement is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broad
efforts to strengthen our nation’s resilience and tackle the climate
crisis. [President Biden’s National Climate Task
Force](https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate/) has launched interagency
efforts to build resilience to climate impacts, including extreme heat,
wildfires, drought, flooding, coastal threats, financial risks, and
more. This builds on the historic investments President Biden and Vice
President Harris secured in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for clean
energy, wildfire mitigation, legacy pollution cleanup, ecosystem
restoration, and resilient infrastructure. These investments create jobs
building a clean energy economy that’s resilient to climate change and
revitalizing our domestic manufacturing base. 

The President and Vice President’s key actions include:

1.  **Providing historic investments for climate resilient
    infrastructure projects:** Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law, President Biden secured $50 billion in resilience investments,
    the most in American history, to protect communities against extreme
    weather. For example, the Department of Transportation [recently
    announced](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-administration-announces-new-protect-formula-program-73-billion-bipartisan)
    $7.3 billion in formula funding through the PROTECT program, which
    will help states and communities make transportation infrastructure
    more resilient by focusing on resilience planning, making resilience
    improvements to existing transportation assets and evacuation
    routes, and addressing at-risk highway infrastructure.
2.  **Combating growing wildfire threats:** Agencies are [undertaking
    various
    action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/28/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-continues-efforts-to-address-growing-wildfire-threat/)s,
    such as the [joint
    planning](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/01/18/secretary-vilsack-announces-new-10-year-strategy-confront-wildfire)
    and [coordination of historic
    investments](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-and-agriculture-departments-join-western-governors-launch-collaborative)
    in conservation programs and natural resource infrastructure
    projects across the West, including the new [Community Wildfire
    Defense Grant
    Program](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/07/26/biden-harris-administration-announces-1-billion-community-wildfire),
    funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These investments
    improve wildfire response and reduce the overall loss of
    infrastructure and critical resources, while prioritizing assistance
    to underserved communities. This summer, as directed by the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the [Wildland Fire Mitigation and
    Management
    Commission](https://www.usda.gov/topics/disaster-resource-center/wildland-fire/commission)
    was established, gathering Federal and non-Federal members to
    formulate and deliver policy recommendations to Congress for
    wildland fire prevention, mitigation, suppression, and management.
3.  **Protecting communities and workers from extreme heat:** The
    Biden-Harris Administration is taking a [wide range of
    actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/26/fact-sheet-10-ways-the-biden-harris-administration-is-responding-to-extreme-heat/)
    to respond to intensifying heat waves and reduce associated health
    risks, especially for vulnerable groups and underserved communities.
    These efforts include using the [Low Income Home Energy Assistance
    Program
    (LIHEAP)](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-im-2022-06-heat-stress-flexibilities-and-resources-fy2022)
    to reduce cooling costs and deliver air conditioners and electric
    heat pumps to homes, developing nationwide standards and enforcement
    programs to [protect
    workers](https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/04122022)
    on the job, launching [Heat.gov](https://www.heat.gov/) as a
    one-stop hub for accessible information and response tools, and
    supporting community-led [urban heat island
    mapping](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-and-communities-to-map-heat-inequities-in-14-us-cities-and-counties),
    [outreach and communication
    strategies](https://www.epa.gov/innovation/lets-talk-about-heat-challenge),
    [innovative cooling
    technologies](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2022/07/05/dhs-prize-winners-announced-challenge-counter-extreme-temperatures),
    [urban tree and greening
    projects](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/urban-forests/ucf),
    and more.
4.  **Strengthening drought resilience:** In June, Vice President Harris
    highlighted the [Drought Resilience Interagency Working Group First
    Year Summary
    Report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DroughtIWGReport_Final_Embargoed-Until-June-1-at-6AM-ET.pdf),
    which details the efforts accomplished and underway to assist
    drought-stricken communities and build their resilience to worsening
    conditions. A new [Federal-state task
    force](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-and-agriculture-departments-join-western-governors-launch-collaborative)
    was launched in partnership with Western governors to coordinate
    conservation programs. Many agencies – in collaboration with states,
    Tribes, and local governments, as well as non-governmental
    organizations – are utilizing Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding
    to support projects that [improve our Nation’s water
    infrastructure](https://www.usbr.gov/bil/), [rehabilitate
    watersheds](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/landscape/wr/),
    [promote water
    reuse](https://www.doi.gov/priorities/investing-americas-infrastructure/addressing-drought),
    and [enhance soil and drought monitoring
    systems](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/statement-from-noaa-administrator-rick-spinrad-on-signing-of-bipartisan-infrastructure-investment).
5.  **Reducing flood risk for households and communities:** President
    Biden [re-established the Federal Flood Risk Management
    Standard](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/)
    that will reduce flood risk and protect infrastructure investments.
    The White House is coordinating Federal efforts on flood resilience
    and ensuring that federal investments include safety standards for
    flooding and sea-level rise. Agencies are already taking action by
    [implementing
    guidance](https://www.fema.gov/floodplain-management/intergovernmental/federal-flood-risk-management-standard)
    to ensure communities are protected from floods. In addition, FEMA
    launched [an updated website for
    purchasers](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/know-your-risk/homeowners-renters)
    to evaluate property-level flood risk and [released a
    report](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_state-flood-risk-disclosure-best-practices_07142022.pdf)
    highlighting best-practices for states requiring flood risk
    disclosures during real estate transactions.
6.  **Protecting coastal communities from storms, sea-level rise, and
    other climate impacts:** The Biden-Harris Administration [announced
    $3 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    funds](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/biden-administration-announces-historic-coastal-and-climate-resilience-funding)
    to strengthen coastal resilience, improve climate data and services,
    and more. As directed in President Biden’s [Earth Day Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-to-strengthen-americas-forests-boost-wildfire-resilience-and-combat-global-deforestation/),
    the Administration is exploring greater deployment of nature-based
    solutions to address coastal and other climate impacts. Through the
    [Coastal Resilience Interagency Working
    Group](https://www.noaa.gov/coastal-resilience-interagency-working-group),
    agencies have developed [a resource
    guide](https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-04/Nature-based-Solutions-Compendium.pdf)
    to help communities build climate resilience along coastlines with
    nature-based solutions—streamlining access to more than 100
    information resources and 48 federal programs.
7.  **Supporting disadvantaged communities:** Through the [White House
    Environmental Justice Advisory Council
    (WHEJAC),](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council)
    the White House formed a new WHEJAC Climate Resilience Working Group
    to advise on how to promote and execute equitable climate change
    resilience and disaster management. The White House continues to
    coordinate with agencies to implement the [President’s Justice40
    Program](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2022/07/26/icymi-biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-covered-programs-for-inclusion-in-the-justice40-initiative/),
    ensuring that 40% of program benefits reach disadvantaged
    communities. This includes benefits offered through the FEMA BRIC
    program.
8.  **Prioritizing assistance to Tribal communities**: Tribal
    communities and lands face particular risks to climate effects. The
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests [$216 million in
    funding](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-funding-build)
    to establish a new Tribal transition and relocation assistance
    program under DOI, which supports the voluntary, community-led
    transition for Tribal communities severely threatened by climate
    change and accelerating coastal hazards. The White House launched a
    new Community-Driven Relocation Subcommittee, which will convene
    agencies to explore key considerations, issues, and strategies for
    working in partnership with communities to support voluntary
    movement away from high-risk regions.
9.  **Addressing climate risks to the economy:** The Biden-Harris
    Administration launched the first [comprehensive, government-wide
    strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/15/fact-sheet-biden-administration-roadmap-to-build-an-economy-resilient-to-climate-change-impacts/)
    to measure, disclose, manage, and mitigate the systemic risks that
    climate change poses to American families, businesses, and economy.
    Climate change has cost Americans an additional $600 billion in
    physical and economic damages over the past five years alone. To
    respond, Federal agencies are taking action to protect the
    hard-earned life savings of workers and homeowners while protecting
    the broader financial system and the Federal Government’s fiscal
    health against climate-related financial risk.
10. **Leading by example across the Federal Government:** The White
    House worked with Federal agencies to develop more than 20 [climate
    adaptation and resilience
    plans](https://www.sustainability.gov/adaptation/) to enhance
    climate readiness across their facilities and operations. This will
    reduce costs and damages caused by extreme weather, minimize
    disruptions to Federal programs and services, and protect workers
    and communities. Last week, USDA announced a
    [strategy](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/07/25/biden-harris-administration-announces-plans-reforestation-climate)
    to address a reforestation backlog of four million acres on national
    forests and plant more than one billion trees over the next decade
    as part of its [climate adaptation
    plan](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/07/25/biden-harris-administration-announces-plans-reforestation-climate).
    Agencies are implementing the actions identified in their climate
    adaptation and resilience plans and will provide annual progress
    updates.
