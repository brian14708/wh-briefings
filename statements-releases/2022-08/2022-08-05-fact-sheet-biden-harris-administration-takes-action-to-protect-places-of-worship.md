title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Action to Protect Places\
  \ of\_Worship"
---
 
Ten years ago, a gunman attacked the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in the
town of Oak Creek. Six people died and four were wounded, and a seventh
victim died of his wounds in 2020.  
  
Tragically, threats and acts of violence against places of worship have
increased over the past 10 years, both in the United States and abroad.
Recent fatal shootings at houses of worship in the United States include
attacks at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina;
Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, Tennessee; First Baptist
Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas; Tree of Life Congregation in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Chabad of Poway in Poway, California; West
Freeway Church of Christ in Tarrant County, Texas; Irvine Taiwanese
Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods, California; Cornerstone Church in
Ames, Iowa; and St. Stephens Episcopal Church in Vestavia Hills,
Alabama.  
  
President Biden has pledged to do everything in his power to ensure that
Americans can practice their faith without fear. As President Biden has
said: “We must be vigilant against the rising tide of targeted violence
and hate at home and abroad, and work to ensure that no one feels afraid
to attend a religious service, school, or community center, or walk down
the street wearing the symbols of their faith.” This is a bedrock
principle of our nation’s commitment to religious freedom for all. The
Biden-Harris Administration will continue to work shoulder-to-shoulder
with Americans of all faiths and beliefs to safeguard these cherished
principles and to preserve our nation’s founding promise as an enduring
citadel of diversity, unity, and mutual respect.

To achieve these aims, President Biden signed, and his Administration is
implementing laws that will make communities safer, including the
[Bipartisan Safer Communities
Act](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/25/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-s-2938-the-bipartisan-safer-communities-act/)
and the [COVID-19 Hate Crimes
Act](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/20/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-the-covid-19-hate-crimes-act/)
and the [Jabara-Heyer NO HATE
Act.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1086?r=17)
The Administration is also taking [executive

including crimes committed on the basis of religious identity or

Countering Domestic
Terrorism](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/15/fact-sheet-national-strategy-for-countering-domestic-terrorism/).
These efforts safeguard all individuals, including those who gather at
places of worship.   
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is also protecting places of worship and
congregants by taking additional steps, including:  
  
**Expanding funding for securing places of worship and other nonprofit
entities**

-   In fiscal year 2022, the Administration implemented a nearly 20%
    increase in funding – from $180 million to $250 million – in the
    Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) [Nonprofit Security Grant
    Program](https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/nonprofit-security)
    (NSGP), which provides support for increasing the physical security
    of nonprofit organizations, including houses of worship and other
    religious affiliated entities. President Biden called for $360
    million for this key program in his fiscal year 2023 budget
    proposal.  
-   The Department of Justice (DOJ) updated a set of [Frequently Asked
    Questions (FAQs)](https://bja.ojp.gov/doc/jag-faqs.pdf) to clarify
    and highlight that Byrne JAG funding can be used by state and local
    governments to increase patrols and deployments that bolster the
    security of at-risk nonprofit organizations including churches,
    gurdwaras, mosques, synagogues, temples, and other places of
    worship.

**Creating a one-stop online clearinghouse of federal resources designed
to counter terrorism and targeted violence-prevention**

-   As called for in the [National Strategy for Countering Domestic
    Terrorism](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf),
    federal departments and agencies are collaborating to develop a
    one-stop online clearinghouse to help users easily navigate and
    access a wide range of federal resources available to support the
    prevention of terrorism and targeted violence.

**Increasing coordination and strengthening resources**

-   The White House established the Protecting Places of Worship
    Interagency Policy Committee, co-chaired by the Domestic Policy
    Council and the National Security Council, to coordinate interagency
    efforts supporting the safety and security of places of worship.  
-   DHS piloted a new initiative to enhance the sharing of threat
    information with community and faith-based based partners, to
    include emerging threat information, products, and the reporting of
    suspicious activities.        
-   DHS developed [an unclassified online
    training](https://www.dhs.gov/nationwide-sar-initiative-nsi/online-sar-training)
    on identifying, evaluating, and reporting suspicious activities
    designed for non-governmental partners, including faith-based and
    community-based organizations.  
-   DHS enabled faith-based partners to access threat information and
    products via the [Homeland Security Information Network
    (HSIN)](https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-information-network-hsin),
    which serves as the Department’s secure platform for sharing
    unclassified threat information. This includes information on
    threats to faith-based groups, facilities, and houses of worship, as
    well as potential motivators to violence related to religion. DHS
    field-based personnel also directly engage with faith-based
    organizations to share threat information, as well as resources
    available to support faith-based organizations’ efforts to prevent,
    protect against, and respond to threats.  
-   The [National Counterterrorism
    Center](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/nctc-how-we-work/joint-ct-assessment-team)
    updated the [*Threats Against Houses of Worship Highlight the
    Importance of Religious Community
    Outreach*](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/jcat/firstresponderstoolbox/129S_-_First_Responders_Toolbox_-_Threats_Against_Houses_of_Worship_Highlight_the_Importance_of_Religious_Community_Outreach.pdf)
    product, which raises awareness of potential threats to houses of
    worship, faith-based organizations, and faith leaders and recommends
    best practices for engaging religious communities.  
-   Federal partners have developed and deployed the following services
    designed to support faith-based organizations, including:
    -   [Tabletop Exercise
        Packages](https://www.cisa.gov/cisa-tabletop-exercises-packages)
        to assist faith-based stakeholders in conducting their own
        exercises, with scenarios including active shooters, vehicle
        ramming, and improvised explosive devices.  
    -   A
        [webinar](https://www.fema.gov/event/preventing-targeted-violence-and-protecting-safety-and-security-houses-worship-through-faith)
        highlighting best practices for preventing targeted violence and
        protecting the safety and security of houses of worship.
    -   [Guidance](https://www.usfa.fema.gov/prevention/outreach/arson-prevention/protecting-houses-of-worship.html#:~:text=Protecting%20Houses%20of%20Worship%20Against%C2%A0Arson)
        for houses of worship to protect themselves against acts of
        arson. 
    -   [Protecting Places of Worship
        Forums](https://www.justice.gov/crs/our-work/facilitation/protecting-places-of-worship)
        to provide faith-based leaders and congregations with
        information about hate crimes committed on the basis of
        religion, state and federal hate crimes laws, law enforcement
        threat assessments, and ways to protect places of worship from
        potential hate crimes and other threats of violence.

**Expanding engagement with faith-based and community-based
organizations, including historically underrepresented communities**

-   In support of [National Preparedness
    Month](https://www.ready.gov/september) in September 2022, DHS will
    launch a national week of action encouraging faith-based and
    community organizations to safeguard people and places through
    partnerships with local emergency managers and first responders.
    This week of action will include virtual and in-person workshops and
    the release of multi-media content for faith-based and
    community-based organizations.  
-   The Protecting Places of Worship Interagency Policy Committee plans
    to launch a network promoting peer-to peer learning on protecting
    places of worship and community spaces. Opportunities for
    faith-based and community organizations to join the partnership
    network will be available starting late fall of 2022.

**Making grant programs more accessible and equitable**

-   DHS has simplified the NSGP application process by developing a
    “quick-start guide” to help nonprofit organizations navigate the
    process. To ensure that current and future NSGP awardees know what
    is required and expected to successfully manage a grant award, DHS
    will offer a *Post-Award Grants Management* webinar series specific
    for nonprofit organizations as awardees.  
-   Nonprofit organizations located in socially vulnerable areas (as
    determined by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Social
    Vulnerability Index) as well as nonprofit organizations that have
    never received a NSGP award will receive bonus points in the final
    scoring methodology to help strengthen their ability to be selected
    for funding.  
-   DHS added a new priority to its fiscal year 2022 [Targeted Violence
    and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP)](https://www.dhs.gov/tvtpgrants)
    Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO): *Advancing Equity in Awards
    and Engaging Underserved Communities in Prevention. * The TVTP Grant
    Program team developed and implemented a communications plan to
    increase the diversity of applicants for the program.  
-   DOJ is making more of its [grant programs on hate
    crimes](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/programs-that-address-hate-crimes.pdf),
    as well as it training and technical assistance, more accessible and
    user-friendly to a wide array of stakeholders. For example, DOJ
    posted several solicitations that provide priority consideration to
    applicants that propose projects addressing equity or the removal of
    barriers to access and opportunity for communities that have been
    historically marginalized, underserved, and adversely affected by
    inequality.  
-   In the fall of 2022, DOJ will begin a series of webinars to help
    community-based and culturally-specific organizations (including
    faith-based organizations) apply for federal grants, be able to
    sustain and grow their programming, and better support
    culturally-specific innovation and services.
