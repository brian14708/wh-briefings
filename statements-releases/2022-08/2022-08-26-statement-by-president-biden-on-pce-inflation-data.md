Last month incomes were up, and overall prices were down – that’s
according to an important measure of inflation, which showed prices
actually came down nationwide last month.  In other words, while the
price of some things went up, the price of other things went down by
even more.  The American people are starting to get some relief from
high prices, and the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed last month
will also help bring prices down.  
  
Gas prices decreased every day this summer – the fastest decline in over
a decade. And, today’s report showed that personal income was up last
month as well.

We have more work to do. We have to help families who have been squeezed
by decades living paycheck to paycheck.  But today confirms that our
economic plan is building the economy from the bottom up and the middle
out and we are making progress.
