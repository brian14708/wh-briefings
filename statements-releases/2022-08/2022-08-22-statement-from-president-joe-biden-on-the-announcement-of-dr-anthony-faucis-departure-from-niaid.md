  s Departure from\_NIAID"

During my time as Vice President, I worked closely with Dr. Anthony
Fauci on the United States’ response to Zika and Ebola. I came to know
him as a dedicated public servant, and a steady hand with wisdom and
insight honed over decades at the forefront of some of our most
dangerous and challenging public health crises. When it came time to
build a team to lead our COVID-19 response – in fact, in one of my first
calls as President-elect – I immediately asked Dr. Fauci to extend his
service as my Chief Medical Advisor to deal with the COVID-19 crisis our
nation faced.  In that role, I’ve been able to call him at any hour of
the day for his advice as we’ve tackled this once-in-a-generation
pandemic.  His commitment to the work is unwavering, and he does it with
an unparalleled spirit, energy, and scientific integrity. 

Dr. Fauci has served under seven Republican and Democratic Presidents
during his career, beginning with Ronald Reagan.  He was awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008 under President George W. Bush. 
For almost four decades, he has served as Director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, helping our country
navigate health crises ranging from HIV/AIDS to COVID-19.  Because of
Dr. Fauci’s many contributions to public health, lives here in the
United States and around the world have been saved.  As he leaves his
position in the U.S. Government, I know the American people and the
entire world will continue to benefit from Dr. Fauci’s expertise in
whatever he does next. Whether you’ve met him personally or not, he has
touched all Americans’ lives with his work. I extend my deepest thanks
for his public service. The United States of America is stronger, more
resilient, and healthier because of him.
