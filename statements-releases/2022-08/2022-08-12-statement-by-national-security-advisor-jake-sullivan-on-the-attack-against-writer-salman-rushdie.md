title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Attack Against\
  \ Writer Salman\_Rushdie"
---
 
Today, the country and the world witnessed a reprehensible attack
against the writer Salman Rushdie.  This act of violence is appalling.
 All of us in the Biden-Harris Administration are praying for his speedy
recovery.  We are thankful to good citizens and first responders for
helping Mr. Rushdie so quickly after the attack and to law enforcement
for its swift and effective work, which is ongoing.
