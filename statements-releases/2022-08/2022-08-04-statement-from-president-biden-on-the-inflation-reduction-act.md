title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Inflation Reduction\_Act"
---
 
Tonight, we’ve taken another critical step toward reducing inflation and
the cost of living for America’s families.  The Inflation Reduction Act
will help Americans save money on prescription drugs, health premiums,
and much more.  It will make our tax system more fair by making
corporations pay a minimum tax.  It will not raise taxes on those making
less than $400,000, and it will reduce the deficit.  It also makes the
largest investment in history in combatting climate change and
increasing energy security, creating jobs here in the US and saving
people money on their energy costs.  I look forward to the Senate taking
up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible
