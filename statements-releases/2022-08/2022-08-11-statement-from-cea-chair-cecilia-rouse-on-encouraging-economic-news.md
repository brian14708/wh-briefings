title: "Statement from CEA Chair Cecilia Rouse on Encouraging Economic\_News"
---
 
We are continuing to see encouraging economic developments, including
strong job growth and lower energy prices.

First, consumer price data showed headline inflation was 0.0% last
month. This moderation compared to the month before was driven by
declining gas prices, and lower prices for clothes, air fares,
electronics, used cars, and more.

Second, new data today shows declining prices that producers pay to make
the goods and services that consumers and businesses buy, such as
gasoline, jet fuel, iron and steel.

And third, the average national price for a gallon of gasoline fell
below $4 today. This is providing much needed breathing room for
families across the country.

While the news from this week is encouraging, we have more work to do to
bring inflation down, without giving up the substantial economic and
labor market gains of the past year. Congress should pass the Inflation
Reduction Act as soon as possible, which will help our economy address
some of its most important near-term and long-term challenges.
