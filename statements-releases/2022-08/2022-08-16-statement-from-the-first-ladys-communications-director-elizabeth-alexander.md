After testing negative for COVID-19 on Monday during her regular testing
cadence, the First Lady began to develop cold-like symptoms late in the
evening. She tested negative again on a rapid antigen test, but a PCR
test came back positive. The First Lady is double-vaccinated, twice
boosted, and only experiencing mild symptoms. She has been prescribed a
course of Paxlovid and, following CDC guidance, will isolate from others
for at least five days. Close contacts of the First Lady have been
notified. She is currently staying at a private residence in South
Carolina and will return home after she receives two consecutive
negative COVID tests.
