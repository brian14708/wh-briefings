title: "Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of\
  \ the Senate on the Alternative Plan for Pay Adjustments for Civilian Federal\_\
  Employees"
---
 
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
I am transmitting an alternative plan for pay adjustments for civilian
Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay
systems in January 2023.  
  
Title 5, United States Code, authorizes me to implement alternative
plans for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees covered by the
General Schedule and certain other pay systems if, because of “national
emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare,”
I view the increases that would otherwise take effect as
inappropriate.  
  
Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to exercise my
authority to set alternative pay adjustments for 2023 pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 5303(b) and 5 U.S.C. 5304a.  
  
Specifically, I have determined that for 2023, the across-the-board base
pay increase will be 4.1 percent and locality pay increases will average
0.5 percent, resulting in an overall average increase of 4.6 percent for
civilian Federal employees, consistent with the assumption in my 2023
Budget.  
  
Federal agencies have witnessed growing recruitment and retention
challenges with Federal positions experiencing eroded compensation.
 Multiple years of lower pay raises for Federal civilian employees than
called for under regular law have resulted in a substantial pay gap for
Federal employees compared to the private sector.  The American people
rely on Federal agencies being managed and staffed by skilled, talented,
and engaged employees, including those possessing critical skills sets,
which requires keeping Federal pay competitive.  This alternative pay
plan decision will allow the Federal Government to better compete in the
labor market to attract and retain a well‑qualified Federal workforce.  
  
The adjustment described above shall take effect on the first day of the
first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

                               Sincerely,  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
