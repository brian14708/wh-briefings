title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the 59th Anniversary of the March on\
  \ Washington"
---
 
On a hot summer day 59 years ago, hundreds of thousands of Americans
descended on Washington to redeem the soul of America. They marched for
jobs and the dignity of work. They marched for the freedom to cast a
ballot or sit at a lunch counter. They marched to hear a preacher’s
timeless dream: an America of possibilities and equal opportunity for
all Americans.  
   
As we face another inflection point in our nation’s history, I’m proud
that my Administration has worked every day to bring us closer to that
dream. On my very first day in office, I signed a historic executive
order to make advancing racial justice and equity a priority across the
entire federal government, as well as another executive order on the
anniversary of Bloody Sunday directing my Administration to expand
access to the sacred right to vote. I signed the landmark Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, making historic investments in communities that were
far too often overlooked or underserved. When Congress failed to act, I
signed an executive order to advance effective, accountable policing and
enhance both public safety and public trust.  
   
But we have much more to do. Nearly six decades later, this day reminds
us of how far we’ve come, where we need to go, and how far and how much
longer the journey is. And it reminds us that each of us must engage in
the painstaking work of perfecting our union. As John Lewis, the
youngest speaker that day, taught us, “Democracy is not a state. It is
an act.”  
   
For Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for John Lewis, and for all those who
have fought for a better America, we must march on.
