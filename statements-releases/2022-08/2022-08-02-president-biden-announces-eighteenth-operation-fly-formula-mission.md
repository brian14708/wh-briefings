*Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of 259,131 8-ounce
bottle equivalents of Nestlé Health Science Alfamino*® *Infant and
Alfamino*® *Junior formula on August 3*

Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
one flight, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Nestlé Health
Science amino acid-based formula from Luxembourg to Chicago, Illinois on
August 3. This delivery will include approximately 19,291 pounds of
Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® Infantand Alfamino® Junior formula, the
equivalent of *259,131* 8-ounce bottles. These products will be
distributed primarily to hospitals and home health care providers and
are intended for use under medical supervision.  
  
In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency
is exercising enforcement discretion so that Nestlé can export
additional infant formula into the U.S. Nestlé will import both standard
and specialty infant formulas including Nestlé NAN® SupremePro 1, Nestlé
NAN® SupremePro 2, Nestlé NAN® EXPERTpro SensiPro Premium Instant
Starter Formula, Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® Infant and Alfamino®
Junior, Vitaflo PKU start™, Gerber® Good Start® Gentle and Gerber® Good
Start® Extensive HA®. Over time Nestlé plans to bring approximately 42
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market.  
  
President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to bring  infant formula from overseas that meet
U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves,
hospitals and home health care providers faster. To date, Operation Fly
Formula has transported nearly 64 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to
the U.S.  
  
In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
at [whitehouse.gov/formula](http://www.whitehouse.gov/formula).
