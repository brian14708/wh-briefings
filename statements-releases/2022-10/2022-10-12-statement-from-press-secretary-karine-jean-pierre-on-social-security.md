Tomorrow, seniors and other Americans on Social Security are will learn
precisely how much their monthly checks will increase – but experts
forecast it will be $140 per month, on average, starting in January. For
the first time in over a decade, seniors’ Medicare premiums will
decrease even as their Social Security checks increase.   
   
This means that seniors will have a chance to get ahead of inflation,
due to the rare combination of rising benefits and falling premiums.  We
will put more money in their pockets and provide them with a little
extra breathing room.  
   
MAGA Republicans in Congress continue to threaten Social Security and
Medicare – proposing to put them on the chopping block every five years,
threatening benefits, and to change eligibility. If Republicans in
Congress have their way, seniors will pay more for prescription drugs
and their Social Security benefits will never be secure. The President
has a different approach – one that continues the progress we’ve made
and saves seniors money.
