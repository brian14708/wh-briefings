National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today in Istanbul with Head
of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak. Mr. Sullivan
underscored the United States’ steadfast support for Ukraine’s
sovereignty and territorial integrity. He conveyed that the United
States and its allies and partners will not be deterred by Russia’s
flagrant violations of international law, including the United Nations
Charter, and will impose severe costs on any individual, entity, or
country that provides support to Russia’s purported annexation.  The two
discussed the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant
and Ukraine’s continued work with the United Nations to export food to
the world. Mr. Sullivan emphasized the United States is committed to
supporting the Ukrainian people as they defend their sovereignty and
democracy, including via the $12 billion in additional assistance that
President Biden recently signed into law.
