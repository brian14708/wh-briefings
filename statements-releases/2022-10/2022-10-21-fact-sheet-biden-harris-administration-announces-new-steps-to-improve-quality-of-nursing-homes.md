title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Steps to Improve\
  \ Quality of Nursing\_Homes"
---
 
For far too long, nursing home residents have been victims of an
industry with little accountability to keep American seniors safe and
protected. COVID-19 has laid bare the challenges in America’s nursing
homes, with [over 200,000 residents and
staff](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/over-200000-residents-and-staff-in-long-term-care-facilities-have-died-from-covid-19/)
dying from COVID-19. That’s why in his State of the Union, President
Biden [launched an action
plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet-protecting-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-by-improving-safety-and-quality-of-care-in-the-nations-nursing-homes/)
to improve the safety and quality of care in the nation’s nursing homes.
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to increase
accountability of bad actors in the nursing home industry, improve the
quality of nursing homes and make them safer. These efforts complement
the Administration’s [investments in home and community-based
services](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/home-community-based-services/guidance/strengthening-and-investing-home-and-community-based-services-for-medicaid-beneficiaries-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-section-9817/index.html)
to prevent unnecessary nursing home admissions and [help nursing home

when possible.

**More Aggressive Enforcement for the Worst-Performing Nursing Homes**  
Today, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced
new actions to significantly strengthen accountability for nursing homes
in the Special Focus Facilities (SFF) Program, an oversight program for
the poorest performing nursing homes in the country. The SFF Program
already provides more frequent inspections of these nursing homes, but
more action is needed to ensure these nursing homes improve.

The SFF Program reforms announced for the first time today:

-   **Increase penalties for nursing homes in the program that fail to
    improve**: CMS will, effective immediately, begin using escalating
    penalties for violations, including considering facilities with
    citations for dangerous violations in two successive inspections for
    termination from Medicare and/or Medicaid funding.
-   **Increase safety standards for improvement**: Under today’s
    changes, CMS is increasing the requirements that nursing homes in
    the SFF Program must meet to be successful and graduate from the
    program. Even after a facility graduates from the program, CMS will
    now continue close scrutiny of the facility for at least 3
    years—helping ensure these nursing homes consistently maintain
    compliance with safety requirements.
-   **Increase technical assistance:** CMS is also increasing its
    engagement with these poor-performing nursing homes, through direct
    and immediate outreach by CMS officials upon their selection as an
    SFF, to help them understand how to improve and to access support
    resources like CMS Quality Improvement Organizations.

**More Resources to Support Good-Paying, Union Jobs in Nursing Home
Care**  
Sufficient, high-quality staffing is the measure most closely linked to
the quality-of-care residents receive. Creating good-paying, union jobs
in the nursing home industry—and career pathways into those
jobs—promotes the “double dignity” of both patients and workers. That’s
why today the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the
Department of Labor (“DOL”) are highlighting funds that are newly
available to support pathways into good-quality nursing jobs—including
for the nursing home workforce:

-   **A wide variety of workforce stakeholders can apply for $80 million
    in grant funding available right now**: Now through January 6,
    nonprofit healthcare organizations, industry organizations or trade
    groups, labor unions, labor management organizations, education and
    training providers, workforce development entities, and Native
    American Tribal Governments can [apply for the DOL’s Nursing
    Expansion Grant
    program](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=341995),
    which will provide $80 million in grants to help address bottlenecks
    in training the U.S. nursing workforce and expand and diversify the
    pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. Specifically, these
    funds will help: 1) increase the number of clinical and vocational
    nursing instructors and educators, and 2) train frontline healthcare
    professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers,
    to advance along a career pathway and attain recognized
    postsecondary credentials, including Licensed Practical Nurses and
    Registered Nurses. This program will emphasize training those from
    historically marginalized and underrepresented populations, which
    helps to address the growing health equity gap in medically
    underserved communities.
-   **HHS** **is announcing** **$13 million in grants to expand nursing
    education and training**: These funds made available through the
    Health Resources and Services Administration will help expand the
    number of nursing preceptors—experienced licensed clinicians who
    supervise nursing students during their clinical rotations.
    Expanding preceptors will help support the goal of nursing schools
    admitting more students by providing more opportunities for
    well-supported clinical rotations and, ultimately, career paths. 
-   **HHS and DOL will provide opportunities to apply for additional
    federal funds to support the nursing workforce pipeline**: HHS and
    DOL have identified hundreds of millions of dollars in funds coming
    online over the next year to help improve nurse staffing and
    workforce sustainability. The Biden-Harris Administration encourages
    eligible entities to braid these programs to attract and retain
    high-quality workers to serve in healthcare professions such as
    nursing aides, home health aides, and registered nurses:
    -   By the end of this year, DOL’s Employment and Training
        Administration’s (ETA’s)
        [**YouthBuild**](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/youth/youthbuild)
        will make available approximately $90 million in grant funding
        for eligible nonprofit organizations or consortia eligible to
        provide education or employment training under a Federal
        program, in order to provide job training and educational
        opportunities for at-risk youth, with over one-third of recent
        grantees offering healthcare-related training.
    -   On a rolling basis, ETA’s [**National Dislocated Worker Grants
        program**](https://dwg.workforcegps.org/) makes tens of millions
        or more in grant funding available to eligible States, outlying
        areas designated by the Governor, and organizations eligible for
        funding through the Native American Programs to develop training
        in entry-level nursing occupations such as Certified Nursing
        Assistant, Medical Assisting, and Physical Therapy. These funds
        help develop training after major economic dislocations, such as
        plant closures, mass layoffs, or higher-than-average demand for
        employment and training activities for dislocated members of the
        Armed Forces and their spouses—with approximately three-quarters
        of grantees connecting participants to careers in healthcare.
    -   In the first half of 2023, ETA’s [**WORC Initiative
        Grants**](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/dislocated-workers/grants/workforce-opportunity)
        will make available up to $35 million in grants to eligible
        State Government, County Government, City or Township
        Government, Special District Government, Regional Organization,
        Independent School District, Public/State Controlled Institution
        of Higher Education, Private Institution of Higher Education,
        Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Indian/Native
        American Tribal Governments. These grant funds enable impacted
        communities to develop local and regional workforce development
        solutions aligned with existing economic development strategies
        and community partnerships to promote new, sustainable job
        opportunities and long-term economic vitality, all to support
        dislocated workers, new entrants to the workforce, and incumbent
        workers for good jobs in high-demand occupations including
        behavioral health, dental health, and health IT.

**Building On Other Nursing Home Reform Progress**  
Today’s efforts build on the many other actions the Biden-Harris
Administration has already taken to improve nursing home quality and
accountability since President Biden announced the Nursing Home Reform
Action Plan in the State of the Union:

-   **Establishing minimum staffing requirements:** CMS [launched a
    public input process and research
    study](https://www.cms.gov/blog/centers-medicare-medicaid-services-staffing-study-inform-minimum-staffing-requirements-nursing-homes)
    that will inform future rulemaking on a minimum staffing
    requirement, and the proposed rule is on track for release by Spring
    2023.
-   **Cracking down on illegal debt collection:** [CMS is working with
    the Consumer Financial Protection
    Bureau](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/09/08/hhs-joins-cfpb-protect-nursing-home-residents-and-their-caregivers-illegal-debt-collection-practices.html)
    to crack down on nursing homes that illegally hold families
    responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.
-   **Increasing transparency & accountability:** CMS made available
    more [data on who owns Medicare-certified nursing
    homes](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/09/26/biden-harris-administration-makes-more-medicare-nursing-home-ownership-data-publicly-available-improving-identification-of-multiple-facilities-under-common-ownership.html),
    helping empower families who are comparison shopping to understand
    whether a nursing home is part of a bad chain. CMS also released
    data publicly—for the first time—on mergers, acquisitions,
    consolidations, and changes of ownership for nursing homes and
    hospitals enrolled in Medicare.
-   **Incentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid
    funding:** CMS issued [a final rule updating Medicare payment
    policies and
    rates](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-acts-improve-safety-and-quality-care-nations-nursing-homes)
    for fiscal year (FY) 2023, including a nearly billion dollar payment
    increase and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality
    Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program. CMS
    also [issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid
    authorities to drive better health
    outcomes](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-encourages-states-use-medicaid-payments-nursing-homes-drive-better-health-outcomes-residents)
    for nursing home residents and improve staff pay, training, and
    retention efforts—i.e., to tie Medicaid payments to measures of
    safety and quality of care.
-   **Improving families’ ability to comparison shop:** CMS [launched
    its enhanced Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating
    System](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-enhances-nursing-home-rating-system-staffing-and-turnover-data),
    integrating data on nursing homes’ weekend staffing rates for nurses
    and information on annual turnover among nurses and administrators.
    The updated Star Ratings increase transparency to make it easier for
    families to comparison shop to find the reliable, quality care their
    loved ones deserve.
-   **Preventing fraudsters from receiving Medicare funds:** CMS
    [issued](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/29/2022-14562/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-cy-2023-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-and-other)
    a proposed rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted
    for federal background checks to be eligible for Medicare funds,
    preventing abuse and Medicare fraud by nursing home owners.
-   **Ensuring pandemic preparedness:** CMS [updated its
    guidance](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-issues-significant-updates-improve-safety-and-quality-care-long-term-care-residents-and-calls)
    to nursing home inspectors, including, among other things, requiring
    infection control specialists to be on site—not just off-site
    consultants as the prior Administration allowed.
