title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Unanimous UN Security\
  \ Council Vote Addressing the Situation in\_Haiti"
---
 
Todayâ€™s decision at the United Nations Security Council is an important
step to help the people of Haiti during this critical time. The rapid
and unanimous vote in support of the Security Council resolution
proposed by Mexico and the United States, to impose sanctions measures
and hold accountable those actors who are undermining stability in
Haiti, reflects the commitment from the international community to
address the challenges contributing to the dire humanitarian situation
in Haiti. These measures will target not only those engaging in or
fomenting violence across Haiti, but also those who fund them.

The United States remains committed to supporting the people of Haiti.
We recently delivered Haitian government-purchased security equipment,
including tactical and armored vehicles and supplies, that will assist
the Haitian National Police in their fight against criminal actors. And
USAID staff is on the ground now working alongside Haitian health
workers and NGOs to respond to the cholera outbreak and deliver care to
those who need it. We will also continue to engage the international
community on additional actions we can take at the United Nations.
