title: "Statement by President\_Joe\_Biden on Breakthrough Diplomacy in the Middle\_\
  East"
---
 
Today, I am pleased to announce a historic breakthrough in the Middle
East.  After months of mediation by the United States, the Governments
of Israel and Lebanon have agreed to formally end their maritime
boundary dispute and establish a permanent maritime boundary between
them.  I have just spoken with the Prime Minister of Israel, Yair Lapid,
and the President of Lebanon, Michel Aoun, who confirmed the readiness
of both governments to move forward with this agreement.  I want to also
thank President Emmanuel Macron of France and his government for their
support in these negotiations.  
   
Energy—particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean—should serve as the
tool for cooperation, stability, security, and prosperity, not for
conflict.  The agreement announced by both governments today will
provide for the development of energy fields for the benefit of both
countries, setting the stage for a more stable and prosperous region,
and harnessing vital new energy resources for the world. 
It is now critical that all parties uphold their commitments and work
towards implementation.  
   
This agreement also protects Israel’s security and economic interests
critical to promoting its regional integration.  It provides Lebanon the
space to begin its own exploitation of energy resources.  And it
promotes the interests of the United States and the American people in a
more stable, prosperous, and integrated Middle East region, with reduced
risks of new conflicts.   
   
I want to thank our diplomats and everyone across the U.S. government,
past and present, who have worked tirelessly on this bipartisan issue
throughout the years.  Persistent U.S. diplomacy, paired with the
openness of Israeli and Lebanese leaders to negotiate, consult, and
ultimately choose what was in the best interests of their people, led to
this breakthrough.   
   
I congratulate everyone involved.
