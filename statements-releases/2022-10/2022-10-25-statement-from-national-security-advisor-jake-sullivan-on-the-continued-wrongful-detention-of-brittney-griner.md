title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Continued Wrongful\
  \ Detention of Brittney\_Griner"
---
 
We are aware of the news out of Russia that Brittney Griner will
continue to be wrongfully detained under intolerable circumstances after
having to undergo another sham judicial proceeding today. President
Biden has been very clear that Brittney should be released immediately.
In recent weeks, the Biden-Harris Administration has continued to engage
with Russia through every available channel and make every effort to
bring home Brittney as well as to support and advocate for other
Americans detained in Russia, including fellow wrongful detainee Paul
Whelan. The President has demonstrated that he is willing to go to
extraordinary lengths and make tough decisions to bring Americans home,
as his Administration has done successfully from countries around the
world. The Administration remains in regular touch with representatives
of the families, and we continue to admire their courage in the face of
these unimaginable circumstances.
