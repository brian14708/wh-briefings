*  
Task Force Discussed Implementing the Historic Environmental and Clean
Energy Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, upcoming COP27
Meeting, Environmental Justice*

Yesterday, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation
and Implementation John Podesta and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi
convened a meeting of the National Climate Task Force to discuss
implementing President Biden’s historic Inflation Reduction Act and how
it will lower energy costs for American families, promote energy
security, create good-paying jobs, advance environmental justice, and
position the U.S. to meet the President’s ambitious climate goals.

The Task Force received a briefing from Secretary of Treasury Janet
Yellen on the ongoing work to provide guidance for taxpayers on
Inflation Reduction Act provisions that benefit consumers and support
the deployment of clean energy technologies. The Task Force also
received a briefing from Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John
Kerry on the upcoming COP27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, as
well as a briefing from Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda
Mallory on how the Administration is advancing the President’s
commitment to environmental justice and delivering on the President’s
Justice40 commitment.

The Inflation Reduction Act is the most aggressive action on climate in
American history, and together with bold actions from across the Task
Force agencies and investments from the President’s other legislative
accomplishments, including the American Rescue Plan, the CHIPS and
Science Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the United States is
leading the world once again on the international stage. The Task Force
reaffirmed that climate change disproportionately impacts low-income
communities and communities of color, and members committed to
prioritize programs in the Inflation Reduction Act alongside other
executive actions that address legacy pollution, and ensure that all
Americans can benefit from the job creation opportunities and lower
costs associated with clean energy.

As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 [Executive Order on Tackling
the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/)
