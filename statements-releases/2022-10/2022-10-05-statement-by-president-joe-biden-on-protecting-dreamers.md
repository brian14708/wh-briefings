title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Protecting\_Dreamers"
---
 
I am disappointed in today’s Fifth Circuit decision holding that DACA is
unlawful. The court’s stay provides a temporary reprieve for DACA
recipients but one thing remains clear: the lives of Dreamers remain in
limbo. Today’s decision is the result of continued efforts by Republican
state officials to strip DACA recipients of the protections and work
authorization that many have now held for over a decade. And while we
will use the tools we have to allow Dreamers to live and work in the
only country they know as home, it is long past time for Congress to
pass permanent protections for Dreamers, including a pathway to
citizenship. 

My Administration is committed to defending Dreamers against attacks
from Republican officials in Texas and other States. This challenge to
DACA is just another example of the extreme agenda being pushed by
MAGA-Republican officials.
