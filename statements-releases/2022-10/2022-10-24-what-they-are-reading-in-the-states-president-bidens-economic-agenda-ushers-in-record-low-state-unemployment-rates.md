title: "What They Are Reading in the States: President\_Biden\u2019s Economic Agenda\
  \ Ushers in Record Low State Unemployment\_Rates"
---
 
Across the country, local news outlets are reporting on  how the
historic Biden economic recovery has led to another consecutive month of
historic job growth and record low unemployment in several states.

In September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics:

-   17 states had unemployment rates at or below 3 percent.
-   11 states and the District of Columbia either set new records or
    matched records for their lowest unemployment rates since the
    beginning of the state data series in 1976.
-   All 50 States and the District of Columbia had their unemployment
    rate decrease or remain unchanged from a year earlier.

This data is further proof that President Biden’s economic agenda is
working, and that the U.S. economy is moving from a historically strong
economic recovery to more steady and stable growth.

Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is below the national average. According
to White House data released today, Wisconsin’s rate is 3.2%. The
national average is at 3.5%. In a one-on-one interview with News 8 Now,
one of President Biden’s economic advisors says Wisconsin’s economy is
strong. Jared Bernstein also touted the president’s work to decrease the
deficit by a record $1.4 trillion. **“Wisconsin is a good example of
that where we have an unemployment rate of close to three percent in the
state, lot of people work which means they’re drawing paychecks and it
also is good news for deficit reduction so we’re glad to see that,” said
Jared Bernstein, member of the president’s council of economic
advisors.**
