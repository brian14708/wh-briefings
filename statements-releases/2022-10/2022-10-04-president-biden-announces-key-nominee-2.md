WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate
Vivek Murthy to serve as Representative of the United States on the
Executive Board of the World Health Organization alongside his continued
duties as Surgeon General.

Dr. Vivek H. Murthy was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in March 2021 to
serve as the 21st Surgeon General of the United States. He previously
served as the 19th Surgeon General under President Obama. As the
Nation’s Doctor, the Surgeon General’s mission is to help lay the
foundation for a healthier country, relying on the best scientific
information available to provide clear, consistent, and equitable
guidance and resources for the public. While serving as 21st Surgeon
General, Dr. Murthy is focused on drawing attention to and working
across government to address a number of critical public health issues,
including the growing proliferation of health misinformation, the
ongoing youth mental health crisis, well-being and burnout in the health
worker community, and social isolation and loneliness.

As the Vice Admiral of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned
Corps, Dr. Murthy also commands a uniformed service of over 6,000
dedicated public health officers, serving the most underserved and
vulnerable populations. The first Surgeon General of Indian descent, Dr.
Murthy was raised in Miami and is a graduate of Harvard, the Yale School
of Medicine, and the Yale School of Management. A renowned physician,
research scientist, entrepreneur, and author, he lives in Washington, DC
with his wife, Dr. Alice Chen, and their two children.
