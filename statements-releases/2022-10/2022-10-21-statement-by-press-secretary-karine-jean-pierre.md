Tonight’s temporary order does not prevent borrowers from applying for
student debt relief at studentaid.gov – and we encourage eligible
borrowers to join the nearly 22 million Americans whose information the
Department of Education already has. It also does not prevent us from
reviewing these applications and preparing them for transmission to loan
servicers.   
   
It is also important to note that the order does not reverse the trial
court’s dismissal of the case, or suggest that the case has merit.  It
merely prevents debt from being discharged until the court makes a
decision.  
   
We will continue to move full speed ahead in our preparations in
compliance with this order. And, the Administration will continue to
fight Republican officials suing to block our efforts to provide relief
to working families.
