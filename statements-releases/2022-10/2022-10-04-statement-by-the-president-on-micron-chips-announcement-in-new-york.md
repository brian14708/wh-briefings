title: "Statement by the President on Micron Chips Announcement in New\_York"
---
 
To those who doubted that America could dominate the industries of the
future, I say this – you should never bet against the American people. 
Today is another win for America, and another massive new investment in
America spurred by my economic plan.  Micron, an American company, is
investing $20 billion dollars this decade and up to $100 billion over
twenty years in CHIPS manufacturing in upstate New York, creating tens
of thousands of good paying jobs.  Together, we are building an economy
from the bottom up and the middle out, where we lower costs for our
families and make it right here in America.
