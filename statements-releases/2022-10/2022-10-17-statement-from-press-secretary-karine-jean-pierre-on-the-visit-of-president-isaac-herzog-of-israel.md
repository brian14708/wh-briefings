President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Isaac Herzog of
Israel to the White House on October 26, a visit that underscores the
enduring partnership and friendship between the United States and
Israel.  They will consult on key issues, including regional and global
challenges of mutual concern, opportunities to deepen Israel’s regional
integration, and ways to advance equal measures of freedom, prosperity,
and security for both Israelis and Palestinians.  President Herzog will
be in Washington October 25-26 for meetings with a range of interagency
officials.
