Jill and I wish a happy Diwali to the more than one billion Hindus,
Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists celebrating this Festival of Lights in the
United States, India, and around the world. As we host the official
White House Diwali reception, we are honored to light the diya
surrounded by members of the most diverse Administration in American
history—led by Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black American
and South Asian American to become Vice President.

On this day, we give thanks for the optimism, courage, and empathy
demonstrated by the incredible South Asian community all across America.
Together, South Asian Americans reflect the soul of who we are as a
nation, whether helping us emerge stronger from this pandemic, building
an economy that works for everyone, or serving and protecting our
communities and our country.

But, even as we celebrate this gathering of light, we know—as this
community has experienced too often—that there is always darkness
lurking. American history has been a constant struggle between the
American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that
that we have never fully lived up to it. By marking the victory of light
over darkness, Diwali is a reminder that each of us has the power to
bring light to the world, whether here in America or around the world.

With prayers, dances, fireworks, and sweets, may all who observe Diwali
enjoy the chance to celebrate and connect, to feel the pride of
community, and to remember the power in the gathering of light.
