title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Honda and LG Investments in\_Ohio"
---
 
It’s another win for America and another win for Ohio, with Honda and LG
committing more than $5 billion toward electric vehicle battery
manufacturing and factory retooling across the state. As I said at the
groundbreaking of Intel’s Ohio factory last month: it’s time to bury the
label ‘Rust Belt.’ Just as my CHIPS and Science Act is spurring record
investments in communities across the country, my Inflation Reduction
Act is driving a manufacturing boom for electric vehicles. This has been
the backbone of my economic plan: America is leading the world again,
rebuilding our supply chains, infrastructure, and manufacturing here at
home.
