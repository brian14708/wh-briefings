title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with President Zelenskyy of\_Ukraine"
---
 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., joined by Vice President Kamala Harris,
spoke today with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to underscore
that the United States will never recognize Russia’s purported
annexation of Ukrainian territory. President Biden pledged to continue
supporting Ukraine as it defends itself from Russian aggression for as
long as it takes, including the provision today of a new $625 million
security assistance package that includes additional weapons and
equipment, including HIMARS, artillery systems and ammunition, and
armored vehicles.  President Biden also affirmed the continued readiness
of the United States to impose severe costs on any individual, entity,
or country that provides support to Russia’s purported annexation. He
welcomed the success of the agreement that has allowed the safe export
of Ukrainian grain to global markets and the need to ensure that
continues.  In addition, President Biden noted the ongoing efforts of
the United States to rally the world behind Ukraine’s efforts to defend
its freedom and democracy, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter.
