The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea’s (DPRK) dangerous and reckless decision to launch a long-range
ballistic missile over Japan. This action is destabilizing and shows the
DPRK’s blatant disregard for United Nations Security Council resolutions
and international safety norms. Tonight, National Security Advisor Jake
Sullivan spoke with his Japanese and Republic of Korea (ROK)
counterparts, Secretary General Akiba Takeo of the National Security
Secretariat of Japan and National Security Office Director Kim Sung-han
of the ROK. In both calls, the National Security Advisors consulted on
appropriate and robust joint and international responses and National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan reinforced the United States’ ironclad
commitments to the defense of Japan and the ROK. The United States will
continue its efforts to limit the DPRK’s ability to advance its
prohibited ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs,
including with allies and UN partners.
