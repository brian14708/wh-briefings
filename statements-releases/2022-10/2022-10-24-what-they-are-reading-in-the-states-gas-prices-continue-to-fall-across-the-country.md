title: "What They Are Reading in the States:  Gas Prices Continue to Fall Across the\_\
  Country"
---
 
Across the country, local news outlets are reporting on declining gas
prices as the President continues to take action to lower them in the
face of Putin’s Price Hike and other supply challenges.  
  
Gas prices have declined by an average of $1.22 per gallon nationwide
since their June peak – a decline of 24% over more than 18 weeks. There
are now 38 states and the District of Columbia with average gasoline
prices of $3.99 or less, with more than two-thirds of all states
boasting prices under $3.79. Nine states have prices of $3.39 or less
and 15 states have average gasoline prices of $3.49 or less.  
  
President Biden is committed to doing everything in his power to bring
prices down for American families. This includes the President’s
announcement to extend the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve through December, his intention to repurchase oil around
$70/barrel to replenish the SPR, and his call for oil and gas companies
to pass their savings from declining oil and wholesale gas prices on to
consumers at the pump.
