  House Tribal Nations\_Summit"
---
 
The President will host the next White House Tribal Nations Summit on
November 30 and December 1 at the Department of the Interior in
Washington, D.C.  
   
Since taking office, the President has prioritized strengthening
Nation-to-Nation relationships, honoring trust and treaty obligations
with federally-recognized Tribes, and advancing Tribal sovereignty and
self-determination. Through the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the Administration
is also making historic investments in Tribal communities. Building on
the 2021 White House Tribal Nations Summit, this year’s Summit will be
an opportunity for Tribal leaders to engage directly with senior
administration officials on implementation of these key priorities, new
policies, and other important issues facing Tribal communities.
