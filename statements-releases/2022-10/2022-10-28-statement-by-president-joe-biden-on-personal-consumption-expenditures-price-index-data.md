This week, the economic reports show we are making progress on our
economic plan: lower inflation, higher incomes, and solid growth.
Inflation slowed in the third quarter, with energy prices coming down.
Gas prices have declined over $1.20 since the summer’s peak.

We have more work to do. My plan will bring down prescription drug
prices and energy costs starting next year. In January, seniors will see
their Social Security checks increase by an average of $140 a month even
as their Medicare premiums go down – the first time in a decade that has
happened. Also starting in January, billion dollar companies will face a
new requirement that they must pay taxes.

Congressional Republicans’ agenda, on the other hand, is very different.
It would drive up inflation and add to the deficit by cutting taxes for
the wealthiest Americans and large corporations. And it would raise the
cost of prescription drugs, health care, and energy for American
families.
