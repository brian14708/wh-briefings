title: "Readout of the First White\_House Leadership Summit with Manufacturing USA\
  \ Innovation Institute Network\_Directors"
---
 
Today, Assistant to the President and Director of the National Economic
Council, Brian Deese, along with Deputy NEC Director Fazili and Deputy
OMB Director Miller, convened the sixteen directors of the nation’s
[Manufacturing USA Innovation
Institute](https://www.manufacturingusa.com/institutes) for the first
time at the White House since the network’s founding in 2012. Deputy and
Under Secretaries from DOD, DOE, DOC, DOL, and USDA, along with
representatives from six additional agencies, joined this leadership
summit to discuss the critical role the Manufacturing USA network plays
in advancing a [modern American industrial
strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/13/remarks-on-executing-a-modern-american-industrial-strategy-by-nec-director-brian-deese/).

The United States is in the midst of implementing an unprecedented and
ambitious manufacturing and investment agenda following the passage of
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the
Inflation Reduction Act. This will help to strengthen our national
competitiveness, promote innovation, and revitalize local economies
nationwide. Under President Biden’s leadership, we are seeing an
historic boom in American manufacturing, with over 700,000 manufacturing
jobs created. Manufacturing jobs now exceed their pre-pandemic level by
almost 100,000, marking the first post-recession recovery in over 60
years to see an uptick in manufacturing jobs.

The Manufacturing USA institutes are an important part of that work.
They help facilitate U.S. leadership in advanced manufacturing and build
a strong workforce. The institutes work through public-private
partnership and are involved in a range of cutting-edge technologies
from robotics to additive manufacturing to biomanufacturing.

For example, [IACMI](https://www.manufacturingusa.com/institutes/iacmi)
is developing fiber-reinforced bridges that have 100-year lifespans and
are 90% lighter than concrete;
[ARM](https://www.manufacturingusa.com/institutes/arm) is advancing
robotic systems for testing COVID-19 samples that can run 24-hours a day
and test 2,000 samples per day; and
[NIIMBL](https://www.manufacturingusa.com/institutes/niimbl) is reducing
by 90% the time needed to make buffers needed for manufacturing
antibodies. Collectively, the Manufacturing USA institutes collaborate
on over 700 major technology and workforce R&D projects and have helped
more than 90,000 people get trained in advanced manufacturing. The
institutes are located in thirteen states across the country and each is
sponsored by the Department of Commerce, the Department or Defense, or
the Department of Energy.
