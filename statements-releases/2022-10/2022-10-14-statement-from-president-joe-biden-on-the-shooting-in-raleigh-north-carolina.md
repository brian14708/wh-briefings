title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Shooting in Raleigh, North\_Carolina"
---
 
Jill and I are grieving with the families in Raleigh, North Carolina,
whose loved ones were killed and wounded in yet another mass shooting in
America. We are thinking of yet another community shaken and shattered
as they mourn the loss of friends and neighbors, including an off-duty
police officer.  
  
As we mourn with the people of Raleigh, we are grateful for the law
enforcement and other first responders, including federal law
enforcement who were on the scene last night and into this morning. My
Administration is working closely with Governor Cooper to assist local
authorities in this investigation to the fullest extent needed.   
  
Enough. We’ve grieved and prayed with too many families who have had to
bear the terrible burden of these mass shootings. Too many families have
had spouses, parents, and children taken from them forever. This year,
and even in just the five months since Buffalo and Uvalde, there are too
many mass shootings across America, including ones that don’t even make
the national news.  
  
For the lives we’ve lost and the lives we can save, I took historic
action to stop gun violence in our nation, including signing the most
significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. But we must do more. We
must pass an assault weapons ban. The American people support this
commonsense action to get weapons of war off our streets. House
Democrats have already passed it. The Senate should do the same. Send it
to my desk and I’ll sign it.   
  
May God bless our fellow Americans we lost and their families and may He
grant the wounded the strength to recover in Raleigh, North Carolina.
