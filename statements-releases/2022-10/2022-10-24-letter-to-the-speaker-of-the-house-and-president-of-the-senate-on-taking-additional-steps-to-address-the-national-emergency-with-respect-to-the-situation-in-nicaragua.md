  \ Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in\_Nicaragua"

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq.*), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et
seq.*), the Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C.
1701 note), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of
1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order to take additional
steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13851 of November 27, 2018 (Blocking Property of Certain Persons
Contributing to the Situation in Nicaragua).  
  
I have determined that additional measures are necessary to address the
national emergency with respect to the situation in Nicaragua to
increase targeted pressure on the Ortega-Murillo regime to change its
malign behavior.  This will afford my Administration additional
financial tools with which to target the regime while allowing the
flexibility necessary to continue supporting the people of Nicaragua.  
  
Specifically, I find that the violent response by the Government of
Nicaragua to the protests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega
regime’s systematic dismantling and undermining of democratic
institutions and the rule of law, its use of widespread violence and
repressive tactics against its people, as well as its corruption leading
to the destabilization of Nicaragua’s economy, have not only continued,
but worsened.  Since Nicaragua’s November 2021 sham elections, the
limited remaining democratic space in the country has dramatically
shrunk as over hundreds of non-governmental organizations have been
shuttered and political prisoners have been subjected to extremely harsh
conditions.  These increased abuses of human rights and fundamental
freedoms continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  I hereby
amend Executive Order 13851 to elaborate upon measures to address the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 to address that
threat.  
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

                               Sincerely,  
  
                                        JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
