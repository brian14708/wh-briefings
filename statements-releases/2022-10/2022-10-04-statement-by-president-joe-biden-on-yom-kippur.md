For Jewish communities across the United States and around the world,
Yom Kippur is a sacred and solemn occasion. During this holiest of days,
Jews come together to fast, reflect, and repent; to take stock of their
actions in the past year, seek forgiveness, and commit to doing better
in the year to come. On this Yom Kippur, our hearts are with all
Americans in the path of Hurricane Ian, especially those whose
synagogues are shuttered and who will have to break their fast without
loved ones beside them.

At the heart of Yom Kippur is the universal truth that we are all
capable of growth and improvement. Each of us has a role to play not
only in healing the wounds we’ve inflicted on others, but in repairing
the rifts in our communities, our country, and our world. As these Days
of Awe come to a close, let us all take this opportunity to face the
injustice and inhumanity in our world honestly and resolve to do our
part to mend what is broken.

Jill and I wish an easy and meaningful fast to all who are observing Yom
Kippur in the U.S., Israel, and around the world*. G’mar Chatimah
Tovah*—may we all be sealed in the Book of Life.
