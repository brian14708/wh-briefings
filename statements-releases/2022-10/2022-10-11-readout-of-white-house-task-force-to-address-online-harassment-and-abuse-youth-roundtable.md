  \ Youth\_Roundtable"

Today, on [International Day of the
Girl](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/11/a-proclamation-on-international-day-of-the-girl-2022/),
the White House Gender Policy Council, Domestic Policy Council, and the
Department of Education convened a roundtable with youth survivors of
online harassment and abuse, alongside educators, youth and adult
advocates, and health experts.    
   
Today’s youth are using social media and online platforms more than ever
before. Screen time among teens and tweens has risen sharply over the
last decade, especially during the past two years, to approximately
eight and a half hours a day for non-school related activities for
teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18.  While there are many benefits
of digital technology, more time spent online also means more exposure
to online harms, which disproportionately impact girls—including sexual
exploitation, the non-consensual distribution of intimate images, dating
violence, sextortion, and cyberstalking.  In the U.S. and globally, half
of girls report that they are more likely to be harassed through social
media than on the street.  Of the girls who have been harassed online,
47% have been threatened with physical or sexual violence.  
   
Roundtable participants shared their experiences with varying forms of
online harassment and abuse, and underscored the serious impact on their
health and well-being, including mental health issues like chronic
stress and depression, as well as physical harm from dating partners. 
They spoke of the false dichotomy between the “offline and online”
worlds for young people, whose social connections move fluidly between
the internet and in-person.  Several participants emphasized the
disproportionate impacts of online abuse on adolescent girls, youth of
color, and LGBTQI+ youth.  One participant spoke of the exponential rise
in child sexual exploitation online, and of the permanent effects of
this trauma on adult survivors as their images continue to circulate
online.  Another participant emphasized the connection between
accelerated social media use during the pandemic and the decline in
adolescent mental health, including the alarming increase in teen
suicides, especially among girls.  
   
Participants provided recommendations to the [White House Task Force to
Address Online Harassment and
Abuse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/16/fact-sheet-presidential-memorandum-establishing-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/),
focused on ensuring access to support services, highlighted the need for
the tech sector to improve safety in the design of their products, and
discussed how parents, teachers, school administrators, and law
enforcement can compassionately and effectively support youth who have
experienced online harassment and abuse.   
   
Administration officials reaffirmed the White House’s commitment to
addressing online harassment and abuse, including through the Task
Force, and the [Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online
Harassment and
Abuse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2022/03/18/launching-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/).
 The Task Force will produce recommendations for preventing and
addressing technology-facilitated gender-based violence, and will share
guidance and resources for supporting and engaging state governments,
schools, and other public and private entities to tackle this pervasive
challenge.
