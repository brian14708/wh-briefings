National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today at the White House
with Mexico’s Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard to discuss our common
vision for North America and joint efforts to address global
challenges. The two discussed accomplishments under the U.S.-Mexico
High-Level Security Dialogue to disrupt transnational criminal
organizations responsible for human smuggling and trafficking drugs and
firearms. They discussed coordinated efforts to reduce irregular
migration and promote legal pathways, including the October 12
announcement of expanded law enforcement cooperation coupled with an
expanded legal pathway for Venezuelan nationals. The two also discussed
how the United States and Mexico – in coordination with international
partners – can continue to work together to address the humanitarian and
security crises in Haiti.
