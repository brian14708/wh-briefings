  \ Force on the Inflation Reduction\_Act"
---
 
Today, Deputy National Security Advisor Mike Pyle met with Bjoern
Seibert, Head of Cabinet to European Commission President Ursula von der
Leyen, to discuss a range of priority issues including Ukraine
reconstruction. Additionally, during today’s meeting, Mr. Pyle and Mr.
Seibert launched the US-EU Task Force on the Inflation Reduction Act to
continue promoting deeper understanding of the law’s meaningful progress
on lowering costs for families, our shared climate goals, and
opportunities and concerns for EU producers. Both sides discussed the
importance of close coordination and supporting sustainable and
resilient supply chains across the Atlantic, including to build the
clean energy economy. The first Task Force meeting will be held next
week.  
  
The Task Force builds on high-level engagement across the United States
Government, including by the White House, State Department, Treasury
Department, Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade
Representative. As the Task Force’s work gets underway, the United
States will continue high-level engagements on these
issues, including through engagement between National Security Advisor
Jake Sullivan, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, Senior
Advisor for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation John Podesta, and
Mr. Seibert.
