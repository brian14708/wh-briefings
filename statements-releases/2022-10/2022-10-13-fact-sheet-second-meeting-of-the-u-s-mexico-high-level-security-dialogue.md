title: "FACT SHEET: Second Meeting of the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Security\_Dialogue"
---
 
Today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Attorney General Merrick
Garland, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and other
U.S. government representatives met with their Mexican counterparts to
discuss implementation of the **U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for
Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities**.   
  
The Bicentennial Framework, adopted at the inaugural meeting of the
High-Level Security Dialogue in October 2021, continues to guide our
bilateral security cooperation. The United States and Mexico remain
committed to transforming our cooperation to better **<u>protect</u>**
the health and safety of our citizens, **<u>prevent</u>** criminal
organizations from harming our countries, and **<u>pursue</u>**
criminals to bring them to justice.  Today, we committed to continue
working together across all three goals to protect human rights in
accordance with our international obligations, share information and
best practices, prosecute those who violate our laws, and evaluate the
impact of our efforts.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration has taken several domestic actions since
October 2021 to implement our Bicentennial Framework goals. In April,
the Administration released its [National Drug Control
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/National-Drug-Control-2022Strategy.pdf),
which focuses on two critical factors in the overdose epidemic:
untreated addiction and drug trafficking. In June, President Biden
signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first major gun safety
legislation the U.S. Congress has passed in nearly 30 years, which
created a Federal firearms trafficking criminal offense for the first
time. On July 12, Presidents Biden and President Lopez Obrador committed
to a multi-year joint border infrastructure modernization effort, noting
that the U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $3.4 billion to
undertake 26 major modernization projects that include enhanced security
features on the United States’ northern and southern borders. Mexico
also committed to invest $1.5 billion on border infrastructure.  
  
Highlighted below are examples of successes achieved under each goal of
the Bicentennial Framework since its adoption in October 2021.  The
United States commits to continue advancements over the next year.  
  
**<u>GOAL 1:  PROTECT OUR PEOPLE</u>** **–** The United States and
Mexico seek to build sustainable, healthy, and secure communities to
benefit citizens of both nations.  
  
**<u>Public Health</u>**

-   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the
    Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),
    awarded nearly $1.5 billion to support efforts by states, tribal
    lands, and territories to address the opioid crisis and support
    individuals in recovery.  The grant programs provide funding to
    increase access to treatment for substance use disorder, remove
    barriers to public health interventions like naloxone, and expand
    access to recovery-support services. 
-   In 2022, a total of 745 community coalitions in all 50 states
    received over $93 million through the Office of National Drug
    Control Policy’s (ONDCP) Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Program.  The
    DFC Program supports communities as they mobilize individuals and
    organizations to prevent youth substance use. 
-   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched four
    complementary education campaigns that provide information on the
    prevalence and dangers of fentanyl, the risks and consequences of
    mixing drugs, the life-saving power of naloxone, and the importance
    of reducing stigma around drug use to support treatment and
    recovery.
-   The Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law
    Enforcement (INL) and HHS co-hosted, with Mexico, three experts’
    roundtables on addiction prevention and treatment.  INL provided
    training on evidence-based prevention and treatment of drug-use
    disorders in support of Mexico’s National Strategy to Prevent
    Addictions.  INL launched, with Mexico, the National Network on Drug
    Information to support consolidation of an early warning system for
    emerging drugs, and improved information collection on drug use
    through the *Red Nacional de Información sobre Drogas*.
-   INL support expanded access to alternative sentencing programs for
    low-level drug offenders in Mexico’s state-level courts.  Six
    Mexican states have now adopted court models that refer these
    offenders to treatment.  These models coordinate justice and public
    health efforts to decrease violence, criminal recidivism, and drug
    consumption in Mexico.  Nine more states are planning to launch
    treatment courts.

**<u>Safe Communities</u>**

-   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) partnered with
    state and local governments to scale evidence-based violence
    prevention methods in Mexico, including strengthening alternative
    civic justice systems to better support at-risk youth, preventing
    violence escalation, and reducing recidivism in 60 municipalities. 
    In the first year of the Bicentennial Framework, USAID implemented
    problem-oriented policing strategies to reduce crime in five
    municipalities and provided psychosocial therapy, life skills and
    vocational training, and employment placement for 3,000 at-risk
    youth. 
-   The State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law
    Enforcement Affairs (INL) trained more than 10,000 Mexican police
    officers and emergency call center operators to respond to gender
    violence crimes between 2019 and 2022 and supported the development
    of specialized police units focused on preventing femicides.  The
    Government of Mexico and INL hosted the first National Women and
    Security Conference to raise the profile of women in Mexico’s
    security and justice sectors and support participants’ efforts to
    reduce gender-based violence in their communities. 

**<u>Human Rights</u>**

-   The United States and Mexico partnered to address human rights
    priorities, including protecting journalists and identifying victims
    of forced disappearances.  USAID partnered with the Secretariat of
    the Interior’s National Human Rights Defenders and the Journalist
    Protection Mechanism to provide integrated protection to 1,600
    threatened individuals.  USAID also partnered with the federal
    Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Freedom of Expression (FEADLE)
    to investigate and prosecute 21 cases of violence against
    journalists.  Since 2020, U.S. forensics assistance helped the
    National Search Commission, National Human Identification Center,
    Coahuila Regional Identification Center, Attorney General’s Office
    (FGR), and state governments collect 1,238 DNA samples, generate
    1,066 family reference samples, and identify 81 victims.

**<u>Reduce Homicides and High-Impact Crimes</u>**

-   U.S. partnership with Mexican federal and state justice actors
    increased justice system efficiency, accredited corrections
    facilities, strengthened defense and victim services, and advanced
    priority prosecutions.  For example, five Mexican states adopted
    criminal prosecution policies, defined with civil society and the
    private sector, to address specific crimes, from femicides to
    extortion.  In those states, interagency task forces decreased
    impunity for target crimes, courts introduced innovations to manage
    caseloads, and the Mexican government gathered data to improve the
    quality of pre-trial evaluation and supervision services.
-   INL and the Department of Justice’s International Criminal
    Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) worked with
    Mexico’s forensics laboratories to increase their capacity to
    support the investigation and prosecution of high impact crimes. 
    Since the program’s inception, 135 laboratory units in 23 states and
    FGR have achieved international accreditation. 

**<u>GOAL 2:  PREVENT TRANSBORDER CRIME</u>** **–** The United States
and Mexico seek to diminish the capacity of Transnational Criminal
Organizations (TCOs) and prevent trafficking of drugs, arms, wildlife,
and people, as well as human smuggling.  
  
**<u>Combating TCOs</u>**

-   President Biden announced two Executive Orders to counter TCOs and
    illicit drug trafficking, first by formally establishing the U.S.
    Council on Transnational Organized Crime, and second, by modernizing
    and expanding the U.S. Government’s ability to target drug
    trafficking organizations, their enablers, and financial
    facilitators through sanctions and other related actions.  
-   Mexico arrested several prominent cartel leaders, “plaza bosses,”
    and operatives in 2022, including:  co-founder of the Guadalajara
    Cartel and FBI most-wanted criminal fugitive, Rafael Caro Quintero,
    Cartel de Noreste (CDN) Leader Juan “El Huevo” Gerardo Treviño
    Chávez, Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG) Plaza Boss in Colima
    Aldrin Miguel “El Chaparrito” Jarquín Jarquín, and CJNG co-founder
    and top Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) target Erick “el 85”
    Valencia Salazar. 
-   In August, the Department of Justice’s Office of Overseas
    Prosecutorial Development Assistance and Training (OPDAT), using INL
    funding, in coordination with the FBI’s Legal Attaché program, DEA,
    and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), hosted an organized
    crime workshop in Guadalajara, Jalisco for 50 federal prosecutors
    from high priority Mexican states.

**<u>Synthetic Opioids</u>**

-   Customs and Border Protection (CBP) significantly increased the
    amount of fentanyl seized along the U.S. Southwest Border, seizing
    an average of more than 800 pounds of fentanyl each month in fiscal
    year 2021, more than twice as much as fiscal year 2020 and four
    times the amount seized in 2019.
-   DEA’s Operation Overdrive, an initiative aimed at combatting the
    rising rates of drug-related violent crime and drug poisoning deaths
    plaguing American communities, is operational in 57 locations across
    the United States.  In 2021, DEA seized more than 20.4 million fake
    pills and 15,000 pounds of fentanyl powder, equating to
    approximately 440,000,000 deadly doses of fentanyl, enough to supply
    a potentially lethal dose to every member of the U.S. population.
-   Mexico expanded its chemical watchlist from 14 to72.  The list helps
    security officials identify which inbound chemical shipments warrant
    additional scrutiny. 
-   INL sponsored two exchanges with more than 250 forensic chemists
    from the U.S. and Mexican governments to advance understanding and
    identification of fentanyl precursors and synthesis; a series of
    fentanyl awareness trainings for law enforcement and courier
    facility operators to reduce personnel contamination and death;
    high-hazard clandestine laboratory identification and destruction
    training; and a workshop for Mexican prosecutors and chemists on
    presenting evidence of fentanyl and precursors at trial. 
-   INL donated protective equipment to specialized units to investigate
    and safely dismantle clandestine labs and 13 additional specialized
    detection canines to state and federal entities.  INL-donated
    canines in Mexico helped seize more than 75,000 fentanyl pills from
    January to August 2022, and more than 172,000 fentanyl pills since
    2019. 
-   The United States and Mexico committed to an action plan focused on
    synthetic drugs as we increase our efforts to tackle the fentanyl
    threat.

**<u>Arms Trafficking</u>**

-   The United States passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (SCA)
    on June 25.  This Act provided the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
    Firearms and Explosives (ATF) with new authorities to combat
    firearms trafficking along the U.S. southwest border and elsewhere. 
-   The Department of Justice announced multiple convictions for arms
    trafficking including:
    -   April 2022:  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District
        of Arkansas announced a 12-year prison sentence for Andrew Scott
        Pierson for his role in a conspiracy that resulted in the
        trafficking of firearms to Mexican cartels. 
    -   May 2022:  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District
        of Texas announced the conviction of three individuals for their
        roles in a Cartel del Noroeste weapons money laundering scheme. 
    -   May 2022:  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District
        of Georgia announced that Othon Marban, Sr., and Othon Marban,
        Jr., pleaded guilty to conspiracy to transfer firearms to an
        out-of-state resident, in connection with their attempted
        trafficking of approximately 50 guns to Mexico. 
    -   August 2022:  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern
        District of Texas announced the conviction of Osiel Cárdenas
        Salinas, Jr., for attempting to purchase assault rifles to
        export into Mexico.  Cárdenas is the son of former head of the
        Gulf Cartel Osiel Cardenas-Guillén.
    -   September 2022:  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern
        District of Texas announced the **first** conviction under the
        Bipartisan Safer Communities Act firearms trafficking statute of
        an individual who pleaded guilty to trafficking handguns into
        Mexico.  At the time of his arrest, authorities discovered 17
        firearms hidden in his car while traveling south towards the
        port of entry in Laredo.
-   ATF significantly increased its ability to interdict firearms and
    stop firearms traffickers through Operation Southbound, ATF’s
    whole-of-government enforcement strategy that incorporates
    information sharing and the use of its Firearms Trafficking Task
    Forces to identify, disrupt, and dismantle firearms trafficking
    networks supplying firearms to TCOs. 
-   INL and ATF trained 775 forensic experts and investigators from
    federal and state law enforcement agencies on firearms and
    explosives identification, as well as more than 119 forensics
    experts and investigators from federal and state law enforcement
    agencies on eTrace.  ATF and INL have steadily built Mexico’s eTrace
    capacity, resulting in a nearly 40 percent increase in the number of
    firearm traces submitted by Mexico from 2017 to 2022, enhancing
    parallel firearms trafficking investigations.  
-   Operation Without a Trace spearheaded a campaign via the U.S.
    Immigration and Customs Enforcement tip-line aimed at eliciting
    information from the public regarding firearms trafficking in July
    2021.  HSI and CBP jointly pushed out messaging at ports of entry,
    checkpoints, and private shipping and transportation businesses. 
    From October 2021 to August 2022, the tip line received 60 tips,
    including four tips related to ongoing HSI investigations and one
    tip that initiated a new investigation that led to an arrest.

**<u>Human Smuggling</u>**

-   In coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
    Mexico’s FGR prioritized and actively investigates the most
    dangerous and prolific human smuggling networks operating in Mexico,
    which led to FGR obtaining 29 arrest warrants, and arresting 19
    suspects over the past year.  Additionally, HSI and FGR committed to
    significantly increase the size of the HSI-FGR Transnational
    Criminal Investigative Unit, which investigates human smuggling,
    human trafficking, and narcotics and arms trafficking cases, among
    other crimes.
-   DOJ announced the creation of Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA) in April
    2021 to prioritize efforts to combat human smuggling and human
    trafficking.  Since its creation, JTFA increased coordination and
    collaboration among DOJ, DHS, and other interagency law enforcement
    participants together with foreign law enforcement partners in
    Mexico and Central America; targeted those organizations who have
    the most impact on the United States; and coordinated significant
    smuggling indictments and extradition efforts in U.S. Attorneys’
    Offices across the country and with foreign counterparts.  To date,
    JTFA’s work with its partners resulted in criminal charges and over
    100 domestic and international arrests against leaders, organizers
    and significant facilitators of human smuggling activities, several
    dozen convictions, significant prison sentences and substantial
    asset forfeiture.  JTFA’s successes relating to smuggling activity
    involving Mexico include:
    -   March 2022: The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of
        Arizona announced the takedown of a human smuggling organization
        operating in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, responsible for
        smuggling large numbers of individuals from Mexico, Central
        America, and South America into Arizona.  This operation, which
        involved extensive cooperation with Mexico, led to the arrest of
        six members of the organization who will be prosecuted by
        Mexican authorities.  Throughout the investigation, the DOJ has
        successfully prosecuted nine U.S.-based co-conspirators.
    -   September 2022:  DOJ announced the arrest of eight individuals
        in four states who were indicted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office
        for the Southern District of Texas and the Human Rights and
        Special Prosecutions Section of the Department of Justice’s
        Criminal Division for their role in a prolific human smuggling
        organization that facilitated the unlawful transportation and
        movement of migrants within the United States.  The migrants or
        their families allegedly paid members of the smuggling
        organization to help them travel illegally to and within the
        United States.

**<u>Secure Modes of Commerce</u>**

-   Mexican Customs and the CBP National Targeting Center signed a
    memorandum of understanding to increase information sharing on
    foreign air cargo shipments entering Mexico.

**<u>GOAL 3:  PURSUE CRIMINAL NETWORKS</u>** **–** Disrupt TCO financial
networks and reduce their ability to profit from illicit activities both
transnationally and in cyberspace.

**<u>Cyber</u>**

-   In August, the U.S.-Mexico Working Group on Cyber Issues convened
    its first bilateral cyber dialogue since the establishment of the
    Bicentennial Framework.  The meeting advanced bilateral cooperation
    on cyber issues in line with our shared commitment to an open,
    interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet and a stable
    cyberspace.
-   INL sponsored trainings with the Department of Justice on obtaining
    and presenting digital evidence in organized crime cases, and on
    cyber-criminal investigations to over 150 participants. 

**<u>Extraditions</u>**

-   Mexico extradited several prominent cartel leaders, “plaza bosses,”
    and operatives to the United States:
    -   Mario Cárdenas Guillén, former head of the Gulf Cartel was
        surrendered to the United States on May 17, 2022.  According to
        the indictment, beginning in 2000 and continuing through 2012,
        Cárdenas Guillén allegedly conspired with others to possess more
        than five kilograms of cocaine, which he intended to distribute
        to others.
    -   Adan Casarrubias Salgado was surrendered to the United States on
        May 26, 2022. The indictment alleges Casarrubias Salgado
        distributed multiple kilograms of heroin in the Chicago area in
        2014 and transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars in
        proceeds back to Mexico.
    -   Carlos Arturo Quintana was surrendered to the United States on
        August 18, 2022. Quintana is alleged to be a prominent member of
        the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization (VCFO).  The VCFO is a
        transnational criminal enterprise based in Chihuahua, Mexico,
        responsible for smuggling several tons of narcotics into the
        United States.

**<u>Combatting Illicit Finance</u>**

-   In May, the United States and Mexico convened the Strategic Dialogue
    on Illicit Finance (SDIF) to disrupt money laundering and the
    financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).  The U.S. delegation to the SDIF,
    led by the Department of the Treasury, included partners from the
    DOJ’s Criminal Division, Civil Rights Division, along with the FBI
    and DEA.  Participants discussed how to move forward on major issue
    areas such as narcotics smuggling, evolving illicit finance threats,
    human smuggling, trafficking, corruption, and digital assets.  The
    group committed to establish a working group on anti-corruption,
    focused primarily on a high-level strategic response to public
    corruption and continue expanding information-sharing.

**<u>Targeted Financial Measures:</u>**

-   The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
    (OFAC) designated 26 individuals and 17 entities pursuant to
    Executive Order (EO) 14059, Imposing Sanctions on Foreign Persons
    Involved in the Global Illicit Drug Trade signed by President Biden
    in December 2021.  Many of the sanctions implemented under this EO
    have targeted individuals and entities engaged in, directly or
    indirectly, fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking. 
    -   On February 17, OFAC designated Sergio Armando Orozco Rodriguez
        (a.k.a. “Chocho”) for acting on behalf of CJNG by facilitating
        various illicit activities in Puerto Vallarta.  This action
        resulted from collaboration between OFAC, the Government of
        Mexico, and other U.S. agencies.
    -   On July 11, OFAC designated Obed Christian Sepulveda
        Portillo for trafficking high-caliber firearms from the United
        States to Mexico on behalf of CJNG.  This action resulted from
        the collaboration between OFAC, HSI, and the Government of
        Mexico.
