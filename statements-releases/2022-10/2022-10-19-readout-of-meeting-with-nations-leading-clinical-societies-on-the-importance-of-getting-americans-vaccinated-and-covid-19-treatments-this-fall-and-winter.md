title: "Readout of Meeting with Nation\u2019s Leading Clinical Societies on the Importance\
  \ of Getting Americans Vaccinated and COVID-\u206019 Treatments this Fall and\_\
  Winter"
---
 
On Monday, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha and
federal public health officials met with leading organizations
representing America’s physicians, nurse practitioners, and other
clinicians to discuss the ongoing work to protect people against and
treat COVID-19 this fall and winter. Administration officials shared
that they are carefully monitoring emerging subvariants in the U.S. and
around the world, and underscored the potential for an increase in both
COVID-19 and flu infections this fall and winter. There was broad
agreement that the single-most important thing Americans, particularly
the elderly, can do to protect themselves and their loved ones from
COVID-19 and serious illness is to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine
without delay. As Americans go about their more normal routines and
access health care throughout this fall, Administration officials
emphasized the essential role the nation’s clinicians will play in
ensuring people stay healthy and protected, and our nation manages the
fall and winter without the suffering and disruptions we have seen in
the past. To that end, Administration officials called on the
organizations to ensure their members are doing everything they can to
get Americans their updated COVID-19 vaccine and flu shot this fall,
including through individual patient counseling, as well as phone calls,
emails, and text reminders to patients. The discussion also focused on
the progress the U.S. has made in making COVID-19 a treatable illness,
with COVID-19 deaths down 90 percent since the President took office,
and the steps health care providers can take to further drive down
COVID-19 deaths. This includes making sure patients—particularly those
at high-risk of developing serious illness—understand the effectiveness
of treatments in saving lives, and the importance of testing for
COVID-19 if they have symptoms and seeking treatment quickly if they
test positive. Administration officials conveyed their deep gratitude to
America’s health care providers for their ongoing efforts to help the
country manage COVID-19, and reiterated their commitment to providing
any support they can in the weeks and months ahead.
