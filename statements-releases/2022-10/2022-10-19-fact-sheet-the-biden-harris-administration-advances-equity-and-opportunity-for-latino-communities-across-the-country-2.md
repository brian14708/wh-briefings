title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Latino Communities Across the\_Country"
---
 
*The Biden-Harris Administration continues to deliver for the Latino
Community by expanding access to health care, lowering drug prices for
seniors, providing student debt relief, creating well-paid jobs and
lowering Hispanic unemployment to its lowest rate in history.  *

President Biden is leading the charge to ensure that all Latino families
and communities can live with dignity, respect, and achieve greater
economic opportunity. Hardworking Latino families and businesses commit
every day to strengthening communities throughout America and far too
often, their sacrifices and contributions as leaders in the community,
business, academia, labor and government go unrecognized. The
Biden-Harris Administration is working to protect and advance civil
rights, voter protections, racial equity, and economic opportunity for
all Latino communities. 

During National Hispanic Heritage Month, the Biden-Harris Administration
celebrates the progress made to advance opportunity in Latino
communities and recommits to delivering on the promise of equity for all
Latino families and communities. 

**Economic Opportunity for Latino Families and Communities.**  President
Biden signed into law three historic pieces of legislation – Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA), American Rescue Plan (ARP), and Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law (BIL) – to deliver on the promise to ensure greater
opportunity for all, including every Latino family and community. 

The American Rescue Plan powered a historically strong economic recovery
that ensured that Latino workers and families are not left behind. That
has meant record drops in unemployment for Latino workers, historically
low credit card delinquency rates – which hit Black and Latino borrowers
hardest, historically low foreclosures and evictions, and historically
low Latino child poverty. 

In past, weaker labor market recoveries, Latino workers faced high
joblessness rates for years. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Latino
unemployment saw its largest calendar year drop on record in 2021 – and
has continued falling in 2022. In 2021, the expanded Child Tax Credit
and other policies in the American Rescue Plan led to a 43% reduction in
Latino child poverty to record lows. 

The Biden-Harris Administration’s vital policies and programs include: 

**Building an Economy that Works for Latino People and Families.** The
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) lowers prescription drug costs, health
care costs, and energy costs. President Biden and Congressional
Democrats successfully fought to pass this historic legislation to help
all Americans, including Latinos, who have been at the frontline of
climate change, by lowering costs, advancing environmental justice while
building a cleaner future, and growing the economy from the bottom up
and the middle out by creating good-paying, union jobs across the
country. The IRA will also lower the deficit and ask the ultra-wealthy
and corporations to pay their fair share. No one earning under $400,000
per year will pay a penny more in taxes. 

**Combatting Climate Change and Lowering Energy Costs.** The IRA will
bring down energy costs for Latino families and create thousands of good
jobs, all while reducing climate pollution and ensuring that we have a
clean, secure future energy supply:

-   **Make Home Efficiency Upgrades More Affordable.** Households can
    save up to 30% with tax credits for efficient heating and cooling
    equipment that will save them hundreds of dollars on utility bills.
    Households can also save up to 30% with tax credits for home
    construction projects on windows, doors, insulation, or other
    weatherization measures that prevent energy from escaping homes.
    When families need to replace or upgrade stoves, ovens, or other
    home appliances, they can receive direct rebates when buying more
    energy efficient and electric appliances that can lower future
    utility bills by at least $350 per year. Families in affordable
    housing units will benefit from resources to support projects that
    boost efficiency, improve indoor air quality, make clean energy or
    electrification upgrades, or strengthen their climate resilience. 
-   **Create Economic Opportunities and Good Paying Jobs.** The IRA
    spurs solar project development in environmental justice communities
    by providing a 20% bonus credit for solar projects on
    federally-subsidized affordable housing projects and a 10% bonus
    credit for solar projects in low-income communities. It also creates
    a new Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator that will seed
    state and local clean energy financing institutions, support the
    deployment of distributed zero-emission technologies like heat-pumps
    and community solar and EV charging, while prioritizing over 50% of
    its investments in disadvantaged communities. The IRA expands clean
    energy tax credits for wind, solar, nuclear, clean hydrogen, clean
    fuels, and carbon capture including a bonus credit for businesses
    that pay workers a prevailing wage and hire using registered
    apprenticeship programs – so that the clean energy we use creates
    good paying jobs.

**Making the Tax Code Fairer.** President Trump and Congressional
Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an unfair tax system worse. 

-   **Inflation Reduction Act:** The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is
    a critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise
    revenue by:
    -   Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the
        taxes they already owe.
    -   Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently
        get away with paying no federal income tax.
    -   Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will
        encourage businesses to invest.
-   The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance
    critically needed investments to lower costs and combat climate
    change, they are also an important component of building an economy
    that rewards work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and
    powerful get away with playing by a separate set of rules. 

**Critical Investments in Latino Families & Communities in the American
Rescue Plan.** When President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan
(ARP) into law, it provided a lifeline to millions of families who were
struggling from the economic fallout of the pandemic. 

-   **Historic Expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) – cutting child
    poverty to record lows for Latino children:** The American Rescue
    Plan (ARP) expanded the 2021 Child Tax Credit to help families with
    the costs of raising their kids and provided the first ever monthly
    payments for a major tax credit. Before the ARP, half of all Latino
    children [lived](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/5cda0024be4e5b0001c6bdc7/1557790757313/Poverty+%26+Social+Policy+Brief_Who+Is+Left+Behind+in+the+Federal+CTC.pdf) in
    families with too little in income to qualify for the full Child Tax
    Credit. The American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the 2021 Child Tax
    Credit helped drive a **43% reduction in Latino Child Poverty in
    2021, cutting Latino child poverty to record lows**. President Biden
    is committed to fighting child poverty by pushing for Congress to
    permanently extend the expanded CTC.
-   **The American Rescue Plan tripled the EITC for 17 million workers
    without dependent children:** The American Rescue Plan nearly
    tripled the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent
    children for 2021 from $540 to $1,500 and extended the credit to
    younger and older workers. This was the first increase in the credit
    in real terms since 1993. This expansion greatly helped Latino
    workers – 26% of all workers expected to benefit are Latino.  
-   **Historic investments to keep families in their homes.** Latino
    families have disproportionately faced foreclosures and evictions in
    the past – with Latino neighborhoods facing [roughly
    twice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/21/lingering-impact-foreclosure-crisis-felt-most-hispanic-black-communities-study-says/)
    the share of foreclosures as their share of all homes in the
    aftermath of the Great Recession. Biden Administration policies have
    kept evictions and foreclosures historically low during the
    pandemic. 

<!-- -->

-   Facing historic levels of housing instability, President Biden took
    significant action, extending the CDC’s eviction moratorium three
    times – and standing up the $46 billion first-of-its kind Emergency
    Rental Assistance program to stop evictions across the nation.
-   The program has helped 7 million renters and their families, and
    kept eviction filings 23% below historic averages over the last
    year. Over 80 percent of assistance went to low-income renters – and
    a disproportionate share went to Latino households, according to
    Treasury data. 

**Advancing Equity and Economic Opportunity for Latinos Through Historic
Infrastructure Investments.** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
addresses economic disparities in our economy and the consequences of
decades of disinvestment in America’s infrastructure that have
disproportionately burdened communities of color. Through critical
investments, the legislation increases access to good-paying jobs,
affordable high-speed internet, reliable public transit, clean drinking
water and other resources, to ensure that all communities – including
Latino communities – get a fair shot at the American dream.

**Ensuring Latino Homeowners Get Full Value for their Homes.** In March
2022, the Biden-Harris Administration’s Interagency Task Force on
Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) released the PAVE Action
Plan, which represents the most wide-ranging set of reforms ever put
forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process. The Action Plan
details a set of more than 20 commitments and actions across all stages
of the valuation process, including: making the appraisal industry more
accountable; empowering consumers with critical information and
assistance if they receive a valuation that is lower than expected;
preventing algorithmic bias in home valuation; cultivating an appraiser
profession that is well-trained and looks like the communities it
serves; and leveraging federal data and expertise to inform policy,
practice, and research on appraisal bias.

**Providing Resources to Help Latino Owned Small Businesses Grow and
Thrive.** By January 2021, millions of small businesses had been forced
to shutter their doors due to the combined impact of the pandemic and
the obstacles many businesses faced in accessing pandemic relief
programs. Minority-owned businesses were hit the hardest, with one study
finding that the number of Latino business owners declined by nearly
one-third during the first two months of the pandemic. In response, the
Biden-Harris Administration delivered over $450 billion in emergency
relief to more than six million small businesses in 2021 alone. These
actions have helped drive an unprecedented surge in entrepreneurship. 

-   In 2021, Hispanic entrepreneurs started new businesses at the
    fastest rate in more than a decade and 23 percent faster than
    pre-pandemic levels. The Administration is committed to continuing
    to help small businesses grow and create jobs for the long-haul,
    expanding access to capital by improving the Small Business
    Administration’s (SBA) flagship loan guarantee programs to expand
    the availability of small dollar loans and working with states,
    territories, and tribal governments to establish loan and equity
    investment programs through the Treasury Department’s State Small
    Business Credit Initiative. These efforts will allow the federal
    government to offer more than $300 billion in loans and equity
    investments through the end of the decade. And the Biden-Harris
    Administration has made important investments at SBA, Treasury, and
    the Minority Business Development Agency to help entrepreneurs
    access the support resources they need to succeed, including
    technical expertise, accountants, and lawyers. 
-   Additionally, the Administration has made over $8 billion in
    investments through Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program
    (ECIP) to support eligible community development financial
    institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions (MDIs) in
    lending to financially underserved borrowers and communities,
    including minority communities. For example, Latino Community Credit
    Union, based in North Carolina, received a more than $99 million
    ECIP investment.

**Leveraging Federal Procurement to Narrow the Racial Wealth Gap for
Latino Entrepreneurs and Families.**  Federal procurement is one of our
most powerful tools to advance equity and build wealth in underserved
communities, but only around 10 percent of federal agencies’ total
eligible contracting dollars typically go to small disadvantaged
businesses, a category under federal law for which Latino-owned
businesses are presumed to qualify. Recognizing the importance of using
the government’s purchasing power to advance opportunity and equity, the
Biden-Harris Administration has launched an all-of-government effort to
expand contracting opportunities for underserved small businesses,
setting a new goal of increasing the share of contracts going to small
disadvantaged businesses to 15 percent by 2025. This effort is projected
to translate to an additional $100 billion to minority-owned businesses,
helping more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams.

**Protecting and Empowering Latino Workers.** The Department of Labor
(DOL) has taken a number of steps to promote safe working environments
and empower Latino workers all across the country, including: 

-   **Boosting farmworker wages.** Boosting the national average wage
    for farmworkers to $13.99 per hour, a 4.5 percent pay increase over
    the prior year, and reversing a harmful 2-year “wage freeze” policy
    put in place by the prior administration.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding workers’ outreach.** Launching an initiative that
    provides outreach and education to protect front-line, essential
    workers during and after the pandemic.   

<!-- -->

-   **Protecting Latino workers from heat exposure.** Combating hazards
    associated with extreme heat exposure **–** both indoors and
    outdoors – through enhanced OSHA measures that better protect
    workers. This initiative will disproportionately benefit Latino
    workers who are more likely to face weather exposure. OSHA is
    implementing an [enforcement
    initiative](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osha.gov%2Flaws-regs%2Fstandardinterpretations%2F2021-09-01&data=04%7C01%7CBarnes.Taylor.A%40dol.gov%7C5d1629300bd04641b81308d97d352440%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C637678489493995678%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=euGQaAi8gu0xk%2FmiZaY%2Bo9KcILUYxgb6YV2nPnrjBew%3D&reserved=0)

    on heat inspections, and launching a rulemaking process to develop a
    workplace heat standard. In addition, the agency has formed a
    [National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and
    Health](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osha.gov%2Fadvisorycommittee%2Fnacosh&data=04%7C01%7CBarnes.Taylor.A%40dol.gov%7C5d1629300bd04641b81308d97d352440%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C637678489494005641%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=pyGefSVmdSH%2F8BA1%2B2qXV4WvX0zFIgftbP42Eo9ELJ8%3D&reserved=0)
    Heat Injury and Illness Prevention Work Group to provide better
    understanding of challenges and to identify and share best practices
    to protect workers. 

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding high-quality job training opportunities, including for
    migrant and seasonal farmworkers.** The Biden-Harris Administration
    is committed to ensuring that Latino workers have equitable access
    to good jobs in in-demand sectors – including those required to
    implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act,
    and the Inflation Reduction Act. This includes by supporting
    worker-centered sector strategies to better recruit, train, and
    retain a diverse, local, and skilled workforce; and strengthening
    community colleges, Registered Apprenticeships, and other
    high-quality education and training that leads to good jobs**.**
    Additionally, the Administration is using the National Farmworkers
    Job Training Program (NFJP), a nationally-directed,
    locally-administered program, to provide services for migrant and
    seasonal farmworkers and their dependents. As part of this program,
    Career Services and Training grant recipients help farmworkers and
    their dependents acquire necessary skills to either stabilize or
    advance in their agricultural jobs or obtain employment in new
    industries. For Program Year 2022, the Employment and Training
    Administration has committed to providing more than $88 million
    through the NFJP, where more than 75 percent of participants
    identify as Hispanic or Latino.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding Workforce Development through $40 billion in American
    Rescue Plan Funds Committed to Workforce:** Since passage of the
    law, states, localities, community colleges, and local organizations
    have leveraged American Rescue Plan resources to deliver training,
    expand career paths, encourage more Registered Apprenticeships,
    provide retention and hiring bonuses in critical industries, and
    power efforts to help underserved Americans and those who face
    barriers to employment secure good jobs. These investments in the
    workforce – along with the American Rescue Plan’s direct payroll
    support that has saved or restored jobs across a broad set of
    industries – have contributed to record job growth since President
    Biden took office. 

<!-- -->

-   **For example: $40 million Build Back Better Regional Challenge
    Award for the West Texas Aerospace & Defense Manufacturing Coalition
    @ UT El Paso:** The West Texas Aerospace and Defense Manufacturing
    coalition, led by the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP),
    received approximately $40 million to strengthen America’s aerospace
    and defense manufacturing capabilities by integrating legacy
    manufacturers in West Texas into the aerospace and defense (A&D)
    supply chain. While UTEP is a national leader in aerospace training
    with highly diverse engineering talent, the region loses these
    skilled workers to more established clusters with greater job
    opportunities. The West Texas Aerospace and Defense Manufacturing
    coalition has demonstrated the ability to train and educate a
    diverse STEM workforce in a region that includes a large rural
    population and is 82 percent Latino; this strategy will give those
    skilled workers the chance to build their careers and their
    businesses in West Texas.

**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity in K-12 Schools and an
Education Beyond High School for Latino Students.** President Biden has
delivered the support necessary to enable every school to return to
full-time, in-person instruction; accelerate academic achievement;
address the mental health needs of students; and build school
communities where all students feel they belong. At the same time,
President Biden has worked to ensure equitable access to high-quality
education for Latino students. These policies and programs include:

-   **Ensuring Educational Opportunity for Latino Students Through
    Student Loan Relief.** President Biden believes that a post-high
    school education should be a ticket to a middle-class life, but for
    too many Latino students, the cost of borrowing for college is a
    lifelong burden that deprives them of that opportunity. President
    Biden released a three-part plan to provide more breathing room to
    America’s working families as they continue to recover from the
    strains associated with the COVID-19 pandemic:

<!-- -->

-   **Providing targeted debt relief to address the financial harms of
    the pandemic, fulfilling the President’s campaign commitment.** The
    Department of Education will provide up to $20,000 in debt
    cancellation to Pell Grant recipients with loans held by the
    Department of Education, and up to $10,000 in debt cancellation to
    non-Pell Grant recipients. 65% of Latino undergraduate borrowers are
    Pell Grant recipients. Borrowers are eligible for this relief if
    their individual income is less than $125,000 ($250,000 for married
    couples). No high-income individual or high-income household – in
    the top 5% of incomes – will benefit from this action. By targeting
    relief to borrowers with the highest economic need, the
    Administration’s actions are also likely to help narrow the racial
    wealth gap.
    -   **Making the student loan system more manageable for current and
        future borrowers by: **

<!-- -->

-   Cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans. The
    Department of Education is proposing a new income-driven repayment
    plan that protects more low-income borrowers from making any
    payments and caps monthly payments for undergraduate loans at 5% of
    a borrower’s discretionary income—half of the rate that borrowers
    must pay now under most existing plans. This means that the average
    annual student loan payment will be lowered by more than $1,000 for
    both current and future borrowers. 
-   Fixing the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by
    proposing a rule that borrowers who have worked at a nonprofit, in
    the military, or in federal, state, tribal, or local government,
    receive appropriate credit toward loan forgiveness. These
    improvements will build on temporary changes the Department of
    Education has already made to PSLF, under which more than 175,000
    public servants have already had more than $10 billion in loan
    forgiveness approved.

<!-- -->

-   **Protecting future students and taxpayers by reducing the cost of
    college and holding schools accountable when they hike up prices.**
    The President championed the largest increase to Pell Grants in the
    last decade – a $400 increase in the maximum award for students in
    the 2022-2023 school year. The FY23 budget also proposed doubling
    the maximum Pell Grant by 2029 to nearly $13,000. To further reduce
    the cost of college, the President will continue to fight to make
    community college free. Meanwhile, colleges have an obligation to
    keep prices reasonable and ensure borrowers get value for their
    investments, not debt they cannot afford. This Administration has
    already taken key steps to strengthen accountability, including in
    areas where the previous Administration weakened rules such as
    holding career colleges accountable for leaving their students with
    mountains of debt that they cannot repay.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting College Students and Hispanic-Serving Institutions
    (HSIs).** The ARP provided nearly $40 billion in support to
    institutions of higher education to serve students and ensure
    learning continues during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes
    approximately $11 billion for HSIs. All students, regardless of
    citizenship, who met the appropriate criteria were eligible to
    receive financial aid from the Higher Education Emergency Relief
    Fund (HEERF). Furthermore, as part of the Administration’s
    commitment to help HSIs provide a pathway to opportunity for their
    students, the FY23 Budget requested increased funding to help HSIs
    and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), Historically Black
    Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Tribal Colleges and
    Universities (TCUs) expand their research and development
    infrastructure.

<!-- -->

-   **Safely Reopening Schools.** The American Rescue Plan has provided
    more than $122 billion to help K-12 schools continue to reopen
    safely. Nearly 14 million students in our Nation’s public elementary
    and secondary school system and nearly 4 million students in
    post-secondary education are Latino. Latino students constitute more
    than 27 percent of all pre-kindergarten through 12th grade students
    and nearly 20 percent of college students.

<!-- -->

-   **Re-Establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing
    Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for
    Hispanics.** In September 2021, President Biden signed a [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/13/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for-hispanics/)
    re-establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational
    Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics. The
    Executive Order helps to ensure that from early childhood to
    entering the workforce, Latino students, including DREAMers, can
    reach their highest potential. The Initiative will address the
    systemic inequities Latino students continue to face in our nation’s
    public education system, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19
    crisis; will help to build capacity at institutions serving Latino
    students, including Hispanic Serving Institutions; and will advance
    educational equity and economic opportunity for Latino students,
    families, and communities. 

**Improving Health Outcomes for Latino Communities.**  Access to quality
healthcare is integral to addressing health disparities in Latino
communities. President Biden is committed to ensuring equitable health
outcomes for communities, while ensuring that we keep costs down for
individuals and families. These policies and programs include:

-   **Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Latino Seniors Through the
    Inflation Reduction Act:** Americans pay 2-3 times more for their
    prescription drugs than people in other wealthy countries. High
    prices contribute to racial and ethnic health inequities. Among
    adults 65 and older, Latino Medicare beneficiaries were roughly 1.5
    times as likely as white beneficiaries to have trouble affording
    medications, and about 2 times as likely to not fill needed
    prescriptions due to cost. The Inflation Reduction Act will help
    close the gap in access to medication by improving prescription drug
    coverage and lowering drug prices in Medicare. The law:

<!-- -->

-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs
    they buy at the pharmacy at $2,000 a year, giving peace of mind to
    seniors who no longer have to worry about spending thousands and
    thousands more on prescription drugs. 
-   Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for
    a month’s supply.
-   Provides access to a number of additional free vaccines, including
    the shingles vaccine, for Medicare beneficiaries.
-   Will further lower prescription drug costs for seniors by allowing
    Medicare to negotiate the price of high-cost drugs and requiring
    drug manufacturers to pay Medicare a rebate when they raise prices
    faster than inflation.

<!-- -->

-   **Lower Health Insurance Premiums and Expand Coverage**: Since the
    implementation of the Affordable Care Act’s coverage expansions, the
    uninsured rate among Latinos decreased by 11 percentage points, from
    30 percent in 2013 to a low of 19 percent in 2017. Despite that
    progress, almost 10.9 million Hispanic people were uninsured in 2019
    before President Biden took office and 640,000 Latinos fell into the
    “coverage gap” and were locked out of coverage because their state
    refused to expand Medicaid. Since President Biden took office, the
    uninsured rate has reached a new historic law: 8% and 5.2 million of
    Americans have gained health insurance coverage. The Inflation
    Reduction Act continues the American Rescue Plan’s more generous
    Affordable Care Act premium tax credits.
    -   The Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower monthly premiums – 80
        percent of uninsured Latinos had access to a plan for $50 or
        less each month and 69 percent could find a plan for $0 a month
        in 2021.
    -   By continuing the improvements made through ARP, the Inflation
        Reduction Act will help keep free or low-cost health insurance
        available. Nearly 700,000 Latinos will have health insurance
        coverage next year, compared to without the IRA.

<!-- -->

-   **Protects Public Health.** Climate change disproportionately
    impacts low-income communities and communities of color. Through the
    Inflation Reduction Act, the law will create Environmental Justice
    Block Grants, and a dedicated program to tackle pollution in port
    communities – where air pollution is especially dense and deadly. It
    will also fund programs to reduce air pollution, including for
    fenceline monitoring and screening near industrial facilities, air
    quality sensors in disadvantaged communities, new and upgraded
    multipollutant monitoring sites, and monitoring and mitigation of
    methane and wood heater emissions. These grants will also help
    protect our children with investments to monitor and reduce
    pollution at public schools in disadvantaged communities.

-   **Expanding Access to Health Care for Latino Individuals and
    Families through the American Rescue Plan.** The ARP also allocated
    $7.6 billion for Community Health Centers (CHCs), which
    predominately serve Latino and communities of color. Through ARP
    investments, 69 percent of Latino uninsured adults have access to a
    zero-premium plan and 80 percent have access to a plan for less than
    $50 a month. According to the latest uninsured data from the Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center for
    Health Statistics, Exchange-based coverage was higher among Latino
    persons (4.2 percent) than non-Latino Caucasians (3.7 percent) and
    non-Latino Blacks (2.6 percent).

**Safeguarding Latinos from COVID-19.** Because of systemic inequities
in our economy and healthcare system, Latino communities have been
disproportionately burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since his first
day in office, President Biden has used every lever and tool to ensure
every person in our country can access safe, free, and convenient
vaccines; expand testing eligibility; and invest in more equitable
public health infrastructure to better serve communities of color. That
includes working with pharmacies to extend their hours to ensure working
people have a chance to get their shot. 

-   **Offering new, updated COVID-19 vaccines for free at tens of
    thousands of trusted locations, with convenient appointment and
    walk-in hours**: The Administration has secured over 170 million
    doses of the updated COVID-19 vaccines, which were made available to
    the American people for free at tens of thousands of convenient
    locations nationwide, including pharmacies, doctor’s offices, health
    centers, and state and local health departments. Americans can visit
    Vaccines.gov to find locations with the new, updated vaccines near
    them—with more locations and appointments becoming available in the
    coming days and weeks.
-   **Engaging community organizations to reach people with trusted
    information on the new, updated COVID-19 vaccines.** Building on the
    successful efforts that have gotten over 600 million shots in arms
    since January 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services is
    engaging national, regional, and local community-based organizations
    including those with strong reach among racial and ethnic minority
    communities, such as the National Hispanic Pastor Alliance to host
    community health expos and vaccine drives in cities. This continued
    collaboration will help meet people where they are, and foster
    conversations with trusted members of their communities. 

**Advancing Public Safety and Public Trust for Latino Communities.**
President Biden believes that the surge in gun violence that has
affected communities across the country over the last year and a half is
unacceptable, and his Administration is moving decisively to act with a
whole-of-government approach. Black and brown Americans
are [disproportionately
harmed](https://efsgv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019CDCdata.pdf) by the
direct and indirect consequences of gun violence, which causes lasting
trauma for children, families, and communities. The President continues
to call on Congress to take action to end this gun violence epidemic.
But he knows we cannot afford to wait a single day while lives are being
taken, which is why he has taken more action to reduce gun violence than
any other President at this point in their Administration. These
policies and programs include:

-   **Passing the First Commonsense Gun Safety Law in 30 years.** In
    June 2022, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities
    Act into law. It includes actions he has long called for and that
    will save lives, including funding crisis intervention, including
    red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a
    danger to themselves and to others; finally closing what’s known as
    the “boyfriend loophole,” so if you assault your girlfriend or
    boyfriend you cannot buy or own a gun; requires young people aged
    18-21 to undergo enhanced background checks; includes the first
    federal law that makes gun trafficking and straw purchases distinct
    federal crimes; clarifies who needs to register as a federally
    licensed gun dealer and run background checks before selling a gun;
    provides historic funding to address the youth mental health crisis
    in this country, especially the trauma experienced by survivors of
    gun violence; and invests in anti-violence programs to work directly
    with people who are most likely to commit gun crimes or become
    victims of gun crimes. President Biden is proposing to build on this
    progress, including by calling on Congress to ban assault weapons
    and high-capacity magazines, calling on Congress to require
    background checks for all gun sales, and the repeal of gun
    manufacturer immunity. 

<!-- -->

-   **Additional Funding to Prevent and Fight Crime.** The President’s
    FY 2023 budget and his Safer America Plan requests $17 billion to
    recruit, train, and hire police officers consistent with the
    standards in the President’s Executive Order to advance safe,
    effective, accountable, community policing in order to enhance
    public trust and public safety; and to invest in crime prevention
    and a fairer criminal justice, including by investing $20 billion in
    services that address the root causes of crime and by incentivizing
    the reform of laws that increase incarceration without redressing
    public safety. 

<!-- -->

-   **Reforming Federal Marijuana Laws to Promote Equity and Fairness in
    the Justice System.**  As President Biden repeatedly said during his
    campaign, no one should be in jail for using or possessing
    marijuana. Sending people to prison for possessing marijuana has
    upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many
    states no longer prohibit. In addition, although white, Black, and
    brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown people
    have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted at disproportionate
    rates. The President recently took three steps to end this failed
    approach and to begin to right these wrongs: 

<!-- -->

-   Announcing a pardon of all prior Federal offenses of simple
    possession of marijuana, including offenses under District of
    Columbia law. There are thousands of people who have prior Federal
    convictions for marijuana possession, who may be denied employment,
    housing, or educational opportunities as a result.  This action will
    help relieve the collateral consequences arising from these
    convictions.
-   Urging all Governors to pardon state offenses of simple marijuana
    possession, because just as no one should be in a Federal prison
    solely for possessing marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or
    state prison for that reason, either.
-   Asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney
    General to begin the administrative process to review expeditiously
    how marijuana is scheduled under Federal law. Marijuana is currently
    classified in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the same
    classification as heroin and LSD and higher than fentanyl and
    methamphetamine, the drugs driving our overdose epidemic. 

Finally, even as federal and state regulation of marijuana changes,
important limitations on trafficking, marketing, and under-age sales
should stay in place.  

-   **Advancing Safe, Effective Accountable Policing.** In May 2022, the
    President signed a historic executive order (EO) to advance
    effective, accountable policing and criminal justice practices that
    will build public trust and strengthen public safety. Police cannot
    fulfill their role to keep communities safe without public trust and
    confidence in law enforcement and the criminal justice system. Yet,
    there are places in America today where the bonds of trust are
    frayed or broken. To heal as a nation, we must acknowledge that
    fatal encounters with law enforcement have disproportionately
    involved Black and brown people. President Biden’s EO will enhance
    public trust by promoting accountability, transparency, and the
    principles of equality and dignity in policing and the larger
    criminal justice system. The EO mandates measures for all Federal
    law enforcement agencies, leveraging the President’s direct
    authority over the executive branch. The EO also requires the use of
    federal tools such as guidance on best practices, training and
    technical assistance, and grantmaking to support reforms at State,
    Tribal, local, and territorial law enforcement agencies that will
    strengthen public trust and improve public safety across the nation,
    including creating a new national database of police misconduct,
    ensuring timely and thorough investigations and consistent
    discipline, mandating the adoption of body-worn camera policies,
    bans the use of chokeholds and carotid restraints unless deadly
    force is authorized, restricts the use of no-knock entries, limits
    the use of force, establishes a duty to intervene to stop excessive
    force and render medical aid, reimagines crisis response, and
    implements anti-bias and de-escalation training.

<!-- -->

-   **Keeping Especially Dangerous Weapons and Repeat Shooters Off Our
    Streets.** The Justice Department issued a final rule to rein in the
    proliferation of ghost guns, which are un-serialized, privately made
    firearms that are increasingly being recovered at crime scenes. The
    Attorney General directed every U.S. Attorney’s Office nationwide to
    increase resources dedicated to district-specific violent crime
    strategies.

<!-- -->

-   **Keeping Guns Out of the Wrong Hands.** The Justice Department
    published model extreme risk protection order legislation to make it
    easier for states that want to adopt these red flag laws to do so.
    The Justice Department also issued a series of reforms: the first
    volume of its new, comprehensive report on firearms commerce and
    trafficking; new policy to underscore zero tolerance for willful
    violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that
    put public safety at risk; and the launch of five new law
    enforcement strike forces focused on addressing significant firearms
    trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York, Chicago,
    Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C.

<!-- -->

-   **Making Additional Progress to Reduce Community Violence.**
    President Biden called for cities and states to use American Rescue
    Plan funding to reduce gun crime and other violent crime, including
    by investing in community violence interventions and prevention.
    Through May 2022, $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds had been
    committed to public safety and violence prevention – including at
    least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds committed by more than
    half of states and more than 300 communities across the country.
    Additionally, five federal agencies made changes to 26 different
    programs to direct vital support to community violence intervention
    programs as quickly as possible.

**Improving and Reforming our Immigration System.** After four years of
chaos and cruelty under the previous Administration, President Biden has
been focused on rebuilding our immigration system and ensuring it is
more fair, humane, and orderly, including by: 

-   **Calling on Congress to Pass Immigration Reform Legislation.** On
    his first day in office, the President sent Congress his vision for
    immigration reform. The U.S. Citizenship Act – is comprehensive
    legislation that would create a pathway to permanent residence and
    eventual citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants
    living in and contributing to our country. The President’s plan
    would modernize our immigration system and provide resources to
    responsibly manage our borders, while also addressing the root
    causes of migration. President Biden and Vice President Harris have
    repeatedly expressed their strong support for legislation that would
    protect Dreamers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients,
    farmworkers, and essential workers and allow long-awaited pathways
    to permanent residence and eventual citizenship for these
    populations.  

<!-- -->

-   **Promoting Naturalization**. President Biden is committed to making
    the naturalization process more accessible for eligible noncitizens,
    directing the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
    and the Secretary of State to improve naturalization processing,
    identify and remove barriers to naturalization, and reduce backlogs
    for naturalization applications. To advance these goals, the
    President also established an Interagency Working Group to Promote
    Naturalization. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, U.S. Citizenship and
    Immigration Services (USCIS) awarded nearly $60 million in grants to
    66 organizations to provide citizenship preparation resources,
    support, and information to immigrants and immigrant-serving
    organizations.

<!-- -->

-   **Protecting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)
    Recipients and Dreamers.**  On his first day in office, President
    Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of
    Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, to
    take actions to preserve and fortify the 2012 DACA policy, under
    which eligible undocumented immigrant youth are provided temporary
    protection from removal and work authorization. In response to this
    directive, on August 24, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
    recently published a rule codifying the 2012 DACA policy in the
    USCIS regulations. The Biden-Harris Administration continues its
    fight to preserve DACA in the courts, while calling on Congress to
    enact legislation providing permanent protections for Dreamers. 

<!-- -->

-   **Reunifying Separated Families.** Less than two weeks into office,
    President Biden issued an Executive Order that established an
    interagency initiative to reunite the families separated at the
    Southwest border by the previous administration under its so-called
    “zero-tolerance policy.” The Biden-Harris Administration has now
    successfully reunified more than 500 children with their families.
    The Family Reunification Task Force continues to identify
    and engage families who were separated to ensure they are aware of
    the reunification process and available support, including
    critically needed behavioral health services to address the trauma
    they have suffered.  The Administration will continue to work
    tirelessly to deliver on President Biden’s commitment to reunite
    children separated from their families at the United States-Mexico
    border.

<!-- -->

-   **Reinstating and Expanding the Central American Minors (CAM)
    Program.** DHS and the Department of State (State) have reinstated
    and improved the Central American Minors (CAM) program, which allows
    parents and legal guardians of certain children who are nationals of
    El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to apply for refugee status or
    parole, and possible resettlement in the United States. As part of a
    phased approach, DHS and State are reopening cases that were closed
    when CAM was terminated in 2018 and have expanded eligibility of
    those who may petition for their children’s access to the U.S.
    Refugee Admissions Program.

<!-- -->

-   **Extending TPS for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.** DHS
    announced the extension of TPS designations for El Salvador,
    Honduras, and Nicaragua through December 31, 2022.

<!-- -->

-   **Designating Venezuela for TPS.** In March 2021, DHS designated
    Venezuela for TPS for 18 months, and in July 2022, extended TPS for
    an additional 18 months, until March 2024. This enables Venezuelan
    nationals who have resided in the United States since March 8, 2021,
    to request and receive TPS if they meet the eligibility
    requirements.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Immigrant Veterans.** The Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA) has partnered with DHS to provide needed care and
    services to deported veterans, including timely and accurate
    information on immigration services. In addition, DHS established an
    online center to consolidate federal resources for immigrant
    veterans, which includes a portal for deported veterans requesting
    permission to return to the United States or accessing VA benefits
    to which they may be entitled.

**Launching a Whole-Of-Government Initiative to Advance Equity and
Justice for Underserved Communities, Including Latino Communities.** On
his first day in office, President Biden signed the historic Executive
Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal
Workforce, establishing a cross-government initiative to advance equity
and justice for communities that have been historically underserved,
marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and
inequality, including many Latino communities. The President directed
all agencies to advance equity by taking comprehensive action to root
out bias from federal programs and policies, engage with underserved
communities, and ensure that federal resources equitably reach all
Americans, including Latinos.

**Protecting the Integrity of the Census. ** After years of attempts to
politicize the decennial Census count, President Biden gave career
professionals at the Census Bureau the time and space they needed to
deliver an accurate count of every American.  The 2020 Census results
reflect the [historic diversity of the
country](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html),
and the Census Bureau has made improvements to data collection so
they’re better able to reveal the multifaceted nature of growing Latino
communities.

**Supporting Hurricane Fiona Response and Recovery Efforts in Puerto
Rico.** In response to Hurricane Fiona, President Biden approved an
Emergency Declaration prior to landfall and immediately approved the
Governor of Puerto Rico’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for
Individual and Public Assistance, which authorized FEMA to provide
assistance for emergency measures to save lives and to protect property
and public health and safety and fund emergency protective measures.
More than 7 million liters of water, more than 4 million ready-to-eat
meals, more than 215 generators, more than 100,000 tarps, more than
28,000 plastic covers and more than 10,300 cots and other emergency
supplies were onsite and readily available for individuals and families.
The President also authorized 100% Federal Cost Share for the Government
of Puerto Rico to support Public Assistance for 30 days. This critical
support will provide 100% Federal funding for Debris Removal and
Emergency Protective Measures, and help Puerto Rico begin their recovery
without adding additional financial burden to communities that are
working to recover. The Biden-Harris Administration also increased
Critical Needs Assistance from $500 to $700 to support displaced
individuals and families with immediate or critical needs, such as
water, food, medical support, infant formula, personal hygiene items,
and fuel for transportation.

-   The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway
    Administration announced the immediate availability of $8 million in
    Emergency Relief funds for use by the Puerto Rico Highways and
    Transportation Authority. The funds will offset costs of repair work
    needed as a result of flooding and landslide damage to highways and
    bridges.

<!-- -->

-   In 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration unlocked more than $9
    billion dollars in federal disaster funds for Puerto Rico that are
    helping to rebuild from natural disasters and strengthen the island
    against future storms. To make sure Puerto Ricans have the support
    they need to get ahead, the American Rescue Plan permanently fixed
    Puerto Rico’s unequal treatment under the Child Tax Credit and
    Earned Income Tax Credit, providing workers and families with
    thousands of dollars in tax relief. 

<!-- -->

-   In July 2021, the White House established the Federal Working Group
    on Puerto Rico, an all-of-government Cabinet-level initiative to
    partner with Puerto Rico to invest in modern and resilient
    infrastructure, support inclusive economic development, expand
    education and workforce opportunities, and set the island on a
    course for future prosperity. In September 2021, the Biden
    Administration announced that Puerto Rico would receive $3 billion
    per year in Medicaid funding from the federal government in
    perpetuity, supporting the provision of affordable, quality health
    care for residents of Puerto Rico.

<!-- -->

-   **Investing in Long-term Climate Resilience in Puerto Rico through
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan:**
    The American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    together provide an opportunity to make a historic investment in
    Puerto Rico’s infrastructure to bolster resilience against future
    climate change and extreme weather events. To date, more than $184
    million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has been allocated to
    Puerto Rico for infrastructure resilience in 2022, including $163
    million in funding for the Caño Martín Peña Channel Restoration from
    the US Army Corps of Engineers. And Puerto Rico has invested $223
    million in American Rescue Plan funds for water improvements and
    maintenance – with an additional $130 million for the Caño Martín
    Peña Channel Restoration, $28 million to improve hydraulic pumping
    infrastructure, and $65 million in assistance to Puerto Rico’s water
    and sewer authority to make improvements and maintain existing
    infrastructure. In addition, Puerto Rico has invested $279 million
    in American Rescue Plan funds to make significant repairs to school
    buildings damaged in past storms.

<!-- -->

-   **An additional $38 million was allocated to Puerto Rico in 2022 for
    weatherization under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.**  The
    Weatherization Assistance Program helps low-income families reduce
    household energy expenditures. Examples of weatherization include
    more efficient cooling systems, light fixtures, and household
    appliances, installation of solar water heaters, and measures to
    reduce hot water use.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Critical Infrastructure Needs in Puerto Rico:**  The
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already delivering results for the
    people of Puerto Rico, making critical investments that will improve
    lives, help grow the economy, position the Island for success, and
    reach all communities, including rural communities and historically
    underserved populations. To date, more than $688 million in
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is
    headed to Puerto Rico. In 2022 alone, Puerto Rico will receive more
    than $380 million for transportation to invest in roads, bridges,
    public transit, ports and airports and over $78 million for clean
    water. And, as of today, more than 505,000 households across the
    Island are receiving affordable internet due to the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. 

<!-- -->

-   **The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also makes significant
    investments to increase the resilience of Puerto Rico’s grid.** The
    Department of Energy’s Preventing Outages and Enhancing the
    Resilience of the Electric Grid formula grant program allocates $3.7
    million to Puerto Rico in 2022 to improve the resilience of the
    electric grid against disruptive events. The Department’s State
    Energy Program also allocates $4.7 million to Puerto Rico to enhance
    energy security, advance state-led clean energy initiatives, and
    increase energy affordability.

<!-- -->

-   **Puerto Rico has made $223 million in Water Infrastructure
    Investments with American Rescue Plan funds:**
    -   $130 million to make water and infrastructure investments as
        part of the restoration of Caño Martín Peña – a channel in the
        San Juan area with risks of flooding & contamination. 
    -   $28 million to improve hydraulic pumping infrastructure to
        reduce flooding – to make improvements to 14 flood pump stations
        to increase resilience to flooding & storms. 
    -   $65 million in assistance to Puerto Rico’s water & sewer
        authority for improvements & maintenance.  

<!-- -->

-   **In addition, Puerto Rico has invested $279 million in American
    Rescue Plan funds to make physical repairs to school buildings:**
    The Improvements to Educational Institutions Program objective is to
    repair the school’s structural damage caused by natural disasters so
    that students could return to in-person instruction. Through July
    2022, Puerto Rico had completed 230 schools and repaired 26,425
    columns at educational institutions.** **
-   **Permanently expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit & the Child Tax
    Credit for Puerto Rico through the American Rescue Plan:** Before
    the American Rescue Plan, Puerto Rico’s child poverty rate was 50+%,
    but only 10% of families with children were eligible for the Child
    Tax Credit because only those with 3 or more children qualified. ARP
    removed that restriction permanently and, as a result, this tax
    filing season, 97% of Puerto Rico’s families are eligible for the
    expanded credit. This comes at a time when we have at long last
    ensured that workers in Puerto Rico will also be treated more fairly
    by the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Before this year, Puerto
    Rico’s locally administered EITC, when it was available, had never
    received federal support – and as a result, the credit was
    significantly smaller than the federal EITC. While Puerto Rico
    workers will still claim their EITC through their commonwealth
    government, the American Rescue Plan is helping Puerto Rico fund a
    dramatic expansion of the credit. The American Rescue Plan is
    providing $600 million in annual federal dollars on top of $200
    million in Puerto Rico tax dollars, allowing Puerto Rico to more
    than triple available EITC benefits for workers. This expansion
    increased the maximum EITC for a family with two children from
    $1,500 to $5,500 – bringing the credit broadly in line with the
    maximum benefit available to a similar family living elsewhere in
    the United States.** **

<!-- -->

-   **Emergency Rental Assistance for over 100,000 Puerto Rico
    families:** Through June, Puerto Rico had distributed $179 million
    in Emergency Rental Assistance through 105,000 payments to Puerto
    Rico Renters & their families. 

<!-- -->

-   **Historic support for distressed union pensions in Puerto Rico:**
    The American’s Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance program to
    restore the solvency of distressed pension plans is providing $28
    million to the GWU Local 610 pension plan based in San Juan,
    ensuring that the more than 2,600 hospitality workers and retirees
    covered by the plan will receive the benefits they have earned for
    decades to come. 

<!-- -->

-   **In addition to using its American Rescue Plan funds to invest in
    resiliency and water infrastructure, Puerto Rico has invested ARP
    funds in other critical areas:**

<!-- -->

-   **Over $500 million for premium pay for frontline workers:** Puerto
    Rico has invested $436 million for premium pay to essential public
    sector workers & private sector frontline workers and $90 million in
    premium pay for hospital workers.
-   **$143 million for the First Responders Program –** to help local
    governments maintain essential services & keep first responders on
    the job.
-   **$152 million for emergency assistance to municipalities,**
    providing municipalities with assistance of last resort, for waste
    disposal, road maintenance, public safety & other services.
-   **$50 million for Low Income Housing repairs –** to improve the
    living conditions of Puerto Rico’s families by removing health and
    safety hazards from housing units.
-   **$76 million for the Commonwealth’s Utility:** This program
    provides funds to the Puerto Rico Power Authority to purchase
    additional fuel and provide maintenance of generators to meet
    increased demand for electricity, broadband, and water.
-   **$100 million for road repairs and maintenance:** This program
    provides the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTOP)
    with up to $25M per year for FY22, FY23, and FY24 for road
    maintenance with an additional $25M in FY22 to purchase required
    equipment.

**Appointing a Historically Diverse Cabinet and Administration.** The
Biden-Harris Administration includes barrier-breaking Latino leaders.
Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the first Latino and immigrant to serve
as Secretary of Homeland Security, and Secretary Xavier Becerra is the
first Latino to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Administrator Isabella Guzman leads the Small Business Administration,
Secretary Miguel Cardona leads the Department of Education, Julie Chavez
Rodriguez is the Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President and
Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, Emmy
Ruiz is the Assistant to the President and White House Director of
Political Strategy and Outreach, and Robert Santos is first Latino and
the first person of color to be Director of the United States Census
Bureau. 

President Biden has assembled the most diverse Administration in our
nation’s history, and is proud to serve alongside the [15
percent](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/29/fact-sheet-100-days-in-biden-harris-administration-makes-history-with-presidential-appointees/)
of all appointees who identify as Latino or Hispanic, and the 32 percent
of all appointees who are naturalized citizens or the children of
immigrants. 

**Diversifying the Federal Court System.** The Biden-Harris
Administration is working to ensure that nominees to the judicial system
reflect the growing diversity of our nation. To date, 21% of the
President’s federal judicial nominees to circuit court of appeals,
district courts, and the Court of Federal Claims are Latino, including
many historical firsts that have been confirmed: Judge Myrna Pérez is
the only active Latina serving on the Second Circuit and the second
Latina ever to serve (the first was Justice Sonia Sotomayor) on the
Second Circuit; Judge Salvador Mendoza is the first Hispanic judge to
serve on the Ninth Circuit from Washington State; Judge Ana de Alba is
the first Latina ever to serve on the Eastern District of California;
Judge Nancy L. Maldonado is the first Latina to serve as a federal
district court judge in Illinois; and Judge Armando Bonilla is the first
Hispanic judge ever to serve on the Court of Federal Claims.
