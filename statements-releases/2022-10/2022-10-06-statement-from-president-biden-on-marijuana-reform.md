title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Marijuana\_Reform"
---
 
As I often said during my campaign for President, no one should be in
jail just for using or possessing marijuana.  Sending people to prison
for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated
people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit. Criminal records
for marijuana possession have also imposed needless barriers to
employment, housing, and educational opportunities.  And while white and
Black and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown
people have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted at disproportionate
rates.  
   
Today, I am announcing three steps that I am taking to end this failed
approach.  
   
First, I am announcing a pardon of all prior Federal offenses of simple
possession of marijuana.  I have directed the Attorney General to
develop an administrative process for the issuance of certificates of
pardon to eligible individuals.  There are thousands of people who have
prior Federal convictions for marijuana possession, who may be denied
employment, housing, or educational opportunities as a result.  My
action will help relieve the collateral consequences arising from these
convictions.  
   
Second, I am urging all Governors to do the same with regard to state
offenses.  Just as no one should be in a Federal prison solely due to
the possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state
prison for that reason, either.  
   
Third, I am asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the
Attorney General to initiate the administrative process to review
expeditiously how marijuana is scheduled under federal law.  Federal law
currently classifies marijuana in Schedule I of the Controlled
Substances Act, the classification meant for the most dangerous
substances.  This is the same schedule as for heroin and LSD, and even
higher than the classification of fentanyl and methamphetamine – the
drugs that are driving our overdose epidemic.   
   
Finally, even as federal and state regulation of marijuana changes,
important limitations on trafficking, marketing, and under-age sales
should stay in place.  
   
Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to
marijuana.  It’s time that we right these wrongs.
