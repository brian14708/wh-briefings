---
 
Today, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the
Office of Public Engagement hosted over 40 elected officials and
community leaders from Georgia at the White House “Communities in
Action: Building a Better Georgia” event. The half-day forum featured a
drop-by from First Lady Jill Biden who was recently in Georgia for a
Joining Forces event. Participants heard from senior Biden-Harris
Administration officials, including Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Michael Reagan, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, Senior
Advisor to the President for Public Engagement Keisha Lance Bottoms,
White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu, White House
American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, and Deputy Director for
Intergovernmental Affairs Gabe Amo. The event featured discussions on
the benefits and impact of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan,
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS
and Science Act for working families in Georgia. White House officials
highlighted the strong partnership between the Biden-Harris
Administration and Georgia state and local government officials, labor
leaders, businesses, non-profits, and business leaders, and the
opportunities to continue partnering to leverage these historic
investments to create and expand opportunities for working families.
This was the sixth in a series of “Communities in Action” events that
the White House will host with state, local, Tribal and community
leaders to demonstrate how the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering
results for the American people.
