Today, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the
Office of Public Engagement hosted over 40 elected officials and
community leaders from Georgia at the White House “Communities in
Action: Building a Better Georgia” event. The half-day forum featured a
drop-by from First Lady Jill Biden who was recently in Georgia for a
Joining Forces event. Participants heard from senior Biden-Harris
Administration officials, including Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Michael Reagan, Senior Advisor to the President for Public
Engagement Keisha Lance Bottoms, White House Infrastructure Coordinator
Mitch Landrieu, White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene
Sperling, and Deputy Director for Intergovernmental Affairs Gabe Amo.
The event featured discussions on the benefits and impact of President
Biden’s American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation
Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act for working families in
Georgia. White House officials highlighted the strong partnership
between the Biden-Harris Administration and Georgia state and local
government officials, labor leaders, businesses, non-profits, and
business leaders, and the opportunities to continue partnering to
leverage these historic investments to create and expand opportunities
for working families. This was the sixth in a series of “Communities in
Action” events that the White House will host with state, local, Tribal
and community leaders to demonstrate how the Biden-Harris Administration
is delivering results for the American people.
