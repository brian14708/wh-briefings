title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s call with Prime Minister Kishida of\_Japan"
---
 
President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Kishida of Japan today to
reinforce our ironclad commitment to Japan’s defense following the
DPRK’s long-range ballistic missile launch over Japan on October 3. The
leaders jointly condemned the DPRK’s missile test in the strongest
terms, recognizing the launch as a danger to the Japanese people,
destabilizing to the region, and a clear violation of United Nations
Security Council resolutions. They confirmed they would continue to
closely coordinate their immediate and longer-term response bilaterally,
trilaterally with the Republic of Korea, and with the international
community. The leaders discussed the importance of immediate return and
resolution of the cases of Japanese citizens abducted by the DPRK and
resolved to continue every effort to limit the DPRK’s ability to support
its unlawful ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs.
