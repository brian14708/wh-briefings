title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the United Nations General Assembly Vote\
  \ Condemning Russia\u2019s Illegal Attempts to Annex Ukrainian\_Territory"
---
 
Today, the overwhelming majority of the world—nations from every region,
large and small, representing a wide array of ideologies and governments
– voted to defend the United Nations Charter and condemn Russia’s
illegal attempt to annex Ukrainian territory by force. 143 nations stood
on the side of freedom, sovereignty, and territorial integrity—even more
than the 141 nations that voted in March to unequivocally condemn
Russia’s war against Ukraine. Only 4 chose to side with Russia—Belarus,
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Nicaragua, and Syria.

By attacking the core tenets of the UN Charter, Russia is tearing at the
very foundations of international peace and security. The stakes of this
conflict are clear to all—and the world has sent a clear message in
response: Russia cannot erase a sovereign state from the map. Russia
cannot change borders by force. Russia cannot seize another country’s
territory as its own. Ukraine is entitled to the same rights as every
other sovereign country. It must be able to choose its own future, and
its people must be able to live peacefully inside its internationally
recognized borders.

Nearly eight months into this war, the world has just demonstrated that
it is more united, and more determined than ever to hold Russia
accountable for its violations. Together with the UN General Assembly,
we will not tolerate illegal attempts at annexation or the theft of a
neighbor’s land by force. We will stand up for international law, the UN
Charter, and the rights and protections it affords to Ukraine and its
people – and to every state and people everywhere.
