*White House “Buy Clean” Convening Spurs New Commitments to Reduce
Industrial Emissions and Support Made in America Steel, Concrete, and
More*

At a White House convening today, National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi and
Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory will join state
leaders to share knowledge and discuss opportunities to collaborate on
expanding the purchase of lower-carbon materials made by American
workers. Ahead of this convening, the Biden-Harris Administration is
announcing a new set of public and private sector commitments aligned
with President Biden’s [Federal Buy Clean
Initiative](http://www.sustainability.gov/buyclean), which leverages the
Federal Government’s power as the largest purchaser in the world to
advance low-carbon construction materials across its procurement and
funded infrastructure projects.  
  
President Biden has ushered in an American manufacturing boom, with
nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs added during his Administration so
far. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation
Reduction Act, the President secured historic investments to upgrade our
nation’s infrastructure and grow our clean energy economy. By leveraging
the U.S. Government’s purchasing power, President Biden is catalyzing
markets and positioning American manufacturing to compete and lead.

Partnerships between state, Tribal, regional, local and industry leaders
are critical to ensure that Buy Clean investments in clean manufacturing
and climate-resilient infrastructure benefit all Americans across the
country. President Biden’s [Action Plan to Accelerate
Infrastructure](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/13/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-announces-action-plan-to-accelerate-infrastructure)
recognizes that over 90% of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is
delivered by non-federal agencies, underscoring the need for strong
partnerships across public and private sectors. Building on recent
[Administration
announcements](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-buy-clean-actions-to-ensure-american-manufacturing-leads-in-the-21st-century/)
through the [Federal Buy Clean
Initiative](https://www.sustainability.gov/buyclean/), today’s actions
to create more good-paying manufacturing jobs while tackling the climate
crisis include:  

-   **New Federal Support:** Federal agencies are supporting Buy Clean
    through new nationwide programs. The Department of Transportation is
    announcing that 25 states will receive the first Federal Highway
    Administration [Climate
    Challenge](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/fhwa-steps-efforts-tackle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-highway-construction-71-million-climate)
    grants to support sustainable pavements. The Department of Energy
    will coordinate Inflation Reduction Act funds for an Advanced
    Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. This will help industrial
    facilities retrofit, upgrade, or install industrial technologies and
    produce low-carbon materials.  
-   **Private Sector Commitments:** Companies are also stepping up and
    announcing new support for Buy Clean initiatives. Major
    manufacturers are committing to boost the supply of clean products
    made in America. Across the industrial sector, 60 companies have
    joined the [Better Climate
    Challenge](https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/climate-challenge)
    where they’ve committed to reducing portfolio-wide greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emissions by at least 50% by 2030. At the same time, leading
    businesses are using their engineering, design and purchasing power
    to drive the demand for low-carbon construction materials.  
-   **State and Local Action:** Leaders from 20 states will join today’s
    White House convening to share knowledge and discuss opportunities
    for collaboration and alignment between State Buy Clean efforts and
    the Federal Buy Clean Initiative. Cities are also harnessing their
    purchasing power through public works projects to shift the
    construction industry toward a cleaner future. Through initiatives
    like the [C40 Clean Construction
    Accelerator](https://www.c40.org/accelerators/clean-construction/)
    and the [Clean Construction Action
    Coalition](https://www.c40.org/news/clean-construction-coalition-halve-emissions-2030/),
    cities and industry leaders are working together to achieve
    thriving, resilient, and healthy communities—especially for the most
    vulnerable and historically-marginalized neighborhoods.

**<u>NEW FEDERAL SUPPORT</u>**

Last month, the Biden-Harris Administration
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-buy-clean-actions-to-ensure-american-manufacturing-leads-in-the-21st-century/)
a major set of Buy Clean initiatives, including a policy to prioritize
the Federal Government’s purchase of steel, concrete, asphalt, and flat
glass that have lower embodied emissions across their
lifecycle—including manufacturing, transportation, installation,
maintenance, and disposal. These construction materials account for
nearly half of all GHG emissions from U.S. manufacturing.    
  
New actions from across the Biden-Harris Administration announced today
include:

-   **The Department of Transportation’s** **(DOT) Federal Highway
    Administration (FHWA)** is announcing grants for 25 State
    Departments of Transportation through the [Climate
    Challenge](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/fhwa-highlights-actions-tackle-climate-change-new-programs-and-historic-funding-under)
    to reduce GHG emissions in highway projects through the use of
    sustainable construction materials. It also supports the new [Carbon
    Reduction Program
    (CRP)](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/president-biden-usdot-announce-new-guidance-and-64-billion-help-states-reduce-carbon)
    announced earlier this year that unlocks $6.4 billion in formula
    funding for states and localities over five years to develop carbon
    reduction strategies and address the climate crisis.  
-   **The Department of Energy (DOE),** through the [**Better Climate
    Challenge**](https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/climate-challenge),
    is partnering with organizations across the U.S. economy to set
    ambitious goals for reducing their carbon emissions, and to share
    real world strategies to decarbonize buildings and plants. Since the
    passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, three new industrial
    firms–Metal Technologies, Inc, Intertape Polymer Group, and Bentley
    Mills–have joined the Better Climate Challenge. Cleveland-Cliffs is
    the first American steel producer to participate in the Challenge,
    and represents the largest industrial energy user in DOE’s [Better
    Plants](https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/better-plants)
    program. DOE also recently
    [launched](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-launches-new-energy-earthshot-cut-industrial-heating-emissions-85-percent)
    the Industrial Heat Shot™ to develop cost-competitive solutions for
    industrial heating processes, used to make everything from food to
    cement and steel. The effort aims to not only realize at least 85%
    lower greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, but also support DOE’s
    [Industrial Decarbonization
    Roadmap](https://www.energy.gov/eere/doe-industrial-decarbonization-roadmap)
    to reduce industrial emissions while benefitting workers and
    revitalizing communities.  
-   **The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** is kicking off a
    series of stakeholder engagement sessions to help shape $350 million
    in new grants, technical assistance, and tools from the Inflation
    Reduction Act to lower GHG emissions in construction materials.
    EPA’s [ENERGY STAR Industrial
    Partnership](https://www.energystar.gov/industrial_plants/energy_star_plant_certification/buy_clean_procurement_and_energy_star_0)
    is also helping over 800 manufacturing companies improve energy
    efficiency in manufacturing plants. Industrial energy efficiency can
    provide over 30% of the emission reductions needed from the
    industrial sector in 2050.  
-   **The** **General Services Administration (GSA)** recently issued a
    [Clean Construction Materials Request for
    Information](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-seeks-industry-input-on-clean-construction-materials-10042022)
    to gather input from industry partners on the availability of
    domestically-manufactured, locally sourced, and low-carbon
    construction materials. This feedback will help inform $2.15 billion
    in Inflation Reduction Act funding for federal procurement of
    lower-carbon materials and products containing steel, concrete, flat
    glass, asphalt, and potentially other construction materials used in
    nationwide federal construction, modernization, and paving
    projects.  
-   **The** **Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)** is
    designing a new program supported by the Inflation Reduction Act.
    The Green and Resilient Retrofit Program will make funding available
    to support energy and water efficiency retrofits, make use of clean
    energy and energy storage, promote building electricity, and
    increase climate resilience for HUD-assisted multifamily properties.
    HUD has released [a Request for
    Information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/27/2022-20855/green-and-resilient-retrofit-program-request-for-information)
    to assess program design and uses for project funding and/or
    financing, including low-emission building materials or processes.

**<u>PRIVATE SECTOR COMMITMENTS</u>**  
  
Concrete and steel are the most widely used construction materials in
the world. Each year, more than four billion tons of cement are
produced, accounting for around 8% of global GHG emissions, all of which
occur well before a concrete truck arrives on a job site. Federal,
state, and local governments purchase about half of concrete poured and
cast in the United States; the other half is purchased by the private
sector. Strong partners in the manufacturing sector are innovating and
investing in scaling up production of lower-carbon materials. At the
same time, design, architecture and engineering firms are integrating
cleaner materials into project designs, and major corporate purchasers
are sending clear demand signals. Together, we can grow clean
manufacturing jobs and reach net zero emissions:

-   **General Motors** will join the [First Movers
    Coalition](https://www.weforum.org/first-movers-coalition), the
    public-private partnership that intends to help commercialize
    zero-carbon technologies by harnessing purchasing power. General
    Motors joins the coalition as a member of the concrete sector, with
    an ambitious pledge to purchase at least 10% (by volume) near-zero
    concrete by 2030 and beyond.  
-   **Starbucks** commits to reduce carbon emissions in its direct
    operations and supply chain 50% by 2030, including advancing
    measurement and reductions in embodied and lifecycle carbon for its
    equipment and building materials. Through the Greener Stores
    program, it has launched an open-source educational series, with
    actions that can be taken to support reductions in carbon, water and
    waste—including sourcing sustainable materials.
