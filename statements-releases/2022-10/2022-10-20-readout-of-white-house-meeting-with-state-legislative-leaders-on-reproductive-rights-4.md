title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Legislative Leaders on Reproductive\_\
  Rights"
---
 
Today, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
Gender Policy Council, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the
President and Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental
Affairs, chaired a meeting with state legislative leaders from states
that have banned abortion. During the meeting, participants discussed
efforts to protect access to reproductive health care in these states
where reproductive rights are under attack.

Since the Supreme Court’s decision overturning *Roe v. Wade* on June 24,
2022, Republican elected officials across the country have moved to
enforce abortion bans – including in states with archaic pre-*Roe* laws,
such as Wisconsin (1849) and Arizona (1864). More than a dozen states
currently have abortion bans in effect, including more than a dozen
near-total bans from the moment of fertilization, and a dozen with no
exceptions for rape or incest. Many of these state laws have extreme
punishments for health care providers, such as Alabama’s law, which
could imprison doctors for 99 years or life for performing an abortion.
Texas’s law threatens physicians with life in prison and fines no less
than $100,000 for performing abortions, putting the lives and health of
women at risk. Already, news reports from across the country show the
devastating impact these bans are inflicting on doctor-patient
relationships, access to care, and women’s health more broadly. 

State legislative leaders across the country are on the frontlines of
defending access to reproductive health care. In the meeting,
participants discussed anticipated attacks on reproductive health care
access in upcoming legislative sessions, as well as affirmative policies
they are exploring to support the populations living under these
draconian bans. White House Senior Officials thanked the leaders for
their efforts and ongoing partnership with the White House to protect
access to reproductive health care, and reiterated the President’s
commitment to ensuring access to reproductive health care nationwide,
including by prioritizing a bill to codify *Roe* into law in the next
Congress.

State legislative leaders included:

-   South Carolina Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto
-   Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo
-   Missouri House Minority Floor Leader Crystal Quade
-   Texas State Representative Donna Howard
-   Arizona State Representative Raquel Teran

-   Georgia State Senator Nan Orrock
-   Louisiana State Representative Mandie Landry
-   Mississippi State Representative Zakiya Summers
-   Tennessee State Senator London Lamar
-   West Virginia State Delegate Danielle Walker
-   Wisconsin State Representative Lisa Subeck
