title: "FACT SHEET: Cheaper Hearing Aids Now in Stores Thanks to Biden-\u2060Harris\
  \ Administration Competition\_Agenda"
---
 
To lower the price of hearing aids and expand access, President Biden’s
[Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American
Economy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/)
called on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make hearing aids
available over the counter, without a prescription. That is now reality.
Starting today, hearings aids are now on store shelves across the
country—for thousands of dollars less than they previously cost.  

Specifically, today, under [a final
rule](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-08-17/pdf/2022-17230.pdf)
issued by the FDA, adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss can buy
hearing aids at a store or online without a prescription, exam, or
audiologist fitting. FDA
[estimates](https://www.fda.gov/media/160971/download) this could lower
average costs by as much as $3,000 per pair—providing significant
breathing room for the nearly [30 million
Americans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564588/) with
hearing loss, including nearly 10 million adults under age 60.  

Retailers across the country are now selling over-the-counter hearing
aids. Options available today or coming soon include: 

-   Starting today, **Walgreens** is selling hearings aids at stores
    nationwide and online for $799 per pair. According to Walgreens,
    comparable models sold by specialists range from $2,000 to $8,000 a
    pair.  
-   Starting today, **CVS** will start selling over-the-counter hearing
    aids on CVS.com, with varying options on model and price point. CVS
    will also offer hearing aids in select CVS Pharmacy locations

-   Starting today, **Walmart** will offer an assortment of
    over-the-counter hearing aids on Walmart.com, SamsClub.com, and in

    well as 474 Sam’s Club Hearing Aid Center locations. Available
    products will range in price from $199 to $999 per pair, while

    aids online and in 34 locations across Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,
