title: "FACT SHEET: Cheaper Hearing Aids Now in Stores Thanks to Biden-\u2060Harris\
  \ Administration Competition\_Agenda"
---
 
To lower the price of hearing aids and expand access, President Biden’s
[Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American
Economy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/)
called on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make hearing aids
available over the counter, without a prescription. That is now reality.
Starting today, hearings aids are now on store shelves across the
country—for thousands of dollars less than they previously cost.  

Specifically, today, under [a final
rule](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-08-17/pdf/2022-17230.pdf)
issued by the FDA, adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss can buy
hearing aids at a store or online without a prescription, exam, or
audiologist fitting. FDA
[estimates](https://www.fda.gov/media/160971/download) this could lower
average costs by as much as $3,000 per pair—providing significant
breathing room for the nearly [30 million
Americans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564588/) with
hearing loss, including nearly 10 million adults under age 60.  

Retailers across the country are now selling over-the-counter hearing
aids. Options available today or coming soon include: 

-   Starting today, **Walgreens** is selling hearings aids at stores
    nationwide and online for $799 per pair. According to Walgreens,
    comparable models sold by specialists range from $2,000 to $8,000 a
    pair.  
-   Starting today, **CVS** will start selling over-the-counter hearing
    aids on CVS.com, with varying options on model and price point. CVS
    will also offer hearing aids in select CVS Pharmacy locations
    beginning in November.  
-   Starting today, **Walmart** will offer an assortment of
    over-the-counter hearing aids on Walmart.com, SamsClub.com, and in
    over 1,000 Vision Centers in Walmart stores across Colorado,
    Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas, as
    well as 474 Sam’s Club Hearing Aid Center locations. Available
    products will range in price from $199 to $999 per pair, while
    according to Walmart, comparable prescription hearing aids are
    priced at $4,400 to $5,500 per pair.

    hearing devices online. By the end of October, it will offer hearing
    aids in nearly 300 stores across the country. Devices will range in
    price between $200 and $3,000.

    aids online and in 34 locations across Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,
