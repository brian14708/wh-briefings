title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Giorgia Meloni Becoming\_Prime Minister\
  \ of\_Italy"
---
 
I congratulate Giorgia Meloni on becoming the new Prime Minister of
Italy. Italy is a vital NATO Ally and close partner as our nations
together address shared global challenges. As leaders in the G7, I look
forward to continuing to advance our support for Ukraine, hold Russia
accountable for its aggression, ensure respect for human rights and
democratic values, and build sustainable economic growth.
