title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Action Plan to\
  \ Accelerate Infrastructure"
---
 
For decades, American presidents have promised to invest in
infrastructure but did not deliver. President Biden brought together
Democrats, Independents and Republicans to pass the most significant
investment in infrastructure since the Eisenhower Administration. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making a once-in-a-generation
investment in America’s infrastructure and competitiveness that will
create good-paying union jobs, grow our economy, invest in communities,
combat climate change, promote domestic innovation and manufacturing,
and help lower costs for American families. In addition to better roads,
bridges, ports and airports, cleaner water, and faster internet, the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also provided a historic down payment
toward achieving the Administration’s climate agenda with funding for
clean energy, a stronger electric grid, resilience in physical and
natural systems, cleaner transportation, and cleaning up legacy
pollution. Coupled with the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and
Science Act, these federal resources present an unprecedented
opportunity to build a better America.

While the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to
implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and delivered impressive
early results, accelerating the pace by which the federal, state and
local governments and the private sector can deliver infrastructure
projects is critical to fully maximizing the benefits of the Law.  The
Administration is engaged in a whole-of-government effort – in
partnership with business, labor, states, local, Tribal, territorial,
and civic leaders – to implement these laws effectively and deliver for
the American people.

While building infrastructure can be complex and challenging, American
ingenuity and government creativity can be used to build our
infrastructure to a higher standard of “On Time, On Task, and On
Budget.”  As we approach the one-year milestone of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the Biden-Harris Administration is determined to
accelerate our progress. Federal agencies will do their part, focused as
never before on accelerating the pace of design, construction and
permitting. But with over 90% of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding
being delivered by non-federal agencies, our state, Tribal, regional,
territorial, local and industry partners must also find ways to
accelerate the delivery of infrastructure. 

In May, the Biden-Harris Administration released a new [Permitting
Action
Plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Biden-Harris-Permitting-Action-Plan.pdf) to
strengthen and accelerate federal permitting and environmental reviews
by fully leveraging existing authorities, as well as new provisions in
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Permitting Action Plan outlines
the Administration’s strategy for ensuring that federal environmental
reviews and permitting processes are effective, efficient, and
transparent, guided by the best available science to promote positive
environmental and community outcomes, and shaped by early and meaningful
public engagement.

The recently-signed Inflation Reduction Act provides $1 billion over the
next ten years for federal agencies to support the timely review of
major federal infrastructure projects, along with training for more
effective community engagement, a critical aspect of project
development.

To build on that effort, today, at the White House Accelerating
Infrastructure Summit, the Administration and outside organizations are
announcing [new efforts and an Action Plan to accelerate the rebuilding
of our
infrastructure](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/build/accelerating-infrastructure/) and
maximize this once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a better
America.
