  \ Hurricane\_Ian"

In the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, President Biden continues to direct
his entire Administration to prioritize lifesaving actions and ensure
delivery of essential services and support to survivors across multiple
states.  
  
The recent steps the President has taken to ensure everything possible
is done to help communities impacted by Hurricane Ian include:  
  
**Additional actions taken in the last 24 hours:**

-   An additional four counties in Florida were approved for Individual
    Assistance and Debris Removal as part of the President’s Expedited
    Major Disaster Declaration for the state of Florida: Flagler,
    Putnam, St. Johns, and Volusia. This brings the total counties
    approved to date to 17, with additional assessments still underway,
    and over 87,300 households have registered for assistance.  
-   Yesterday, the President approved an Expedited Major Disaster
    Declaration for the Seminole Tribe of Florida to make aid for
    temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover
    uninsured property losses, and other programs available to help
    individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
    hurricane.  
-   Last night, through the work of the U.S. Coast Guard and the Tampa
    Bay maritime community, the Port of Tampa Bay was reopened.  This is
    a significant milestone that will help support Hurricane Ian
    recovery efforts across the state of Florida. The Port of Tampa Bay
    provides nearly half of Florida with its fuel supply and supports
    tens of thousands of jobs.  
-   The President approved an Emergency Declaration for North Carolina
    early this morning, providing Federal assistance to support
    emergency preparedness and response efforts.  
-   President Biden spoke with the Governors of Florida and South
    Carolina to ensure the needs of the State of Florida and the State
    of South Carolina continue to be met.  
-   President Biden spoke with Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hooper
    and Aviation Survival Technician Second Class Zach Loesch to
    personally thank them for the heroic work that they and their Coast
    Guard colleagues have performed during search and rescue operations
    in response to Hurricane Ian. As of this morning, over 3,500 people
    and nearly 140 pets have been rescued by U. S. Coast Guard, Federal,
    state, and local search and rescue teams. The number of Federal
    teams supporting search and rescue operations has doubled.  
-   Power has been restored to 1.7 million customers in Florida the last
    48 hours. Nearly 44,000 utility workers from 33 states and the
    District of Columbia are supporting restoration efforts.   
-   At the President’s direction, FEMA activated a medical support
    contract for ambulances and paratransit seats. All requested
    National Disaster Medical System assets arrived in Florida,
    including 400 ambulances, 15 bariatric paratransit ambulances, and
    four rotary aircraft to evacuate medically vulnerable individuals in
    nursing homes and other medical facilities as needed.

**Supporting life-saving response work and surging support on the
ground:**

-   Currently, the Biden-Harris Administration has more than 3,400
    Federal response personnel working in Florida and the Southeast. An
    additional 6 Federal Search and Response teams have been deployed to
    help evacuate survivors and search for missing people.  
-   The President directed the deployment of an unprecedented Search and
    Rescue Coordination Group before the storm made landfall. This
    group, led by FEMA, began conducting search and rescue operations
    before daylight on September 29 and continue to conducting
    operations today. Teams came from across the Federal government and
    included skilled rescuers from FEMA Urban Search and Rescue task
    forces, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of Defense, Customs and
    Border Protection, the Department of the Interior, and state and
    local responders.  
-   At the President’s direction, the Army Corps of Engineers has now
    deployed over 550 personnel to conduct engineering evaluations about
    the safety of bridges, roads, and other infrastructure and to assess
    emergency power needs. They are installing generators to support
    critical infrastructure, focusing on hospitals and long-term care
    facilities, water treatment and wastewater plants, and public safety
    organizations such as 911 call centers.  
-   The Department of Health and Human Services promptly declared a
    Public Health Emergency and deployed three disaster medical
    assistance teams to the region to support emerging health and
    medical needs.     
-   Looking ahead to the urgent needs of hurricane survivors, the
    President has asked FEMA to focus on the housing needs of survivors
    as well as other immediate challenges they will face in recovering
    from Ian.  FEMA Administrator Criswell established an interagency
    Recovery Leadership Team to proactively address the recovery needs
    of individual survivors and expedite assistance to those in
    desperate need of help.

**Issuing Federal disaster assistance:**

-   On September 29, President Biden approved an Expedited Major
    Disaster Declaration for the state of Florida, providing Individual
    Assistance and Debris Removal for 9 counties, and 100% direct
    Federal assistance for costs associated with search and rescue,
    sheltering, feeding, and other emergency measures to save lives for
    30 days.    
-   President Biden approved a pre-landfall Emergency Declaration for
    Florida on September 24, to ensure lifesaving resources and Federal
    responders were pre-positioned in advance of potential storm
    impacts. President Biden approved a pre-landfall Emergency
    Declaration for South Carolina on September 29.
