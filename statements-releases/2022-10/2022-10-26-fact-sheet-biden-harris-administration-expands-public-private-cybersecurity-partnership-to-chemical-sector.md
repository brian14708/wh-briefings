title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Expands Public-Private Cybersecurity\
  \ Partnership to Chemical\_Sector"
---
 
A keystone of the Biden-Harris Administration’s cybersecurity commitment
is strengthening the resilience of the United States’ critical
infrastructure to safeguard the services Americans rely on every day.
Today, the Administration continued to deliver on this commitment by
expanding the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Cybersecurity Initiative
to a fourth sector – the chemical sector.

The majority of chemical companies are privately owned, so we need a
collaborative approach between the private sector and government. The
nation’s leading chemical companies and the government’s lead agency for
the chemical sector – the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA)
– have agreed on a plan to promote a higher standard of cybersecurity
across the sector, including capabilities that enable visibility and
threat detection for industrial control systems.

The Chemical Action Plan will serve as a roadmap to guide the sector’s
assessment of their current cybersecurity practices over the next 100
days, building on the lessons learned and best practices of the
previously launched action plans for the electric, pipeline, and water
sectors to meet the needs for this sector. The Chemical Action Plan
will:

-   Focus on high-risk chemical facilities that present significant
    chemical release hazards with the ultimate goal of supporting
    enhanced ICS cybersecurity across the entire chemical sector;
-   Drive information sharing and analytical coordination between the
    Federal Government and the chemical sector;
-   Foster collaboration with the sector owners and operators to
    facilitate and encourage the deployment of appropriate technologies
    based on each chemical facility’s own risk assessment and
    cybersecurity posture. The Federal Government will not select,
    endorse, or recommend any specific technology or provider; and,
-   Support the continuity of chemical production critical to the
    national and economic security of the United States. The chemical
    sector produces and manufactures chemicals that are used directly or
    as building blocks in the everyday lives of Americans, from
    fertilizers and disinfectants to personal care products and energy
    sources, among others.  

The ICS Cybersecurity Initiatives emphasizes that cybersecurity
continues to be a top priority for the Administration.
