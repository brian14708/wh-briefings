title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden Marking Five Years Since the Las Vegas\_\
  Shooting"
---
 
Five years ago, a concert became a killing field, and our nation was
once more shocked to our very core. For 10 terrifying minutes, a lone
gunman fired more than 1,000 bullets into the crowd at the Route 91
Harvest Festival, taking the lives of 60 of our fellow Americans,
wounding hundreds more, and leaving so many others scarred by the
carnage they witnessed. This massacre remains the deadliest mass
shooting in modern U.S. history.  
   
In the face of such horror, Nevadans showed what it meant to be
\#VegasStrong. Concertgoers risked their own lives to bring others to
safety. Community members stood in line for hours to donate blood, while
first responders worked swiftly to save lives. The city rallied together
to raise money for medical costs and a memorial in honor of the
victims.  
   
From the Nevada desert, we heard the same cry that we’ve heard in the
aftermath of Sandy Hook, Charleston, Parkland, Uvalde, Buffalo, and too
many neighborhoods to count: Do something. And, my Administration has
been working tirelessly to heed that call. I’ve taken more executive
action to curb gun violence than any president at this point in office,
including cracking down on ghost guns and rogue gun dealers. This past
summer, in the face of fierce lobbying by the National Rifle Association
and the gun industry, the Senate confirmed Steve Dettelbach on a
bipartisan vote as the first permanent head of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in more than seven years, where he is
playing a leading role in getting illegal guns off our streets. And,
after decades of gridlock in Congress, I signed into law the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act—the first significant gun violence reduction
legislation in nearly 30 years.  
   
But, we’re not stopping there. I am determined to seize this momentum
and work with Congress to enact further commonsense gun violence
prevention legislation, including banning assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines, which have enabled shooters to slaughter so
many innocents. We’ve done it before, and we can do it again. The
memories of the victims demand nothing less.  
   
Jill and I mourn with all those who lost a piece of their soul on
October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2017. May God bless those taken from us and
comfort the loved ones of the fallen. And may we resolve to turn our
heartbreak into action.
