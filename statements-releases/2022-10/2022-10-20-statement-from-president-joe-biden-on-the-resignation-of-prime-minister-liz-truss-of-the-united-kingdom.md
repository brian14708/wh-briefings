title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Resignation of Prime Minister Liz\
  \ Truss of the United\_Kingdom"
---
 
The United States and the United Kingdom are strong Allies and enduring
friends — and that fact will never change. I thank Prime Minister Liz
Truss for her partnership on a range of issues including holding Russia
accountable for its war against Ukraine. We will continue our close
cooperation with the U.K. government as we work together to meet the
global challenges our nations face.
