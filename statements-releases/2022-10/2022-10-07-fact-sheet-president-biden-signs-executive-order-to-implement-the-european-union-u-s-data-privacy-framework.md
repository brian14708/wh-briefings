title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Signs Executive Order to Implement the European\
  \ Union-U.S. Data Privacy\_Framework"
---
 
Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards
for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.) directing the
steps that the United States will take to implement the U.S. commitments
under the European Union-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF)
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/25/fact-sheet-united-states-and-european-commission-announce-trans-atlantic-data-privacy-framework/)
by President Biden and European Commission President von der Leyen in
March of 2022. 

Transatlantic data flows are critical to enabling the $7.1 trillion
EU-U.S. economic relationship.  The EU-U.S. DPF will restore an
important legal basis for transatlantic data flows by addressing
concerns that the Court of Justice of the European Union raised in
striking down the prior EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as a valid data
transfer mechanism under EU law. 

The Executive Order bolsters an already rigorous array of privacy and
civil liberties safeguards for U.S. signals intelligence activities. It
also creates an independent and binding mechanism enabling individuals
in qualifying states and regional economic integration organizations, as
designated under the E.O., to seek redress if they believe their
personal data was collected through U.S. signals intelligence in a
manner that violated applicable U.S. law.  
  
U.S. and EU companies large and small across all sectors of the economy
rely upon cross-border data flows to participate in the digital economy
and expand economic opportunities. The EU-U.S. DPF represents the
culmination of a joint effort by the United States and the European
Commission to restore trust and stability to transatlantic data flows
and reflects the strength of the enduring EU-U.S. relationship based on
our shared values. 

In particular, the Executive Order:

-   **Adds further safeguards** for U.S. signals intelligence
    activities, including requiring that such activities be conducted
    only in pursuit of defined national security objectives; take into
    consideration the privacy and civil liberties of all persons,
    regardless of nationality or country of residence; and be conducted
    only when necessary to advance a validated intelligence priority and
    only to the extent and in a manner proportionate to that priority.  
-   **Mandates handling requirements for personal information**
    collected through signals intelligence activities and extends the
    responsibilities of legal, oversight, and compliance officials to
    ensure that appropriate actions are taken to remediate incidents of
    non-compliance.     
-   **Requires U.S. Intelligence Community elements to update their
    policies and procedures** to reflect the new privacy and civil
    liberties safeguards contained in the E.O.   
-   **Creates a multi-layer mechanism for individuals from qualifying
    states and regional economic integration organizations, as
    designated pursuant to the E.O., to obtain independent and binding
    review and redress** of claims that their personal information
    collected through U.S. signals intelligence was collected or handled
    by the United States in violation of applicable U.S. law, including
    the enhanced safeguards in the E.O.   
    -   Under the first layer, the Civil Liberties Protection Officer in
        the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (CLPO) will
        conduct an initial investigation of qualifying complaints
        received to determine whether the E.O.’s enhanced safeguards or
        other applicable U.S. law were violated and, if so, to determine
        the appropriate remediation. The E.O. builds up the existing
        statutory CLPO functions by establishing that the CLPO’s
        decision will be binding on the Intelligence Community, subject
        to the second layer of review, and provides protections to
        ensure the independence of the CLPO’s investigations and
        determinations.  
    -   As a second layer of review, the E.O. authorizes and directs the
        Attorney General to establish a Data Protection Review Court
        (“DPRC”) to provide independent and binding review of the CLPO’s
        decisions, upon an application from the individual or an element
        of the Intelligence Community. Judges on the DPRC will be
        appointed from outside the U.S. Government, have relevant
        experience in the fields of data privacy and national security,
        review cases independently, and enjoy protections against
        removal. Decisions of the DPRC regarding whether there was a
        violation of applicable U.S. law and, if so, what remediation is
        to be implemented will be binding. To further enhance the DPRC’s
        review, the E.O. provides for the DPRC to select a special
        advocate in each case who will advocate regarding the
        complainant’s interest in the matter and ensure that the DPRC is
        well-informed of the issues and the law with regard to the
        matter. The Attorney General today issued accompanying
        regulations on the establishment of the DPRC.  
-   **Calls on the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to review
    Intelligence Community policies and procedures** to ensure that they
    are consistent with the Executive Order and to conduct an annual
    review of the redress process, including to review whether the
    Intelligence Community has fully complied with determinations made
    by the CLPO and the DPRC.

These steps will provide the European Commission with a basis to adopt a
new adequacy determination, which will restore an important, accessible,
and affordable data transfer mechanism under EU law. It will also
provide greater legal certainty for companies using Standard Contractual
Clauses and Binding Corporate Rules to transfer EU personal data to the
United States.
