Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer met yesterday with
Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka. Mr. Finer reaffirmed the United
States’ immediate, significant, and continuing support for Albania’s
efforts to strengthen its cybersecurity in the face of repeated,
disruptive cyber attacks by Iran. He expressed U.S. appreciation for our
strong cooperation on bilateral, regional, and global issues. He
highlighted our work together as NATO Allies and praised Albania’s
leadership as a member of the UN Security Council, especially as co-pen
holder with the United States on resolutions related to Russia’s
unprovoked and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine. In addition, Mr. Finer
thanked the Albanian people for their generosity in temporarily hosting
those who have left Afghanistan.
