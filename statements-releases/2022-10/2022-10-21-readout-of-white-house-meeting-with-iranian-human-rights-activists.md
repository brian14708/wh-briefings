Today, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy
Council Jennifer Klein, along with senior officials from the National
Security Council, convened a meeting with Iranian activists and experts
to hear perspectives on how the Biden-Harris Administration can continue
supporting the Iranian people as they bravely call for equal rights and
basic human dignity. The group discussed the pivotal role of Iranian
women in mobilizing a diverse coalition of Iranians protesting against
the brutality of the government, and discussed the diplomatic and
economic tools the United States is pursuing to support Iranian
protestors and hold the Iranian government accountable.
