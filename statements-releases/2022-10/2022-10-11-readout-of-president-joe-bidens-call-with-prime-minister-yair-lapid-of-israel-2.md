President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke today with Prime Minister Yair Lapid
of Israel to congratulate him on a historic breakthrough agreement to
establish a permanent maritime boundary between Israel and Lebanon. The
President commended the Prime Minister’s persistent and principled
diplomacy and praised his team for the consultative spirit demonstrated
throughout months of talks mediated by the United States.  The President
underscored his unshakeable commitment to Israel’s security and
discussed how the agreement announced today not only preserves and
further enhances Israel’s security and economic interests, but also
creates new opportunities for Israel’s regional integration and national
prosperity.  He stressed that the United States remains ready to
facilitate resolution of issues that may arise under the agreement, if
called upon by the parties.
