title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Violent Crackdown in\_Iran"
---
 
I remain gravely concerned about reports of the intensifying violent
crackdown on peaceful protestors in Iran, including students and women,
who are demanding their equal rights and basic human dignity.  They are
calling for just and universal principles, which underpin the UN Charter
and Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  For decades, Iran’s regime
has denied fundamental freedoms to its people and suppressed the
aspirations of successive generations through intimidation, coercion,
and violence. The United States stands with Iranian women and all the
citizens of Iran who are inspiring the world with their bravery.  
   
The United States is making it easier for Iranians to access the
Internet, including through facilitating greater access to secure,
outside platforms and services.  The United States is also holding
accountable Iranian officials and entities, such as the Morality Police,
that are responsible for employing violence to suppress civil society.
 This week, the United States will be imposing further costs on
perpetrators of violence against peaceful protestors.  We will continue
holding Iranian officials accountable and supporting the rights of
Iranians to protest freely.
