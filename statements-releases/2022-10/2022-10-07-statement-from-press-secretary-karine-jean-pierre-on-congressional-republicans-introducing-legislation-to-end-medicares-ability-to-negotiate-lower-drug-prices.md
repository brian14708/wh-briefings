title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Congressional Republicans\
  \ Introducing Legislation to End Medicare\u2019s Ability to Negotiate Lower Drug\_\
  Prices"
---
 
Today, MAGA Congressional Republicans [introduced
legislation](https://www.lankford.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Lankford%20Lee%20Protect%20Drug%20Innovation%20Act.pdf)
that puts special interests before working families. Their new bill is a
giveaway to big pharma at the expense of seniors by ending Medicareâ€™s
new ability to negotiate lower drug prices. Their vision for the country
is extreme and out of touch with working families across the country.
