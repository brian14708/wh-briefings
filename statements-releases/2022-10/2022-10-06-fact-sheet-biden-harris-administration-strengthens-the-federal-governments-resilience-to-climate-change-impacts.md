title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Strengthens the Federal Government\u2019\
  s Resilience to Climate Change\_Impacts"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions by more
than 20 agencies to bolster the Federal Government’s resilience to the
worsening impacts of climate change. These actions are detailed in
annual agency adaptation progress reports and highlight an
Administration-wide commitment to confronting the climate crisis by
integrating climate-readiness across every agency’s mission and
programs.  
  
More frequent and severe weather events, including droughts, extreme
heat, wildfires, floods, and hurricanes, create mounting climate-related
damages nationwide. Climate-related disasters impact millions of
Americans each year when roads wash out, power goes down, homes and
businesses burn, crops fail, and schools flood. Last year alone, the
United States faced 20 extreme weather and climate related disaster
events with losses exceeding $1 billion each—a cumulative price tag of
more than $145 billion. The Federal Government’s employees, assets, and
operations are exposed to these same impacts. With a footprint of over
300,000 buildings, over 600,000 vehicles, and the responsibility for
delivering critical goods and services, the Biden-Harris Administration
is minimizing disruptions, creating safer working conditions,
strengthening supply chains, saving taxpayer money, and sustaining our
mission.  
  
In February 2021, President Biden charged agencies to revitalize Federal
climate adaptation efforts through [*Executive Order 14008 on Tackling
the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/).

In October 2021, Federal agencies [released climate adaptation
plans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/07/fact-sheet-biden-administration-releases-agency-climate-adaptation-and-resilience-plans-from-across-federal-government/)
that identified and addressed their most significant climate risks.
Through these plans, agencies initiated actions to address a broad range
of risks, including to programs, facilities, worker safety, supply
chains, grants, and contracts. As part of this work, the White House
also launched an effort to rebuild the Federal Government’s information
resources and capacity to act on climate data. For example, in September
2022, the Administration launched a first-of-its-kind climate adaptation
training for Federal program acquisition managers. The training provides
a high-level overview on how to manage climate risks, including how
climate change hazards may impact Federal programs and what steps they
can take to prepare for these impacts. While the training is tailored
for a community of approximately 1,500 Federal program acquisition
managers, over 250,000 Federal Acquisition Institute users can take the
course.  
  
In addition to shoring up Federal Government operations and programs,
the Biden-Harris Administration continues to work with states, Tribes,
and local governments in a coordinated effort to protect America’s
communities, economies, and infrastructure from the most severe impacts
of climate change. Further, the Administration has worked closely with
Congress to provide key adaptation investments supported by President
Biden’s [Inflation Reduction
Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/15/by-the-numbers-the-inflation-reduction-act/)
and [Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law](https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/),
including $50 billion in investments to protect American infrastructure
against catastrophic wildfires, heat, and floods, and $4.5 billion for
drought preparedness.  
  
The reports released today show significant progress made by agencies to
bolster adaptation and increase resilience to climate impacts.
Highlights from the [2022 Climate Adaptation Progress
Reports](https://www.sustainability.gov/federalsustainabilityplan/resilience.html)
are below:

-   **Safeguarding Federal investments.** Across the government,
    agencies analyzed new data and tools to reduce risks to Federal
    facilities, infrastructure, and critical assets. For example, the
    **Department of Defense (DOD)** expanded the number of major
    installations and sites using the [DOD Climate Assessment
    Tool](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/05/2002614579/-1/-1/0/DOD-CLIMATE-ASSESSMENT-TOOL.PDF)
    (DCAT) from 157 to over 1,900. The DCAT is a comprehensive screening
    tool that rigorously identifies climate hazards, empowering
    officials with information to prioritize where best to invest
    resources and how to mitigate potential harm and security impacts
    through adaptive solutions. For example, Florida’s Tyndall Air Force
    Base is creating an “Installation of the Future” that is resilient
    to climate change impacts. Tyndall suffered $5 billion in damages
    from Category-5 Hurricane Michael, which destroyed almost 500
    buildings and impeded critical operations. Local, state, and
    national partners are leveraging funds to construct living
    shorelines and oyster reef habitats adjacent to the base to preserve
    water quality, enhance overall ecosystem health, and strengthen
    flood resilience. Additionally, over the past year, the **General
    Services Administration** has incorporated climate risk requirements
    into several major solicitations with an approximate combined
    spending of more than $400 million.  
-   **Developing a more resilient supply chain.** The **Department of
    Energy (DOE)** is strengthening the reliability of key technology
    supply chains, specifically focused on adding large-capacity
    batteries used for storage and backup generation at its 17 national
    labs. The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** developed a
    Supply Chain Risk Management Plan to protect research equipment and
    regional labs from climate change hazards and to continue Superfund
    site and emergency response activities during a natural disaster. In
    2022, **DOD** stood up the Federal Consortium for Advanced
    Batteries, which coordinates interagency action on a more secure
    domestic lithium battery supply chain. Additionally, **DOD** has
    also committed to increase energy resilience by building microgrid
    capability at critical installations.  
-   **Expanding and deepening agency resilience efforts.** The
    **Department of Labor** created a Climate Adaptation Plan Committee
    to support collaboration on all climate adaptation initiatives,
    including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s
    expanded use of strategic enforcement tools to protect Federal
    workers and workers from over 70 industries from extreme heat
    conditions. The **Department of Agriculture** required [each of its
    13 major agencies to identify and address climate change
    risks](https://www.usda.gov/oce/energy-and-environment/climate/adaptation),
    while the **Department of the Interior (DOI)** has similarly
    directed its Bureaus and offices to update major policies [to
    improve and increase climate adaptation and
    resilience](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/elips/documents/so-3399-508_0.pdf)
    in meeting its mission. EPA’s 21 Regional and National Program
    Offices identified and are addressing climate change risks specific
    to the region and program.   
-   **Strengthening institutional climate adaptation capacity.** Agency
    decisionmakers and front-line employees are building skills and
    knowledge to address climate change impacts to their specific
    mission. For example, the **Department of Homeland Security**
    [launched a
    program](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/01/12/department-homeland-security-announces-climate-change-professionals-program)
    in January 2022 to train its first class of climate adaptation
    fellows, deploying them to deepen climate adaptation and resilience
    expertise across programs. The **Department of Transportation**’s
    reinstituted Climate Change Center is developing a climate education
    and training program for its 50,000 Department employees and other
    stakeholders. For example, the Center is working with the
    **Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration** to deliver climate information and support to
    transportation planners and stakeholders to enhance the safety,
    effectiveness, equity, and resilience of U.S. transportation
    infrastructure.  
-   **Incorporating environmental justice and equity into Federal
    adaptation efforts.** Over the past year, agencies have embedded
    environmental justice and equity principles into their policies,
    processes, and procedures, including adaptation and resilience
    planning, in an effort to address past injustices and provide equal
    treatment to all U.S. Citizens. **DOI** is investing $46 million
    from the *Bipartisan Infrastructure Law* and Fiscal Year 2022
    appropriations in [Tribal
    communities](https://doi.gov/priorities/investing-americas-infrastructure/tribal-investments)
    to address the unique impacts of climate change in indigenous
    communities. The funds also increase support for a community-led
    relocation effort of Tribes, dedicating $130 million from 2022-2026.
    This past year, **DOE** funded $12 million to 13 Tribes for
    innovative projects to reduce energy costs, increase energy security
    and resilience through new microgrids, and develop novel cost share
    reductions. The **Department of the Treasury** recently built a
    hurricane-resistant customer call center in Puerto Rico, which
    employs 2,000 people and is strategically located and built to
    withstand future severe weather events, including hurricanes and
    earthquakes.
