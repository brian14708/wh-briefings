title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on \u201CFamily Glitch\u201D Final\_Rule"

Health care should be a right, not a privilege. But for many Americans
caught in the so-called “family glitch,” the peace of mind that health
insurance brings has remained out of reach. Because of this
glitch, employer-based health insurance has been considered “affordable”
if the coverage is affordable for the employee even if it is not for
their family members—making those family members ineligible for
Affordable Care Act subsidies even though they need them to afford
quality coverage.  
   
In April, I announced that we were proposing to fix this regulatory
flaw. Now, the Treasury Department is finalizing that fix so that the
law works the way Congress intended and the cost of coverage comes down
for families all over the country. Starting next month, Americans can
sign up to take advantage of this change. About 1 million Americans will
either gain coverage or see their insurance become more affordable as a
result of the new rule. This marks the most significant administrative
action to implement the Affordable Care Act since the law was first put
into place. It builds on our progress so far, which has brought the rate
of uninsured Americans to a record-low eight percent. My Administration
will continue working every day to lower costs and expand quality,
affordable health coverage to all Americans, and I urge everyone to take
advantage by visiting [HealthCare.gov starting November
1<sup>st</sup>](https://www.healthcare.gov/) and signing up for a plan
that works best for them.
