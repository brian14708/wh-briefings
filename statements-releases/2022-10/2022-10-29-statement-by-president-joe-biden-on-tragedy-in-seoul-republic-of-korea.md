Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved
ones in Seoul. We grieve with the people of the Republic of Korea and
send our best wishes for a quick recovery to all those who were injured.
The Alliance between our two countries has never been more vibrant or
more vital – and the ties between our people are stronger than ever. The
United States stands with the Republic of Korea during this tragic time.
