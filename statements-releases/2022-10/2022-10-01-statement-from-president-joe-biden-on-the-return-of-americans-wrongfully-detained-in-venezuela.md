title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Return of Americans Wrongfully\
  \ Detained in\_Venezuela"
---
 
Today, after years of being wrongfully detained in Venezuela, we are
bringing home Jorge Toledo, Tomeu Vadell, Alirio Zambrano, Jose Luis
Zambrano, Jose Pereira, Matthew Heath, and Osman Khan.  These
individuals will soon be reunited with their families and back in the
arms of their loved ones where they belong.  I am grateful for the hard
work of dedicated public servants across the U.S. Government who made
this possible, and who continue to deliver on my Administration’s
unflinching commitment to keep faith with Americans held hostage and
wrongfully detained all around the world.  Today, we celebrate that
seven families will be whole once more. To all the families who are
still suffering and separated from their loved ones who are wrongfully
detained – know that we remain dedicated to securing their release.  
   
It is also a priority of my Administration to prevent Americans from
having to endure the unimaginable pain of being held hostage or
wrongfully detained. This summer, I signed an executive order that will
impose new costs, including sanctions and visa bans, against the
perpetrators of such acts.  In addition, the State Department has
introduced a new warning indicator “D” that is designed to help
Americans understand where and when travel may incur increased risks of
wrongful detention, potentially for long periods of time.  If travelers
make the decision to go despite this “D” warning, they need to know that
they are incurring massive personal risk and that it may not be feasible
for the U.S. Government to secure their release.
