title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces New Public and Private-Sector\
  \ Efforts to Advance Racial Equity at Freedman\u2019s Bank\_Forum"
---
 
Today, Vice President Harris will announce a slate of new actions taken
by the Biden-Harris Administration and private sector stakeholders to
deliver capital and resources to underserved small businesses and the
community lenders who serve them.  Small businesses are the engines of
our economy and the path to economic prosperity for countless Americans
in underserved communities.  Community lenders—including Community
Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository
Institutions (MDIs), and others—are vital to unlocking the full economic
potential of these communities, turning previously sidelined talent into
a source of economic growth and shared prosperity for all. 

Unfortunately, for too long, the small business ecosystem in underserved
communities has struggled to keep up with better funded businesses and
entrepreneurs in more prosperous communities.  Entrepreneurs of color
regularly report being turned away by traditional financial institutions
for loans at higher rates than their white counterparts.  And the
community lenders committed to filling that gap similarly report that
shortfalls in capital and technical capacity limit their ability to
invest in the communities that need them the most.

Under President Biden and Vice President Harris’s leadership, this
Administration has taken significant steps to address these
disparities.  Over the past two years, the Treasury Department
(Treasury) has directed more than $15 billion in investments and tax
credits to community lenders and other mission capital providers,
allowing them to expand their efforts to drive inclusive
entrepreneurship and create high-opportunity communities.  This past
summer, the Vice President announced a first-of-its-kind private sector
initiative—the [Economic Opportunity
Coalition](https://www.economicopportunitycoalition.org/)
(EOC)—committed to investing billions of dollars in underserved
communities and small businesses emerging from the pandemic.

Today’s announcements build on that work.  With new commitments from
agencies across the federal government, the Administration is taking the
next step towards ensuring that underserved small businesses and
community lenders can reliably access the resources necessary for
success.  For underserved communities, small businesses, and community
lenders, these new policies mean increased investments, greater
regulatory clarity, and improvements in infrastructure and capacity.

**<u>New Federal Investments in Underserved Small Businesses</u>**

-   **Government Contracts for Small, Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs).**
     Today, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is issuing a
    memorandum to federal agencies to set individualized goals for an
    unprecedented 12 percent of FY 2023 governmentwide procurement
    dollarsto go to SDBs, up from a FY 2022 goal of 11 percent and a
    statutory goal of 5 percent.Today’s action will put agencies on a
    path to meet the [President’s
    goal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-build-black-wealth-and-narrow-the-racial-wealth-gap/)
    of increasing annual SDB spending from an average of 9.8 percent
    over 5 years prior to the start of the Biden-Harris Administration
    to 15 percent by FY 2025.
-   **New Lenders for Underserved Small Businesses**.  This Fall, the
    Small Business Administration (SBA) will propose a rule to expand
    its lender base by lifting the moratorium on new Small Business
    Lending Companies (SBLCs), which would allow new lenders to apply
    for a license to offer SBA-backed 7(a) small business loans.  The
    SBA’s objective for this policy change is to grow the number of
    lenders that receive its loan guarantee, thus increasing small
    business lending, particularly in smaller-dollar and underserved
    markets, where borrowers are most acutely shut out of current
    lending.
-   **Technical Assistance for Underserved Entrepreneurs.**  Using funds
    made available through the ARP, the Minority Business Development
    Agency (MDBA) will issue a $100 million notice of funding
    opportunity to provide technical assistance grants for
    entrepreneurship technical assistance providers to help businesses
    owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (SEDIs)
    launch, scale and connect with growth capital.
-   **Opportunities for Smaller Asset Management Firms.**  The Pension
    Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is releasing [a review of its
    Smaller Asset Manager Pilot
    Program](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pbgc.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2Fpbgc-smaller-asset-managers-pilot-program-final.pdf&data=05%7C01%7CBeech.Mary.K%40dol.gov%7C0d872add1e8946c486e408daa56395b8%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C638004144376424725%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=WXROVakz8aTxbrnRmmbgrkdiUDe78WyN8UbclFvF%2FhY%3D&reserved=0),
    a first-of-its-kind program to reduce barriers to competition and
    create opportunities for smaller investment management firms to
    manage some of the agency’s fixed-income assets.  The review finds
    that each of the participating smaller managers generated net-of-fee
    returns exceeding the benchmark.  Earlier this year, the PBGC Board
    established the pilot as an ongoing program, and is exploring
    opportunities for expansion.

**<u>Improving Federal Support for Community Lenders and other Community
Financial Institutions</u>**

-   **CDFI Fund Increasing Accountability and Clarifying Impact for
    Financially Underserved Communities.  **Through the CDFI Fund,
    Treasury is soliciting public comment regarding the CDFI
    certification requirements as well as the designation of a Minority
    Lending Institution (MLI).  The CDFI Fund is in the process of
    updating the requirements and standards for CDFI certification and
    has released for public review policies that define clearer
    guardrails for the activity of CDFIs and provide greater
    transparency into their impact.  The CDFI Fund also published for
    public comment criteria for designating a certified CDFI as an MLI.
     These policy steps will clarify the value of investing through
    community financial institutions, which is important for private
    investors that seek to align with recent historic federal investment
    in this sector.
-   **Coordinating Federal Investments in Underserved Communities.
     **The newly formed Interagency Community Investment Committee
    (ICIC) issued a [request for information
    (RFI)](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2022-21524/opportunities-and-challenges-in-federal-community-investment-programs)
    to gather input from the American people on how to improve the
    effectiveness and impact of federal community investment programs. 
    The Administration invites feedback from community stakeholders,
    including local government, civil society, as well as the private
    sector, to understand the specific challenges of accessing and
    working with federal community investment programs.  This feedback
    will enable the ICIC to better align numerous federal programs,
    thereby facilitating the flow of resources into underserved
    communities. 
-   **Feedback on Small-Balance Mortgages.**  To facilitate greater
    availability of small-balance mortgages, HUD is issuing an RFI to
    solicit specific and actionable feedback on the barriers that
    prevent the origination of these mortgages and recommendations for
    increasing the volume of small-mortgage loans in FHA programs.  This
    RFI supplements a report also released today by HUD’s Office of
    Policy Development and Research that assesses the factors that limit
    the supply of small mortgages and the impact to affordable
    homeownership for those interested in lower-priced homes.

**These new policy steps follow two recent announcements by the
Administration of billions of dollars in investments for CDFIs and
MDIs.**

-   **Investments under the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP).
     **Vice President Harris recently joined Secretary Yellen to
    announce that Treasury has funded over $8.28 billion in 162
    community financial institutions across the country through ECIP.
     The communities served by these ECIP investments are geographically
    diverse, and many share a common characteristic of having suffered
    from a lack of investment historically. 
-    Last week, Treasury, through the CDFI Fund, announced $11.4 million
    in grant awards under the Small Dollar Loan Program, $27.6 million
    under the CDFI/NACA Program, and three guarantees totaling $355
    million under the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI)
    Bond Guarantee Program.  The Small Dollar Loan Program helps
    certified CDFIs expand consumer access to mainstream financial
    institutions and provide alternatives to high-cost small dollar
    loans.  Of the 66 CDFIs receiving awards, 13 are MDIs, eight are
    based in Puerto Rico and one in Guam.  The CDFI Program/NACA Program
    provides monetary awards to invest in and build the capacity of
    CDFIs.  There are 218 organizations receiving Technical Assistance
    awards, the largest number of award recipients in program history.
     Recipients include 56 MDIs and 38 organizations based in Puerto
    Rico.  The CDFI Bond Guarantee Program provides low-cost capital to
    spur economic growth and jump start community revitalization.

**<u>New Private Sector Investments in Underserved Communities</u>**

On July 28, 2022, Vice President Harris announced the formation of the
**EOC, a historic partnership of more than 20 corporations and
foundations to catalyze private investments to address disparities and
accelerate inclusive economic opportunity.**  EOC members include Ariel
Investments, Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Capital One, Citi, Discover,
Ford Foundation, Goldman Sachs, Google, Intercontinental Exchange, Key
Bank, Kresge Foundation, Mastercard, McDonald’s, McKinsey & Company,
Micron, Momentus Capital, Moody’s, Netflix, Next Street, PayPal, PNC,
Rockefeller Foundation, TIAA, Upstart and Wells Fargo.

**As part of today’s announcement, EOC members have committed more than
$1 billion in investments that will:**

-   EOC members have committed to moving $1 billion in deposits to MDIs
    to increase access to affordable capital in communities of color.
    ** **As an initial commitment to this initiative, Bank of America,
    Intercontinental Exchange, KeyBank, Moody’s, PayPal, Next Street,
    and Wells Fargo have already committed more than $550 million.
-   Mastercard is launching Strive USA to help 5 million small
    businesses access capital, go digital, and grow networks, with an
    intentional focus on women and entrepreneurs of color.  As part of
    its launch, Strive USA and Next Street are working with New York
    City to build on Mayor Adams’ initiative to launch its one-stop-shop
    Business Portal.  Together, they are linking business owners to
    financing options, advisors, educational content, and a community of
    representative, local business owners.
-   Google, BNY Mellon, Citi, KeyBank, Mastercard, Moody’s, and Upstart
    are establishing a Center of Excellence for the more than 1,000
    CDFIs and MDIs that serve over 1 million people in low-to-moderate
    income (LMI) communities per year.  This shared platform will
    provide CDFIs and MDIs with the access to the technology, data, and
    professional expertise from EOC members.
-   Micron is partnering with Alphabet on a new Semiconductor Career
    Certificates Program to open up pathways for students, especially
    students of color, to obtain the tens of thousands of new, highly
    paid technical and operational American jobs created through their
    recently announced plans to invest in domestic memory manufacturing.
     The effort will also include partnerships from key non-profits like
    YearUp, Co-Op, and Merit America.

**Outside of the EOC, philanthropies and the private sector are making
complementary investments by leveraging the underwriting and capital
channeled to community lenders and capital providers. Fund for Inclusive
Entrepreneurship.**  

Today, Hyphen announced the Fund for Inclusive Entrepreneurship, a $100
million national initiative to expand access to capital for small
businesses owned by people of color.  With lead support from JPMorgan
Chase and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, the Fund will offer a two-stage
approach: (1) building capacity among high-impact community lenders, and
(2) raising private capital to invest alongside federal funding.
