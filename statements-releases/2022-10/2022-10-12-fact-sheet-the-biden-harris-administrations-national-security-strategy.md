President Biden’s National Security Strategy outlines how the United
States will advance our vital interests and pursue a free, open,
prosperous, and secure world. We will leverage all elements of our
national power to outcompete our strategic competitors; tackle shared
challenges; and shape the rules of the road.

The Strategy is rooted in our national interests: to protect the
security of the American people, to expand economic opportunity, and to
realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American
way of life. In pursuit of these objectives, we will:

-   **Invest** in the underlying sources and tools of American power and
    influence;
-   **Build** the strongest possible coalition of nations to enhance our
    collective influence to shape the global strategic environment and
    to solve shared challenges; and
-   **Modernize** and strengthen our military so it is equipped for the
    era of strategic competition.

**<u>COOPERATION IN THE AGE OF COMPETITION</u>**  
In the early years of this decisive decade, the terms of geopolitical
competition will be set while the window of opportunity to deal with
shared challenges will narrow. We cannot compete successfully to shape
the international order unless we have an affirmative plan to tackle
shared challenges, and we cannot do that unless we recognize how
heightened competition affects cooperation and act accordingly.

**Strategic Competition. **The most pressing strategic challenge we face
as we pursue a free, open, prosperous, and secure world are from powers
that layer authoritarian governance with a revisionist foreign policy.

-   We will effectively compete with the People’s Republic of China,
    which is the only competitor with both the intent and, increasingly,
    the capability to reshape the international order, while
    constraining a dangerous Russia.
-   Strategic competition is global, but we will avoid the temptation to
    view the world solely through a competitive lens, and engage
    countries on their own terms.

**Shared Challenges**. While this competition is underway, people all
over the world are struggling to cope with the effects of shared
challenges that cross borders—whether it is climate change, food
insecurity, communicable diseases, or inflation. These shared challenges
are not marginal issues that are secondary to geopolitics. They are at
the very core of national and international security and must be treated
as such.

-   We are building the strongest and broadest coalition of nations to
    enhance our collective capacity to solve these challenges and
    deliver for the American people and those around the world.
-   To preserve and increase international cooperation in an age of
    competition, we will pursue a dual-track approach. On one track, we
    will work with any country, including our competitors, willing to
    constructively address shared challenges within the rules-based
    international order and while working to strengthen international
    institutions. On the other track, we will deepen cooperation with
    democracies at the core of our coalition, creating a latticework of
    strong, resilient, and mutually reinforcing relationships that prove
    democracies can deliver for their people and the world.

**<u>INVESTING AT HOME</u>**  
The Biden-Harris Administration has broken down the dividing line
between domestic and foreign policy because our strength at home and
abroad are inextricably linked. The challenges of our age, from
strategic competition to climate change, require us to make investments
that sharpen our competitive edge and bolster our resilience.

-   Our democracy is at the core of who we are and is a continuous work
    in progress. Our system of government enshrines the rule of law and
    strives to protect the equality and dignity of all individuals. As
    we strive to live up to our ideals, to reckon with and remedy our
    shortcomings, we will inspire others around the world to do the
    same.
-   We are complementing the innovative power of the private sector with
    a modern industrial strategy that makes strategic public investments
    in our workforce, strategic sectors, and supply chains, especially
    in critical and emerging technologies.
-   A powerful U.S. military helps advance and safeguard vital U.S.
    national interests by backstopping diplomacy, confronting
    aggression, deterring conflict, projecting strength, and protecting
    the American people and their economic interests. We are modernizing
    our military, pursuing advanced technologies, and investing in our
    defense workforce to best position America to defend our homeland,
    our allies, partners, and interests overseas, and our values across
    the globe.

**<u>OUR ENDURING LEADERSHIP</u>**  
The United States will continue to lead with strength and purpose,
leveraging our national advantages and the power of our alliances and
partnerships. We have a tradition of transforming both domestic and
foreign challenges into opportunities to spur reform and rejuvenation at
home. The idea that we should compete with major autocratic powers to
shape the international order enjoys broad support that is bipartisan at
home and deepening abroad.

-   Our alliances and partnerships around the world are our most
    important strategic asset that we will deepen and modernize for the
    benefit of our national security.
-   We place a premium on growing the connective tissue on technology,
    trade and security between our democratic allies and partners in the
    Indo-Pacific and Europe because we recognize that they are mutually
    reinforcing and the fates of the two regions are intertwined.
-   We are charting new economic arrangements to deepen economic
    engagements with our partners and shaping the rules of the road to
    level the playing field and enable American workers and
    businesses—and those of partners and allies around the world—to
    thrive.
-   As we deepen our partnerships around the world, we will look for
    more democracy, not less, to shape the future. We recognize that
    while autocracy is at its core brittle, democracy’s inherent
    capacity to transparently course-correct enables resilience and
    progress.

**<u>AFFIRMATIVE ENGAGEMENT</u>**  
The United States is a global power with global interests; we are
stronger in each region because of our engagement in the others. We are
pursuing an affirmative agenda to advance peace and security and to
promote prosperity in every region.

-   As an Indo-Pacific power, the United States has a vital interest in
    realizing a region that is open, interconnected, prosperous, secure,
    and resilient. We are ambitious because we know that we and our
    allies and partners hold a common vision for the region’s future.
-   With a relationship rooted in shared democratic values, common
    interests, and historic ties, the transatlantic relationship is a
    vital platform on which many other elements of our foreign policy
    are built. To effectively pursue a common global agenda, we are
    broadening and deepening the transatlantic bond.
-   The Western Hemisphere directly impacts the United States more than
    any other region so we will continue to revive and deepen those
    partnerships to advance economic resilience, democratic stability,
    and citizen security.
-   A more integrated Middle East that empowers our allies and partners
    will advance regional peace and prosperity, while reducing the
    resource demands the region makes on the United States over the long
    term.
-   In Africa, the dynamism, innovation, and demographic growth of the
    region render it central to addressing complex global problems.
