  s\_Cybersecurity"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration has brought a relentless focus to
improving the United States’ cyber defenses, building a comprehensive
approach to “lock our digital doors” and take aggressive action to
strengthen and safeguard our nation’s cybersecurity, including:

-   **Improving the cybersecurity of our critical infrastructure. **
    Much of our Nation’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated
    by the private sector.  The Administration has worked closely with
    key sectors – including transportation, banking, water, and
    healthcare – to help stakeholders understand cyber threats to
    critical systems and adopt minimum cybersecurity standards.  This
    includes the introduction of multiple performance-based directives
    by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to increase
    cybersecurity resilience for the pipeline and rail sectors, as well
    as a measure on cyber requirements for the aviation sector. Through
    the President’s National Security Memorandum 8 on Improving
    Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems, we are
    issuing cybersecurity performance goals that will provide a baseline
    to drive investment toward the most important security outcomes.  We
    will continue to work with critical infrastructure owners and
    operators, sector by sector, to accelerate rapid cybersecurity and
    resilience improvements and proactive measures.  
-   **Ensuring new infrastructure is smart and secure.**  President
    Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is an investment to modernize
    and strengthen our Nation’s infrastructure.  The Administration is
    ensuring that these projects, such as expanding the Nation’s network
    of electric-vehicle charging stations, are built to endure, meeting
    modern standards of safety and security, which includes cyber
    protections.  Investments in digital security through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law (BIL) will also bring high-speed internet to
    underserved parts of the country, bridging the digital divide as
    well. Also the BIL, the Administration launched a first-of-its-kind
    cybersecurity grant program specifically for state, local, and
    territorial (SLT) governments across the country. The State and
    Local Cybersecurity Grant Program will provide $1 billion in funding
    to SLT partners over four years, with $185 million available for
    fiscal year 2022, to support SLT efforts to address cyber risk to
    their information systems and critical infrastructure.  
-   **Strengthening the Federal Government’s cybersecurity requirements,
    and raising the bar through the purchasing power of government. **
    Through the President’s Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s
    Cybersecurity, issued in May 2021, President Biden raised the bar
    for all Federal Government systems by requiring impactful
    cybersecurity steps, such as multifactor authentication.  The
    Administration also issued a strategy for Federal zero trust
    architecture implementation, as well as budget guidance to ensure
    that Federal agencies align resources to our cybersecurity goals. We
    are also harnessing the purchasing power of the Federal Government
    to improve the cybersecurity of products for the first time, by
    requiring security features in all software purchased by the Federal
    Government, which improves security for all Americans.  
-   **Countering ransomware attacks to protect Americans online. ** In
    2021, the Administration established the International
    Counter-Ransomware Initiative (CRI), bringing together partners from
    around the globe to address the scourge of ransomware.  The White
    House will host international partners October 31-November 1 to
    accelerate and broaden this joint work.  This group has raised
    collective resilience, engaged the private sector, and disrupted
    criminal actors and their infrastructure.  The United States has
    made it harder for criminals to move illicit money, sanction a
    series of cryptocurrency mixers used regularly by ransomware actors
    to collect and “clean” their illicit earnings.  A number of cyber
    criminals have also been successfully extradited to the United
    States to face justice for these crimes.  
-   **Working with allies and partners to deliver a more secure
    cyberspace. ** In addition to launching the International Counter
    Ransomware Initiative, the Administration has established cyber
    dialogues with a breadth of allies and partners to build collective
    cybersecurity, formulate coordinated response, and develop cyber
    deterrence.  We are taking this work to our most vital alliances –
    for example, establishing a new virtual rapid response mechanism at
    NATO to ensure Allies can effectively and efficiently offer each
    other support in response to cyber incidents.  
-   **Imposing costs on and strengthening our security against malicious
    actors.** The Biden-Harris Administration has not hesitated to
    respond forcefully to malicious cyber actors when their actions
    threaten American or our partner’s interests.  In April of 2021, we
    sanctioned Russian cyber actors affiliated with the Russian
    intelligence services in response to the SolarWinds attack.  We
    worked with allies and partners to attribute a destructive hack of
    the Viasat system at the beginning of Russia’s war in Ukraine.   
-   **Implementing internationally accepted cyber norms. ** The
    Administration is committed to ensuring internationally negotiated
    norms are implemented to establish cyber “rules of the road.” More
    recently, we worked with international partners to call out Iran’s
    counter-normative attack on Albanian government systems and impose
    costs on Tehran for this act.  
-   **Developing a new label to help Americans know their devices are
    secure.** This month, we will bring together companies, associations
    and government partners to discuss the development of a label for
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices so that Americans can easily
    recognize which devices meet the highest cybersecurity standards to
    protect against hacking and other cyber vulnerabilities.  By
    developing and rolling out a common label for products that meet by
    U.S. Government standards and are tested by vetted and approved
    entities, we will help American consumers easily identify secure
    tech to bring into their homes.  We are starting with some of the
    most common, and often most at-risk, technologies — routers and home
    cameras — to deliver the most impact, most quickly.  
-   **Building the Nation’s cyber workforce and strengthening cyber
    education. ** The White House hosted a [National Cyber Workforce and
    Education
    Summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/21/fact-sheet-national-cyber-workforce-and-education-summit/),
    bringing together leaders from government and from across the cyber
    community. At the Summit, the Administration announced a [120-Day
    Cybersecurity Apprenticeship
    Sprint](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osec/osec20220719) to
    help provide skills-based pathways into cyber jobs. With momentum
    from the Summit, the Administration
    [continues](https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2022/10/03/office-of-the-national-cyber-director-requests-your-insight-and-expertise-on-cyber-workforce-training-and-education/)
    to work with partners throughout society on building our Nation’s
    cyber workforce, improving skills-based pathways to good-paying
    cyber jobs, educating Americans so that they have the skills to
    thrive in our increasingly digital society, and improving diversity,
    equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the cyber field.  
-   **Protecting the future – from online commerce to national secrets
    —** **by developing quantum-resistant encryption. ** We all rely on
    encryption to help protect our data from compromise or theft by
    malicious actors.  Advancements in quantum computing threaten that
    encryption, so this summer the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) announced four new encryption algorithms that will
    become part of NIST’s post-quantum cryptographic standard, expected
    to be finalized in about two years.  These algorithms are the first
    group of encryption tools that are designed to withstand the assault
    of a future quantum computer, which could potentially crack the
    security used to protect privacy in the digital systems we rely on
    every day, such as online banking and email software.  
-   **Developing our technological edge through the National Quantum
    Initiative and issuance of National Security Memorandum-10 (NSM-10)
    on Promoting United States Leadership in Quantum Computing While
    Mitigating Risks to Vulnerable Cryptographic Systems. ** This
    initiative has more than doubled the United States Government’s
    research and development (R&D) investment in quantum technology,
    creating new research centers and workforce development programs
    across the country. NSM-10 prioritizes U.S. leadership in quantum
    technologies by advancing R&D efforts, forging critical
    partnerships, expanding the workforce, and investing in critical
    infrastructure; will move the Nation to quantum-resistant
    cryptography; and protects our investments, companies, and
    intellectual property as this technology develops so that the United
    States and our allies can benefit from this new field’s advances
    without being harmed by those who would use it against us.
