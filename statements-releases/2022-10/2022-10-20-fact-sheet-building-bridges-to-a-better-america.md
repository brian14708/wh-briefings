* President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Is Repairing Thousands
of Bridges Across the Country*

Today, President Biden is traveling to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to visit
the Fern Hollow Bridge, which collapsed on the day the President was
visiting Pittsburgh eight months ago. In less than a year, the State of
Pennsylvania and City of Pittsburgh have made significant progress in
rebuilding the bridge – made possible by President Biden’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. Thanks to strong federal, state, and local
government partnership, the Fern Hollow bridge is on an accelerated
track to be rebuilt in a single year, compared to a 2- to 5- year
timeline common for a similar bridge project.

The Fern Hollow bridge is one of the nearly 45,000 bridges in poor
condition across the United States that need to be repaired or replaced.
For decades, American presidents have promised to rebuild our crumbling
infrastructure but did not deliver. President Biden brought together
Democrats, Independents, and Republicans to pass the most transformative
investment in infrastructure since passage of the Eisenhower-era
Interstate Highway Act of 1956. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
includes a historic $40 billion investment to repair or replace bridges
across the country. **In less than a year, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
funds are being put to work to begin to repair, rehabilitate and replace
over 2,400 bridge projects across the United States,** [**exceeding
President Biden’s goal for the first
year**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-actions-to-address-the-needs-of-people-with-disabilities-and-older-adults-in-response-to-and-recovery-from-covid-19-2/)**.**
Like the Fern Hollow Bridge, these bridges can be life lines for
communities, connecting families to their loved ones, students to
school, workers to their jobs, and providing critical access and
evacuation routes in case of an emergency. That is why the Biden-Harris
Administration has hit the ground running to rebuild bridges across the
country.

In January, the Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the new
Bridge Formula Program, which provides funding for states, tribes, and
territories to repair bridges over five years, including $5.5 billion in
2022. Over the past year, states, tribes, and territories have used this
funding to begin to repair, rehabilitate, or replace 2,400 bridge
projects across the country. This includes some critical bridges for
communities such as:

-   **The I-270 Bridge over the Mississippi River** which connects St.
    Louis, Missouri and Madison, County Illinois. This bridge was built
    in 1966 and carries over 50,000 vehicles per day and is an important
    route for trucks transporting goods across the Midwest.
-   **The Dare Country Bridge in North Carolina** which connects Roanoke
    Island to the mainland of North Carolina and is one of the longest
    bridges in the state.
-   **The I-65 Bridge over the Sepulga River in Alabama** which was
    built in 1960 and is an important transportation route for this
    rural community.

Last week, DOT announced another $5.53 billion in funding in fiscal year
2023 funding through the Bridge Formula Program for states, Tribes, and
territories to continue the important work of rebuilding our nations
bridges.

In September, DOT announced $1.6 billion in awards to improve
transportation systems and strengthen our supply chains through the
INFRA program, funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. As part of
this announcement, DOT awarded funds to several important bridges in
need of repair, including funds to:

-   Replace the existing **I-39/90/94 Wisconsin River Bridge** with two
    new bridge spans. The project will help to support a critical route
    for economic hubs in Madison, Milwaukee, and Chicago and keep an
    important link in the supply chain operational.
-   Rehabilitate the 100-year-old **Rockport Railroad Bridge** in
    Kentucky that serves as a vital link for the transportation of
    commodities such as grain, lumber, steel, coal, and petroleum along
    the railway.
-   Rehabilitate the **Newport Pell Bridge**, a 4-lane suspension bridge
    that carries Route 138 over the Narragansett Bay and connects
    mainland Rhode Island to Newport.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also provides $12.5 billion for a new
Bridge Investment Program to help repair some of the nation’s most
economically significant bridges. In June, DOT opened applications for
the first round of funding available for this program in 2022. Last
week, DOT announced funding to support planning for 23 bridge projects
to create a pipeline of construction-ready projects. Some notable bridge
planning projects include:

-   **The I-5 Columbia River Bridge** which connects Vancouver,
    Washington and Portland, Oregon. Replacing this bridge has been an
    ongoing issue in the region for decades, and this project would
    greatly reduce congestion and improve freight movement in one of the
    West Coast’s most significant economic corridor.
-   **The Iowa River Bridge Improvement Project** to replace two
    existing bridges on Burlington Street and State Highway 1 with a
    single structure.
-   **The Kodiak Sargent Creek and Russian River Bridges** in Kodiak
    Island, Alaska to replace two bridges in this rural area.
-   **The Flathead County Bridge Improvement Project** in Montana to
    help preserve four important bridges in the county: The Dry Creek
    Bridge, the Swift Creek Bridge, the Baker Avenue Bridge, and the
    Whitefish Stage Bridge.
-   **East River Bridges Capital Program** in New York City to support
    the planning of a 30-year capital construction program to repair the
    Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, and
    the Ed Koch Queensboro bridge.

DOT plans to announce the awards for large bridge projects through the
Bridge Investment Program later this year.
