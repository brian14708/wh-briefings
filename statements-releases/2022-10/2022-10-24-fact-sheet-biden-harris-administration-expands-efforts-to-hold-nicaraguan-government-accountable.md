title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Expands Efforts to Hold Nicaraguan\
  \ Government\_Accountable"
---
 
Today, President Biden is taking further action to demonstrate our
commitment to the Nicaraguan people by expanding the tools to hold the
Ortega-Murillo regime accountable for its escalating human rights
violations, continued dismantling of democratic institutions, attacks on
civil society, and increasing security cooperation with Russia.   
  
President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) that amends E.O. 13851
(Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in
Nicaragua) to expand the authorities available to increase targeted
pressure on the Ortega-Murillo regime. This will give the Administration
additional means to target the regime while allowing the flexibility
necessary to continue to support the people of Nicaragua.  
  
In the lead up to Nicaragua’s November 2021 sham elections, the
Ortega-Murillo regime arbitrarily detained dozens of political opponents
and pro-democracy activists. Since then, the limited remaining
democratic space in the country has shrunk even further as the
Ortega-Murillo regime shuttered over 2,000 non-governmental
organizations and subjected political prisoners to extremely harsh
conditions. And, the Nicaraguan regime has increased its attacks on
faith leaders and closed private universities, robbing Nicaragua’s youth
of their future and politicizing education.   
  
While the United States and our allies continue to take steps to hold
Russia accountable for its war of aggression in Ukraine, the
Ortega-Murillo regime has increased its cooperation with Moscow by
authorizing the continued presence of Russian military personnel and
equipment in the country. The regime was one of only four countries —
and the only country in Latin America — to
[vote](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/10/1129492) with Russia against
an October 2022 United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning
its attempted illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is today taking the following actions:

-   Today’s amended E.O. substantially expands our Nicaragua sanctions
    program with sectoral sanctions authorities, which expose
    individuals and entities operating in identified sectors to
    sanctions. Specifically, the amended E.O. identifies the gold sector
    of the Nicaraguan economy, which the Ortega-Murillo regime uses to
    fund its authoritarian and destabilizing activities. The E.O. also
    allows for the future identification of additional sectors that
    could become subject to sanctions, if warranted.  
-   The amended E.O. adds new authorities to allow for the imposition of
    future restrictions on certain trade with Nicaragua to limit the
    outsized financial benefits of certain trade from flowing to the
    Ortega-Murillo regime, as warranted. This could potentially include
    restrictions on both imports into the United States from Nicaragua
    and exports from the United States to Nicaragua.   
-   The amended E.O. also authorizes certain restrictions on new
    investment in sectors of the Nicaraguan economy to prevent the
    United States from contributing to the corrupt regime’s
    coffers.     
-   Concurrent with this action, the Department of the Treasury is
    designating a key Nicaraguan entity that is central to the mining
    sector that directly benefits the Ortega-Murillo regime, as well as
    an individual linked to major human rights abuses in the country.  
-   To continue supporting the Nicaraguan people and hold those who
    support the corrupt Nicaraguan Government accountable, the State
    Department is imposing visa restrictions on more than 500 Nicaraguan
    individuals, and their family members, who work for the Nicaraguan
    Government or formulate, implement, or benefit from policies or
    actions that undermine or injure democratic institutions or impede
    the return to democracy in the country.

Today’s actions build on recent efforts by the Biden-Harris
Administration to support the Nicaraguan people and hold the
Ortega-Murillo regime accountable. This includes the [designation of
Nicaragua’s state mining company,

2022, and the [reallocation of the country’s sugar quota by the Office

in July 2022.
