SUBJECT:       Partial Revocation of Presidential Policy Directive 28

The Executive Order of October 7, 2022 (Enhancing Safeguards for United
States Signals Intelligence Activities), establishes enhanced safeguards
for United States signals intelligence activities that supersede the
safeguards for personal information collected through signals
intelligence established by Presidential Policy Directive 28 of January
17, 2014 (Signals Intelligence Activities) (PPD-28).  The Executive
Order establishes enhanced safeguards in recognition that signals
intelligence activities must be conducted in a manner that takes into
account that all persons should be treated with dignity and respect,
regardless of their nationality or wherever they might reside, and that
all persons have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their
personal information.  In addition, signals intelligence activities
present the potential for national security damage if improperly
disclosed.  Therefore, it is essential to maintain the policy process
refined by section 3 of PPD-28 and supplemented by the classified annex
to PPD-28, under which national security policymakers consider carefully
the value of signals intelligence activities to our national interests
and the risks entailed in conducting those activities.

Section 1.  Revocation.  PPD-28 is hereby revoked except for sections 3
and 6 of that directive and the classified annex to that directive,
which remain in effect.   
  
Section 2.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall
be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head thereof; or  
  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
  
(b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
  
(c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
