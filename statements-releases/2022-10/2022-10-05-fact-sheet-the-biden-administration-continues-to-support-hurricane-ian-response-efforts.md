title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration Continues to Support Hurricane Ian Response\_\
  Efforts"
---
 
In the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, President Biden has directed his
Administration to prioritize lifesaving actions, ensure delivery of
essential services, and offer support to survivors across multiple
states.

Today, President Biden is traveling to Fort Myers, Florida, where he and
First Lady will meet with local residents and small business owners
impacted by Hurricane Ian. They will survey the damage, receive an
operational briefing on ongoing recovery efforts, and thank federal,
state, and local officials working around the clock to provide
life-saving assistance and supporting recovery. Since before Hurricane
Ian made landfall, President Biden has been in regular touch with the
FEMA Administrator, the Governor of Florida, and local officials in
Florida to ensure needs are being met on the ground.

Actions the President has taken to date to ensure everything possible is
done to help communities impacted by Hurricane Ian include:  
  
**Issuing Federal Disaster Assistance:**

-   President Biden issued an Expedited Major Disaster Declaration for
    the state of Florida, providing Individual Assistance and Debris
    Removal for 17 counties, and 100% direct Federal assistance for
    costs associated with search and rescue, sheltering, feeding, and
    other emergency measures to save lives for 30 days.
    -   **<u>Today, the President will announce that he will double the
        amount of time the Federal government picks up those costs – to
        60 days.</u>**
    -   To date, FEMA has already registered hundreds of thousands of
        households and pushed tens of millions of dollars out the door
        for Individual Assistance to provide impacted families with
        money to replace essential items, support temporary rentals, and
        begin home repairs.
-   President Biden issued a pre-landfall Emergency Declaration for
    Florida to ensure lifesaving resources and Federal responders were
    pre-positioned in advance of potential storm impacts on September
    24.
-   President Biden issued a pre-landfall Emergency Declaration for
    South Carolina on September 29. 
-   President Biden issued an Expedited Major Disaster Declaration for
    the Seminole Tribe of Florida on October 1.
-   President Biden issued an Emergency Declaration for North Carolina
    on October 1.

**Supporting Life-Saving Response Work:**

-   FEMA and the State of Florida opened the first Disaster Recovery
    Center in Fort Myers at the Lakes Regional Library to provide
    services from more than 10 Federal and state agencies and
    non-governmental organizations. These centers enable survivors to
    access and register for disaster assistance, as well as
    opportunities to meet with insurance providers and replace lost
    documents. 
-   Currently, there are more than 4,000 Federal response personnel
    working in Florida and the Southeast.
-   The President directed the deployment of an unprecedented number of
    Search and Rescue teams. This group, led by FEMA, began conducting
    search and rescue operations at first daylight on September 29.
    Teams came from across the Federal government and included skilled
    rescuers from FEMA Urban Search and Rescue task forces, the U.S.
    Coast Guard, the Department of Defense, Customs and Border
    Protection, the Department of the Interior, and state and local
    responders. Together, they have rescued more than 3,800 people and
    200 pets.
-   FEMA has over 4 million meals and 10 million bottles of water
    available for distribution in Florida.
-   The Department of Health and Human Services promptly declared a
    Public Health Emergency and deployed medical assistance teams to the
    region to support emerging health and medical needs.   
-   The Department of Agriculture approved a waiver to allow purchase of
    hot foods with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
    benefits and will issue funds for food replacement to impacted
    households.
-   At the President’s direction, FEMA activated a medical support
    contract for ambulances and paratransit seats, including 400
    ambulances, 15 bariatric paratransit ambulances, and four rotary
    aircraft to evacuate medically vulnerable individuals in nursing
    homes and other medical facilities as needed.

**Supporting Key Recovery Efforts:**

-   Power has been restored to 2.5 million customers in Florida since
    peak outages. Nearly 44,000 utility workers from 33 states and the
    District of Columbia are supporting restoration efforts. 
-   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing eligible homeowners
    with temporary roof repairs through the Operation Blue Roof program,
    which began on Oct. 3. Through this program, the Army Corps provides
    a temporary blue covering with fiber-reinforced sheeting to help
    reduce further damage to property until permanent repairs can be
    made.
-   At the President’s direction, the Army Corps of Engineers has
    deployed over 550 personnel to conduct engineering assessments for
    water infrastructure and emergency power needs, and to support
    debris removal. They are installing generators to support critical
    infrastructure, focusing on hospitals and long-term care facilities,
    water treatment and wastewater plants, and public safety
    organizations such as 911 call centers.
-   Through the work of the U.S. Coast Guard and the Tampa Bay maritime
    community, the Port of Tampa Bay was reopened on September 30.  This
    significant milestone helps support Hurricane Ian recovery efforts
    across the state of Florida. The Port of Tampa Bay provides nearly
    half of Florida with its fuel supply and supports tens of thousands
    of jobs.
-   Looking ahead to the urgent needs of hurricane survivors, the
    President has asked FEMA to focus on the housing needs of survivors
    as well as other immediate challenges they will face in recovering
    from Ian.  FEMA Administrator Criswell established an interagency
    Recovery Leadership Team to proactively address the recovery needs
    of individual survivors and expedite assistance to those in
    desperate need of help.

**Investing in Long-term Resilience:**

-   A total of $5.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has
    been approved for Florida, with over 100 specific projects already
    identified including, funding for repairs to roads and bridges
    repair, public transportation enhancements, and lead pipe
    replacement.
