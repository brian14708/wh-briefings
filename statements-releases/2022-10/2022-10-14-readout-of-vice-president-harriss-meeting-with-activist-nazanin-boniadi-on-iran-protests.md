  \ on Iran Protests"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris met today with actress and activist Nazanin
Boniadi to express her support for the brave women and girls leading
peaceful protests in Iran to secure equal rights and basic human
dignity. The Vice President emphasized how the courage of these women
protestors has inspired her as it has inspired the world. The Vice
President commended those in Iran and in the Iranian diaspora who are
giving a voice to the aspirations of a new generation seeking
fundamental rights that Iran’s regime has for decades attempted to deny
and suppress through repression and violence.  The Vice President
underscored that the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to stand
with these Iranian women and citizens.  They discussed how the United
States will make sure these important voices are heard, including by
making it easier for Iranians to access the Internet, and that Iranian
officials are held accountable for their brutality and abuses.
