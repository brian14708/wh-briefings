title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on New Mental Health\_Funding"
---
 
Today’s announcement of funding to expand Certified Community Behavioral
Health Clinics is a critical step in helping to expand the availability
of evidence-based community mental health services. These clinics are
proven to improve health outcomes while lowering costs, by
delivering 24/7 mental health and substance use care to millions of
Americans, no matter who they are or whether they have ability to
pay. Through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the American Rescue
Plan, and funding in this year’s budget, my Administration is working to
expand this program to communities that need them most.

Mental health affects all of us, which is why I named tackling the
mental health crisis a core pillar of my Unity Agenda. As I outlined in
my State of the Union address last March, we can and must do more to
transform how we address mental health in America. 

In June, I was proud to sign the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which
included unprecedented resources to help address mental health needs
across our nation, particularly for young people that have been exposed
to violence. Over the past few weeks, my Administration has announced
the availability of funding that will help grow the pipeline of
school-based mental health professionals, expand trauma-informed
services in schools, and connect youth in need to mental health experts
via telehealth. 

In the coming weeks, my Administration will be announcing additional
resources to support our heroic mental health workers and help
communities strengthen mental health. My Administration remains
committed to ensuring that everyone has access to services and support
when and where they need them.
