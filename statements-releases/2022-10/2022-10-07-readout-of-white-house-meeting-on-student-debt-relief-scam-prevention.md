title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting on Student Debt Relief Scam\_Prevention"
---
 
This afternoon, the White House convened top Administration officials to
discuss the Biden-Harris Administration’s [ongoing
efforts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/05/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-boosts-administration-wide-efforts-to-protect-student-loan-borrowers-from-scammers/)
to protect borrowers from student debt relief scams.  During this
meeting, the participants shared information on current and future
efforts to combat student loan scams, and discussed how the
Administration can strengthen its collective efforts going forward.  
  
During the meeting, Cabinet agencies and the White House committed to
amplifying the Department of Education’s (ED) recently-released “[Do’s
and
Don’ts](https://blog.ed.gov/2022/10/student-loan-debt-relief-dos-and-donts/)”
across communication channels to help borrowers protect themselves
against scammers and make sure borrowers know to report scams to
[ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/). Secretary of
Education Miguel Cardona also discussed new actions ED will be taking
this month to provide complaint reports regularly to states to
facilitate quick enforcement actions, such as cease and desist letters
from state attorneys general. Chair of the Federal Communications
Commission Jessica Rosenworcel shared the FCC’s plans to identify
originators of student loan scam calls to order phone companies to block
those calls. Earlier this summer, FCC issued a similar order to block
auto warranty scam calls, reducing the level of these calls by 80%,
according to
an [analysis](https://blog.youmail.com/2022/07/july-enforcement-achieve-success-in-escalating-the-war-on-robocalls/)
by YouMail, a robocall blocking and analysis company.     
  
In addition to the commitments from ED and FCC, leaders from the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission
discussed their ongoing and expanded work to hold scammers who take
advantage of borrowers accountable. This work includes sharing
information in real time with thousands of federal, state, and local law
enforcement entities and obtaining multimillion dollar judgments against
scammers over the last 18 months.  
  
Earlier this week, the White House announced a [series of
