For months, doomsayers have been arguing that the US economy is in a
recession and Congressional Republicans have been rooting for a
downturn. But today we got further evidence that our economic recovery
is continuing to power forward. This is a testament to the resilience of
the American people. As I have said before, it is never a good bet to
bet against the American people. Our economy has created 10 million
jobs, unemployment is at a 50 year low, and U.S. manufacturing is
booming. Today’s data shows that in the third quarter, Americans’
incomes were up and price increases in the economy came down.     
  
Now, we need to make more progress on our top economic
challenge: bringing down high prices for American families. Even with
our historic economic recovery, gas prices are falling – down $1.26
since the summer, and down over the last three weeks. The most common
price at gas stations in America today is $3.39 a gallon. That is
progress, but we need to do more to bring other prices down as well. My
Administration has passed laws that will bring down prescription drug
prices and health insurance premiums starting next year.  We must do
more.  
  
Congressional Republicans have a very different agenda – one that would
drive up inflation and add to the deficit by cutting taxes for the
wealthiest Americans and large corporations. It would raise the cost of
prescription drugs, health care, and energy for American families. That
failed economic vision is not the way to give families more breathing
room and grow our economy so working families can get ahead
