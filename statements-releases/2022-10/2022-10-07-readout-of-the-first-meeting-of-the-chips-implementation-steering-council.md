title: "Readout of the First Meeting of the CHIPS Implementation Steering\_Council"
---
 
Yesterday, the CHIPS Implementation Steering Council met for the first
time to discuss the implementation plan for the CHIPS and Science Act.
The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act was signed into law on August 9,
2022.  The Act makes historic investments to strengthen the American
semiconductor industry through manufacturing, research and development,
and workforce investments. The August 25, 2022 Executive Order on the
Implementation of the CHIPS Act of 2022 established the Steering Council
to coordinate and develop the policies needed to effectively implement
the Act within the executive branch. 

In the Steering Committee’s inaugural meeting, participants discussed
how implementation of the Act will strengthen American leadership in the
semiconductor industry, boost our economic competitiveness, and protect
our national security. NEC Director Brian Deese (Council Co-Chair)
emphasized the need for coordination across agencies on research and
development, workforce investments, and protecting taxpayer dollars. NSC
Director Jake Sullivan (Co-Chair) addressed the geopolitical competition
in semiconductors and the importance of chips to American national
security. OSTP Director Arati Prabhakar (Council Co-Chair) highlighted
the need to articulate strategic capability and capacity objectives to
guide implementation, while also sustaining our commitment to research
and development to ensure that America remains at the forefront of
building the technologies of the future. The White House Coordinator for
CHIPS Implementation Ronnie Chatterji provided an overview of the
implementation process and how the whole-of-government approach will be
coordinated.

Council members also received briefings from the Department of Commerce,
the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the Director of
the National Science Foundation on the status of their implementation
efforts. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo presented on the Department
of Commerce’s roadmap and priorities for administering the manufacturing
incentives program and R&D funding provided under the Act. Deputy
Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks laid out the Department of Defense’s
plan for ensuring accessibility to semiconductor chips that are integral
to American defense systems and leveraging CHIPS R&D funding to maintain
a competitive edge. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman explained
how the State Department will work to build secure and reliable
semiconductor supply chains through diplomatic engagement with allied
and partner countries. The Director of the National Science Foundation
Sethuraman Panchanathan addressed how the country will invest in its
semiconductor workforce. The Council also discussed the guardrails in
place to ensure that manufacturing incentives funds are used in ways
that protect US taxpayer dollars, benefit local communities, and
safeguard national security.
