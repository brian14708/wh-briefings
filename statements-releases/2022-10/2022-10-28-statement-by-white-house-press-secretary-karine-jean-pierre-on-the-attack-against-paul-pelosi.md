The President is praying for Paul Pelosi and for Speaker Pelosi’s whole
family. This morning he called Speaker Pelosi to express his support
after this horrible attack. He is also very glad that a full recovery is
expected. The President continues to condemn all violence, and asks that
the family’s desire for privacy be respected.
