title: "G7 Statement on Ukraine, 11 October\_2022"
---
 
1\. We, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), convened today with
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Our meeting took place against
the backdrop of the most recent missile attacks against civilian
infrastructure and cities across Ukraine, leading to the death of
innocent civilians. We condemn these attacks in the strongest possible
terms and recall that indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian
populations constitute a war crime. We will hold President Putin and
those responsible to account.  
   
2. The G7 firmly condemn and unequivocally reject the illegal attempted
annexation by Russia of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and
Kherson regions in addition to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the
City of Sevastopol. We solemnly reiterate that we will never recognise
this illegal annexation or the sham referenda that Russia uses to
justify it.  
   
3. Russia has blatantly violated the principles enshrined in the UN
Charter. They cannot and do not give Russia a legitimate basis to change
Ukraine’s borders. We call upon all countries to unequivocally reject
these violations of international law and demand that Russia cease all
hostilities and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all
of its troops and military equipment from Ukraine.  
   
4. We have imposed and will continue to impose further economic costs on
Russia, including on individuals and entities – inside and outside of
Russia – providing political or economic support for Russia’s illegal
attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory.  
   
5. We deplore deliberate Russian escalatory steps, including the partial
mobilisation of reservists and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, which is
putting global peace and security at risk. We reaffirm that any use of
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with
severe consequences.  
   
6. We condemn Russia’s actions at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power
Plant and the pressure exerted on the personnel of the facility. This is
a further irresponsible escalation and we will hold Russia responsible
for any incident caused by their actions. The safety, security and
safeguards of the nuclear facility are paramount and we support the
International Atomic Energy Agency’s efforts in this regard.  
   
7. We reiterate our call on the Belarusian authorities to stop enabling
the Russian war of aggression by permitting Russian armed forces to use
Belarusian territory and by providing support to the Russian military.
The announcement of a joint military group with Russia constitutes the
most recent example of the Belarusian regime’s complicity with Russia.
We renew our call on the Lukashenko regime to fully abide by its
obligations under international law.  
   
8. We reaffirm our full support to Ukraine’s independence, territorial
integrity and sovereignty in its internationally recognised borders. In
line with international law, in particular the UN Charter, Ukraine has
the legitimate right to defend itself against Russian aggression and to
regain full control of its territory within its internationally
recognised borders.  
   
9. We reassured President Zelenskyy that we are undeterred and steadfast
in our commitment to providing the support Ukraine needs to uphold its
sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will continue to provide
financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support and will
stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We are committed to
supporting Ukraine in meeting its winter preparedness needs.  
   
10. With a view to a viable post-war peace settlement, we remain ready
to reach arrangements together with interested countries and
institutions and Ukraine on sustained security and other commitments to
help Ukraine defend itself, secure its free and democratic future, and
deter future Russian aggression. We will continue to coordinate efforts
to meet Ukraine’s urgent requirements for military and defense
equipment. We look forward to the outcomes of the International Expert
Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine
on October 25.  
   
11. No country wants peace more than Ukraine, whose people have suffered
death, displacement and countless atrocities as the result of Russian
aggression. In solidarity with Ukraine, the G7 Leaders welcome President
Zelenskyy’s readiness for a just peace. This should include the
following elements: respecting the UN Charter’s protection of
territorial integrity and sovereignty; safeguarding Ukraine’s ability to
defend itself in the future; ensuring Ukraine’s recovery and
reconstruction, including exploring avenues to do so with funds from
Russia; pursuing accountability for Russian crimes committed during the
war.  
   
12. We are deeply troubled by the deliberate damage to the Nordstream
pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea and strongly condemn
any deliberate disruption of critical infrastructure. We welcome ongoing
investigations.  
   
13. We will act in solidarity and close coordination to address the
negative impact of Russia’s aggression for global economic stability,
including by continuing to cooperate to ensure energy security and
affordability across the G7 and beyond.
