The Arctic—home to more than four million people, extensive natural
resources, and unique ecosystems—is undergoing a dramatic
transformation.  Driven by climate change, this transformation will
challenge livelihoods in the Arctic while at the same time creating new
economic opportunities. The United States is an Arctic nation, which
instills responsibility for the stewardship and protection of this
region, especially during this period of change.  
  
The United States seeks an Arctic region that is peaceful, stable,
prosperous, and cooperative. The new National Strategy for the Arctic
Region articulates an affirmative U.S. agenda over the next ten years to
realize this vision. This strategy, an update of its 2013 predecessor,
addresses the climate crisis with greater urgency and directs new
investments in sustainable development to improve livelihoods for Arctic
residents, while conserving the environment. It also accounts for
increasing strategic competition in the Arctic, exacerbated by Russia’s
unprovoked war in Ukraine and the People’s Republic of China’s increased
efforts to garner influence in the region, and seeks to position the
United States to both effectively compete and manage tensions.  
  
This strategy recognizes that there is no bright line between foreign
and domestic policy. Realizing our vision during this dynamic period
will require U.S. leadership at home and abroad. We will advance U.S.
interests in the Arctic across four mutually reinforcing pillars
spanning both domestic and international issues.

-   **Pillar 1 – Security**: We will deter threats to the U.S. homeland
    and our allies by enhancing the capabilities required to defend our
    interests in the Arctic, while coordinating shared approaches to
    security with allies and partners and mitigating risks of unintended
    escalation. We will exercise U.S. government presence in the Arctic
    region as required to protect the American people and defend our
    sovereign territory.
-   **Pillar 2 – Climate Change and Environmental Protection**: The U.S.
    government will partner with Alaskan communities and the State of
    Alaska to build resilience to the impacts of climate change, while
    working to reduce emissions from the Arctic as part of broader
    global mitigation efforts, improve scientific understanding, and
    conserve Arctic ecosystems.
-   **Pillar 3 – Sustainable Economic Development**: We will pursue
    sustainable development and improve livelihoods in Alaska, including
    for Alaska Native communities, by investing in infrastructure,
    improving access to services, and supporting growing economic
    sectors. We will also work with allies and partners to expand
    high-standard investment and sustainable development across the
    Arctic region.
-   **Pillar 4 – International Cooperation and Governance**: Despite the
    challenges to Arctic cooperation resulting from Russia’s war in
    Ukraine, the United States will work to sustain institutions for
    Arctic cooperation, including the Arctic Council, and position these
    institutions to manage the impacts of increasing activity in the
    region. We also seek to uphold international law, rules, norms, and
    standards in the Arctic. 

This strategy is intended to serve as a framework to guide the U.S.
government’s approach to tackling emerging challenges and opportunities
in the Arctic. Our work will be guided by five principles that will be
applied across all four pillars.

-   **Consult, Coordinate, and Co-Manage with Alaska Native Tribes and
    Communities**: The United States is committed to regular,
    meaningful, and robust consultation, coordination, and co-management
    with Alaska Native Tribes, communities, corporations, and other
    organizations and to equitable inclusion of Indigenous Peoples and
    their knowledge.
-   **Deepen Relationships with Allies and Partners**: We will deepen
    our cooperation with Arctic Allies and partners: Canada, Kingdom of
    Denmark (including Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.
    We will also expand Arctic cooperation with other countries that
    uphold international law, rules, norms, and standards in the region.
-   **Plan for Long Lead-Time Investments**: Many of the investments
    prioritized in this strategy will require long lead times. We will
    be proactive, anticipating changes coming to the Arctic over the
    next several decades and making new investments now to be prepared.
-   **Cultivate Cross-Sectoral Coalitions and Innovative Ideas**: The
    challenges and opportunities in the Arctic cannot be solved by
    national governments alone. The United States will strengthen and
    build on coalitions of private sector; academia; civil society; and
    state, local, and Tribal actors to encourage and harness innovative
    ideas to tackle these challenges.
-   **Commit to a Whole of Government, Evidence-Based Approach**:  The
    Arctic region extends beyond the responsibility of any single region
    or government agency. U.S. federal departments and agencies will
    work together to realize this strategy. We will deploy
    evidence-based decision-making and carry out our work in close
    partnership with the State of Alaska; Alaska Native Tribes,
    communities, corporations, and other organizations; and local
    communities.
