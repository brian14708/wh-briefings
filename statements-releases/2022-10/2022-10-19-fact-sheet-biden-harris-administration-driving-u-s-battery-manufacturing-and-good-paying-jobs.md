*Department of Energy Awarding $2.8 Billion from Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to Boost Domestic Manufacturing*  
  
*Administration Launching “American Battery Materials Initiative” to
Strengthen Critical Mineral Supply Chains*

Today, President Biden is announcing that the Department of Energy is
awarding $2.8 billion in grants from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
to 20 manufacturing and processing companies for projects across 12
states. President Biden is also announcing the *American Battery
Materials Initiative*, a new effort to mobilize the entire government in
securing a reliable and sustainable supply of critical minerals used for
power, electricity, and electric vehicles (EVs). Together, these actions
will improve America’s energy independence, strengthen national
security, support good-paying jobs across battery supply chains, and
lower costs for working families.   
  
President Biden set an ambitious goal for electric vehicles (EV) to make
half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric. Thanks to his
leadership, economic and industrial strategy, and landmark legislative
accomplishments, the United States is seeing historic investment in
electric vehicle and battery manufacturing – which has resulted in EV
sales tripling since President Biden took office. This market
transformation is expected to increase demand for critical minerals such
as lithium and graphite used in EV batteries. Today’s announcements
demonstrate how the United States is poised to meet this challenge while
growing our economy and creating high-quality union jobs in the battery
supply chain.  
  
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS & Science Act, and Inflation
Reduction Act combined will invest more than $135 billion to build
America’s electric vehicle future, including critical minerals sourcing
and processing and battery manufacturing.  The Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law alone invests more than $7 billion to help domestic manufacturers
have the critical minerals and other necessary components to manufacture
the batteries we need to meet our climate goals.  The Inflation
Reduction Act makes new and used EVs more affordable for consumers with
tax credits that support using minerals and battery components from the
United States and our allies. And, it includes credits to help
manufacturers retool existing facilities and build new battery
manufacturing and critical mineral processing in the United States as
well as grants to deploy zero emission heavy-duty vehicles.  
  
President Biden’s economic agenda has already ignited a domestic
manufacturing boom, with companies announcing over $100 billion in EV,
battery and EV charging investments right here in the United States.  
  
Today’s actions and the launch of the *American Battery Material
Initiative* will also make America more competitive, ensuring we can
make more in America to support our own supply chains and workers. The
U.S. and its allies currently do not produce enough of the critical
minerals and battery materials needed to power clean energy
technologies. China currently controls much of the critical mineral
supply chain and the lack of mining, processing, and recycling capacity
in the U.S. could hinder electric vehicle development and adoption,
leaving the U.S. dependent on unreliable foreign supply chains. The
*American Battery Materials Initiative* will align and leverage federal
resources for growing the end-to-end battery supply chain; work with
stakeholders, allies, and partners to develop more sustainable, secure,
resilient supply chains; and support faster and fairer permitting for
projects that build the domestic supply chain.

**<u>BATTERY MANUFACTURING AWARDS</u>**  
  
Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is announcing the first set
of projects funded by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles and the
electrical grid including $2.8 billion for 20 manufacturing and
processing companies in 12 states, including Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Ohio, Tennessee, and Washington.  
  
When matched by recipients, the funding leverages a total of more than
$9 billion to boost American production of EV batteries. The projects
will have positive impact on their own and also catalyze a whole US
industry in the critical phases of the battery supply chain.  
  
The funding for the selected projects will support:

-   Developing enough battery-grade lithium to supply approximately 2
    million EVs annually.
-   Developing enough battery-grade graphite to supply approximately 1.2
    million EVs annually.
-   Producing enough battery-grade nickel to supply approximately
    400,000 EVs annually.
-   Installing the first large-scale, commercial lithium electrolyte
    salt (LiPF6) production facility in the United States.
-   Developing an electrode binder facility capable of supplying 45% of
    the anticipated domestic demand for binders for EV batteries in
    2030.
-   Creating the first commercial scale domestic silicon oxide
    production facilities to supply anode materials for an estimated
    600,000 EV batteries annually.
-   Installing the first lithium iron phosphate cathode facility in the
    United States.

All projects will develop enough lithium to supply over 2 million
electric vehicles annually and establish significant domestic production
of graphite and nickel.

**<u>AMERICAN BATTERY MATERIALS INITIATIVE</u>**  
  
President Biden is committed to advancing America’s energy security and
energy independence as he takes historic action to tackle the climate
crisis. Today, the White House is launching a new whole-of-government
effort to secure a reliable and sustainable supply of the critical
minerals that power everything from electric vehicles to homes to
defense systems. The *American Battery Materials Initiative* will be led
by a White House steering committee and coordinated by the Department of
Energy with support from the Department of the Interior.

The critical minerals and large capacity battery [supply chain

initiated by Executive Order 14017 recommended (1) taking a
mineral-by-mineral approach to both expand sustainable,
environmentally-responsible domestic mining, processing, and recycling
of critical minerals; (2) working with partners and allies to diversify
international supply chains, recognizing that America’s national and
economic security is bolstered through strong alliances, and
international coalitions of reliable partners reinforce the security of
our supply chains; and (3) developing a faster and fairer domestic
process that meets strong environmental and labor standards, ensures
meaningful community engagement and consultation with Tribal Nations,
and reduces time and cost of permitting.

The Initiative will work through the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment, and leverage ongoing work by the
Department of State, to work with partners and allies to strengthen
critical mineral supply chains globally, and it will leverage and
maximize ongoing efforts throughout the U.S. government to meet resource
requirements and bolster energy security.

To further accelerate efforts to secure the supply chain for the
critical minerals and materials needed for advanced batteries, this
Initiative will coordinate White House and agency attention to
 implement the President’s critical mineral strategy, align ongoing work
on critical mineral supply chains, coordinate community and industry
engagement, help guide research, grants, and loans supporting
environmentally responsible critical minerals extraction, processing,
and recycling, and aid diplomatic efforts to build reliable and
sustainable global supply chains. The Initiative will also strengthen
federal engagement, partnership, and consultation with the private
sector, state, Tribal, and local governments, environmental and
environmental justice leaders, and labor unions to more effectively
marshal resources, ensure the concerns of Tribes and local communities
are heard and addressed earlier in the planning process, and reflect our
nation’s commitment to high environmental, social, and labor
standards.  
  
Finally, the Initiative will leverage deep, ongoing engagement with
international partners and allies to map resources, advance strategic
partnerships, diversify global supply chains, and raise international
environmental, community, and worker-safety standards for extraction,
processing, and recycling. Through this initiative, the Administration
is acting on its commitment to build fairly at scale and speed as it
