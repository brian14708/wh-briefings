title: "Readout of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s Meeting with Kenyan\
  \ National Security Advisor Monica\_Juma"
---
 
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan
called Dr. Monica Juma today to congratulate her on her appointment as
Kenya’s first-ever National Security Advisor.  
  
Mr. Sullivan and Dr. Juma discussed their shared concerns about the
escalation of conflict in northern Ethiopia and the seriousness of the
humanitarian crisis, which worsens each day.  Mr. Sullivan urged that
the Government of Ethiopia and Tigrayan regional authorities meeting in
Pretoria, South Africa for talks next week agree to an immediate
cessation of hostilities, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance,
Eritrea’s withdrawal, and accountability for human rights violations.   
  
Mr. Sullivan and Dr. Juma also expressed concern over the devastating
Horn of Africa drought, under which Kenyans are suffering alongside
their neighbors in Ethiopia and Somalia.  The United States has provided
more than $2 billion this fiscal year alone in response to the drought
in the Horn of Africa, representing more than half of all humanitarian
funding to the region to address this situation.  
  
Mr. Sullivan and Dr. Juma reaffirmed the close partnership between the
United States and Kenya, and pledged to deepen our cooperation on
regional and global challenges.
