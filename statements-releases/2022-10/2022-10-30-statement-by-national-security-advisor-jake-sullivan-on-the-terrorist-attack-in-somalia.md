title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Terrorist Attack\
  \ in\_Somalia"
---
 
The United States strongly condemns yesterday’s tragic terrorist attack
in Mogadishu that killed an estimated 100 people and wounded
approximately 300 more, and in particular its heinous targeting of the
Somali Ministry of Education and first responders.  We send our deepest
condolences to the Somali people and to all those who lost loved ones or
were injured by these unconscionable attacks against innocent
civilians.  The United States remains committed to supporting the
Federal Government of Somalia in its fight to prevent such callous
terrorist acts.
