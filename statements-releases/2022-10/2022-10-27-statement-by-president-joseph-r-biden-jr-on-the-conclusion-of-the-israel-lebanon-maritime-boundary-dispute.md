  \ Maritime Boundary\_Dispute"

I am proud to congratulate Israel and Lebanon on officially concluding
their agreement to resolve their long-standing maritime boundary
dispute.  Today in Naqoura, Lebanon, both Parties took the final steps
to bring the agreement into force and submitted the final paperwork to
the United Nations in the presence of the United States.    
  
As I said when this historic agreement was announced, it will secure the
interests of both Israel and Lebanon, and it sets the stage for a more
stable and prosperous region.  The United States will continue to serve
as a facilitator as the parties work to uphold their commitments and
implement this agreement. Energy—particularly in the Eastern
Mediterranean—should not be a cause for conflict, but a tool for
cooperation, stability, security, and prosperity.  This agreement takes
us one step closer to realizing a vision for a Middle East that is more
secure, integrated, and prosperous, delivering benefits for all the
people of the region.
