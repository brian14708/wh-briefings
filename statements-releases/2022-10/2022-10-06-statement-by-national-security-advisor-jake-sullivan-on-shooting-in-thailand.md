The United States was horrified by the tragic shooting at a day care
center in Nong Bua Lam Phu Province, Thailand. The images are
heartbreaking and our deepest condolences go out to the families who
lost loved ones. We condemn this act of violence and stand ready to
assist our long-standing ally Thailand in whatever they need.
