*President Biden to Call on All Americans to Get Their Free, Updated
COVID-19 Vaccine and Do Their Part to Ensure a Safe and Healthy Winter*

Today, President Biden will announce additional efforts to get Americans
their updated COVID-19 vaccine, so that they have the protection they
need heading into Thanksgiving and can have a safe and healthy holiday
season. Over 20 million Americans, including nearly one in five seniors,
have already rolled up their sleeves to get their updated COVID-19
vaccine, and the President will encourage more Americans to do so right
away. The President will get his updated COVID-19 vaccine, and call on
everyone—including state, local, education, and business leaders—to do
their part to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their
communities.  
  
While COVID-19 is not the disruptive force it was when the President
took office, the virus continues to evolve. COVID-19, flu, and other
respiratory illnesses spread more quickly in the winter, as people
gather indoors. As the weather gets colder, Americans must take action
to stay protected.  
  
We have the tools we need to manage this moment. The updated vaccines
target the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of Omicron – the versions of the
virus that are most dominant in the U.S. and around the world. For most
Americans, if they get this updated COVID-19 vaccine, they can go about
their lives this fall and winter with the peace of mind that they remain
protected against serious illness. And, if they do get sick, there are
widely available and easily accessible treatments that reduce the
severity of illness, keep people out of the hospital, and save lives.

**Today, the President will announce the following actions:**

-   **Reaching high-risk Americans, including seniors, through targeted
    education and engagement efforts:**  
     
    -   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is
        launching new national and local TV, radio and print ads geared
        at reaching Black and Latino audiences in more than 30 markets
        in English and Spanish. New football and country music-themed
        radio ads geared at reaching rural communities will run in 15
        local markets. New print, radio, digital, and social ads will
        run in 25 markets to reach Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and
        Pacific Islander audiences in seven languages.  And, new social
        and digital ads will run on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest,
        Snapchat, and Reddit. The ads highlight the importance of
        getting the updated vaccine to protect the ones we love and the
        protection the updated COVID-19 vaccines offer against
        Omicron.  
         
    -   HHS will launch the \#VaxUpAmerica Family Vaccine Tour, a new
        push to encourage families to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine
        for maximum protection going into the winter and holiday season.
        As part of this tour, HHS will work with national and
        community-based organizations and others to reach families where
        they are with information on COVID-19 vaccines, and will host
        pop-up vaccination events and distribute toolkits at venues such
        as Head Start provider locations, nursing homes, and community
        health centers around the country. HHS will launch this tour on
        October 26 with a virtual event featuring Administration
        officials and others to share information and encourage schools,
        community-based organizations, faith-based organizations,
        employers and others to host their own vaccination events. And,
        HHS will continue to ramp up community outreach efforts to bring
        pop-up clinics to regions with lower vaccine uptake, including a
        pop-up vaccination clinic with Healthy Trucking of America at
        the NASCAR Cup Series Championship in Arizona.  
         
    -   The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is doubling
        down on its efforts to reach older Americans. In the next week,
        Medicare will send a second email reminder to the 16 million
        people who have signed up to receive Medicare emails with
        information about the updated COVID-19 vaccines and how to get
        them. CMS has also added a message on the updated COVID-19
        vaccines and the availability of effective treatments to the
        1-800-MEDICARE line. During this year’s Medicare Open Enrollment
        period, CMS expects to reach about 5 million people through
        these messages. CMS will also reemphasize the importance of
        updated vaccines and available treatments to Medicare Advantage
        plans and urge them to ensure their members have the information
        they need to protect themselves and their families.
-   **Calling on education and business leaders to do their part to get
    Americans their updated COVID-19 vaccine and manage COVID-19 this
    fall and winter: **Because of the work of leaders from across
    different sectors of society, over 225 million Americans have
    completed their primary COVID-19 vaccinations. Today, the President
    will call on employers and school leaders to once again do their
    part to get their communities protected, including by helping people
    get their updated COVID-19 vaccine ahead of the winter. The
    President will call on every school district, college, and
    university in America to host at least one vaccination clinic by
    Thanksgiving. He will also call on employers to take actions like
    offering paid-time-off for vaccination, and working with local
    vaccine providers to host on-site vaccination clinics for
    employees.  
     
    -   **Fall Playbook for Businesses to Manage COVID-19:** The
        Administration is releasing a [fall playbook for
        businesses](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Fall-Playbook-for-Businesses-to-Manage-COVID-19-and-Protect-Workers.pdf),
        with clear information about steps that businesses of all kinds
        can take to protect their workforces and customers and to keep
        their doors open—including actions they can take to get workers
        their updated COVID-19 vaccine, raise employee awareness about
        COVID-19 treatments, and improve indoor air quality in their
        buildings.  
         
    -   **Walgreens, Uber, and DoorDash:** Walgreens, Uber, and DoorDash
        are stepping up to answer the President’s call to action by
        increasing access to COVID-19 treatments. Walgreens is working
        with Uber and DoorDash to provide free delivery of prescriptions
        of Paxlovid, an oral COVID-19 treatment, directly to the
        doorsteps of Americans living in underserved communities.
        Patients with a prescription for Paxlovid being filled at
        Walgreens who live in a socially vulnerable community, based on
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Social
        Vulnerability Index, will be able to have their Paxlovid
        prescription delivered to their home through Uber Health and
        DoorDash at no cost via Walgreens.com and the Walgreens app. The
        initiative will formally launch in the coming weeks.
-   **Reaching out to Americans and making it even easier to get
    vaccinated through their local pharmacy: **The President will call
    on the nation’s pharmacies to double down on efforts to get
    Americans their updated COVID-19 vaccines this fall. The federal
    pharmacy vaccination program, which the Administration launched in
    February 2021, now includes over 40,000 local pharmacies across the
    country, and is responsible for more than 270 million shots in arms
    to date, including roughly three out of four updated COVID-19
    vaccines administered. The largest federal pharmacy partners are
    encouraging people to get their updated COVID-19 vaccines through
    tens of millions of texts, calls, and emails to customers,
    multimedia marketing campaigns, and a range of incentives. Federal
    pharmacy partners are offering walk-in vaccinations and extended
    hours, including at nights and on weekends. And, they are working
    with employers, schools, nursing homes and other community
    organizations to meet people where they are and advance vaccine
    equity. These steps will ensure Americans can get the protection
    they need heading into the winter at trusted, convenient
    locations.  
     
    -   **Albertsons**: All 1,722 Albertsons grocery store pharmacies
        are offering walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations, including on
        evenings and weekends. Albertsons is also offering 10 percent
        off groceries (up to $20 off) for people who get their COVID-19
        vaccine in-store. Albertsons has already sent 1.6 million text
        messages and nearly 17 million emails encouraging people to get
        an COVID-19 vaccine, and will soon launch a “Not Too Late”
        marketing campaign to urge people to get an updated COVID-19
        vaccine. In addition, Albertsons is engaging employers, schools,
        long-term care facilities, and other community partners to offer
        both flu and COVID-19 vaccines where people are, with over 3,000
        clinics hosted and/or scheduled since September 1 through
        October 23.  
         
    -   **CVS Health**: CVS has launched a scheduling tool that
        automatically prompts individuals making an appointment for
        either a flu vaccine or an updated COVID-19 vaccine to consider
        getting both at the same time. CVS has already sent more than 50
        million texts this fall to encourage consumers to get both their
        updated COVID-19 vaccine and flu shot, with tens of millions
        more texts planned between now and Thanksgiving. Building on its
        national TV ad campaign on the importance of flu and COVID-19
        vaccinations, CVS is investing in additional paid media through
        the end of December, and is offering $5 off any purchase of $20
        (redeemable in-store or online) for consumers getting an updated
        COVID-19 shot.  
         
    -   **Rite Aid**: Rite Aid is holding Family Immunization Days at
        more than 350 Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations to promote
        immunization and provide families with the convenience of
        getting vaccinated together after school and work, including
        with walk-in availability – with the next one scheduled on
        October 26 at Bartell Drugs locations. Rite Aid has already sent
        millions of text alerts to customers about scheduling an updated
        COVID-19 and a flu vaccine, with more planned.  Rite Aid has
        also scheduled thousands of COVID-19 vaccination clinics in
        workplaces, schools, colleges and universities, community
        centers, senior centers, churches, and casinos. And, beginning
        later this week, Rite Aid will offer coupons for $5 off $25
        purchase for those who receive a COVID-19 updated booster (not
        valid in New York or New Jersey).  
         
    -   **Southeastern Grocers**: Southeastern Grocers (SEG), parent
        company of Fresco y Más, Harveys Supermarket and Winn-Dixie
        grocery stores serving communities throughout the five
        southeastern states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and
        Mississippi, is offering walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations at all of
        its pharmacy locations, and working with school systems and
        employers to provide convenient COVID-19 vaccines at on-site
        vaccination clinics. SEG has also sent text and email reminders
        to customers, and offers $20 in free groceries when an
        individual gets their updated COVID-19 vaccine and flu shot at
        the same time.  
         
    -   **Walmart and Sam’s Club**: More than 5,000 Walmart and Sam’s
        Club locations offer updated COVID-19 vaccines seven days a
        week, including through walk-ins. In addition to sending
        millions of text reminders to consumers, Walmart also encourages
        shoppers to get their updated COVID-19 vaccines and the flu shot
        through audio messages that play in-store three to four times
        every hour, as well as through prominent signage on the updated
        COVID-19 vaccine. And, any individual who receives the flu shot
        at Walmart or Sam’s Club is encouraged to get the updated
        COVID-19 vaccine at the same time.  
         
    -   **Walgreens**: Walgreens has held over 1,000 vaccination clinics
        offering updated COVID-19 vaccines at churches, community
        centers, businesses, schools, and long-term care facilities,
        with hundreds more planned in the coming months. Walgreens is
        also working with trusted community influencers to drive
        awareness around the importance of getting the updated COVID-19
        vaccine and flu shot for the fall and winter. And, Walgreens is
        investing millions of dollars in paid media and direct
        outreach to encourage vaccinations across Black and Hispanic
        communities between now and the end of the year.
