title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden Congratulating Nobel Peace Prize\_Winners"
---
 
This year’s Nobel Peace Prize winners remind us that, even in dark days
of war, in the face of intimidation and oppression, the common human
desire for rights and dignity cannot be extinguished. On behalf of the
American people, I congratulate Ales Bialiatski of Belarus, Ukraine’s
Center for Civil Liberties, and the Russian organization Memorial on
this deserved honor.  
   
For years, they have tirelessly fought for human rights and fundamental
freedoms—including the right to speak freely and criticize openly. They
have pursued their mission with passion and persistence. Throughout its
history, Memorial has revealed the truth about the abuse of Soviet and
Russian citizens, despite intense intimidation. Ales Bialiatski has
never backed down from demanding the democratic freedoms the Belarusian
people deserve, even while imprisoned. And, in the midst of Russia’s
brutal and unprovoked war against Ukraine, the Center for Civil
Liberties is documenting in real time the war crimes and atrocities
Russia is inflicting on the Ukrainian people.  
   
Above all, the brave souls who do this work have pursued the truth and
documented for the world the political repression of their fellow
citizens—speaking out, standing up, and staying the course while being
threatened by those who seek their silence. In doing so, they have made
our world stronger. Ales Bialiatski, the Center for Civil Liberties, and
Memorial deserve to be recognized for the work they have done, the
example they have set, and the hope they inspire for a better future
through their unwavering dedication to fundamental freedoms.
