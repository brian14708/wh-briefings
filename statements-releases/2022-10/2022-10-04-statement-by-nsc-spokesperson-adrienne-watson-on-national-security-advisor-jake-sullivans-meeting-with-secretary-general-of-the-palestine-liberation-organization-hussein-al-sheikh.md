Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan
met with Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization
Hussein Al-Sheikh at the White House on October 4.  Following up on
President Biden’s trip to the West Bank in July, the two discussed U.S.
interest in supporting peace and stability, preserving the path towards
negotiations for two states, and advancing equal measures of security,
prosperity, and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike. Sullivan
stressed the need to take steps to de-escalate tensions in the West Bank
by countering terrorism and incitement, noted the importance of all
parties refraining from unilateral actions that threaten stability, and
emphasized the need to strengthen Palestinian institutions, including
reinforcing commitment to non-violence.
