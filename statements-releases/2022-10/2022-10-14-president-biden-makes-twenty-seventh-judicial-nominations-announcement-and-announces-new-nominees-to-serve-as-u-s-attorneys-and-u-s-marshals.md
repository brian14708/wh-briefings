title: "President\_Biden Makes Twenty-Seventh Judicial Nominations Announcement and\
  \ Announces New Nominees to Serve as U.S. Attorneys and U.S.\_Marshals"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate one new federal
judicial nominee who is extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and
devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.  
  
This is President Biden’s twenty-seventh round of nominees for federal
judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial
nominees to 144. 

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.

President Biden is also announcing his intent to nominate three new
nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys and three new nominees to serve as
U.S. Marshals. These are officials who will be indispensable to
upholding the rule of law as top federal law enforcement officials.

These individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law,
their professionalism, their experience and credentials, their
dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to
the independence of the Department of Justice.

The President has proposed a budget that would significantly increase
funding for law enforcement as part of a comprehensive approach to
tackling the rising crime rate this administration inherited last year.

The President has also launched a comprehensive effort to take on the
uptick in gun crime that has been taking place since 2020—putting more
cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking
down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys as the chief
federal law enforcement officers in their district is important for
these efforts.

The President has now announced 63 nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys
and 20 nominees to serve as U.S. Marshals.
