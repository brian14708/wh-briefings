title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Hyundai Investments in Georgia"
---
 
My economic agenda passed by Democrats in Congress to rebuild our
manufacturing and infrastructure here at home continues to pay off for
the American people, this time in Georgia.  This plant was announced
during my trip to the Republic of Korea in May, and I am excited the
groundbreaking is happening months ahead of schedule. Hyundai’s
commitment to invest more than $5 billion and create more than 8,000
jobs making electric vehicles and batteries will help boost the entire
community around Bryan County with good jobs people can raise a family
on, and ultimately help lower costs for the American people. This has
been at the heart of the historic legislation we have passed over the
past two years, and the last thing we should do is repeal it as
Republicans in Congress want to do.
