title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Russia\u2019s Missile\_Strikes"
---
 
The United States strongly condemns Russia’s missile strikes today
across Ukraine, including in Kyiv. These attacks killed and injured
civilians and destroyed targets with no military purpose. They once
again demonstrate the utter brutality of Mr. Putin’s illegal war on the
Ukrainian people.   
   
We offer our condolences to the families and loved ones of those who
were senselessly killed today, as well as our best wishes for the
recovery of those who were wounded.  
   
These attacks only further reinforce our commitment to stand with the
people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. Alongside our allies and
partners, we will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression,
hold Putin and Russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes, and
provide the support necessary for Ukrainian forces to defend their
country and their freedom.  
   
We again call on Russia to end this unprovoked aggression immediately
and remove its troops from Ukraine.
