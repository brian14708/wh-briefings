Vice President Kamala Harris spoke separately today with King Hamad bin
Isa Al Khalifa and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Salman bin Hamad Al
Khalifa of Bahrain. The Vice President expressed regret she was no
longer able to travel to Bahrain given the historic wildfires in Los
Angeles. The Vice President thanked both leaders for their partnership
throughout the Biden-Harris Administration in strengthening the
U.S.-Bahrain relationship and she reaffirmed the close and enduring
bilateral relationship between the United States and Bahrain. The Vice
President expressed pride in the 2023 signing of the Comprehensive
Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement (C-SIPA), a key
accomplishment of the Biden-Harris Administration in the Middle East,
which she and the Crown Prince advanced in their March 2022 meeting.
C-SIPA enhances U.S-Bahrain cooperation on defense, trade, science, and
emerging technology. The Vice President expressed support for
strengthening C-SIPA, and noted the United Kingdom’s recent decision to
join C-SIPA—demonstrating it can be a model for further regional
integration.  The Vice President expressed her appreciation for the
security partnership with Bahrain, and for its hosting the U.S. 5th
Fleet and U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, and the Vice President
reaffirmed the importance of the United States working with our regional
partners to support regional stability and maritime security. The Vice
President discussed latest developments in the Middle East, and she
underscored she will continue working toward a future of peace, dignity,
and security for all people in the region, and a future with increased
integration, connectivity, and prosperity. The Vice President commended
Bahrain’s leaders on the steps taken to promote interfaith tolerance in
Bahrain.
