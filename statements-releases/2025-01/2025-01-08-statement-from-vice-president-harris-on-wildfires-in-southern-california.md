title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on Wildfires in Southern\_California"
---
 
My heart goes out to all those being impacted by the devasting wildfires
in Southern California. Doug and I are praying for our fellow
Californians who have evacuated, and we are thinking of the families
whose homes, businesses, and schools remain in harm’s way. We are deeply
grateful for the heroic first responders who are risking their own
safety to fight the flames and help keep communities safe.  
   
I was briefed earlier tonight and will continue to receive regular
updates about these damaging wildfires and the coordinated efforts to
contain them. I am also urging residents in the affected areas to listen
to local officials, remain vigilant, and evacuate immediately if told to
do so.  
   
President Biden and I are committed to ensuring that no community has to
respond to this disaster alone. We have already mobilized federal
resources to help suppress the fires, provide overhead support, and
begin assisting those impacted. FEMA also quickly approved a Fire
Management Assistance Grant to help reimburse the state for immediate
firefighting costs.  
   
As a proud daughter of California, I know the damage that wildfires have
on our neighbors and communities. I also know that the impact is often
felt long after the fire is contained. As we respond and as Californians
recover, I will ensure that our administration is in constant contact
with state and local officials.
