title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the December 2024 Jobs\_Report"
---
 
With today’s report of 256,000 new jobs in December, we have created
over 16.6 million jobs over the course of my administration and this is
the only administration in history to have created jobs every single
month. Although I inherited the worst economic crisis in decades with
unemployment above 6% when I took office, we’ve had the lowest average
unemployment rate of any administration in 50 years with unemployment at
4.1% as I leave. Although forecasts were projecting it would take years
to achieve a full recovery, we have had the strongest growth and
employment creation of any advanced country, brought inflation back
down, and achieved the soft landing that few thought was possible. My
administration has achieved record high employment rates for working age
women and the lowest black-white unemployment gap on record. Incomes are
up almost $4,000 more than prices.

There is more to do to lower costs, but we’ve taken action to lower
prescription drug prices, health insurance premiums, utility bills, and
gas prices that will pay dividends for years to come. This has been a
hard-fought recovery, but we’ve made progress for working families,
showing what can be accomplished when we build from the middle out and
bottom up.
