title: "The United\_States\u2019 Enduring Commitment to the Indo-Pacific\_Region"
---
 
From Day One, President Biden identified the Indo-Pacific as the
critical region for the future of the United States and the world. Under
the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States has reinvested in and
reinvigorated our leadership in this region and, as a result, our
position there is stronger now than ever before. Together with our
allies and partners, we have built a shared foundation for the
Indo-Pacific–one that is free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and
resilient.

1.  **An Indo-Pacific that is Free and Open**

We are promoting a free and open region where individuals can thrive in
transparent societies and nations can make sovereign political choices
free from coercion.  We are addressing regional issues openly, upholding
international law and norms, and facilitating the free movement of
goods, services, ideas, and people by:

-   **Ensuring seas, skies, and other shared domains are lawfully
    governed:** The Department of Defense (DoD) continues to uphold
    freedom of navigation and overflight in the Indo-Pacific in
    accordance with international law. Over the past four years, DoD has
    challenged over a dozen excessive maritime claims as part of the
    global freedom of navigation operations (FON) Program. The U.S.
    military, alongside allies and partners, has participated in
    numerous bilateral and multilateral maritime exercises to strengthen
    regional and international cooperation in support of a free and open
    Indo-Pacific, including in the South China Sea.

<!-- -->

-   **Investing in democratic institutions, a free press, and a vibrant
    civil society**:  In 2024, we co-hosted the third Summit for
    Democracy with the Republic of Korea (ROK) to champion our
    democratic values of transparency, accountable governance, advancing
    technology for democracy and support for the rule of law.  We
    continue to promote accountability for human rights abuses in the
    People’s Republic of China (PRC), Democratic People’s Republic of
    Korea (DPRK), and Burma. We have continued to rally global attention
    to these human rights abuses at the United Nations and in other
    multi-lateral fora.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting journalistic integrity and countering foreign
    information manipulation and interference:**  To bolster civil
    society and safeguard communities, we have signed bilateral
    memoranda with Japan, the ROK, and Australia to combat foreign state
    information manipulation.  We also built the capacity of media
    outlets across the Indo-Pacific to increase journalistic integrity,
    improve access to information, and reduce vulnerability to foreign
    interference. 

<!-- -->

-   **Addressing the Humanitarian Crisis in Burma:** As a leading
    contributor of humanitarian assistance, we provided $1.8 billion in
    life saving assistance in Burma and the region, including more than
    $1.2 billion in response to the Rohingya crisis.  We have sanctioned
    91 individuals and 50 entities since the 2021 coup to deny the
    military regime income and pressure it to return to the path of
    democracy.

1.  **An Indo-Pacific that is Connected**

Over the past four years, this Administration has built, in cooperation
with our partners and allies, a new, enduring Indo-Pacific architecture
that is better equipped to meet the profound challenges and capitalize
on the momentous opportunities this region presents. We have built
collective capacity within and beyond the region by:

-   **Elevating and strengthening our bilateral relationships:**  We
    upgraded our bilateral relationships with Vietnam and Indonesia to
    Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships. President Biden hosted State
    or Official Visits with the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and
    the ROK at the White House. We affirmed commitments with the ROK to
    deepen defense and security ties, expand economic cooperation, and
    increase digital and technology collaboration. We inaugurated a new
    era of U.S.-Australia strategic cooperation, adding climate and
    clean energy as the third pillar of our Alliance. The U.S. and Japan
    launched over 70 initiatives at the April 2024 State Visit as part
    of our drive to transform our bilateral relationship into a truly
    global partnership. The U.S. and India launched a transformational
    initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) to deepen our
    strategic technology partnership and defense industrial cooperation.
    And we achieved unprecedented defense, economic, and technology
    cooperation with our ally the Philippines.

<!-- -->

-   **Delivering through the Quad**:  In 2021, President Biden elevated
    the Quad – a grouping of Australia, India, Japan, and the United
    States – to the Leader-level. Since then, Leaders have met six
    times, including at four Leaders’ Summits. Our four countries have
    achieved an unprecedented degree of strategic alignment and advanced
    concrete projects across the Indo-Pacific in priority areas:
    maritime domain awareness, cybersecurity and technology, quality
    infrastructure, health security, and humanitarian assistance and
    disaster relief.

<!-- -->

-   **Deepening U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral cooperation:**  At the
    Trilateral Leaders’ Summit at Camp David in August 2023, we achieved
    a historic breakthrough that ushered in a previously unimaginable
    level of cooperation between the United States, Japan, and the ROK,
    and drove deeper trilateral cooperation in every domain. We
    committed to consult on regional challenges, provocations, and
    threats affecting our collective interests and security; accelerated
    information sharing, including the real-time sharing of missile
    warning data and data on potential supply chain disruptions;
    institutionalized defense cooperation through the annual FREEDOM
    EDGE exercise; and established a new cyber working group.

<!-- -->

-   **Enhancing trilateral cooperation with Japan and the Philippines:**
     In April 2024, President Biden hosted the first-ever
    U.S.-Japan-Philippines Leaders’ Summit, standing
    shoulder-to-shoulder with our Philippine allies in the face of
    unlawful and destabilizing PRC provocations in the South China Sea.
    Since then, we have coordinated investment in strategic sectors and
    promoted dynamic growth in the Philippines, cooperated on critical
    technologies, and strengthened maritime law enforcement and security
    coordination and interoperability.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding our Diplomatic Presence**:  We opened U.S. embassies in
    Vanuatu, Tonga, Maldives, and Solomon Islands, we intend to open new
    consulates in India in 2025, and we established diplomatic relations
    with the Cook Islands and Niue. We opened Department of Commerce
    Commercial Service offices in Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, and
    Fiji. We re-established a USAID mission in Fiji and elevated USAID’s
    presence in Papua New Guinea to a Country Representative Office.

<!-- -->

-   **Deepening cooperation with our Pacific partners: ** UnderPresident
    Biden, we hosted two historic Pacific Islands Forum Summits at the
    White House, designated the first-ever U.S. Envoy to the Pacific
    Islands Forum, and launched the first-ever U.S.-Pacific Partnership
    Strategy. We launched the Partners in the Blue Pacific initiative in
    2022 to work with partners and bring new resources to deliver
    results in support of Pacific priorities. Our defense posture in the
    Pacific Islands countries continues to be critical for U.S. military
    logistics, sustainment, and power projection. In the last few years,
    we expanded the National Guard State Partnership Program to Pacific
    Island countries and signed important new defense agreements with
    Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We returned the Peace Corps to Fiji,
    Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. In partnership with the Republic of the
    Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau, we
    continue to strengthen the Compacts of Free Association and have
    extended $7.1 billion in economic assistance over the next 20 years.

<!-- -->

-   **Strengthening our relationships in the Indian Ocean Region: ** We
    brought the U.S.-India relationship to new heights, including
    through Prime Minister Modi’s State Visit to Washington and
    President Biden’s visit to New Delhi for the G-20 Leaders’ Summit.
    We deepened cooperation with India on semiconductor and critical
    minerals supply chains, and launched an Innovation Handshake to
    strengthen our startup and entrepreneurial ecosystems.  We
    strengthened partnerships in the Indian Ocean Region, working with
    partners and organizations like the Indian Ocean Rim Association
    (IORA) on climate adaptation, sustainable blue economies, and
    maritime security. Additionally, the United States recently launched
    the Young South Asian Leaders Initiative, which will link young
    leaders throughout South Asia and promote innovation through local
    and regional grants.

<!-- -->

-   **Reaffirming our support for ASEAN: ** We support a strong and
    independent ASEAN and its central role within the region.  Over the
    course of the administration, we held five U.S.-ASEAN Summits,
    including a historic U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington, DC, in
    May 2022.  That same year, the United States elevated its
    relationship with ASEAN to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. We
    have already successfully implemented 99% of the 2022-2025
    ASEAN-U.S. Plan of Action goals; established through a
    public-private partnership the U.S.-ASEAN Center in Washington, DC;
    extended the U.S.-ASEAN Regional Development Cooperation Agreement
    to 2029; and launched the new five-year ASEAN USAID Partnership
    Program. Continuing a tradition of close defense cooperation with
    ASEAN, we launched the new Emerging Leaders Defense Program to
    support rising defense leaders across the region, commenced planning
    for the second ASEAN-U.S. Maritime Exercise, and expanded training
    and support for climate resilience efforts.We have reinvigorated
    youth leadership in the region through fellowships, training
    programs, and educational exchanges. Through the Young Southeast
    Asian Leaders Initiative, we have equipped more than 150,000
    participants with knowledge and skills to solve regional and global
    challenges. In FY 2023 alone, the United States also supported soft
    and life skills training for more than 68,000 youth across the
    region.

<!-- -->

-   **Reinvigorating our partnership in the Mekong sub-region: **
    Through sustained engagement with partner countries under the
    Mekong-U.S. Partnership (MUSP), we convened in July 2024 the first
    ever in-person MUSP Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, and adopted the MUSP
    Plan of Action 2024-2026, which captures the contributions that the
    MUSP has made towards the equitable, sustainable, and inclusive
    development of the Mekong sub-region over the last years, and sets
    the course for continued cooperation.

1.  **An Indo-Pacific that is Prosperous**

In collaboration with our regional partners, we are fostering private
investment, enhancing economic competitiveness, and addressing the
region’s infrastructure gap to drive greater economic prosperity by:

-   **Demonstrating leadership in the region through Asia-Pacific
    Economic Cooperation (APEC):**  We continued to deepen our economic
    ties with key regional partners and advance a more innovative,
    interconnected, and inclusive economic agenda for the region by
    hosting APEC in 2023. In addition to promoting U.S. economic policy
    priorities, we announced over $50 billion of U.S. private sector
    investment into APEC economies to drive inclusive, sustainable, and
    resilient growth throughout the region, while advancing U.S.
    competitiveness and incentivizing private sector investment from the
    region. Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration,
    companies based in the Asia-Pacific invested almost $200 billion
    into the United States and supported tens of thousands of jobs for
    American workers.

<!-- -->

-   **Launching the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity
    (IPEF): ** Along with 13 partners in the Indo-Pacific, we
    established a new grouping to shape regional collaboration on
    contemporary economic challenges to ensure that the Indo-Pacific
    remains a dynamic marketplace where businesses can invest, grow, and
    thrive. Through a combination of innovative agreements and
    cross-cutting initiatives, IPEF partners are fostering trade ties,
    strengthening supply chain resilience, facilitating public and
    private investments in infrastructure, and promoting a fair and
    predictable business environment for our companies.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding Investment in Regional Infrastructure:**  We invested
    billions in regional infrastructure, including in ports, energy,
    rail, and digital.  We launched the Partnership for Global
    Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) Luzon Economic Corridor with the
    Philippines and Japan to improve regional transportation, energy,
    and digital connectivity in the Philippines. We supported Pacific
    island countries by funding over $37 million in undersea cables
    projects–providing communications connections to populations for the
    first time–and collaborated with partners like Australia, Japan, New
    Zealand, and Taiwan, and mobilized the U.S. private sector, to
    secure further funding. We are also providing capacity building
    support to South Asia’s busiest transshipment hub as well as
    supporting sustainable and resilient port infrastructure development
    across the Indo-Pacific through the Quad Ports of the Future
    Partnership.
-   **Promoting Resilient and Secure Connectivity**: The United States
    promoted resilient, secure, and trustworthy telecommunications
    across the region, focusing on 5G vendor diversification, Open Radio
    Access Network (Open RAN) technology, and undersea cable
    infrastructure. In India, USAID teamed up with Qualcomm to introduce
    Open RAN technology. The United States is promoting Open RAN
    workforce development opportunities through the Asia Open RAN
    Academy in the Philippines. In Indonesia, we are supporting the
    deployment of Open RAN technology to provide connectivity to 1,621
    unserved rural villages. In addition, we, alongside Quad partners,
    deployed the first Open RAN technology in the Pacific, in Palau, and
    elevated undersea cable protections throughout the region through
    the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience.

1.  **An Indo-Pacific that is Stable and Secure**

In pursuit of regional peace, security, and stability, we have
reinvested in our defense presence and capabilities, integrated our
efforts with partners and modernized our alliances, and collectively
deterred aggression and coercion by:

-   **Launching the Australia – United Kingdom – United States (AUKUS)
    Enhanced Security Partnership: ** We are delivering on a
    generational opportunity to support Australia’s acquisition of a
    conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability and are
    engaged with Australia and the United Kingdom in developing advanced
    capabilities to address current and future security challenges. In
    addition to the core partners, we are consulting with Japan, Canada,
    New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea on possible collaboration on
    AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects.

<!-- -->

-   **Providing an unprecedented $2 billion in supplemental Foreign
    Military Financing (FMF) to the Indo-Pacific:**  We are
    demonstrating the United States’ commitment to enhancing our allies’
    and partners’ capacity to address external threats and meet emerging
    challenges. This included working with Congress to allocate an
    unprecedented $500 million in FMF from the National Security
    Supplemental to enhance the capability of the Armed Forces of the
    Philippines and the Philippine Coast Guard to fulfill their
    territorial defense mission and contribute to regional security.  We
    also allocated a record level of FMF to support the Papua New Guinea
    Defence Force, gave new support to Vietnam, and made substantial
    contributions to the maritime security of states across the Indian
    Ocean region.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities:**  Consistent with
    the United States’ longstanding one China policy, we have used a
    range of security assistance authorities and resources to provide
    Taiwan defensive arms and services necessary to maintain a
    sufficient self-defense capability, commensurate with the threat it
    faces.  This support includes the first-ever use of Foreign Military
    Financing and Presidential Drawdown Authority for Taiwan, as well as
    International Military Education and Training.  This assistance is
    an important part of our efforts to maintain cross-Strait peace and
    stability.

<!-- -->

-   **Modernizing our alliances:** The U.S.-Japan Alliance is stronger
    than ever before. Over the past four years, we have modernized our
    alliance command and control frameworks, strengthened training and
    exercises, and established a new bilateral forum to advance
    co-production, co-development, and co-sustainment. We strengthened
    the U.S.-Philippines alliance by signing the first-ever Bilateral
    Defense Guidelines to enhance military cooperation across all
    domains, expanding the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)
    to include four new sites, supporting the Philippines’ military
    modernization, and investing $128 million in EDCA infrastructure
    through the President’s FY25 Budget Request.  We also created the
    Nuclear Consultative Group with the Republic of Korea to deepen and
    enhance our extended deterrence cooperation in the face of threats
    from the DPRK. Additionally, cooperation in cyberspace and emerging
    technology has become an integral feature in all of our alliances to
    support our joint network defenses and interoperability.

<!-- -->

-   **Enhancing Maritime Security: ** We worked with our allies and
    partners to enhance the rules-based maritime order in the
    Indo-Pacific and protection of sea lanes, including through the
    Maritime Security Consortium—the first ever initiative bringing
    together defense industry, U.S. government leaders, and Southeast
    Asian decision makers to transform maritime security in Southeast
    Asia—the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness
    (IPMDA), expanded Coast Guard exchanges, and capacity building
    efforts across the region. In December 2023, we established a
    dedicated Indo-Pacific Support Cutter in Honolulu, HI to promote
    maritime governance, establish persistent U.S. presence, and conduct
    meaningful engagements in the region. U.S. Coast Guard Cutter
    *Harriet Lane* embarked shipriders and worked alongside 12 Pacific
    island countries to enhance maritime domain awareness and combat
    illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and other illicit
    activities. We secured $200 million for two additional U.S. Coast
    Guard Fast Response Cutters to support the Indo-Pacific, which will
    add capacity to complete further-reaching deployments.

<!-- -->

-   **Forging deeper ties between NATO and its Indo-Pacific Partners
    (IPP)**:  The United States has championed NATO deepening its
    relationships with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the ROK,
    recognizing the prosperity and security of the two regions are
    inextricably linked. The IPP attended the past three NATO Summits
    and at the most recent Washington Summit, NATO and the IPP pledged
    to cooperate on flagship projects focused on cybersecurity,
    countering disinformation, emerging technology, and supporting
    Ukraine. The NATO-IPP partnership demonstrated its indispensable
    importance in November when an ROK delegation briefed Allies and
    other IPP countries on DPRK’s deepening support for Russia on the
    eve of the entry of DPRK forces into battle against Ukraine.

<!-- -->

-   **An Indo-Pacific that is Resilient**

The United States has collaborated with Indo-Pacific partners to enhance
resilience against transnational threats that effect all of our
countries, including climate change, natural disasters, and infectious
disease threats by:

-   **Addressing the climate crisis: ** We are supporting ASEAN member
    states in developing and implementing ambitious nationally
    determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions through the U.S.-ASEAN Climate Solutions
    Hub.  Through the Interagency Climate Ambition Program, we provided
    long-term embedded advisors to the Philippines, Fiji, and Vietnam to
    support partner countries’ climate priorities. We also supported
    Pacific island countries through the funding of humanitarian
    warehousing, an ocean and fisheries research vessel, the Pacific
    Resilience Facility, marine spatial planning, a Resilience and
    Adaptation Fellowship, and the Climate Action Champions Network to
    support disaster resilience, community resilience, and climate
    leadership in the Pacific and South Asia.

<!-- -->

-   **Strengthening disaster and climate resilient infrastructure:** We
    are supporting Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure
    (CDRI) India’s climate change initiative to help foster disaster and
    climate resilient infrastructure worldwide. Together, we launched
    the Global Infrastructure Risk Model and Resilience Index, enabling
    countries to predict disaster impacts and strengthen infrastructure
    resilience.

<!-- -->

-   **Deepening Coordination on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster
    Relief:** Following Super Typhoon Man-Yi, Tropical Storm Kristine,
    and Tropical Storm Julian, USAID provided over $6 million in life
    saving assistance, and DoD worked with our Philippine allies to
    deliver humanitarian relief prepositioned at EDCA sites, along with
    50 tons of other assistance, to affected communities across the
    Philippines. We worked with ourQuad partners on coordinated
    responses to Typhoon Yagi and the devastating landslides in Papua
    New Guinea, providing $5 million in humanitarian assistance for the
    landslide disaster relief efforts.

<!-- -->

-   **Boosting Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response: ** We
    enhanced coordination with Quad partners to scale up COVID-19
    response efforts, donating more than 400 million COVID-19 vaccine
    doses to Indo-Pacific countries and almost 800 million vaccines
    doses globally, expanding vaccine production capacity, and
    addressing a range of health security priorities in the region. We
    also launched the Quad Cancer Moonshot, an over $150 million
    public-private investment to prevent, detect, and treat cancer
    across the Indo-Pacific. Additionally, the U.S. government is
    partnering with more than ten countries in the Indo-Pacific region
    to strengthen their ability to prevent and control health security
    threats at their source.

<!-- -->

-   **Deepening our cooperation on clean energy research and
    development:**  We collaborated with Indo-Pacific partners to
    establish diverse, secure, and reliable supply chains for critical
    minerals and clean energy.  We launched the multilateral Just Energy
    Transition Partnerships with Indonesia and Vietnam and signed
    Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Technology “123” Agreements with both the
    Philippines and Singapore to address energy needs.  We also launched
    the Renewable Energy Technology Action Platform (RETAP) under the
    U.S.-India Strategic Clean Energy Partnership aimed at developing
    action roadmaps for technology development, deployment, and
    commercialization ofhydrogen, long duration energy storage, offshore
    wind, and geothermal energy.
