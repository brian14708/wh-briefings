title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Wildfires Across Los\_Angeles"
---
 
Our hearts ache for the 24 innocent souls we have lost in the wildfires
across Los Angeles. Jill and I pray for them and their loved ones. We
are deeply saddened by the devastation caused by the unprecedented
ongoing wildfires across Southern California.

I am being frequently briefed on intensive efforts to suppress the
wildfires across Los Angeles, and have directed our team to respond
promptly to any request for additional federal firefighting assistance.
At my direction, hundreds of federal personnel and unique federal aerial
and ground support has been sent to California to support the
firefighting efforts and help communities in need. My Administration
remains laser-focused on helping survivors and we will continue to use
every tool available to support the urgent firefight as the winds are
projected to increase.

To the brave firefighters and first responders working day and night to
suppress these fires and save lives: our nation is grateful. You
represent the best of America and we are in your debt.
