President Biden spoke today with Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of
Qatar. The two leaders discussed the negotiations in Doha for a
ceasefire and hostage release deal based on the May 27, 2024 arrangement
described by the President last year and endorsed unanimously by the UN
Security Council. The President thanked the Amir for his leadership and
praised the mediating role of Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al
Thani throughout the process. Both leaders emphasized the urgent need
for a deal to be implemented to return the hostages to their families
and bring immediate relief to the people of Gaza through a surge in
humanitarian aid enabled by the ceasefire and called for in the deal.
Both leaders agreed to remain in close coordination directly and through
their teams at this critical point in the negotiations.
