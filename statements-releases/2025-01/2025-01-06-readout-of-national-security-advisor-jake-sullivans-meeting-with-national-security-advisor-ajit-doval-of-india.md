National Security Advisor of India Shri Ajit Doval met with U.S.
National Security Advisor Mr. Jake Sullivan in New Delhi on 6 January,
2025.  NSA Sullivan was accompanied by a delegation of senior U.S.
government officials.   
  
The two NSAs have engaged regularly in a high-level dialogue through
extensive discussions on a broad bilateral, regional and global agenda.
 Following the launch of the India-US Initiative on Critical and
Emerging Technologies (iCET) by Prime Minister Modi and President Joseph
Biden on the side lines of the Quad Summit in Tokyo on 24 May 2022, the
two NSAs have driven concrete initiatives between the two
countries across a range of areas including Artificial Intelligence,
Quantum Computing, Semiconductors, Telecommunications, Defence
and Space.   
  
The current visit gave them the opportunity to review ongoing progress
in their high-level dialogue, including in diverse fields such
as Defence, Cyber and Maritime Security.    
  
US NSA Jake Sullivan briefed the Indian side on the updates brought out
by the Biden administration to U.S. missile export control policies
under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) that will boost US
commercial space cooperation with India. Reflecting the progress the
United States and India have made—and will continue to make—as strategic
partners and countries with a shared commitment to peaceful nuclear
cooperation, NSA Sullivan announced US efforts to finalize necessary
steps to delist Indian nuclear entities, which will promote civil
nuclear cooperation and resilient clean energy supply chains.
