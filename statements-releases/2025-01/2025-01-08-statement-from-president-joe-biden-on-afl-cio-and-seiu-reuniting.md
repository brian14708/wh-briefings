title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on AFL-CIO and SEIU\_Reuniting"
---
 
This is a big deal. 

Today, SEIU reunited with the AFL-CIO, America’s largest federation of
labor unions and a key voice for workers across the country. SEIU is one
of the most powerful unions in America representing two million care and
service workers. Their affiliation will help workers across the country
to organize, earn higher wages, receive better benefits and build
retirement security. 

I am proud to be the most pro labor President in American history – and
I’m proud to congratulate American workers on this important milestone.
