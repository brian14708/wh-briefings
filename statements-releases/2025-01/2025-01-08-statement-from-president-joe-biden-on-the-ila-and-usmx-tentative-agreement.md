title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the ILA and USMX Tentative\_Agreement"
---
 
Collective bargaining plays an important role when it comes to building
a strong economy from the middle out and the bottom up. Today’s
tentative agreement between the International Longshoremen’s Association
and the United States Maritime Alliance shows that labor and management
can come together to benefit workers and their employers. 

I applaud the dockworkers’ union for delivering a strong contract. Their
members kept our ports open during the pandemic, as we worked together
to unsnarl global supply chains. Thank you to the carriers and port
operators who play an essential role in our nation’s economy.
