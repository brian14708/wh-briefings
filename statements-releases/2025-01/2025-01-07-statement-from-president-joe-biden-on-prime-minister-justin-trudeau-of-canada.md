title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of\_\
  Canada"
---
 
The last time I visited Ottawa, I said that the United States chooses to
link our future with Canada because we know that we’ll find no better
ally, no closer partner, and no steadier friend. The same can be
said of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

When I became President, he was the first foreign leader I spoke with. I
spoke to him yesterday and expressed my appreciation for his partnership
over the years.  Together, we’ve tackled some of the toughest issues our
nations faced in decades, from the COVID-19 pandemic, to climate change,
to the scourge of fentanyl. We’ve stood together with the people of
Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression to defend our nations’ most
sacred value: freedom. And we have made generational investments to
strengthen our supply chains and rebuild our economies from the
bottom up and middle out—establishing North America as the most
economically competitive region in the world. 

Over the last decade, Prime Minister Trudeau has led with commitment,
optimism, and strategic vision. The U.S.-Canada alliance is
stronger because of him. The American and Canadian people are safer
because of him. And the world is better off because of him.

I am proud to call him my friend. And I will be forever grateful for
his partnership and leadership.
