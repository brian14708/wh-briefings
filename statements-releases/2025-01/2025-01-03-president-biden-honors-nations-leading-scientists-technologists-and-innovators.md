  Innovators"

Today, President Biden announced the latest recipients of the National
Medal of Science and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation—our
nation’s highest honors for exemplary achievement and leadership in
science and technology.  
   
For 65 years, the President of the United States has bestowed the
National Medal of Science on those deserving of special recognition for
their outstanding contributions to science in service to the United
States. This medal was established by Congress in 1959 and is
administered by the U.S. National Science Foundation.  
   
Since it was first awarded in 1985, the National Medal of Technology and
Innovation has recognized American innovators whose vision, intellect,
creativity, and determination have strengthened America’s economy and
improved our quality of life. The medal was established by Congress in
1980 and is administered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

President Biden often says that America can be defined in a single word:
possibilities. Those who earn these awards embody the promise of America
by pushing the boundaries of what is possible. These trailblazers have
harnessed the power of science and technology to tackle challenging
problems and deliver innovative solutions for Americans and for
communities around the world.

These medalists have made discoveries that are helping us meet the
climate crisis, treat crippling disease, create lifesaving vaccines,
pioneer the way we communicate, and significantly improve our
understanding of the universe and our place within it. Their
accomplishments advance American leadership in science, technology, and
innovation, and their work inspires the next generation of American
leaders.
