title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Final Rule Removing Medical Debt\
  \ from All Credit\_Reports"
---
 
*Today’s final rule will remove $49 billion in unpaid medical bills from
the credit reports of 15 million Americans. In addition, the Vice
President is announcing that States and Localities have already
Eliminated Over $1 Billion in Medical Debt Thanks to Biden-Harris
Administration Support* 

**Today, Vice President Harris announced a final rule by the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau to remove medical debt from consumer credit
reports. This rule will reduce the burden of medical debt and ensure
that patients are not denied access to credit for home mortgages, car
loans, or small business loans due to unpaid medical bills.**  
   
Further, Vice President Harris announced that states and localities have
leveraged American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to support the elimination of
over $1 billion in medical debt for more than 700,000 Americans. These
actions build on the Vice President’s call to action for states to
reduce the burden of medical debt, including by directly purchasing the
debt from providers and third parties. Overall, jurisdictions are on
track to eliminate roughly $15 billion in medical debt for up to nearly
6 million Americans.  
   
“No one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or
experienced a medical emergency. That is why President Biden and I
cancelled over $1 billion in medical debt – part of our overall plan to
forgive $7 billion by 2026 – with support from our American Rescue Plan,
legislation that I advanced with my tie-breaking vote in the Senate. We
also reduced the burden of medical debt by increasing pathways to
forgiveness and cracking down on predatory debt collection
tactics,” **said Vice President Harris.** “Today, we are building on
this meaningful work by announcing an unprecedented final rule that will
make it so medical debt is no longer included in your credit score. This
will be lifechanging for millions of families, making it easier for them
to be approved for a car loan, a home loan, or a small-business loan. As
someone who has spent my entire career fighting to protect consumers and
lower medical bills, I know that our historic rule will help more
Americans save money, build wealth, and thrive.”  
   
More than 100 million Americans struggle with medical debt. Medical debt
is the largest source of debt in collections, making up a larger
proportion of debt tradelines than credit cards, utilities, and auto
loans. However, medical debt is not like other forms of debt because it
is often the result of unavoidable medical complications and medical
bills often contain significant errors, such as inflated or duplicative
charges and fees for services never received or already paid. Reducing
the burden of medical debt has been a key priority in President Biden
and Vice President Harris’s effort to lower cost for American
families.  
   
**Removing Medical Debt from Consumer Credit Reports**  
   
The CFPB is finalizing a rule that will remove medical debt from the
credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, raising their credit
scores by an estimated average of 20 points and leading to the approval
of approximately 22,000 additional mortgages every year. Under the CFPB
rule, there will be zero Americans with medical debt listed on their
credit reports, down from 46 million in 2020. CFPB’s research indicates
that medical bills are [poor
predictors](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-study-finds-medical-debt-overly-penalizes-consumer-credit-scores/) of
an individual’s ability to repay a loan and that medical bills are
often [confusing and
erroneous](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-spotlights-medical-billing-challenges/).
In March 2022, the CFPB released
a [report](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-estimates-88-billion-in-medical-bills-on-credit-reports/) estimating
that medical bills made up $88 billion of reported debts on credit
reports. After the March 2022 report, the three largest credit reporting
agencies announced that they would no longer include paid medical debts,
unpaid medical debts less than a year old, and medical debt under $500
from credit reporting. Despite these voluntary changes, [15 million
Americans](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-finds-15-million-americans-have-medical-bills-on-their-credit-reports/) still
have $49 billion in outstanding medical bills in collections appearing
in the credit reporting system. Today’s action will remove these
outstanding $49 billion in unpaid medical bills from the credit reports
of the remaining 15 million impacted Americans.  
   
**Vice President Harris’s Call to Action, Leveraging Federal Funds to
Eliminate Medical Debt**  
   
In June 2024, Vice President Harris [called on states, local
governments, and health care providers to take
action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/11/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-proposal-to-prohibit-medical-bills-from-being-included-on-credit-reports-and-calls-on-states-and-localities-to-take-further-actions-to-reduce-medical-debt/) to
reduce the burden of medical debt. States and localities have responded
to this call by directly relieving debt and launching innovative
programs to improve their health systems. Thanks to the President Biden
and Vice President Harris’s American Rescue Plan, states, counties, and
cities have already eliminated more than an estimated $1 billion in
medical debt for over 750,000 Americans, including:

-   Cook County, Illinois has eliminated over $382 million in medical
    debt for over 210,000 residents.
-   New Jersey has eliminated $220 million in medical debt for over
    120,00 residents.
-   Cleveland, Ohio has eliminated nearly $137 million in medical debt
    for over 130,000 residents.
-   Toledo and Lucas County, Ohio partnered to eliminate over $87
    million in medical debt for over 140,000 residents.
-   New Orleans, Louisiana has eliminated nearly $70 million in medical
    debt for 75,000 residents.
-   St. Paul, Minnesota has eliminated $40 million in medical debt for
    over 30,000 residents.
-   Washington, DC has eliminated $42 million in medical debt for over
    60,000 residents.
-   Connecticut has eliminated $30 million in medical debt for 23,000
    residents.
-   Wayne County, Michigan has eliminated $27 million in medical debt
    for more than 46,000 residents.
-   Oakland County, Michigan has eliminated $9 million in medical debt
    for more than 14,000 residents.

These and other jurisdictions are on track to eliminate an estimated up
to $7 billion in medical debt for nearly 3 million Americans by the end
of 2026 thanks to ARP-supported efforts.

In addition to directly relieving debt, states and localities have
responded to Vice President Harris’s call by launching innovative
programs to improve their health systems. For instance, North
Carolina [recently
announced](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2024/08/12/north-carolina-hospitals-sign-relieve-medical-debt) that
all of the state’s 99 eligible hospitals have committed to participate
in medical debt relief program that will eliminate up to $4 billion in
existing medical debt for nearly 2 million low-and middle-income North
Carolinians.  The program also ensures that hospitals have policies in
place to reduce the chance individuals will end up in debt in the first
place. North Carolina’s program utilizes a novel approach, where
hospital systems become eligible for enhanced Medicaid reimbursements
under the State Directed Payments Healthcare Access and Stabilization
Program by implementing policies that:

-   Relieve all medical debt deemed uncollectible dating back to Jan. 1,
    2014, for any individuals not enrolled in Medicaid with incomes at
    or below at least 350% of the federal poverty level (FPL) or for
    whom total debt exceeds 5% of annual income.  
-   Relieve all unpaid medical debt dating back to Jan. 1, 2014, for
    individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid.  
-   Sets a charity care floor in the state that provides discounts on
    medical bills of between 50-100% for patients with incomes at or
    below 300% FPL, with the amount of the discount varying based on the
    patient’s income.
-   Automatically enroll people into financial assistance, known as
    charity care, by implementing a policy for presumptively determining
    individuals eligible for financial assistance through a streamlined
    screening and income validation approach. 
-   Not sell any medical debt for consumers with incomes at or below
    300% FPL to debt collectors. 
-   Not report a patient’s debt covered by these policies to a credit
    reporting agency.

**Preventing the Accumulation of Medical Debt Through Increased
Oversight**

Today’s announcements build on efforts by the Biden-Harris
Administration to reduce the burden of medical debt, including:

-   The Internal Revenue
    Service [announced](https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/irs-plans-more-nonprofit-hospital-audits-as-scrutiny-heats-up) new
    steps to ensure that non-profit hospitals provide free and
    reduced-price care for patients that need it, as is required by law.
    This includes [issuing new
    guidance](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-counsel/2024-2025-priority-guidance-plan-initial-version.pdf) in
    the coming months to clarify the obligations of tax-exempt
    hospitals  to offer and publicize financial assistance policies
    and [committing to prioritizing enforcement
    actions](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5313.pdf) against
    tax-exempt hospitals that violate these responsibilities.
-   The CFPB issued an [Advisory
    Opinion](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-aim-at-double-billing-and-inflated-charges-in-medical-debt-collection/) and [Consumer
    Advisory](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-advisory-pause-and-review-your-rights-when-you-hear-from-a-medical-debt-collector/) clarifying
    the responsibilities of debt collectors to confirm that debts are
    accurate, valid, and substantiated before engaging in collection
    actions and explaining to consumers what actions they can take when
    they suspect that they have been improperly billed or if they have
    had improper or illegal collection actions taken against them.
-   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) implemented [a streamlined
    process](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-supporting-veterans-experiencing-financial-hardship-and-addressing-the-harmful-effects-of-military-environmental-exposures/#:~:text=VA%20will%20streamline%20the%20request%20process%20and%20set,effect%20in%20the%20next%2090%20to%20120%20days.) to
    make it easier and faster for lower-income veterans to get their VA
    medical debt forgiven, already providing relief to over 10,000
    veterans and saved them more than $10 million in copay debt.
-   The Department of Defense has proposed a rule aimed at providing
    financial relief for civilians receiving medical care at military
    medical treatment facilities (MTFs).  If finalized as proposed, this
    rule would implement fee reductions through a sliding scale discount
    program as well as catastrophic cap waivers.  Through these
    measures, the DoD aims to significantly reduce the financial burden
    on patients while maintaining high-quality care.
-   The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) [validated and
    approved](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Documents/CS-Fact-Sheet-2022.pdf) the
    use of VantageScore 4.0, along with FICO 10T, for the underwriting
    of mortgages by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, marking the first time
    that a credit score that excludes medical debt has been approved for
    mortgage underwriting of Enterprise loans.
-   The Small Business Administration (SBA) is taking steps to reduce
    the role of medical debt in the underwriting of loans for its
    flagship 7(a) guaranteed loan program, including revising its lender
    Standard Operating Procedures and Lender Match tool to discourage
    consideration of medical debt.
-   The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued
    memorandum [M-22-17](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/M-22-17.pdf) to
    direct agencies to reduce the impact of medical debt in the
    underwriting of Federal credit programs, helping to spur the actions
    by VA, FHFA, and SBA listed above.
-   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Department of
    Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of the
    Treasury [issued a joint request for
    information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/notice-opportunities-comment/archive-closed/request-for-information-on-medical-payment-products/) seeking
    comment on the prevalence, nature, and impact of medical payment
    products.
-   CMS and CFPB issued guidance clarifying protections against
    inappropriate patient billing and costs for the approximately 8
    million low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in the
    Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program. 
-   The Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury
    have prioritized implementing [surprise billing
    protections](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-new-steps-to-lower-prescription-drug-and-health-care-costs-expand-access-to-health-care-and-protect-consumers/),
    preventing 1 million surprise medical bills every single month.
-   As a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden [capped
    the cost of insulin at
    $35](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-president-bidens-cap-on-the-cost-of-insulin-could-benefit-millions-of-americans-in-all-50-states/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20announced%20they%20are%20lowering%20the%20cost,diabetes%20in%20all%20fifty%20states%20and%20U.S.%20territories.) for
    a month’s supply of each covered insulin and capped out-of-pocket
    prescription drug costs at $2,000 in 2025 for seniors and others
    with Medicare. Thanks to the $3500 cap, nearly 1.5 million Medicare
    enrollees saved nearly $1 billion on prescription drugs in just the
    first half of 2024. Since taking these actions, President Biden has
    called on Congress [to expand the cap on out-of-pocket prescription
    drug
    costs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-new-steps-to-lower-prescription-drug-and-health-care-costs-expand-access-to-health-care-and-protect-consumers/#:~:text=Expand%20Cap%20on%20Out%2Dof%2DPocket%20Prescription%20Drug%20Costs.&text=The%20President%20is%20calling%20on,putting%20food%20on%20the%20table.) to
    cover all Americans.
-   President Biden has [called on
    states](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/10/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-lowers-health-care-costs/) to
    close the Medicaid coverage gap and create new pathways to health
    coverage by expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
-   Secretary Becerra directed HHS to evaluate how providers’ billing
    practices impact access and affordability of care and the accrual of
    medical debt. HHS, CFPB, and the Treasury Department requested
    information and data on medical bill collection practices, lawsuits
    against patients, financial assistance, financial product offerings,
    and 3rd party contracting or debt buying practices. HHS, for the
    first time, considered weighing this information in their funding
    decisions.
-   The CFPB and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
    issued a joint letter affirming that nursing homes that participate
    in Medicare and Medicaid are prohibited from forcing a resident’s
    family or friends to assume responsibility for the cost of care as a
    condition of admission or continued stay in the facility.
-   HHS is collecting evidence and data to inform future actions by
    adding new questions on medical debt to Medicare Current Beneficiary
    Survey and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, two of the most
    important sources of data on health care in the United States.
-   HHS released a set of [frequently asked
    questions](https://oig.hhs.gov/faqs/general-questions-regarding-certain-fraud-and-abuse-authorities/#13-does-the-federal-anti-kickback-statute-or-the-beneficiary-inducements-cmp-prohibit-hospitals-from-waiving-their-patients-cost-sharing-amounts-pursuant-to-hospitals-financial-assistance-policies-also-known-as-charity-care-policies.) clarifying
    that hospitals have the ability to provide relief to uninsured and
    underinsured patients who cannot afford their hospital bills and to
    Medicare beneficiaries who cannot afford their Medicare cost.
-   The Biden-Harris
    Administration [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-landmark-rule-to-protect-americans-from-junk-health-insurance/#:~:text=Under%20the%20new%20rules%2C%20new%20plans%20that%20claim,they%20in%20fact%20provided%20little%20to%20no%20coverage.) a
    final rule that protects consumers from junk health insurance and
    makes sure Americans aren’t scammed into low-quality coverage that
    leaves consumers on the hook for thousands of dollars in medical
    bills.
-   CMS is [soliciting
    comment](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/10/10/2024-23103/patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-hhs-notice-of-benefit-and-payment-parameters-for-2026-and) on
    how hospital-based personnel who help consumers enroll in
    Marketplace coverage could connect consumers to hospital financial
    assistance programs designed to reduce medical debt.
-   The White House[ convened state and local
    leaders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/08/readout-of-the-white-house-state-convening-on-medical-debt/) to
    discuss initiatives to further lower health care costs and reduce
    the burden of medical debt, including addressing medical payment
    products, unfair debt collection practices, surprise billing and
    facility fees, and charity care.
