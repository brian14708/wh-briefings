President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine to discuss U.S. support for Ukraine in its
courageous defense against Russian aggression. President Biden updated
President Zelenskyy on U.S. efforts to surge support to Ukraine and
strengthen its position vis-à-vis Russia. Over the past several months,
the United States has delivered hundreds of thousands of artillery
rounds, thousands of rockets, hundreds of armored vehicles, and other
critical capabilities to Ukrainian forces as they defend their freedom
from Russian aggression. In addition, today the United States announced
a comprehensive sanctions package against the Russian energy sector,
which builds upon the unprecedented sanctions regime that the United
States has put in place against the Russian economy since 2022.
President Zelenskyy expressed his appreciation for this surge in support
and briefed President Biden on his strategic planning in the war. 

It is now clear that President Putin’s war against Ukraine has been a
disaster for Russia. Due to the Ukrainian people’s courage and resolve,
and with the support of the United States, Russia has failed to achieve
any of its strategic objectives in Ukraine. When President Putin started
this war, he thought he would capture Kyiv in a matter of days. Nearly
three years later, Kyiv is still free. Russia wanted to destroy the
Ukrainian nation. Today, Ukraine remains a free and vibrant democracy.
Russia wanted to grind down Ukraine’s army. Now, that army is stronger
and more capable than ever. And Russia wanted to break NATO. Instead,
NATO is larger, stronger, and more united than at any time in its
history. 

President Biden underscored the importance of continuing to support
Ukraine in its fight for freedom so that the Ukrainian people can secure
the just and lasting peace that they deserve.
