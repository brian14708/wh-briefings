title: Statement by Vice President Harris on the Executive Order on Advancing U.S.
  Leadership in Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure
---
 
While representing the United States at the first-ever Global Summit on
AI Safety in London, I laid out a vision for the future of artificial
intelligence (AI) — a future where AI is used to advance the public
interest. In order for that vision to be realized, it is imperative that
the United States remain the global leader on AI.  
  
The Executive Order announced today will ensure the United States
has the infrastructure — including large-scale data centers and clean
power facilities — necessary to maintain America’s competitive advantage
and safeguard our national security interests. The significant
electrical power needs of large-scale AI operations also present a new
opportunity for advancing American leadership in clean-energy
technology, which will power our future economy. By activating the full
force of the federal government to speed up and scale AI operations here
in the United States, we are securing our global leadership on AI, which
will have a profound impact on our economy, society, and national
security for generations to come.
