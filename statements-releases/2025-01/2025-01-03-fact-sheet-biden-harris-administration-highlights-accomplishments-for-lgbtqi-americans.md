title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Highlights Accomplishments for\
  \ LGBTQI+\_Americans"
---
 
President Biden and Vice President Harris have been instrumental in
remedying historical injustices and advancing equality for LGBTQI+
Americans. Today, the White House is recognizing the Biden-Harris
Administration’s historic track record as the most pro-equality
Administration in American history:

-   **Enshrining the right to marriage in Federal law**. The Respect for
    Marriage Act enshrined into law the right to Federal recognition of
    marriage for same-sex and interracial couples, repealing the Defense
    of Marriage Act. This legislation strengthened civil rights
    protections and ensured that the promise of equality is promised to
    all families. The right to marriage confers vital legal protections,
    dignity, and full participation in our society.
-   **Protecting LGBTQI+ service members and veterans**. In October
    2024, the Department of Defense (DOD) announced that it concluded
    its [proactive
    review](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3934894/dod-finishes-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge-reviews/)
    of discharge records for former Service members who had received a
    less than honorable discharge due to their sexual orientation under
    Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. As a result of DOD’s new actions, 96% of
    individuals who were administratively separated on the basis of
    their sexual orientation and who served for long enough to receive a
    merit-based characterization of service now have an honorable
    discharge. In addition, this past spring,the Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA)
    [expanded](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-rule-amending-regulations-discharge-determinations/)
    access to care and benefits for some former Service members who
    received a less than honorable discharge based on homosexual
    conduct. Furthermore, in June 2024, President Biden issued a
    categorical
    [pardon](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/26/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-pardon-of-lgbtqi-service-members-wrongly-convicted/)
    for certain former Service members convicted of crimes based on
    their sexual orientation. And in his first week in office, the
    President
    [rescinded](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/)
    the discriminatory ban on transgender Service members.
-   **Supporting community safety and security**. In June 2023, the
    President established the LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership. The
    partnership is a collaboration between the Department of Health and
    Human Services (HHS), Department of Justice, and Department of
    Homeland Security, which work hand-in-hand with LGBTQI+ community
    organizations to provide critical safety resources to ensure these
    organizations can remain safe spaces for the community. Ahead of
    Pride Month 2024, the partnership released a new
    [guide](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-LGBTQI-Resources-and-Guidance.pdf)
    of key security resources for the LGBTQI+ community and provided
    briefings on these resources throughout June.
-   **Advancing a federal blood donation policy based on science, not
    stigma**. The Food and Drug Administration announced a new
    [policy](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-finalizes-move-recommend-individual-risk-assessment-determine-eligibility-blood-donations)
    for assessing blood donor eligibility using a set of individual
    risk-based questions to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted
    HIV. The new policy ends identity-based restrictions on blood
    donation by gay and bisexual men.
-   **Signing historic Executive Orders.** Starting on Day One of his
    Administration, President Biden signed several historic Executive
    Orders to [prevent and combat discrimination on the basis of gender
    identity or sexual
    orientation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/)
    and [advance equality for LGBTQI+
    individuals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/06/15/executive-order-on-advancing-equality-for-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-individuals/).
    These Executive Orders formed the basis for dozens of executive
    actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to advance civil
    rights and improve the lives of LGBTQI+ Americans.
-   **Implementing a new National HIV/AIDS Strategy**. The White House
    Office of National AIDS Policy launched a revised National HIV/AIDS
    Strategy that sets bold new national targets to end the HIV epidemic
    and includes transgender people as a priority population for the
    first time. In September, the White House Office of National AIDS
    Policy convened the [¡Adelante!
    Summit](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/white-house-to-convene-summit-on-response-to-hiv-in-latino-communities)
    to accelerate the nation’s HIV response in Latino communities.
    Latino gay men now represent the highest number of new HIV cases in
    the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention.
-   **Appointing historic LGBTQI+ leaders**. The Biden-Harris
    Administration includes barrier-breaking LGBTQI+ leaders, including
    the first openly LGBTQI+ Cabinet Secretary, White House Press
    Secretary, and White House Communications Director, the two first
    openly transgender people to ever be confirmed by the U.S. Senate,
    and the first out lesbian to achieve the rank of Ambassador.
-   **Protecting against discrimination in health care, education,
    grantmaking, and foster care.** The Biden-Harris Administration has
    finalized several rules to offer protections to LGBTQI+ people
    against discrimination in health care, education, and other areas. 
    The HHS Office for Civil Rights published a final
    [rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/04/26/hhs-issues-new-rule-strengthen-nondiscrimination-protections-advance-civil-rights-health-care.html)
    under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act that guarantees
    critical protections to LGBTQI+ people against discrimination in
    health care. The rule protects individuals from discrimination
    regardless of the type of care they are seeking. Pursuant to
    [decisions](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html)
    by courts, some of the rule’s provisions are stayed or
    enjoined. Still, the Administration has appealed those decisions and
    continues to defend the rule. The Department of Education’s Office
    for Civil Rights released a final
    [rule](https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/civil-rights-laws/resources-for-lgbtqi-students)
    under Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex
    in education programs receiving federal funding and strengthens
    civil rights protections for all, including for LGBTQI+ students and
    staff. Pursuant to federal court orders, the final rule is enjoined
    in 26 states and certain schools. Notwithstanding those injunctions,
    the final rule is in effect in most schools in 24 states, the
    District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The HHS Office for Civil
    Rights published a final
    [rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/04/30/hhs-issues-final-rule-prevent-discrimination-health-and-human-services-grant.html)
    affirming non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity and
    sexual orientation in HHS-funded programs. This protects against
    discrimination in programs such as Head Start, Family Violence
    Prevention and Services Act grant programs, and the Substance Use
    Prevention, Treatment and Recovery Services Block Grant, consistent
    with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in *Bostock v. Clayton
    County*.

-   **Strengthening mental health resources and protections for LGBTQI+
    youth.** To address the disproportionate mental health challenges
    facing LGBTQI+ youth, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration added dedicated crisis counseling services for
    LGBTQI+ youth and young adults to 988, the National Suicide & Crisis
    Lifeline. In addition, HHS released a final
    [rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/04/29/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-rule-strengthen-protections-youth-child-welfare-system.html)
    that strengthens protections for LGBTQI+ youth in foster care, who
    are some of the most vulnerable children in the country, which is
    expected to protect tens of thousands of LGBTQI+ children in foster
    care each year.
-   **New clinical guidelines to prevent STIs**. The Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention issued
    [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/rr/rr7302a1.htm) for
    a post-exposure prophylaxis strategy that significantly reduces the
    risk of bacterial sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs),
    particularly among gay and bisexual men and transgender women,
    marking a critical step forward in STI prevention efforts and
    strengthening the nation’s sexual health response.
-   **Addressing book bans**. The Department of Education’s Office for
    Civil Rights appointed a Coordinator to advance public understanding
    of the civil rights and other impacts of book restrictions. The
    Coordinator leads community-based trainings on the civil rights laws
    enforced by the Office for Civil Rights. In a [blog
    post](https://blog.ed.gov/2024/07/book-bans-are-not-just-bad-policy-they-can-raise-civil-rights-issues/),
    the Coordinator discussed how book bans, which disproportionately
    target works written by or about members of the LGBTQI+ community
    and people of color, may create a hostile school environment and
    implicate federal civil rights laws.
-   **Historic engagements with the LGBTQI+ community.** In September,
    President Biden became the first sitting President to sit down with
    an LGBTQI+ newspaper, The Washington Blade.

-   **Promoting human rights for LGBTQI+ people globally.** The [Special
    Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+
    Persons](https://www.state.gov/biographies/jessica-stern/) is
    driving rapid response to proposed anti-LGBTQI+ legislation around
    the world. With the encouragement of the United States, a growing
    number of nations have decriminalized same-sex conduct, and
    together, we are working to hold accountable perpetrators of
    discrimination and abuse. For example, as
    [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/29/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-enactment-of-ugandas-anti-homosexuality-act/)
    by President Biden, departments and agencies took
    [steps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/11/fact-sheet-the-united-states-response-to-ugandas-anti-homosexuality-act-and-persistent-human-rights-abuses/)
    to encourage the repeal of Uganda’s anti-homosexuality act.
