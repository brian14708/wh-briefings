title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Continues to Support Life-Saving\
  \ Wildfire Response Efforts in\_California"

*Over the last 24 hours, U.S. Forest Service personnel have suppressed
50 fire starts*

Under President Biden’s leadership, the Biden-Harris Administration is
continuing to support life-saving and life-sustaining response efforts
for the wildfires impacting Los Angeles, California. President Biden
continues to be regularly briefed by his team, including this morning by
Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall. **Today, President Biden
will convene senior White House and Administration officials for a
briefing on the full Federal response he has directed to the
wildfires.** The situation remains extremely dangerous, and the
Administration continues to urge residents to heed the warnings of local
officials and evacuate immediately if told to do so.  
   
This morning, in response to the significant outlay of personnel and
equipment in support of fire suppression efforts, the National
Preparedness Level was raised to prioritize additional suppression
resources, including wildland fire crews and other personnel, engines,
helicopters, airtankers and other aircraft, and other specialized heavy
equipment, such as bull dozers to build fire lines.  
   
**Over the last 24 hours, U.S. Forest Service personnel have suppressed
50 fire starts in California.** Additionally, the Hollywood Fire has
been suppressed, and the evacuation order has been lifted. Additional
containment progress is being made on other active fires. CalFire is
actively working to supply generators to power water pumps throughout
the area to ensure sufficient water to support suppression efforts.  
   
Yesterday, President Biden approved a Major Disaster declaration for
California, allowing impacted communities and survivors to immediately
access funds and resources to get through the coming days and begin to
recover from the devastation. The Administration is in regular contact
with state and local officials, including Governor Newsom, Mayor Bass,
their teams, and other state and local officials throughout the impacted
areas.  
   
Consistent with the President’s direction for a robust and
well-coordinated Federal response, the Administration is continuing to
support ongoing response efforts, including:  
   
**<u>Federal Personnel and Resources</u>**  
   
**At the President’s Direction, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell is in Los Angeles today to meet
with state and local officials and firefighting personnel to assess
immediate and anticipated needs.** FEMA has a team embedded at the
California State Emergency Operations Center to provide hands-on
assistance to the ongoing response efforts. FEMA, in partnership with
the Department of Defense, has also established a staging area at March
Air Force Base to help pre-position supplies and equipment to meet
immediate needs.  Over the coming days, FEMA will develop options to
support lodging for people who have been displaced and cannot return to
their homes. FEMA has an Incident Management Assistance Team and a
Mobile Emergency Response Support team deploying to Los Angeles County
today with additional teams at the ready.  
   
**<u>Mobilizing Fire Suppression Assets</u>**  
   
The Federal government is continuing to support local firefighting
efforts with three additional CL-415 aerial firefighting aircraft and
nine additional helicopters. These supplement the five tankers and 10
firefighting helicopters already in place through the National
Interagency Fire Center. The Federal government is also coordinating
with the Canadian Interagency Fire Center, which will provide additional
two CL-415s from Quebec, Canada, that are expected to move into Southern
California on Monday. The State of Colorado mobilized their
multi-mission fixed wing aircraft to Southern California yesterday to
assist with wildfire detection and provide real-time updates to
firefighters on the ground in addition to fielding 50 engine companies
to assist with firefighting efforts on the ground.  Additionally, the
Department of Defense is providing infrared imaging for perimeter
mapping of the fires, and at the President’s direction has activated all
eight of its Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems to further support
suppression efforts. The first two of those specially equipped aircrafts
will be in the air today.
