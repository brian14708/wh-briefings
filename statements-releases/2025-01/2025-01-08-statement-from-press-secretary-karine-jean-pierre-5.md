After returning this evening from Los Angeles, where earlier today he
had met with police, fire and emergency personnel fighting the historic
fires raging in the area and approved a Major Disaster declaration for
California, President Biden made the decision to cancel his upcoming
trip to Italy to remain focused on directing the full federal response
in the days ahead. Additional details to follow.
