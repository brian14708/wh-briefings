title: "FACT SHEET: The United\_States and India Committed to Strengthening Strategic\
  \ Technology\_Partnership"
---
 
Today, U.S. National Security Advisor (APNSA) Jake Sullivan met with
Indian National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, Indian External
Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, and Prime Minister Modi in New Delhi as
the United States and India continue to forge a strategic technology
partnership that benefits both of our countries and our partners around
the world.  APNSA Sullivan and NSA Doval launched the U.S.-India
initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) in 2022 at the
direction of President Biden and Prime Minister Modi.  In the
intervening years, our two nations have taken significant steps forward
together to integrate our technology and defense supply chains in
recognition that, now more than ever, we need to work with our partners
to build a trusted and resilient innovation base.  
  
During their capstone meeting, APNSA Sullivan and NSA Doval underscored
the vital importance of our efforts to jointly produce and develop
strategic technologies that will allow us to deliver secure, reliable,
and cost-competitive technology solutions for the world. As the United
States and India deepen collaboration across key sectors – from space to
semiconductors, biotechnology, cybersecurity, advanced
telecommunications, and clean energy – we have seen the promise of our
partnership deliver results.  Our partnership has also anchored
multilateral work with like-minded nations from across the Indo-Pacific
and Europe, including the [Bio-5 Biopharmaceutical Supply Chain
Consortium](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/06/25/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administrations-actions-to-advance-american-biotechnology-and-biomanufacturing/),
the U.S.-India-ROK Technology Trilateral, and ongoing cooperation with
Australia and Japan through the Quad.  
  
Finally, APNSA Sullivan and NSA Doval reaffirmed our shared resolve to
adapt and strengthen our technology protection toolkits and discussed
efforts to address national security concerns associated with
overcapacity in key technology sectors.  At the same time, they
commended the progress we have made to address long-standing barriers to
bilateral strategic trade, technology, and industrial cooperation.  
  
The two national security leaders expressed their confidence that the
bridges we have built across our governments, industry, and academia
will endure and reflected on the significant achievements we have driven
across every dimension of the technological enterprise – from the seabed
to the stars, and beyond.  This includes:
