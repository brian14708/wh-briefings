title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025\
  \ Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable Care\_Act"
---
 
*President Biden announces nearly 24 million consumers have signed up
for Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage, nearly doubling enrollment
during the last 4 years*

President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that health care is a
right, not a privilege. Since day one of their Administration, they have
taken steps to ensure that every American has access to affordable,
quality health care. And, as a result of these efforts, **the
Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that it has set another
all-time record for ACA Marketplace enrollment, with nearly 24 million
Americans signing up for coverage with one week left in the 2025 Open
Enrollment Period. A total of 45 million Americans have coverage through
the ACA – either the Marketplace or Medicaid expansion – and <u>more
people have health insurance today than ever in our nation’s
history.</u>**

*Statement from the President:* “Today, we have once again set a record
when it comes to ensuring access to affordable, quality health care:
nearly 24 million Americans have signed up for Affordable Care Act
coverage. That means that enrollment has nearly doubled since I took
office. That’s no coincidence. When I took office, I made a promise to
the American people that I would bring down the cost of health care and
prescription drugs, make signing up for coverage easier, and strengthen
the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid. I’m proud that my
Administration delivered – even as Republican elected officials, who
have been eager to put millions of Americans’ coverage at risk, stood in
the way. I urge Congress to double down on the progress we have made and
ensure Americans have access to quality, affordable health care by
extending the ACA premium tax credit this year.”

Today’s announcement builds upon a remarkable record of success over the
last four years. More Americans have health insurance than ever before,
with the uninsured rate at record lows. In fact, in every year of the
Biden-Harris Administration, we have set a new all-time record for ACA
Marketplace enrollment.

This record-breaking enrollment is no accident, and due to this
Administration’s efforts to lower health care costs and make it easier
to sign up for coverage. We also made health care more affordable for
Americans purchasing their health insurance on the ACA Marketplace,
saving consumers an average of **$800 annually on their premiums**. For
example, this Administration made the largest ever investment in
outreach and enrollment assistance, especially those in rural or
underserved communities while at the same time eliminating bureaucratic
red tape that makes it harder for people to enroll in coverage.

But all of these efforts to lower health care costs and expand coverage
are now in danger. If Republicans in Congress take away the enhanced
premium tax credits that make ACA coverage more affordable, premiums
will skyrocket and people will lose coverage. For many families the
results will be catastrophic:

-   A **single parent** earing $50,00 per year could see their premiums
    **increase by $1600 per year**.
-   A **retired couple** earning $85,000 per year could see their
    premiums increase **by $18,000 per year**.
-   Experts estimate that **3 to 5 million people would become
    uninsured**. 

The Affordable Care Act Marketplaces are just one part of this
Administration’s commitment to health care coverage. Today, Medicaid
covers about **80 million** people. Thanks to the President’s
leadership, over one million Americans in four states now have Medicaid
expansion coverage, driving total ACA-related enrollment to **over 45
million.** This Administration has also cut red tape to make applying
for and renewing Medicaid coverage easier, and established new standards
to ensure people have access to the care they need when they need it.

In addition to today’s record-breaking enrollment numbers, we are also
releasing [a

and [a data
chart](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CHARTPACK-health-care-report_all-chapters_FINAL.pdf)
pack detailing the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic progress to
improve the health of millions of Americans– from making health care and
prescription drugs more affordable, to tackling crises in mental health,
maternal health, and more, and investing in public health
infrastructure. Some highlights include:

-   In its first year alone, President Biden’s Medicare Drug Price
    Negotiation program outperformed expectations, achieving negotiated
    prices that are **38 to 79 percent lower** than U.S. list prices for
    the ten first round negotiated drugs. These prices are **$6
    billion** per year lower than what Medicare pays today and, once in
    effect, will put **$1.5 billion** dollars back into the pockets of
    Medicare beneficiaries. Seniors with Medicare are protected by the
    new $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs, and insulin is capped at just
    $35 per month.

<!-- -->

-   The Administration ended the “family glitch,” making **millions of
    family members finally eligible** for affordable ACA Marketplace
    coverage with about one million people projected to either gain
    coverage or have lower premiums.

<!-- -->

-   The 988 lifeline, created under this Administration, has answered
    more than **11 million calls, chats, and texts** and made it easier
    for individuals experiencing distress to access immediate care.

<!-- -->

-   Following the Administration’s efforts to reduce overdose deaths,
    recent data shows **a 17% reduction in overdose deaths** in the 12
    months ending July 2024 compared to the prior year—the largest
    decline in U.S. history.

<!-- -->

-   After the release of a comprehensive strategy to improve maternal
    health, **46 states and DC extended Medicaid postpartum coverage**
    from two to twelve months for hundreds of thousands of new
    mothers**.**

<!-- -->

-   Following the launch of a comprehensive national strategy to end the
    HIV epidemic by the end of the decade, **rates of new HIV infections
    are also down**.
