*In addition, federal agencies awarded a record $183 billion in federal
contracting opportunities to small businesses and $78billion to small
disadvantaged businesses in 2024.* ** **

Since President Biden and Vice President Harris took office, American
entrepreneurs have filed a record 21 million new business applications.
The Biden-Harris Administration has overseen for the fastest rate new
business applications on record with entrepreneurs filing an average of
over 440,000 applications every month, a rate over 90% faster than
pre-pandemic averages. This historic wave of entrepreneurships is
happening in communities across the country—with the most new business
applications in any Presidential administration on record.

Further, federal agencies made record awards to small businesses and
small disadvantaged businesses in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024. The federal
government is the world’s largest purchaser of goods and services,
giving it a critical role in creating opportunities for entrepreneurs.
In FY24, federal agencies awarded a record $183 billion in federal
contracts to small businesses—representing 28.78% of all eligible
federal contracting dollars. These federal contract awards enable small
business growth, supporting more than one million jobs in manufacturing,
construction, defense, and other core industries. Federal agencies also
awarded a record $78 billion to small disadvantaged businesses.

Small business are the engines of our economy and the heart and soul of
our communities. They powered our economic recovery and make our economy
the strongest in the world. They account for more than 40 percent of
GDP, create around two-thirds of new jobs, and employ nearly half of all
private sector workers. The Biden-Harris Administration has stood firmly
behind small businesses, powering the small business boom by:

-   **Oversaw historic increases in business ownership and new business
    creation among underserved communities.** Business ownership has
    doubled among Black households and hit a 30-year high for Hispanic
    households; new business creation rates hit a 30-year high for Asian
    Americans; and women own a higher share of businesses than before
    the pandemic.
-   **Supporting small business through the COVID-19 pandemic.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration made significant investments to keep
    small business afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Small
    Business Administration (SBA) provided over $450 billion in total
    emergency relief to more than 6 million small businesses.  The
    Biden-Harris Administration made reforms to the Paycheck Protection
    Program that, compared to the first rounds of the program under the
    previous Administration, [increased loans to small businesses in low
    to moderate income communities by 67%, rural small businesses by
    40%, and businesses with less than 20 employees by
    35%.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/President-Biden-Small-Biz-Boom-full-report-2022.04.28.pdf)
     Further, through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, the SBA
    provided more than 100,000 restaurants, bars, and other eligible
    small businesses a total of over $28 billion, including $18 billion
    to underserved restaurant owners. Finally, the American Rescue
    Plan’s State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund enabled states and
    localities to support small business through the pandemic with $5
    billion in these funds supporting small business assistance
    programs.
-   **Backing record levels of lending through the Small Business
    Administration.** In FY2024, [the SBA backed an historic $56 billion
    in
    capital](https://www.sba.gov/article/2024/10/24/new-report-reveals-historic-surge-small-business-financing-under-biden-harris-administration) to
    small businesses and disaster impacted communities, providing over
    100,000 financings in the forms of loans, investments, and surety
    bond guarantees to small businesses. The SBA tripled its lending to
    Black-owned business, doubled lending to Latino-owned and
    women-owned small businesses, and significantly increased lending to
    businesses owned by Native, Veteran, and rural entrepreneurs
    compared to FY20. The SBA also prioritized increasing access to
    small dollar loans, doubling the number of loans under $150,000.
-   **Investing in small businesses by funding hands-on assistance to
    help entrepreneurs successfully access capital and grow and scale
    their businesses.** Federal agencies provided extensive hands-on
    support to ensure small businesses could fully benefit from federal
    programs and access broader markets. Building on established SBA
    programs—offered through Regional Field Offices, Small Business
    Development Centers, Veteran’s Business Outreach Centers, Women’s
    Business Centers, and SCORE mentoring—the American Rescue Plan made
    the largest-ever federal investment in small business navigator
    services through the Small Business Community Navigators Pilot
    Program. This initiative provided training to over 350,000
    entrepreneurs and one-on-one counseling to more than 33,000 small
    business owners. Additionally, the plan included the largest federal
    investment in small business incubators and accelerators via the
    Minority Business Development Agency’s Capital Readiness Program.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law built on this success by making
    the MBDA permanent and expanding the agency, allowing MBDA to
    increase their programs and outreach to underserved businesses.
    Through Treasury’s SSBCI technical assistance grants and Small
    Business Opportunity Program awards, the Federal government is
    partnering with local and non-profit organizations to ensure
    entrepreneurs receive the support they need, no matter where they
    live.
-   **Lowering costs for small businesses through the Inflation
    Reduction Act (IRA).** The IRA saved small business owners money in
    a number of areas. The IRA allowed small businesses to deduct up to
    $1.00 per square foot of their business for making high energy
    efficiency upgrades, created a tax credit to cover 30% of the cost
    of switching to solar power, and lowered health care costs that
    burden small business owner’s budgets by capping the cost of insulin
    for seniors at $35 a month and the cost f out-of-pocket prescription
    drugs costs for seniors at $2,000 , and preserving the American
    Rescue Plan’s premium tax credit supports for the Affordable Care
    Act—saving millions of small business owners and self-employed
    workers an average of $700 per year on their health insurance
    premiums.
-   **Expanding access to capital across the country through the State
    Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). **Through SSBCI, the
    American Rescue Plan is providing nearly $10 billion to support
    small business loan and venture capital programs run by states,
    territories, and Tribal governments. By the end of 2023, SSBCI
    funding had already spurred $3.1 billion in public and private
    financing for small businesses, including $1.2 billion in venture
    capital financing. The program is expected to assist up to 200
    investment funds throughout its duration. SSBCI places a strong
    emphasis on underserved and very small businesses; as of December
    2023, 75% of supported transactions benefited underserved
    businesses, while 78% supported businesses with fewer than 10
    employees.
-   **Expanded and reformed the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)
    program to expand access to equity capital.**  SBICs are
    SBA-licensed privately managed investment funds that make debt and
    equity investments in small businesses using SBA-guaranteed funds.
     Over the course of the Biden-Harris Administration, SBICs deployed
    over $30 billion in financing to more than 3,100 U.S. small
    businesses and startups, with more than 28 percent of SBIC
    financings going to underserved small businesses, including
    women-owned, minority-owned, and veteran-owned small businesses and
    small businesses located in low median income areas (LMIs). 
    Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration expanded the SBIC
    program to include new types of licenses tailored to align with long
    duration equity investment in earlier stage and capital-intensive
    industries or enable a fund of funds model to invest equity in new
    and emerging funds – particularly funds serving underserved small
    businesses and startups.  Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the
    number of jobs supported by underserved small businesses financed by
    SBICs are estimated to have increased by 75 percent to 350,000
    between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2023.
