title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Approving Student Debt Cancellation\
  \ for Over 5 Million\_Americans"
---
 
Today, my Administration is approving student loan relief for more than
150,000 borrowers – bringing the total number of Americans who have had
their student debt cancelled by my Administration to over 5
million. These 150,000 borrowers include: almost 85,000 borrowers who
attended schools that cheated and defrauded their students, 61,000
borrowers with total and permanent disabilities, and 6,100 public
service workers. 

My Administration has taken historic action to reduce the burden of
student debt, hold bad actors accountable, and fight on behalf of
students across the country. This includes fixing the broken Public
Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and ensuring over 1 million
public service workers receive the student loan relief they are entitled
to under the law, approving student loan relief for 1.7 million
borrowers who were cheated and defrauded by their schools, delivering
student debt relief to 633,000 borrowers with total and permanent
disabilities, and fixing administrative errors in the Income-Driven
Repayment programs to deliver relief to over 1.4 million borrowers who
have been in repayment for decades. My Administration also secured the
largest increase to the maximum Pell Grant award in a decade to put
higher-education in reach for more Americans.

Since Day One of my Administration, I promised to ensure
higher-education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to
opportunity, and I’m proud to say we have forgiven more student loan
debt than any other administration in history.
