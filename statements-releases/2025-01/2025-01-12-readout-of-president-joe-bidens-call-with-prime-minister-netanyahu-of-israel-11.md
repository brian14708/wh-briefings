President Biden spoke today with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel. The
two leaders discussed the ongoing negotiations in Doha for a ceasefire
and hostage release deal based on the May 27, 2024 arrangement described
by the President last year and endorsed unanimously by the UN Security
Council. The President discussed the fundamentally changed regional
circumstances following the ceasefire deal in Lebanon, the fall of the
Assad regime in Syria, and the weakening of Iran’s power in the region.
He stressed the immediate need for a ceasefire in Gaza and return of the
hostages with a surge in humanitarian aid enabled by a stoppage in the
fighting under the deal. The Prime Minister thanked the President for
his lifelong support of Israel and for the extraordinary support from
the United States for Israel’s security and national defense.
