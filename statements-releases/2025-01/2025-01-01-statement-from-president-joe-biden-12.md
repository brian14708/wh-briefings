title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden"

I have been continually briefed since early this morning by federal law
enforcement leadership and my homeland security team, including
Secretary of Homeland Security Ali Mayorkas, Deputy Attorney General
Lisa Monaco, White House Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall,
and the Mayor of New Orleans regarding the horrific incident that
occurred there overnight. The FBI is taking the lead in the
investigation and is investigating this incident as an act of
terrorism. I am grateful for the brave and swift response of local law
enforcement in preventing even greater death and injury. I have directed
my team to ensure every resource is available as federal, state, and
local law enforcement work assiduously to get to the bottom of what
happened as quickly as possible and to ensure that there is no remaining
threat of any kind. 

I will continue to receive updates throughout the day, and I will have
more to say as we have further information to share. In the meantime, my
heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying
to celebrate the holiday. There is no justification for violence of any
kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s
communities.
