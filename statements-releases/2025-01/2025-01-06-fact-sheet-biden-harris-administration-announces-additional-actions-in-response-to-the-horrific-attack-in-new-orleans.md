title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Additional Actions\
  \ in Response to the Horrific Attack in New\_Orleans"
---
 
Since the horrific attack conducted by a homegrown violent extremist
inspired by ISIS took place in New Orleans on January 1, President Biden
has directed his team to provide every possible resource to support the
state and local response, as well as the victims and their families. The
President and members of the Administration have been in contact with
the Governor of Louisiana, the Mayor of New Orleans, and other state and
local officials to ensure they have the resources and support they need
in the wake of this attack.

**<u>Today, the President is committing additional federal resources to
help the city of New Orleans prepare for upcoming major events including
Mardi Gras and the Super Bowl.</u>**

-   The Mardi Gras parades and certain related events occurring in New
    Orleans from February 21 to March 4 have been upgraded to a Special
    Event Assessment Rating of 1 (SEAR 1). Super Bowl LIX is also a SEAR
    1 event. The Biden-Harris Administration has determined that these
    significant events require extensive federal interagency support,
    and will use every tool available to fill local capability
    shortfalls to assure safe and secure events.
-   The federal government provides a federal coordination team and
    specialized assistance for all SEAR 1 events. Federal assistance
    could include explosive detection canine teams, cyber risk
    assessments, venue screening and field intelligence teams, and air
    security and tactical operations support in addition to the support
    already provided by state and local governments. More information on
    SEAR events is available
    [here](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=3b92f0014f5ec11cbbeff18adb1adc18bbf39c941ba609074957e95244597e92JmltdHM9MTczNjEyMTYwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=20d21695-129b-6a4a-0fe8-03f013026b36&psq=dhs+sear+rating&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGhzLmdvdi9wdWJsaWNhdGlvbi9zcGVjaWFsLWV2ZW50LWFzc2Vzc21lbnQtcmF0aW5nLXNlYXItZXZlbnRzLWZhY3Qtc2hlZXQ&ntb=1).

**<u>Since January 1, under the Biden-Harris Administration’s
leadership, the federal government has driven actions to investigate the
attack and provide resources to the victims, their families, and the New
Orleans community.</u>**

-   The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Justice,
    Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Defense are
    coordinating on all aspects of the investigation.
-   The FBI is operating a command post in its New Orleans office that
    includes federal personnel as well as state and local authorities.
-   The FBI has deployed additional special agents, analysts, and bomb
    technicians to assist in the investigation and liaise with local
    authorities. 
-   The FBI’s Victim Services Division has engaged the FBI Language
    Services Section (LSS) to provide interpretation services in French,
    Spanish, Portuguese, and Vietnamese, as needed.
-   On January 3, the[U.S. Small Business
    Administration](http://www.sba.gov/disaster) announced that small
    businesses and private nonprofit organizations in Louisiana may now
    apply for federal disaster loans to offset economic losses caused by
    this attack.
-   On January 5, the FBI opened a Family Assistance Center at St.
    Martin De Porres Catholic Church in New Orleans where Victims
    Services Officers are providing assistance to survivors, the family
    members of those deceased, and other members of the community
    impacted by the tragedy. This assistance includes lodging
    assistance, creditor/financial assistance, crisis intervention, and
    the provision of on-site mental health services, and other programs
    to support healing and recovery.
