  \ Urrutia of\_Venezuela"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. welcomed President-elect Edmundo Gonzalez
Urrutia of Venezuela to the White House to discuss shared efforts to
restore democracy in Venezuela.  President Biden emphasized that the
world was inspired by the millions of Venezuelans who courageously voted
for democratic change in Venezuela’s deeply flawed July 28 presidential
election, as demonstrated through the collection of voting tally sheets
that indicated that Gonzalez Urrutia received the most votes by an
insurmountable margin.  Both leaders agreed there is nothing more
essential to the success of democracy than respecting the will of the
people, as expressed through a transparent and accountable electoral
process, and that Gonzalez Urrutia’s campaign victory should be honored
through a peaceful transfer back to democratic rule.  Both leaders also
expressed deep concern regarding Nicolas Maduro and his representatives’
unacceptable and indiscriminate use of repression against peaceful
protestors, democracy activists, and civil society.  President Biden
noted he would be following the planned January 9 protests in Venezuela
closely and emphasized Venezuelans should be allowed to express their
political opinions peacefully without fear of reprisal from the military
and police.  President Biden reiterated his support for Venezuela’s
democratic aspirations and underscored the U.S. commitment to continue
to hold Maduro and his representatives accountable for their
anti-democratic and repressive actions, including by working closely
with democratic allies in the hemisphere and around the world.
