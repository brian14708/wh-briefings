title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Supporting Robust Response Efforts\
  \ to California\_Wildfires"
---
 
Under President Biden’s leadership, the Biden-Harris Administration is
taking significant actions to support state and local response efforts
for the wildfires in Los Angeles, California. As the fires continue to
devastate communities, President Biden is focused on mobilizing
life-saving and life-sustaining resources across the region.

The President is closely monitoring ongoing response efforts and is
receiving regular briefings, including today from his team and from
CalFire and local officials at a Santa Monica fire station. At the
President’s direction, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
Administrator Deanne Criswell is also traveling to California on Friday
to assess on-the-ground community needs like additional sheltering
options and damage assessments.  

**Today, President Biden has approved a Major Disaster declaration for
California, allowing impacted communities and survivors to immediately
access funds and resources to jumpstart their recovery. Additionally,
FEMA has approved Fire Management Assistance Grants to reimburse
California for firefighting costs last night.**

The Biden-Harris Administration has been in constant communication with
California Governor Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, their
teams, officials from affected counties, and other local officials from
the day the fires started. Additionally, the National Interagency Fire
Center is in continuous contact with CalFire and is ready to deploy any
additional resources that are needed – including additional firefighting
personnel and equipment. 

President Biden and Vice President Harris are praying for those who lost
loved ones, had property damaged, were injured, and for everyone
affected by this and other devastating fires in the area. The situation
remains extremely dangerous, and the Administration continues to urge
residents to heed the warnings of local officials and evacuate
immediately if told to do so.

Consistent with the President’s direction for a robust and
well-coordinated federal response, the Administration has taken swift
action to support preparedness and response efforts. Specific actions
taken to date include:

Mobilizing Fire Suppression Assets

The Federal government has taken action to support local firefighting
efforts through the provision of five U.S. Forest Service Large Air
Tankers operating in Southern California and 10 Federal firefighting
helicopters performing firefighting operations in the area in support of
state and local firefighters. In addition, the U.S. Forest Service has
prepositioned dozens of fire engines that are ready to be deployed as
needed. 

President Biden has directed the Department of Defense to rapidly
provide additional firefighting personnel and capabilities. The Federal
government is working closely with the National Guard, which is deployed
under the Governor’s state of emergency declaration. The California
National Guard is adding two Modular Air Firefighting System units, and
two more are being readied by the Nevada National Guard. The Department
of Defense Northern Command is preparing four more. Additionally, the
Department is sending ten Navy helicopters with water delivery buckets
are being sent to the region immediately to assist with aerial
suppression.

Providing Essential Data, Resources, and Support

-   The National Weather Service (NWS) has provided constant weather
    forecasting support and updated watches and warnings based on
    changing conditions. NWS began messaging the potential for a
    significant wind event a week in advance of the current wind storm.
    Regular email briefings and webinars were conducted by the NWS Los
    Angeles and San Diego Forecast Offices. NWS has collocated support
    to the Los Angeles County emergency operations center, and a local
    NWS Incident Meteorologist is being deployed to the Palisades Fire
    to work directly with the Incident Management Team to assist
    firefighters with planning to conduct their fire suppression efforts
    under extremely hard conditions. Both the NWS Los Angeles and San
    Diego Forecast Offices continue to support their communities with
    updated briefings and media interviews.
-   The Environmental Protection Agency stands ready to provide
    resources for air quality assessments and other support as needed.
