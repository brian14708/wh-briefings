title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Women\u2019s Suffrage National\
  \ Monument Location\_Act"
---
 
Yesterday, I was proud to sign into law the Women’s Suffrage National
Monument Location Act, authorizing the placement of a monument honoring
the women’s suffrage movement on the National Mall. In addition to
commemorating the ratification of the 19th Amendment, the Women’s
Suffrage National Monument will recognize the generations of women who
fought to ensure an equal voice for women in our democracy and honor the
leaders who fought for the enfranchisement of all women long after the
19th Amendment was ratified. Vice President Harris and I are committed
to defending equal rights for all Americans, to strengthening the
federal government’s recognition of women’s contributions to our
nation’s history, and to inspiring the next generation to create a more
equal future for all.
