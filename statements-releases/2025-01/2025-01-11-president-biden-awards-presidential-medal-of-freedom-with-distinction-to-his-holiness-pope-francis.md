Today, President Biden spoke with His Holiness Pope Francis and named
him as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom with
Distinction. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the Nation’s highest
civilian honor, presented to individuals who have made exemplary
contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United
States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private
endeavors. This is the first time that President Biden has awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction.

As a young man, Jorge Bergoglio sought a career in science before faith
led him to a life with the Jesuits. For decades, he served the voiceless
and vulnerable across Argentina. As Pope Francis, his mission of serving
the poor has never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers
children’s questions about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to
fight for peace and protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches
out to different faiths. The first pope from the Southern Hemisphere,
Pope Francis is unlike any who came before. Above all, he is the
People’s Pope – a light of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly
across the world.
