President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Prime Minister
Ishiba Shigeru of Japan and President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. of the
Philippines to advance our continuing cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.
 This meeting follows the historic trilateral summit hosted at the White
House in April 2024. Together the three Leaders discussed trilateral
maritime security and economic cooperation, as well as the People’s
Republic of China’s dangerous and unlawful behavior in the South China
Sea. The three Leaders agreed on the importance of continued
coordination to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific.
