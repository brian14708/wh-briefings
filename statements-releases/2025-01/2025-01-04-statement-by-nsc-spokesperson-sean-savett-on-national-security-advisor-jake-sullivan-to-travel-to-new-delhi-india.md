National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will travel to New Delhi, India
on January 5-6 for a capstone meeting with Indian National Security
Advisor Ajit Doval that will span a range of issues across the breadth
of the U.S.-India partnership – from space, defense, and strategic
technology cooperation to shared security priorities in the Indo-Pacific
and beyond.  During his visit, Mr. Sullivan will meet with External
Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and other Indian leaders. He will also
visit the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, where he will meet with
young Indian entrepreneurs and give a speech outlining the significant
steps the United States and India have taken together to strengthen our
innovation alliance under the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and
Emerging Technology (iCET).
