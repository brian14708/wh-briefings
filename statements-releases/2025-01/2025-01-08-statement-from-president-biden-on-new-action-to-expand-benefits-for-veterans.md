title: "Statement from President\_Biden on New Action to Expand Benefits for\_Veterans"
---
 
As a nation, there is no more sacred obligation than properly preparing
those we send into harm’s way and taking care of them and their families
when they come home. This is especially critical when we know that many
who return home experience long-term health problems related to their
service. That’s why, as President, I have made supporting veterans,
their families, caregivers, and survivors a key priority and central to
my Unity Agenda for the Nation.

Among my key priorities for supporting veterans has been addressing the
harmful toxic exposures that are too often associated with military
service. Agent Orange, radiation, burn pits, and other hazards create
devastating consequences for those exposed. When I signed the PACT Act
into law in 2022, I enacted the most significant expansion of benefits
and services for toxic-exposed veterans in more than thirty years. This
law has been transformational and has enabled VA to serve more veterans,
more quickly than ever before. And I’ve directed my Administration to
accelerate all aspects of implementing the law, including using new PACT
Act authorities to make sure that more conditions could be recognized as
presumptive – lowering the burden of proof for veterans to receive
disability benefits related to toxic illnesses, including cancer.

Today, I’m proud that VA is adding more cancers to the list of those
presumed related to burn pit exposure. This includes bladder cancer,
ureter cancer, other genitourinary cancers, acute and chronic leukemias,
and multiple myeloma. Veterans with these conditions, as well as
survivors of veterans who passed away due to these conditions, can
immediately apply for benefits. I encourage them to do so.

These actions build upon other recent announcements to expand
eligibility for GI Bill benefits, lower health care costs for veterans,
and increase resources to help eliminate veteran homelessness – bringing
Veteran homelessness to a record low in 2024. It has been the honor of a
lifetime to serve as Commander-in-Chief and to support and care for our
service members, veterans, and their families.
