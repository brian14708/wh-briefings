As Orthodox Christians around the world celebrate Christmas, Jill and I
send our warmest greetings for a day of joy and reflection. We join
Orthodox Christians in giving thanks for the miraculous birth of Jesus
Christ and the hope and love He brought to our world.

Today, we pray for Orthodox Christians who are suffering around the
world due to war, conflict, deprivation, and oppression. They, like all
human beings, are created in the image of God, and deserve safety and
security, dignity and respect. We will continue to advocate for these
core principles, including religious freedom, and on this day, we keep
these communities close to our hearts.

Scripture reminds us: “The light shines in the darkness, and the
darkness has not overcome it.” Orthodox Christians help bring hope and
healing to countless communities here at home and around the world. We
are deeply grateful for their contributions, and join our fellow
Christians in prayers for peace and justice for all God’s children in
the year ahead.
