title: "FACT SHEET: Ensuring U.S. Security and Economic Strength in the Age of Artificial\_\
  Intelligence"
---
 
Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming central to both security and
economic strength. The United States must act decisively to lead this
transition by ensuring that U.S. technology undergirds global AI use and
that adversaries cannot easily abuse advanced AI. In the wrong hands,
powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant
national security risks, including by enabling the development of
weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber
operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance.
Today, countries of concern actively employ AI – including U.S.-made AI
– in this way, and seek to undermine U.S. AI leadership.  
   
To enhance U.S. national security and economic strength, it is essential
that we do not offshore this critical technology and that the world’s AI
runs on American rails. It is important to work with AI companies and
foreign governments to put in place critical security and trust
standards as they build out their AI ecosystems.  
   
To strengthen U.S. security and economic strength, the Biden-Harris
Administration today is releasing an Interim Final Rule on Artificial
Intelligence Diffusion. It streamlines licensing hurdles for both large
and small chip orders, bolsters U.S. AI leadership, and provides clarity
to allied and partner nations about how they can benefit from AI. It
builds on previous chip controls by thwarting smuggling, closing other
loopholes, and raising AI security standards.  
   
Six key mechanisms in the rule catalyze the responsible diffusion of
U.S. technology:   
 

-   **No restrictions apply to chip sales to 18 key allies and
    partners**. This flexibility enables jurisdictions with robust
    technology protection regimes and technology ecosystems aligned with
    the national security and foreign policy interests of the United
    States to benefit from seamless large-scale purchases.  
-   **Chip orders with collective computation power up to roughly 1,700
    advanced GPUs do not require a license and do not count against
    national chip caps.** The overwhelming majority of chip orders are
    in this category, especially those being placed by universities,
    medical institutions, and research organizations for clearly
    innocuous purposes. Streamlined processing of these orders
    represents an improvement over the status quo, rapidly accelerating
    low-risk shipments of U.S. technology around the world.  
-   **Entities that meet high security and trust standards and are
    headquartered in close allies and partners can obtain highly trusted
    “Universal Verified End User” (UVEU) status.** With this status,
    they can then place up to 7% of their global AI computational
    capacity in countries around the world – likely amounting to
    hundreds of thousands of chips. This trusted status is granted on a
    global and enduring basis, allowing responsible entities to expand
    rapidly and flexibly, and strengthening U.S. and allied global
    leadership while keeping frontier training at home.  
-   **Entities that meet the same security requirements and are
    headquartered in any destination that is not a country of concern
    can apply for “National Verified End User” status, enabling them to
    purchase computational power equivalent to up to 320,000 advanced
    GPUs over the next two years.** This provision permits trusted
    national entities to benefit from advanced U.S. technology, serving
    local, governmental, and regional customers, while guarding against
    diversion risks.  
-   **Non-VEU entities located outside of close allies can still
    purchase large amounts of computational power,** up to the
    equivalent of 50,000 advanced GPUs per country. This cap ensures
    that U.S. technology is available to service foreign governments,
    healthcare providers, and other local businesses.    
     
-   **Government-to-government arrangements cultivate an international
    ecosystem of shared values regarding the development, deployment,
    and use of AI.** Governments that sign these arrangements – which
    align those nations’ export control, clean energy, and technology
    security efforts with the United States – can double their chip caps
    (up to 100,000 of today’s advanced GPUs).

Even as it encourages the diffusion of U.S. technology, the rule takes
significant steps against countries of concern, constraining them from
accessing advanced AI systems and the computing power used to train
them. These actions include:

-   **Continuing to ensure that advanced semiconductors sold abroad are
    not used by countries of concern to train advanced AI
    systems, **while still permitting access for general-purpose
    applications from telecommunications to banking.

<!-- -->

-   **Restricting the transfer to non-trusted actors of the model
    weights for advanced closed-weight models.** The rule does not in
    any way inhibit the publication of model weights for open-weight
    models.  
-   **Setting security standards to protect the weights of advanced
    closed-weight AI models**, permitting them to be stored and used
    securely around the world while helping prevent illicit adversary
    access.

The rule builds on previous regulations that aim to protect U.S.
national security, including the October 2022 and October 2023 chip
controls. It follows a broad range of relevant engagements over the past
ten months with stakeholders, bipartisan members of Congress, industry
representatives, and foreign allies and partners.
