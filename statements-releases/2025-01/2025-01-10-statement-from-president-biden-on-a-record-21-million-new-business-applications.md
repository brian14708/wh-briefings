title: "Statement From President\_Biden on a Record 21 Million New Business\_Applications"
---
 
Starting a small business is an act of hope and confidence in the
economy. During my Administration, American entrepreneurs took the first
step in this journey in record numbers, filing 21 million new business
applications – more than during any other Presidential Administration on
record. Over the last four years, we’ve seen the strongest four years
for new business applications on record.

My Administration has empowered this unprecedented wave of
entrepreneurship by significantly expanding access to capital and by
making historic investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and clean
energy that are benefiting small businesses in communities across the
country. And today, the Small Business Administration announced that the
federal government built on this support by awarding $183 billion in
federal contracts to small businesses and $78 billion to small
disadvantaged businesses in Fiscal Year 2024 – both record totals.

Small businesses powered our economic recovery and will continue to make
our economy the strongest in the world.
