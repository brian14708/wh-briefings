title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Wildfires in West Los\_Angeles"
---
 
I am being frequently briefed on the wildfires in west Los Angeles. My
team and I are in touch with state and local officials, and I have
offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the
terrible Pacific Palisades fire. Earlier tonight, FEMA approved a Fire
Management Assistance Grant to support areas that are impacted and help
reimburse the state of California for the immediate firefighting
costs. My Administration will do everything it can to support the
response.

I urge the residents of the Pacific Palisades and the surrounding areas
of Los Angeles to stay vigilant and listen to local officials.
