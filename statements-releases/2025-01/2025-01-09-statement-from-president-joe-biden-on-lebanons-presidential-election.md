title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Lebanon\u2019s Presidential\_Election"
---
 
Today, the Speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament convened a session of
Parliament to elect Lebanon’s next President, and an overwhelming
majority of Lebanon’s Parliament voted in favor of Joseph Aoun.  I
congratulate him on his election as President of Lebanon.

President Aoun’s election comes just six weeks after the United States
secured an end to the hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel.  Now,
President Aoun will provide critical leadership as Lebanon and Israel
fully implement that cessation of hostilities and as hundreds of
thousands of people return to their homes and Lebanon recovers and
rebuilds.  President Aoun has my confidence.  I believe strongly he is
the right leader for this time.

For more than two years, the Lebanese people have suffered – not only
from a devastating war and continuing financial crisis, but also from
the absence of national leadership.  Now, through their elected
parliamentarians, the people of Lebanon have exercised their democratic
right to choose their own future.  They have chosen a path aligned with
peace, security, sovereignty, and reconstruction, in partnership with
the international community.  And the United States will support them as
they walk that path.
