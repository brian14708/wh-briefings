title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Sean Savett on Anomalous Health\_Incidents"
---
 
Upon taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration spearheaded a
dedicated effort to address anomalous health incidents reported by our
colleagues. We convened departments and agencies across the U.S.
Government to develop new policies to expand access to and improve
medical care for affected personnel, ensure incidents could be reported
freely and without stigma, and provide benefits to eligible employees
under statutes passed by Congress, including the HAVANA Act which
President Biden signed into law. We also tasked the Intelligence
Community to examine the causes or causes of these incidents and
directed intensive research by our leading laboratories, informed by
experts in and outside of government. 

Our focus on these priorities remains unwavering and must continue.
Today’s updated Intelligence Community Assessment, which is the product
of ongoing analytic efforts and includes a shift in key judgements by
some intelligence components, only reinforces why it is vital that the
U.S. Government continue critical research, investigate credible
incidents, and strengthen efforts to provide timely care and long-term
clinical follow-up.

We will be briefing the incoming Administration on the full scope of
ongoing work that should continue, as well as additional areas of focus
recommended by the Intelligence Community [experts
panel](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/2022_02_01_AHI_Executive_Summary_FINAL_Redacted.pdf),
which found that a subset of anomalous health incidents cannot be easily
explained by known environmental or medical conditions and that pulsed
electromagnetic or acoustic energy remains a plausible explanation in
certain cases.  As with other health challenges faced by U.S. personnel
that took years to diagnose, sustained clinical, research, and
investigative work is necessary to clarify what caused the symptoms our
colleagues have reported, develop effective medical interventions, and
prevent future incidents. Our brave colleagues and their families, who
suffered real and sometimes serious injuries, deserve no less.
