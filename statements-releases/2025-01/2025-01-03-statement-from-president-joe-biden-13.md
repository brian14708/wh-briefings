As I have said many times, steel production—and the steel workers who
produce it—are the backbone of our nation.  A strong domestically owned
and operated steel industry represents an essential national security
priority and is critical for resilient supply chains.  That is because
steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our
defense industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic
steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.

For too long, U.S. steel companies have faced unfair trade practices as
foreign companies have dumped steel on global markets at artificially
low prices, leading to job losses and factory closures in America. I
have taken decisive action to level the playing field for American
steelworkers and steel producers by tripling tariffs on steel imports
from China.  With record investments in manufacturing, more than 100 new
steel and iron mills have opened since I took office, and U.S. companies
are producing the cleanest steel in the world. Today, the domestic steel
industry is the strongest it has been in years.

We need major U.S. companies representing the major share of US
steelmaking capacity to keep leading the fight on behalf of America’s
national interests. As a committee of national security and trade
experts across the executive branch determined, this acquisition would
place one of America’s largest steel producers under foreign control and
create risk for our national security and our critical supply chains.

So, that is why I am taking action to block this deal. It is my solemn
responsibility as President to ensure that, now and long into the
future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel
industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at
home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block
foreign ownership of this vital American company. U.S. Steel will remain
a proud American company – one that’s American-owned, American-operated,
by American union steelworkers – the best in the world.  

Today’s action reflects my unflinching commitment to utilize all
authorities available to me as President to defend U.S. national
security, including by ensuring that American companies continue to play
a central role in sectors that are critical for our national security.
As I have made clear since day one: I will never hesitate to act to
protect the security of this nation and its infrastructure as well as
the resilience of its supply chains.
