title: "Statement from President\_Biden Announcing the Names of CVN 82 and CVN\_83"
---
 
I am proud to announce that the next two Gerald R. Ford-class
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers will be named for two former
presidents: Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. 

When I personally delivered the news to Bill and George, they were
deeply humbled.  Each knows firsthand the weight of the responsibilities
that come with being Commander-in-Chief.  And both know well our duty to
support the families and loved ones who wait and worry for the safe
return of their servicemember.

The future USS William J. Clinton (CVN 82) and the future USS George W.
Bush (CVN 83) will begin construction in the years ahead. When complete,
they will join the most capable, flexible, and professional Navy that
has ever put to sea.  They will be crewed by Sailors who hail from every
corner of the United States, and who will sail these ships into harm’s
way, defending our interests overseas and our safety here at home. 

Those Sailors will demonstrate not only the example of our power, but
the power of our example. And our nation remains grateful to them, their
families, and all the talented shipyard workers who will bring these
ships to life.

May God protect all who sail aboard USS William J. Clinton, USS George
W. Bush and every other ship in our fleet.  And may God continue to
bless our troops.
