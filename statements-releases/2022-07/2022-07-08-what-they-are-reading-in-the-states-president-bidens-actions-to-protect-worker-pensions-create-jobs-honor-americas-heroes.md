title: "What They Are Reading in the States:  President\_Biden\u2019s Actions to Protect\
  \ Worker Pensions, Create Jobs & Honor America\u2019s\_Heroes"
---
 
Local news outlets across the country are highlighting President Biden’s
actions to strengthen families’ retirement savings, create good-paying
jobs through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and honor extraordinary
Americans who embody the soul of our nation.  
  
Following his trip to Cleveland, Ohio, newspapers and broadcast outlets
across the Buckeye state covered President Biden’s announcement of the
American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance program. This
initiative will protect two to three million workers and retirees from
facing dramatic cuts to their pensions, and it will reverse previous
cuts to their pensions.  
  
Americans nationwide also witnessed President Biden present the
Presidential Medal of Freedom – our Nation’s highest civilian honor – to
individuals who represent the best of America because of their exemplary
contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United
States and world.    
  
And from Long Island to Los Angeles, travelers are reading about how
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is building better
airports, investing nearly $1 billion across 85 airports to improve
customer experiences, move more goods through the economy to lower
prices, and enhance U.S. competitiveness.
