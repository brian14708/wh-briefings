title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces Historic American Rescue Plan Pension\
  \ Relief for Millions of Union Workers and\_Retirees"
---
 
Tomorrow, President Biden will join union workers and retirees at the
Max S. Hayes High School in Cleveland, Ohio to announce the final rule
implementing the American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance
program. The American Rescue Plan provided critical assistance to
working families and jump started our economic recovery, re-opening 99%
of schools, helping to create more than 8 million jobs, and generating
the fastest economic growth in 40 years. The Special Financial
Assistance Program will protect millions of workers in multiemployer
pension plans who faced significant cuts to their benefits.  
  
Multiemployer plans are created through agreements between employers and
a union, with plans typically involving multiple employers in a single
industry or related industries. A typical worker whose multiemployer
plan became insolvent would see their expected pension benefits slashed
substantially. Before the American Rescue Plan, workers and retirees
participating in more than 200 multiemployer pension plans faced the
prospect of not receiving the full benefits they earned and need to
support them and their families in retirement.  
  
These plans are insured by a federal agency, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). PBGC provides partial protection of the
benefits of approximately 10.9 million workers and retirees in
approximately 1,400 private-sector multiemployer, union-connected plans.
Prior to the America Rescue Plan, the PBGC’s multiemployer pension
insurance program was projected to become insolvent in 2026.  
  
**The American Rescue Plan Protects Retirees’ Pension Benefits**  
  
Named for heroic Ohio union leader and pension advocate Butch Lewis, the
American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance program will provide
financial relief to struggling multiemployer pension plans and ensure
that millions of families facing benefit cuts will receive their full
benefits they earned.  
  
Under the program, financially struggling multiemployer pension plans
can apply to the PBGC for assistance. PBGC issued an Interim Final Rule
implementing the program in July 2021. Unions, employers, and other key
stakeholders provided important comments that PBGC and the three Cabinet
agencies that constitute its Board of Directors (the Labor, Treasury,
and Commerce Departments) considered in developing the Final Rule.
Important policy changes from the Interim Final Rule to the Final Rule
include:

-   **Addressing the amount of Special Financial Assistance needed to
    better achieve the goal of allowing plans to remain solvent until
    2051.** The interim final rule applied a single rate of return
    included in the statute that is higher than could be expected for
    Special Financial Assistance funds given that they were required to
    be invested exclusively in safe, but low-return, investment-grade
    fixed income products. The final rule uses two different rates of
    return for SFA and non-SFA assets so that the interest rate for SFA
    assets is more realistic given the investment limitations on these
    funds. This policy fix will help ensure that all multiemployer plans
    that receive assistance will receive sufficient funds to remain
    solvent until 2051.  
-   **Responsible permissible return-seeking investments:** The final
    rule allows 33% of Special Financial Assistance to be invested in
    return-seeking assets that are projected to allow plans to receive a
    higher rate of return on their investments than under the interim
    final rule, but subject to strict protections. This portion of
    plans’ SFA funds generally must be invested in publicly traded
    assets on liquid markets to ensure responsible stewardship of
    federal funds. These return-seeking investments include equities,
    equity funds, and bonds. The other 67% of SFA funds must be invested
    in investment-grade fixed-income products.  
-   **Ensure MPRA plans could confidently restore both past and future
    benefits and enter 2051 with rising assets**. PBGC designed the
    final rule to ensure that no MPRA plan – the 18 multiemployer plans
    that remained solvent by cutting benefits pursuant to the
    Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) – was forced to
    choose between restoring their benefit payments to previous levels
    and remaining indefinitely solvent, as required by the Act. The
    final rule ensures that all 18 MPRA plans avoid this dilemma, with
    enough assistance so that these plans can both restore benefits and
    be projected to remain indefinitely solvent going into 2051.

*Taken together, these changes ensure that all plans that receive
Special Financial Assistance are projected to be solvent and pay full
benefits through at least 2051.*  
  
**The American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance Program Will
Have Historic Impacts:**  

-   **Positions multiemployer plans that receive assistance to remain
    solvent through at least 2051 – with no cuts to earned benefits:  
    **
    -   **Before American Rescue Plan:** over 200 multiemployer plans
        were on pace to become insolvent in the near term.  
    -   **After:** Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, every
        multiemployer pension plan that faced near-term insolvency and
        benefit cuts that receives Special Financial Assistance is
        projected to remain solvent through 2051, and for much longer.  
-   **Protect benefits for millions of workers who faced cuts:  
    **
    -   **Before** **the American Rescue Plan**: a wave of multiemployer
        pension plan insolvencies was projected to leave two to three
        million union workers, retirees, and their families without the
        full benefits they had earned.  
    -   **After:** Two to three million workers and retirees in plans
        that receive assistance are expected to have their full pension
        benefits for the next three decades.  
-   **Harsh Pension Cuts Reversed for over 80,000 Workers and Retirees
    in 18 Multiemployer Plans:  
    **
    -   **Before**: MPRA allowed plans to, for the first time, cut
        workers’ and retirees’ benefits in order to remain indefinitely
        solvent. Eighteen multiemployer “MPRA plans” were approved to
        utilize this program.  
    -   **After**: More than 80,000 workers and retirees in MPRA plans
        who, through no fault of their own, had their pension benefits
        cut, are eligible to have those benefits fully reinstated – with
        their plans solvent through 2051. The Special Financial
        Assistance program ensures all MPRA plans that were forced to
        cut benefits are able to restore those cuts in full, maintain
        full benefits into the foreseeable future, and be projected to
        remain indefinitely solvent.   
-   **Most significant effort to protect the solvency of the
    multiemployer pension system in almost 50 years:   
    **
    -   **Before:** Before the American Rescue Plan, because of the
        anticipated financial pressures from the need to guarantee
        minimum (partial) benefits for insolvent plans, PBGC’s
        Multiemployer Pension Insurance Program was projected to become
        insolvent in 2026.   
    -   **After:** The American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial
        Assistance program extended the solvency of the PBGC
        multiemployer insurance program from 2026 to 2055. This relief
        is the most substantial policy to strengthen the solvency of our
        nation’s multiemployer pensions since the enactment of the
        Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974.
