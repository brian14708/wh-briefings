title: "President\_Biden Announces Fourteenth Operation Fly Formula\_Mission"
---
 
*Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of over 4.7 million
8-ounce bottle equivalents of Bubs Australia infant formula on July 10
and 21*  
  
Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
a flight, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport *Bubs* Australia
infant formula from Australia to Ontario, California and Columbus, Ohio
via flights on July 10 and 21 respectively. These two deliveries will
include in total approximately 318,000 pounds of Bubs Organic Infant
Formula S1, Bubs Organic Follow On Formula S2, Bubs Supreme Infant
Formula Supreme Follow On Formula, Bubs Goat Milk Infant Formula S1,
Bubs Goat Milk Follow On Formula S2, the equivalent of approximately 4.7
million 8-ounce bottles. The product will be available through national
and regional retailers.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency
is exercising enforcement discretion so that Bubs Australia can export
additional infant formula into the U.S. Bubs Australia will import both
standard and specialty infant formulas to the U.S. including Bubs
Organic Grass Fed, Bubs Supreme A2 Beta-Casein Protein and Bubs
Easy-digest Goat Milk. Bubs plans to export over 27.5 million 8-ounce
bottle equivalents into the U.S. market.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S.
health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. *By
July 10, Operation Fly Formula will have transported more than 43
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S.*

In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
at whitehouse.gov/formula.
