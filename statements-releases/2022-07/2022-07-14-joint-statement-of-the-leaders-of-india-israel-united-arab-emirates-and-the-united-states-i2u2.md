  \ the United\_States\_(I2U2)"

On July 14, 2022, we, the Heads of Government of India, Israel, the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the United States, convened for the
first leaders’ meeting of the “I2U2” Group.  This unique grouping of
countries aims to harness the vibrancy of our societies and
entrepreneurial spirit to tackle some of the greatest challenges
confronting our world, with a particular focus on joint investments and
new initiatives in water, energy, transportation, space, health, and
food security.  
   
We intend to mobilize private sector capital and expertise to modernize
infrastructure, advance low carbon development pathways for our
industries, improve public health and access to  vaccines, advance
physical connectivity between countries in the Middle East region,
jointly create new solutions for waste treatment, explore joint
financing opportunities, connect our startups to I2U2 investments, and
promote the development of critical emerging and green technologies, all
while ensuring near- and long-term food and energy security.     
   
We reaffirm our support for the Abraham Accords and other peace and
normalization arrangements with Israel.  We welcome the economic
opportunities that flow from these historic developments, including for
the advancement of economic cooperation in the Middle East and South
Asia, and in particular for the promotion of sustainable investment
amongst the I2U2 partners. We also welcome other new groupings of
countries, such as the Negev Forum for regional cooperation, that
recognize the unique contributions of each partner country, including
Israel’s ability to serve as an innovation hub connecting new partners
and hemispheres to strategically address challenges that are too great
for any one country to manage alone.   
   
Today’s inaugural I2U2 leaders meeting focused on the food security
crisis and clean energy.  The leaders discussed innovative ways to
ensure longer-term, more diversified food production and food delivery
systems that can better manage global food shocks.   
   
To this end, the I2U2 leaders highlighted the following initiatives:

-   **Food Security:**  The UAE – home to the International Renewable
    Energy Agency (IRENA) and host of COP28 in 2023 – will invest $2
    billion USD to develop a series of integrated food parks across
    India that will incorporate state-of-the-art climate-smart
    technologies to reduce food waste and spoilage, conserve fresh
    water, and employ renewable energy sources.  India will provide
    appropriate land for the project and will facilitate farmers’
    integration into the food parks.  U.S. and Israeli private sectors
    will be invited to lend their expertise and offer innovative
    solutions that contribute to the overall sustainability of the
    project.  These investments will help maximize crop yields and, in
    turn, help tackle food insecurity in South Asia and the Middle
    East.  
-   **Clean Energy:**  The I2U2 Group will advance a hybrid renewable
    energy project in India’s Gujarat State consisting of 300 megawatts
    (MW) of wind and solar capacity complemented by a battery energy
    storage system.  The U.S. Trade and Development Agency funded a
    feasibility study for the $330 million USD project.  UAE-based
    companies are exploring opportunities to serve as critical knowledge
    and investment partners.  Israel and the United States intend to
    work with the UAE and India to highlight private sector
    opportunities.  Indian companies are keen to participate in this
    project and contribute to India’s goal of achieving 500 GW of
    non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.  Such projects have the potential
    to make India a global hub for alternate supply chains in the
    renewable energy sector.  

The leaders expressed their determination to leverage well-established
markets to build more innovative, inclusive, and science-based solutions
to enhance food security and sustainable food systems.  The leaders also
welcomed India’s interest in joining the United States, the UAE, and
Israel in the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate initiative (AIM
for Climate).  They affirmed that these are only the first steps in a
long-term strategic partnership to promote initiatives and investments
that improve the movement of people and goods across hemispheres, and
increase sustainability and resilience through collaborative science and
technology partnerships.
