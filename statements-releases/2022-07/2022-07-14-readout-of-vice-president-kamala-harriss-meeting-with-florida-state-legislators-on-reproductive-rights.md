title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Florida State\
  \ Legislators on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, July 14, 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris convened Florida
state legislators who are fighting on the frontlines to protect
reproductive rights. The Vice President was joined by Secretary of
Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra for the meeting which took
place in Orlando, Florida. Today’s convening follows engagements about
reproductive rights that the Vice President held with health care
providers, faith leaders, constitutional law and privacy experts,
advocates, State Attorneys General, and other state legislators from
across the country.  
   
During the meeting, the Vice President conveyed the Administration’s
commitment to protecting access to reproductive health care, including
abortion access, and she encouraged the legislators to continue fighting
to protect reproductive rights in Florida. She emphasized that the
government should not interfere with the right of every American to make
the most intimate decisions about “heart and home” – including
reproductive health care access. The Vice President reiterated the
Administration’s commitment to partnering with elected leaders at the
local, state, and federal level to protect reproductive health care. The
Vice President discussed actions the Administration is taking to defend
health care access, and she applauded the state legislators for their
work defending abortion access in Florida.  
  
The state legislative leaders shared what is happening in Florida as
extremist legislators are fighting to further limit reproductive health
care access. Florida currently has a 15 week ban on abortion, with no
exception for rape or incest. The law was signed into law by Governor
DeSantis in April and went into effect on July 1, 2022. Participants
shared stories of patients who have experienced the harmful impact of
Florida’s abortion restrictions, noting that every person deserves
access to comprehensive health care. The legislators conveyed how the
impact of abortion bans across other southern states is overwhelming the
health systems in Florida. They also discussed how in states like
Florida, the extremist legislators who are attacking reproductive rights
are also restricting LGBTQI+ rights and voting rights. The Vice
President recognized the importance of building coalitions to defend
rights and freedoms. The Vice President and the state leaders reaffirmed
their commitment to working together to protect reproductive rights for
all women across the state of Florida and our nation.

-   HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra
-   Doctor Robyn Schickler, Chief Medical Officer at Planned Parenthood
    of Southwest and Central Florida
