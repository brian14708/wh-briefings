title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Six New Actions to\
  \ Lower Electricity Bills for Working\_Families"
---
 
*Boosted by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Actions to Connect More
States and Families to Affordable, Reliable Solar Projects and Create
Clean Energy Jobs*

President Biden is laser focused on lowering energy costs for working
families while creating good-paying jobs and tackling the climate
crisis. As extreme heat continues to affect tens of millions of
Americans, hitting low-income families harder than others, President
Biden is implementing new programs to help maintain a consistent and
affordable energy supply to cool their homes.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing six new actions to
**lower home electricity costs** for hard-hit American families by
increasing access to affordable and more reliable clean energy and
**create clean energy jobs**:

**<u>LOWERING ELECTRICITY COSTS</u>**

1.  **Connecting Families to Low-Cost Solar Power:** The Department of
    Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing new guidance that –
    for the first time – will help enable families in HUD-assisted
    rental housing to subscribe to local community solar where
    available. With this guidance, HUD setting the stage for 4.5 million
    families to reap the benefits of community solar which, on average,
    can save families 10% per year on their electric bills. In some
    programs, such as the [Washington, DC Solar for All
    program](https://www.dcseu.com/solar-for-all), savings to households
    from subscribing to local community solar can reach up to 50% per
    year.

This national guidance builds on recent state-specific guidance that HUD
has provided to Illinois, Washington, DC and New York, that determined
community-net-metering (CNM) credits would be excluded from household
income and utility allowance calculations and therefore not increase
housing costs for residents in properties participating in HUD
Multifamily, Public Housing and Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance
programs. ****

-   **Connecting States to Low-Cost Solar Power**: The Department of
    Energy (DOE) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    are announcing that **Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico,
    New York, and Washington, D.C.** have signed up to pilot the
    [Community Solar Subscription
    Platform](https://www.energy.gov/communitysolar/community-solar-subscription-platform)
    which is designed to connect community solar electric bill savings
    projects to households participating in the Low-Income Home Energy
    Assistance Program (LIHEAP). DOE estimates that families in the
    pilot states and Washington, DC will see over $1 billion annually in
    combined electric bill savings.

-   **Empowering Rural Housing Authorities to Save Families Money**:
    Building on guidance from last year, HUD will launch a new
    initiative to help small rural housing authorities make money-saving
    energy efficiency upgrades and retain the savings from those
    projects to reinvest in improvements to rural HUD supported rental
    housing.

**<u>CREATING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS</u>**

-   **Strengthening America’s Solar Workforce:** DOE will announce that
    $10 million in funding is available from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law’s [Advancing Equity through Workforce
    Partnerships](https://energy.gov/eere/solar/articles/funding-notice-advancing-equity-through-workforce-partnerships)
     program to support new workforce programs that expand union density
    and increase participation from underserved and underrepresented
    groups in the rapidly growing solar industry. This funding will help
    to ensure that the hundreds of thousands of solar jobs that will be
    created over the next decade will be accessible to workers from all
    backgrounds, provide competitive wages and benefits, and offer
    opportunities for union membership.

-   DOE is announcing the [Sunny Awards for Equitable Community
    Solar](https://energy.gov/communitysolar/sunny-awards-equitable-community-solar),
    a new awards program to recognize communities that are implementing
    best-in class community solar programs and projects that lower costs
    and increase access for families.

<!-- -->

-   **Bringing New Federal Resources to Communities:** HUD announced
    that HUD regional offices will convene stakeholders in their regions
    over the next 90 days to highlight federal funding sources–
    including funding streams from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
    and HUD programs such as the HOME Investment Partnerships program
    and the Community Development Block Grant – that can be used to
    support public facilities and increase affordable housing supply
    that improves energy efficiency.

These announcements are bolstered by funding from President Biden’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which will create good-paying jobs in one
of the fastest growing sectors of our economy – clean energy. And they
build on Bipartisan Infrastructure Law programs focused on lowering
utility costs and reducing energy use such as LIHEAP and the
Weatherization Assistance Program. 

Low-income households spend a disproportionate amount of their earnings
on energy costs – according to the Department of Energy’s (DOE)
[Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD)
Tool](https://www.energy.gov/eere/slsc/low-income-community-energy-solutions),
the average low-income household spends almost 9% of their income on
energy. That adds up to tens of millions of Americans who are forced to
make hard decisions between keeping the lights on or staying cool, and
making other essential purchases like food and medicine.

Today’s announcements further the President’s Justice40 Initiative which
commits to delivering at least 40 percent of the benefits from federal
climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities that
are marginalized, underserved, or overburdened by pollution.
