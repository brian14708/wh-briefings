This morning, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19.  He is fully
vaccinated and twice boosted and experiencing very mild symptoms.  He
has begun taking Paxlovid. Consistent with CDC guidelines, he will
isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his
duties fully during that time.  He has been in contact with members of
the White House staff by phone this morning, and will participate in his
planned meetings at the White House this morning via phone and Zoom from
the residence.   
  
Consistent with White House protocol for positive COVID cases, which
goes above and beyond CDC guidance, he will continue to work in
isolation until he tests negative.  Once he tests negative, he will
return to in-person work.  
  
Out of an abundance of transparency, the White House will provide a
daily update on the President’s status as he continues to carry out the
full duties of the office while in isolation.  
  
Per standard protocol for any positive case at the White House, the
White House Medical Unit will inform all close contacts of the President
during the day today, including any Members of Congress and any members
of the press who interacted with the President during yesterday’s
travel.  The President’s last previous test for COVID was Tuesday, when
he had a negative test result.
