title: "ICYMI: Jared Bernstein of the Council of Economic Advisers Presses for Lowering\
  \ the Costs of Prescription Drugs for American\_People"
---
 
On Fox News Sunday, Jared Bernstein of the Council of Economic Advisers
described the strong state of the labor market and our jobs recovery,
while re-emphasizing that bringing down prices is the President’s top
priority. As part of that, he encouraged bipartisan support for measures
to make prescription drugs, one of the biggest costs Americans face,
much more affordable. As he noted, Americans often pay two to three
times as much for the same drugs as Europeans, and for years both
parties including President Trump have claimed they are in favor of
addressing this issue.

BERNSTEIN:  So, you made what I think is a really important point here,
which is that, yes, savings — elevated savings from the Rescue Plan and
other measures are very much helping to support consumer spending, the
real buffer in this time of elevated inflation. But you said that can’t
go on forever, and you’re exactly right. 

What you need in the backdrop is a strong labor market, because that’s
where most people get their incomes from. We have the strongest labor
market on record in history by many conventional metrics. Nine million
jobs since this president got here. 

There’s a lot of talk about all these economic headwinds. If you look at
this tailwind of job growth, 375,000 jobs per month in the past three
months. 

Now, you made a point about wage growth. Wage growth is actually pretty
strong in nominal terms, but inflation is so high. And that’s what the
president’s agenda is all about. Helping families afford prescription
drugs, lowering their health insurance premium, something that Congress
— I’m looking at the Capitol of the window here — something that
Congress needs to act on before the August recess, and I’m talking
bipartisan. 

You know, I have heard Republicans say for the many decades I’ve been
here — they want to lower prescription drugs. President Trump talked
about lowering prescription drug costs. 

We pay two to three times what people in other countries pay for the
very same drugs. That is just an unconscionable tax on our seniors.

And we shouldn’t — not only does that help people’s bottom line in terms
of affordability, it saves Medicare $100 billion over ten years. So we
should do that tomorrow to answer your question on affordability.
