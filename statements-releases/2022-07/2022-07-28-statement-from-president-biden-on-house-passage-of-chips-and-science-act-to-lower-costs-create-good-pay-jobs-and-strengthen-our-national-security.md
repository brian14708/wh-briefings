title: "Statement from President\_Biden on House Passage of CHIPS and Science Act\
  \ to Lower Costs, Create Good-Pay Jobs and Strengthen Our National\_Security"
---
 
Today, the House passed a bill that will make cars cheaper, appliances
cheaper, and computers cheaper.  It will lower the costs of every day
goods.  And, it will create high-paying manufacturing jobs across the
country and strengthen U.S. leadership in the industries of the future
at the same time.

The CHIPS and Science Act is exactly what we need to be doing to grow
our economy right now. By making more semiconductors in the United
States, this bill will increase domestic manufacturing and lower costs
for families.  And, it will strengthen our national security by making
us less dependent on foreign sources of semiconductors.  This bill
includes important guardrails to ensure that companies receiving tax
payer dollars invest in America and that union workers are building new
manufacturing plants across the country.

I look forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to grow our
economy from the bottom up and middle out for working families all
across the country.
