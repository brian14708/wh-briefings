SUBJECT:       The President’s Intelligence Priorities

The collection and analysis of timely and accurate intelligence is
essential to our national security, foreign policy, law enforcement, and
defense, and is critical to protecting and advancing the United States’
vital interests.  Global challenges posed by nation states and
transnational threats alike demand the Intelligence Community (IC) use
its resources in a coordinated manner that aligns with and is responsive
to the President’s overall priorities and direction.

     Section 1.  President’s Intelligence Priorities.  The President’s
Intelligence Priorities (PIP) will continue to serve as the President’s
primary mechanism for identifying and providing guidance to the IC on
the intelligence topics and issues of highest importance.  The PIP
should inform the IC’s budgetary, personnel, and other resource
allocations to ensure collection and analysis of intelligence that
provides insights, warning, or other illuminating information on the
priorities contained therein.

     Sec. 2.  Process.  Due to the evolving nature of the challenges we
face as a Nation, I direct the following process to govern the
development and execution of the PIP and ensure that it remains current
and instructive:

     (a)  The National Security Council (NSC) Deputies Committee, as
described in NSM-2 or a successor directive, shall convene not less than
every 2 years to update the PIP and recommend its approval by the
President.  Should there be a lack of consensus among the Deputies, the
NSC Principals Committee shall review the PIP and recommend its approval
by the President.  Any lack of consensus among the NSC Principals
Committee shall be presented to the President for decision.

     (b)  The NSC staff will facilitate this review through a Restricted
Interagency Policy Committee process, as necessary.

     (c)  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), in
close consultation with NSC staff, shall further establish and manage a
robust National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) process which
responds to the PIP and ensures that both the IC and additional
departments and agencies that require intelligence are represented in
the process of developing priorities.  The ODNI shall also evaluate, on
an ongoing basis, the IC’s responsiveness to the designated priorities
within the PIP.

     (d)  The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) shall work with IC
department and agency heads to ensure proper implementation of the PIP
so that the President, through the Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs (APNSA), is adequately informed of any
challenges related to implementation.  In response to emerging threats
or crisis events, the DNI, in consultation with the APNSA, may increase
the priority of any item within the NIPF to a Priority 1 for period(s)
not to exceed 180 days each. 

     Sec. 3.  Definition.  As used in this memorandum, the
term “Intelligence Community” has the meaning specified in the National
Security Act of 1947, as amended, and Executive Order 12333, as amended.

     Sec. 4.  Revocation.  This memorandum supersedes National Security
Presidential Directive/NSPD-26, which is hereby revoked.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
