title: "FACT SHEET:  Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Two New Actions to\
  \ Address Youth Mental Health\_Crisis"
---
 
Our nation’s young people are facing an unprecedented mental health
crisis. Even before the pandemic, rates of depression, anxiety and
suicidal thoughts among youth were on the rise. The pandemic exacerbated
those issues, disrupting learning, relationships, and routines and
increasing isolation – especially among our nation’s young people. More
than 40 percent of teenagers
[state](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/su/pdfs/su7103a1-a5-H.pdf)
that they struggle with persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness,
and more than
[half](https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/news-releases/new-apa-poll-shows-sustained-anxiety-among-americans-more-than-half-of-parents-are-concerned-about-the-mental-well-being-of-their-children)
of parents and caregivers express concern over their children’s mental
well-being.

To address this crisis, President Biden put forward in his first State
of the Union a [comprehensive national
strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-strategy-to-address-our-national-mental-health-crisis-as-part-of-unity-agenda-in-his-first-state-of-the-union/)
to tackle our mental health crisis, and called for a major
transformation in how mental health is understood, accessed, treated,
and integrated – in and out of health care settings.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced two new actions to
strengthen school-based mental health services and address the youth
mental health crisis.

**1. Awarding the first of nearly $300 million the President secured
through the FY2022 bipartisan omnibus agreement to expand access to
mental health services in schools.** Next week, the Department of
Education will begin the process to disburse almost $300 million
Congress appropriated in FY22 through both the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act and the FY22 Omnibus to help schools hire more
school-based mental health professionals and build a strong pipeline
into the profession for the upcoming school year. In total, the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will invest $1 billion over the next
five years in mental health supports in our schools, making progress
towards the President’s goal to double the number of school counselors,
social workers and other mental health professionals. This funding is
allocated to two critical programs: 

-   **The Mental Health Service Professional (MHSP) Demonstration Grant
    Program.** In FY22, this program will provide over $140 million in
    competitive grants to support a strong pipeline into the mental
    health profession, including innovative partnerships to prepare
    qualified school-based mental health services providers for
    employment in schools.
-   **School-Based Mental Health (SBMH) Services Grant Program.** In
    FY22, this program will provide over $140 million in competitive
    grants to states and school districts to increase the number of
    qualified mental health services providers delivering school-based
    mental health services to students in local educational agencies
    with demonstrated need. This will increase the number of school
    psychologists, counselors, and other mental health professionals
    serving our students. Some schools will gain mental health staff for
    the first time. Others will see this critical workforce expand. By
    increasing the number of qualified mental health professionals in
    our schools, and thereby reducing the number of students each
    provider serves, this program will meaningfully improve access to
    mental health services for vulnerable students. 

In the following months, the Biden Administration will deliver the
following additional FY22 funding that can be used to expand access to
mental health services and supports in schools:

-   **Fostering Trauma-Informed Services in Schools**. Young people have
    been especially impacted by the trauma of COVID. Over the next
    several weeks, the Department of Health and Human Services will
    begin evaluating applications to award nearly $7 million to
    education activities designed to help students access evidence-based
    and culturally relevant trauma support services and mental health
    care. Applications were submitted on July 25, 2022, and award
    announcements will be made this fall. The grant funds will help
    create partnerships that link school systems with local
    trauma-informed support and mental health systems to provide
    services to students in need.
-   **Expanding Mental Health Services Through Full-Service Community
    Schools.** The Biden-Harris Administration has proposed expanding
    funding for community schools, which play a critical role in
    providing comprehensive services to students and families to improve
    academic outcomes and student well-being. In response to the
    President’s FY22 budget, Congress more than doubled funding for the
    Department of Education’s Full-Service Community Schools Program,
    which supports community schools that provide, or establish
    partnerships to provide, a range of wraparound supports for students
    and their families – including health, nutrition and mental health
    services. Earlier this month, the Department announced plans to
    award $68 million in funds for 40 new grantees. All grantees are
    required to provide integrated student services, which can include
    mental health services and supports.
-   **Responding to Childhood Trauma Associated with Community
    Violence.** The FY22 omnibus included $5 million for the Department
    of Education’s Project Prevent, a program that provides grants to
    help school districts increase their capacity to implement
    community- and school-based strategies to mitigate community
    violence and the impacts on students. Experiencing or witnessing
    violence in the community is an adverse childhood experience linked
    to chronic health issues, including mental health. Project Prevent
    seeks to build a bridge between schools and community-based
    organizations to provide students with the tools to break cycles of
    generational violence and trauma, including through the use of
    mental health services and supports.

**2. Encouraging Governors to Invest More in School-Based Mental Health
Services.**

In a
[letter](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/secletter/220729.html?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=)
sent today to Governors across the country, the Departments of Education
and Health and Human Services highlight federal resources available to
states and schools to invest in mental health services for students. The
joint letter from Secretaries Becerra and Cardona highlights actions by
the Biden-Harris Administration to improve the delivery of health care
in schools and make sure children enrolled in Medicaid have access to
comprehensive health care services, as required by law. The letter also
previews forthcoming Medicaid guidance on how states can leverage
Medicaid funding to deliver critical mental health care services to more
students, including ways to make it easier to bill Medicaid for these
services.

*Next Up: $1.7 Billion for Mental Health Thanks to the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act*

An additional $1.7 billion for mental health is headed to our schools
and communities thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA)
signed by President Biden last month. Provisions of this legislation
authorize funding and technical assistance in the following areas:

-   **Expanding Community Based Behavioral Health Services**. $40
    million for the Department of Health and Human Services to support
    the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Medicaid
    Demonstration Program, including support for new planning grants to
    states. CCBHCs provide comprehensive, coordinated, person-and
    family-centered services and 24/7 crisis intervention services.
-   **Enhancing Delivery of School-Based Mental Health.** Working with
    the Department of Education, HHS will establish a technical
    assistance center and award grants for implementing, enhancing, or
    expanding the provision of assistance through schools under Medicaid
    and CHIP.
-   **Improving Oversight of Medicaid’s Early and Periodic Screening,
    Diagnostic and Treatment Benefit.** HHS will review and identify
    gaps in state implementation of ESPDT compliance, provide technical
    assistance, and issue guidance to states in order to improve
    implementation of this critical benefit.
-   **Increasing Access to Children’s Mental Health Services**. $80
    million to HHS to award grants to support pediatric primary care
    providers, emergency departments, and schools to rapidly access
    mental health specialists’ expertise and better connect children to
    care. The Act also requires CMS to provide guidance to states on how
    they can increase access to behavioral health through telehealth
    under Medicaid and CHIP.
-   **Expanding Training for Pediatric Providers.** $60 million, over
    five years, for HHS to train primary care residents in the
    prevention, treatment, and referral of services for mental and
    behavioral health conditions for pediatric and adolescents.
-   **Supporting Community and First Responders Mental Health
    Training**. $120 million for HHS to prepare and train community
    members and first responders on how to appropriately recognize and
    safely respond to individuals with mental health problems.
-   **Building Awareness of and Access to Mental Health Services**. $240
    million for programs that increase awareness and access to mental
    health supports for school-aged youth.
-   **Providing Support after Traumatic Events.** $40 million to improve
    treatment and services for children, adolescents, and families who
    have experienced traumatic events.
-   **Enhancing the 9-8-8 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline**. $150 million to
    support implementation of the 24/7 hotline to provide free and
    confidential support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional
    distress.
-   **Improving Conditions for Student Learning.** $1 billion in funding
    through Title IV-A to support a variety of activities to improve
    conditions for student learning through evidence-based practices to
    promote positive school climates.
-   **Expanding Access to Out of School Programs**. $50 million in
    funding to the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Community Learning Centers
    (21<sup>st</sup> CCLC) program to fund extracurricular, after school
    and summer programs, with a focus on reengaging youth. The
    Department of Education will support grantees in using funds to
    build relationships between students and educators, and other adults
    who serve students, in ways that help students feel less isolated
    and more connected to their school, improving their overall mental
    health and well-being.  

*Building on Progress*

These actions build upon earlier investments and
[announcements](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/19/fact-sheet-improving-access-and-care-for-youth-mental-health-and-substance-use-conditions/)
designed to expand access to mental health services for youth and
further President Biden’s Unity Agenda. In just 18 months, President
Biden has invested unprecedented resources in addressing the mental
health crisis and providing young people the supports, resources, and
care they need. Through the American Rescue Plan (ARP), the Biden-Harris
Administration has invested over $5 billion in funding through the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand access to mental
health and substance use services, and school districts are estimated to
use an additional $2 billion in Department of Education ARP Elementary
and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds to hire more school
psychologists, counselors and other mental health professionals in K-12
schools. And the President’s [FY23
budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf)
proposes over $27 billion in discretionary funding and another $100
billion in mandatory funding over 10 years to implement his national
mental health strategy.
