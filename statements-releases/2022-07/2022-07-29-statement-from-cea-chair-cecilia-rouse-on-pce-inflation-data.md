The President’s number one economic priority is tackling inflation,
while maintaining a strong economy and labor market. Today’s data show
that inflation remains too high. The good news is that gas prices have
declined since these data were collected in June. This week, Congress
passed the CHIPS and Science bill – a much needed investment in our
economy – which will lead to lower costs of everyday goods like cars,
computers, dishwashers and more. The Senate is also making progress on
the Inflation Reduction Act, which will lower the price of prescription
drugs and health care and lower the price of clean energy, all while
decreasing the deficit and reforming our tax system so that the
wealthiest Americans and corporations pay their fair share. Leading
economists agree that this legislation would be an important step
forward in fighting inflation and addressing some of our nation’s most
pressing economic challenges.

The President will continue to do everything in his power to tackle
inflation and work with Congress to lower prices.
