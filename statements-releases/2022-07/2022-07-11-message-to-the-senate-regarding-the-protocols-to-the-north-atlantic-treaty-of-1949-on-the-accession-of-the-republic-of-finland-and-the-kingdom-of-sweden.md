title: "Message to the Senate Regarding the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty\
  \ of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of\_Sweden"
---
 
To the Senate of the United States:

I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its
ratification, the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the
Accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden (the
“Protocols”).  The Protocols were signed in Brussels on July 5, 2022, on
behalf of the United States and the other Parties to the North Atlantic
Treaty.  Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is an
overview of the Protocols by the Department of State.  Full ratification
of the Protocols will allow Finland and Sweden to become Parties to the
North Atlantic Treaty and members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).

Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which outlines NATO’s Open Door
policy, is part of the doctrinal foundation of the Alliance.  It states
that Allies may, by unanimous consent, invite any other European State
in a position to further the principles of the Treaty and to contribute
to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede.  As further
explained in the reports on the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO,
transmitted to the Congress on May 19 and July 1, 2022, in light of
section 3(2)(E) of the Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification
of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession
of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic of April 30, 1998, Finland
and Sweden more than meet these qualifications.  They will be net
contributors to the Alliance, in both capabilities and resources, and
they share critically important values with the United States. 
Finland’s and Sweden’s accession will help further United States
priorities within NATO. 

I ask the Senate to continue working with my Administration in advancing
a strong and free Europe by providing its prompt advice and consent to
ratification of the Protocols.  We are encouraging all Allies to act
expeditiously in their own ratification processes as well, given current
global considerations.  My Administration stands ready to brief and
assist you in your deliberations.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 11, 2022.
