title: "Joint U.S.-Israel Statement on Launching Strategic High-Level Dialogue on\_\
  Technology"
---
 
Today, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the
State of Israel reaffirm their commitment to elevating the strategic
partnership between the countries to new heights by launching the new
Strategic High-Level Dialogue on Technology, tasked with establishing a
U.S.-Israel technological partnership on critical and emerging
technologies and solutions to global challenges: pandemic preparedness,
climate change, implementation of artificial intelligence, and trusted
technology ecosystems. The dialogue will also reinforce existing
collaboration mechanisms.  
  
The United States-Israel relationship reflects our shared values and
interests and the true friendship between our peoples. We pledge to
boost our mutual innovation ecosystems, to deepen bilateral engagements,
advance and protect critical and emerging technologies in accordance
with our national interests, democratic principles and human rights, and
to address geostrategic challenges.  
  
**First**, we recognize the importance of the technological ties between
the United States and Israel, along with other key partners and
allies.  
  
**Second**, we resolve to encourage innovative solutions to global
challenges and promote a shared agenda in the international arena.  
  
**Third**, we will advance and facilitate a high-level bilateral
inter-agency dialogue led by the respective national security councils
of the United States and Israel to enhance our collaboration on
promoting and protecting critical and emerging technologies in areas of
global concern:

-   **Pandemic preparedness:** exploring cooperative tech R&D ventures,
    including technology fordisease surveillance and early warning and
    for rapid medical countermeasure responses.  
-   **Trustworthy artificial intelligence:** addressing important
    challenges, such as large scale planning, implementation and
    logistical challenges through multidimensional optimization by means
    of cutting-edge AI in the fields of transportation, medicine and
    agriculture. This includes discussing evaluation and measurement
    tools for trustworthy AI, and for risk management and
    privacy-enhancing technologies.  
-   **Technology for addressing climate change:** cooperative R&D
    ventures and/or deploying technologies to drive equitable climate
    solutions (e.g., water reuse, solid waste management, clean and
    renewable energy).  
-   **Trusted tech ecosystems:** exchange information and seek to
    increase coordination on policies on risk management in our
    innovation ecosystems, including research security, investment
    screening, and export controls, as well as on technology investment
    and protection strategies for critical and emerging technologies.

**Fourth**, the Strategic Dialogue on Technology will convene annually,
alternating between the United States and Israel. The first meeting will
take place in Israel in the fall of 2022, to discuss advancing specific
projects in the fields for cooperation mentioned above.  
  
**Fifth,** we affirm our commitment to expanding our cooperation to
further areas, and beginning an exchange program in quantum information
science, so that the U.S. and Israel can jointly address strategic
technology challenges and pursue our common goals for the mutual benefit
of both our countries.
