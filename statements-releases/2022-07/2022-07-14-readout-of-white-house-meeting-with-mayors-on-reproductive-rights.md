title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Mayors on Reproductive Rights"
---
 
Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and
Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director,
met with women and allied mayors from across the country to discuss
reproductive rights. 

From safeguarding public health to overseeing critical infrastructure,
mayors lead and implement policies closest to home. As abortion bans go
into effect in states across the country, compromising women’s access to
critical reproductive health care services, mayors can play an important
role in their communities, including by supporting public education and
outreach on reproductive health care, supporting the funding of
services, sharing accurate information, and taking additional actions to
protect abortion access and promote safety.

On June 30, the Women Mayors Network released
a [letter](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2Fwww.womenmayorsnetwork.org%2Fabortionaccessletter2%2F__%3B!!AQdq3sQhfUj4q8uUguY!iz9lbb4k2qPMql2vQSzaIkbXehLFnIQSVFuYJ2uZbuErKQuqz-Pff91Bk8qG5HwgiLZ7mKsWjHcBjY1K2BwAE2_hnuJ7A_G_IKfr%24&data=05%7C01%7CZMiller%40ap.org%7C928d3918aa964d68d4d908da65a61411%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C637934061221694690%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=CJ8Y7dIJBu23JiIBcCBL3skploii%2BYuIOtLNmO2Vm7g%3D&reserved=0) from
more than 65 women mayors and additional male allies in response to the
Supreme Court’s decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson* *Women’s Health
Organization. *In the letter, the mayors commit to “actions that
safeguard our clinics and our residents who are seeking abortion
services or helping others do so and funding services and logistical
support whenever possible, and to organize with residents and activists
to support actions that expand access to abortion care.”

In the meeting, which was co-hosted by the Women Mayors Network, mayors
shared what they are seeing and hearing on the ground as patients from
states that ban abortion travel to seek care. The mayors also discussed
actions they have taken to support reproductive rights, as well as key
messaging and outreach strategies. White House Senior Officials thanked
the mayors for their leadership and reinforced the Administration’s
commitment to working together to protect access to abortion.
