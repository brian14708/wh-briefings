title: "FACT SHEET:\_Vice President Harris Marks Important New Milestone in Administration\u2019\
  s Efforts to Cut Costs for American\_Families"

*Vice President announces that since GetInternet.gov launch in May,
Administration has signed up 1 million new households to save hundreds
of dollars a year on internet service*

Access to high-speed internet is no longer a luxury. Still, too many
families go without high-speed internet because of the cost or have to
cut back on other essentials to make their monthly internet service
payments.  That’s why President Biden and Vice President Harris worked
with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to include the Affordable
Connectivity Program (ACP) in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which
[provides $65 billion](https://www.internetforall.gov/) to expand
internet for all — to ensure that every American has access to reliable
and affordable high-speed internet.    
  
The ACP, administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),
provides eligible households up to $30/month (or $75/month on Tribal
lands) off internet bills, as well as a one-time $100 discount off a
connected device. To further lower costs, in May, President Biden and
Vice President Harris announced commitments from internet service
providers across the country to offer high-speed plans that are fully
covered by the ACP—meaning millions of working families can now get
high-speed internet without paying a dime. They simultaneously launched
[GetInternet.gov](https://getinternet.gov/)—a one-stop shop to check
eligibility and sign up.  
  
Today in North Carolina, Vice President Harris is announcing that,
**thanks to the Administration’s “all of government” enrollment drive,1
million new households have signed up to save on home broadband through
the ACP.**  
The Administration’s efforts increased the rate of ACP enrollments by
about 35%.  
  
To build on this success, today the Vice President called on the
nation’s governors to join the Administration’s enrollment drive,
sending them letters describing key steps they can take to boost
enrollment in their states. For example, today, the State of North
Carolina committed to email 5 million households to let them know they
can lower their internet bill by visiting GetInternet.gov to check
eligibility and sign up.  
  
  
**<u>THE BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION’S “ALL OF GOVERNMENT” ENROLLMENT
DRIVE</u>**  
  
***Partnering with state and local governments***: The Vice President’s
call to action today builds on the Administration’s existing successful
partnerships with state and local governments to spread the word. For
example:

-   Michigan texted about 1.3 million likely eligible Michiganders and
    gained 25,000 new ACP enrollees as a result.
-   Albemarle County, Virginia now includes a “P.S.” about
    GetInternet.gov in every client communication by county social
    service workers.
-   Massachusetts recently texted more than 1 million Supplemental
    Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for
    Needy Families (TANF) beneficiaries about GetInternet.gov and saw
    their rate of enrollments double in the five days following the
    text.
-   The City of Mesa, Arizona reports that constituents who hear about
    ACP are extremely interested. Mesa’s texts to residents about
    GetInternet.gov have a 10% clickthrough rate, as compared to a usual
    1-5% rate for other Mesa governmental outreach.
-   New York City sent backpack flyers about ACP home via 1,700
    principals to reach about 1 million children who attend Free and
    Reduced-Price School Lunch Community-Eligible Schools, and it will
    advertise GetInternet.gov at bus stops in zip codes with a high
    number of households likely eligible for ACP.

***Leveraging all of the federal government***: In addition to working
with state and local partners, the Administration is using every tool in
its toolbox to get the word out—including communicating directly with
households that are automatically eligible for ACP due to their
participation in other federal government programs. For example:

-   The Social Security Administration (SSA) emailed all 1.7 million
    Supplemental Security Income recipients who have a “my social
    security” account letting them know that they are eligible for ACP.
    SSA plans to send a second email to recipients this summer. The
    agency is also running PSAs on Social Security Television, broadcast
    in more than 1,200 local social security offices nationwide.
-   This summer, the Department of Education will email over 6 million
    Pell grant recipients who are eligible for ACP. It will also conduct
    a Back-To-School campaign with information about ACP.
-   The Department of Veterans Affairs sent information to its 12
    million VetResources email subscribers and 120 Community Veteran
    Engagement Boards, as Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit
    recipients are eligible for ACP. This summer the Veterans Benefits
    Administration will also directly mail all 380,000 Veterans and
    Survivors currently receiving pension benefits a notification letter
    and flyer.
-   The Department of Housing and Urban Development emailed over 3,000
    Public Housing Authorities with information about the ACP to share
    with their over 3 million families who receive Federal Public
    Housing Assistance and are eligible, and is currently doing
    follow-up engagement.
-   The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Trust Funds
    Administration reached out to over 400,000 beneficiaries with a
    direct mailing to let them know about ACP. The Department also
    trained over 200 call center and field staff who work at the Bureau
    of Trust Funds Administration to disseminate information and answer
    questions about eligibility and how to enroll in ACP.
-   Broadband infrastructure grant programs operated by the Department
    of the Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department
    of Commerce are all requiring grant funding recipients to
    participate in the ACP, helping ensuring federal funds are used to
    deploy networks that are actually affordable.

***Working with advocates and digital navigators***: The Administration
is also working with trusted community leaders to get the word out and
enroll eligible households. For example:

-   The FCC has registered over 40,000 individuals and organizations to
    be ACP outreach partners. To build on these efforts, the FCC is in
    the process of standing up a new grant program to empower partners
    to engage their communities and has reserved up to $100 million of
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to conduct ACP outreach
    efforts, including consumer research, focus groups, paid media
    campaigns, and grants to outreach partners over the next five years.
-   The Administration partnered with civil rights groups to kick off a
    Week of Action in June, in which the Leadership Conference and
    partner civil rights organizations reached out to communities to
    encourage households to sign up for ACP.
-   Thanks to Administration outreach, United Way will share information
    about ACP in communications reaching at least 15,000 people per
    month.
-   The Administration also worked with Propel, a financial technology
    platform used by SNAP beneficiaries that reaches over 5 million
    low-income households. Propel is running an ACP promotion campaign
    through July.

**<u>THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM (ACP)</u>**

The ACP is a key part of the Administration’s [Internet for
All](https://www.internetforall.gov/) initiative and the largest
internet affordability program in our nation’s history. Experts estimate
that [48 million
households](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/62785ccb671629771cd1a60d/1652055243247/Broadband-Connectivity-Fact-Sheet-CPSP-2022.pdf)—or
nearly 40% of households in the country—qualify for the ACP either
because their income is at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level,
or because a member of the household meets one of the other criteria
below:

-   Participates in one of the following programs:
    -   Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known
        as Food Stamps
    -   Medicaid
    -   Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
        Children (WIC)
    -   Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
    -   Federal Public Housing Assistance (FPHA)
    -   Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit
    -   Free and Reduced-Price School Lunch Program or School Breakfast
        Program, including at U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
        Community Eligibility Provision schools
    -   Federal Pell Grant (received in the current award year)
    -   Lifeline
    -   Certain Tribal assistance programs, including Bureau of Indian
        Affairs General Assistance, Head Start (only households meeting
        the income qualifying standard), Tribal Temporary Assistance for
        Needy Families (Tribal TANF), and Food Distribution Program on
        Indian Reservations
-   Meets the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband
    provider’s existing low-income internet program.

As of now, more than 1,300 internet service providers participate in the
program, and about 13 million households have signed up to receive the
ACP benefit.  
  
Households can check their eligibility for ACP, sign up, and find fully
covered plans by visiting [GetInternet.gov](https://getinternet.gov/).
They can also learn more by calling (877) 384-2575.  
  
The ACP enrollment drive is just one part of the Biden-Harris
Administration’s [Internet for All
Initiative](https://www.internetforall.gov/) to ensure that every
American has access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a $65 billion investment in
high-speed internet access—on top of
[billions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-over-25-billion-in-american-rescue-plan-funding-to-help-ensure-every-american-has-access-to-high-speed-affordable-internet/)
in funding for high-speed, affordable internet provided by the American
Rescue Plan that is currently being deployed across the nation.
