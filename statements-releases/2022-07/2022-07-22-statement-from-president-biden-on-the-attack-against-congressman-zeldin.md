title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Attack Against Congressman\_Zeldin"
---
 
I condemn the attack on Congressman Zeldin in the strongest terms. As
I’ve said before, violence has absolutely no place in our society or our
politics. I am especially grateful for the courage of those who
immediately intervened, and that he is unharmed and was able to continue
his speech. I also want to thank the law enforcement officers who
quickly took action and are investigating this attack that defies our
fundamental democratic values.
