title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Successful Counterterrorism\_Operation"
---
 
Today, the men and women of the U.S. military and of our intelligence
community successfully executed an airstrike against one of the top
leaders of ISIS, Maher al Agal.  
   
His death in Syria takes a key terrorist off the field and significantly
degrades the ability of ISIS to plan, resource, and conduct their
operations in the region. And, like the U.S. operation in February that
eliminated ISIS’s overall leader, it sends a powerful message to all
terrorists who threaten our homeland and our interests around the world.
 The United States will be relentless in its efforts to bring you to
justice.  
   
This airstrike represents the culmination of determined and meticulous
intelligence work and stands as testament to the bravery and skill of
our armed forces.  It also demonstrates that the United States does not
require thousands of troops in combat missions to identify and eliminate
threats to our country.   
   
On behalf of the American people, whose lives they protect every day, I
thank them for their service, their dedication, their professionalism,
and for the teamwork that led to this successful outcome.   
   
The American people — and our allies and partners — are safer today
because of their actions.
