title: "Joint Statement Following Meeting Between President\_Biden and Egyptian President\
  \ Abdel Fattah Al Sisi in\_Jeddah"
---
 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah
Al Sisi today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to reaffirm their shared
commitment to the U.S.-Egypt strategic partnership, consult on a broad
range of global and regional security challenges, and advance the
U.S.-Egypt relationship.  In celebrating the milestone of 100 years of
U.S.-Egypt diplomatic relations, President Al Sisi and President Biden
expressed their intention to meet again in the near future to further
enhance the two countries’ multi-faceted partnership.  The two leaders
renewed their commitment to the U.S.-Egypt Strategic Dialogue co-chaired
by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Minister of Foreign Affairs
Sameh Shoukry and welcomed the continued implementation of its
outcomes.  
   
Strengthening our shared security  
   
The decades-long U.S.-Egypt defense partnership remains a key pillar of
regional stability.  Both Presidents affirmed the importance of this
partnership, which serves the interests of both countries.  President
Biden reiterated that the United States aims to continue to support
Egypt in providing for its own defense, including through the continued
provision of security assistance in consultation with the U.S.
Congress.  Both Presidents affirmed their commitment to cooperate on
counter-terrorism and welcomed the notable achievements of the Global
Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  President Al Sisi expressed Egypt’s
appreciation for military equipment and security assistance from the
United States.  
   
Advancing economic prosperity  
   
Both Presidents expressed their commitment to furthering bilateral
economic cooperation for the mutual benefit of the Egyptian and American
people.  They decided to explore new ways to expand bilateral trade,
increase private sector investments, and collaborate on clean energy and
climate technology.  The leaders welcomed the recent U.S. GreenTech
Mission to Egypt, the largest in history, and committed to launch the
high-level Joint Economic Commission.  
   
The impact of the war in Ukraine  
   
The United States and Egypt underlined that peace, security and a
multilateral, rules-based order lie at the heart of their longstanding
partnership.  Recalling the March 2<sup>nd</sup> and March
24<sup>th</sup> United Nations General Assembly resolutions on Ukraine,
which both voted in favor of, they reaffirmed their shared principles
enshrined in the UN Charter, including the respect for international
law, territorial integrity, and national sovereignty.  The two
Presidents emphasized the need to refrain from the use of force, solve
conflicts by peaceful means, and end violations of human rights in
conflict areas.  The United States and Egypt share particular concerns
over the severe global consequences that stem from the war in Ukraine,
including on global supply chains and energy and commodity prices.  For
example, the blockading of Black Sea ports has triggered rising food
insecurity and levied significant economic pressures on Egypt.   
   
President Biden underscored U.S. support for the Egyptian people in
responding to these challenges.  To this end, the United States commends
Egypt’s consultations with the International Monetary Fund and supports
the provision of additional funding to Egypt through the IMF’s
Resilience and Sustainability Trust.  The United States also lends its
full support to Egypt’s engagement with the World Bank to seek financing
options to stabilize its economy and strengthen the well-being of
Egyptian households, in particular through the Crisis Response Finance
Package recently announced by the Bank.  President Biden conveyed that
the United States is providing $1 billion in new assistance to address
the food security situation in the Middle East, with $50 million
specifically for Egypt. These funds aim to bolster food security and
offset the effects of the disruption in agricultural supply chains and
higher food prices due to the blocking of ports.  President Biden
assured President Al Sisi that the United States will advocate for Egypt
and its food security needs.  
   
Promoting regional stability  
   
The United States and Egypt are cooperating closely to mediate solutions
to regional conflicts and promote peace.  The two leaders stressed that
a two-state solution remains the only viable path to achieve a lasting
resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to realize a secure,
prosperous, and dignified future for Israelis and Palestinians alike. 
President Biden expressed support for Egypt’s vital leadership and
historic role in promoting peace and an end to the conflict, thereby
expanding the circle of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors and
globally, as well as preserving sustainable calm between Israelis and
Palestinians.   
   
The two leaders underscored the need to implement United Nations
Security Council resolutions 2570, 2571 (2021), reaffirming the
necessity of holding presidential and parliamentary elections in tandem
as soon as possible in Libya.  They emphasized the importance of the
full withdrawal of all foreign forces, mercenaries, foreign fighters,
and the pivotal role of the 5+5 Joint Military Committee in this regard,
including the prompt development of timelines.  President Biden thanked
President Al Sisi for Egypt’s role in helping to consolidate the Yemen
Truce, particularly through facilitating commercial flights from Sana’a
to Cairo, an important component of the UN-mediated truce arrangement. 
The two Presidents committed to regular consultations to resolve
regional conflicts and humanitarian crises in Syria, Lebanon, and
Sudan.  Regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), President
Biden reiterated U.S. support for Egypt’s water security and to forging
a diplomatic resolution that would achieve the interests of all parties
and contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous region.  The two
leaders reiterated the imperative of concluding an agreement on the
filling and operation of the GERD without further delay as stipulated in
the Statement of the President of the United Nations Security Council
dated September 15, 2021, and in accordance with international law.  
   
Promoting human rights  
   
President Biden and President Al Sisi emphasized their mutual commitment
to a constructive dialogue on human rights, which is an integral
component of the strong U.S.-Egypt partnership.  They will continue to
consult closely on ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights
and fundamental freedoms in political, civil, economic, social and
cultural fields.  The two leaders reaffirmed the important role that
civil society can play in these areas.  
   
Accelerating global efforts to tackle the climate crisis  
   
President Biden congratulated President Al Sisi for Egypt presiding over
the 27<sup>th</sup> United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 27) in
Sharm El Sheikh in November 2022 and reaffirmed the United States’
commitment to a successful Conference.  The United States welcomes
Egypt’s leadership in accelerating global ambition and action to tackle
the climate crisis.  President Biden welcomed Egypt’s submission of its
updated nationally determined contribution (NDC).  Both leaders
emphasized their countries’ support for the Global Methane Pledge (GMP)
and the new GMP Energy Pathway, which Egypt has joined with respect to
the oil and gas sector.  The two leaders reaffirmed the U.S. and Egypt’s
new partnership on Adaptation in Africa, which the U.S. and Egypt will
co-lead, focused on delivering concrete initiatives that will improve
people’s lives and help build resilience to a changing climate.  The
leaders committed to convene the Joint U.S.-Egypt Climate Working Group
as soon as possible.
