title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on National Wildland Firefighter\_\
  Day"

Today, on the first annual National Wildland Firefighter Day, I join
Americans across the country in expressing deep gratitude for our
wildland firefighters who heroically protect our communities and natural
resources from wildfires.   
  
Recognizing their service and sacrifice on this day is especially
important because we continue to ask more of them year after year. In
the past year and a half, I’ve met firefighters in Idaho, California,
Colorado, and New Mexico who work night and day to keep people safe, all
while fires are getting larger, more intense, and more difficult to
control because of climate change, the accumulation of hazardous fuels
in our forests, and evolving land development patterns.   
  
Firefighters can spend months away from their loved ones, courageously
working to save lives, homes, schools, businesses, natural resources,
and wilderness areas.  Beyond fighting fires, these dedicated women and
men also work year-round to protect us from wildfires before they start
by doing the important fuels management work needed to reduce the
likelihood of catastrophic fire. This work is tough and extremely
dangerous.   

That’s why my Administration continues to make supporting this workforce
a top priority.  [Building on what I initiated last
year](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/30/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-acts-to-address-the-growing-wildfire-threat/),
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law authorized historic new initiatives
and resources for wildland firefighters that we are implementing now.
[This includes a substantial
pay](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-pay-raises-supports-for-wildland-firefighter-workforce-from-bipartisan-infrastructure-law/)
increase, new programs to support wildland firefighter mental and
physical health, and the creation of a wildland firefighter job series
that will improve recruitment, retention, and opportunities for
professional growth. 

We are also building our firefighting workforce, including converting
more temporary firefighting positions to permanent jobs.  And we’re
further supporting our brave firefighters by doing everything we can to
help reduce the risk of catastrophic fires, including proposing a nearly
60 percent increase in hazardous fuels management funds in my Fiscal
Year 2023 Budget Request, and investing another $2.5 billion in this
work over the next five years through my Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law.  
  
National Wildland Firefighter Day will occur annually during the
previously established wildland firefighter Week of Remembrance.  I’ve
attended too many memorial services for the fallen, including almost
nine years to the day, honoring 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters
who died fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire in Arizona.  They were some of
the strongest, most disciplined, tenacious, physically fit firefighters
in the world.  So, this week we will also reflect on those firefighters
who have fallen in the line of duty and renew our commitment to wildland
firefighter safety.  We pause to remember them, commemorate their
selfless service, and thank their loved ones for their service and many
sacrifices.  
  
May God bless firefighters and their families across our Nation.
