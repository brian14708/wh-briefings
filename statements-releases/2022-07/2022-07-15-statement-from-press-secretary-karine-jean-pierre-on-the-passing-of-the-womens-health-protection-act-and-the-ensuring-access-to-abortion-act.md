title: "Statement From Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the\_Passing of the Women\u2019\
  s Health Protection Act and the Ensuring Access to Abortion\_Act"
---
 
This week, we’ve seen the deeply different approaches that Congressional
Democrats and Congressional Republicans have for women’s health. Today,
House Democrats took an important step in passing the Women’s Health
Protection Act and Ensuring Access to Abortion Act. These bills would
ensure women’s access to essential health care services, regardless of
where they live, and protect the bedrock right to cross state lines for
medical care. A majority of Americans across the country support them.
Every single Republican voted against the bill to codify women’s right
to choose and nearly every single House Republican voted against the
right to travel. Senate Republicans blocked a similar bill that would
make the right to travel to access medical care a law. It’s extreme and
it’s out of touch.
