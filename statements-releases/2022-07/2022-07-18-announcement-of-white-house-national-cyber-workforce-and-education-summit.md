title: "Announcement of White\_House National Cyber Workforce and Education\_Summit"
---
 
On Tuesday, July 19, 2022, National Cyber Director Chris Inglis will
convene a National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit at the White
House with Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo; Secretary of Labor
Martin J. Walsh; Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas;
Ambassador Susan E. Rice, Director of the Domestic Policy Council; Under
Secretary of Education James Kvaal; Director of the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency Jen Easterly; Anne Neuberger, Deputy
Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for
Cyber and Emerging Technology on the National Security Council; other
senior representatives from the Federal Government; private sector
executives; and thought leaders from across the cyber community and
academia. 

With approximately 700,000 cybersecurity positions open, America faces a
national security challenge that must be tackled aggressively. During
the Summit, participants will help chart a path toward a more secure
future in which all Americans have the opportunity to raise the bar on
cybersecurity through greater awareness, education, and training. The
Summit will also serve as a call to action – to ensure that all
Americans can capitalize on the benefits of the digital domain and to
ensure that our Nation carries through on the positive opportunities
ahead of us.

At the Summit, participants will discuss:

-   The need to create and prioritize new skills-based pathways to
    cybersecurity jobs, including at community colleges, through
    Registered Apprenticeships, and via non-traditional training
    opportunities for Americans who can help defend our country and make
    a good living for themselves and their families. Training models
    such as Registered Apprenticeships can allow career seekers to earn
    and learn at the same time while often obtaining college credit,
    degrees, and a nationally recognized credential.
-   How in filling these open cybersecurity positions, the United States
    has an opportunity to build pipelines for historically untapped
    talent, including underserved and diverse communities, to reach jobs
    that often pay well and do not require a four-year degree.
-   And how investing in cyber training and education will: (1) enable
    Americans who comprise the lifeblood of our economy – including
    those building the next generation of our Nation’s infrastructure –
    to be successful in our digital economy; and (2) empower society to
    harness cyber capabilities to achieve our individual and collective
    aspirations.
