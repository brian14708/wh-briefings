President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke today with President Xi Jinping of
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The call was a part of the Biden
Administration’s efforts to maintain and deepen lines of communication
between the United States and the PRC and responsibly manage our
differences and work together where our interests align. The call
follows the two leaders’ conversation on March 18<sup>th</sup> and a
series of conversations between high-level U.S. and PRC officials. The
two presidents discussed a range of issues important to the bilateral
relationship and other regional and global issues, and tasked their
teams to continue following up on today’s conversation, in particular
to address climate change and health security. On Taiwan, President
Biden underscored that the United States policy has not changed and that
the United States strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the
status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
