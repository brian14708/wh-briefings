title: "Statement by the President on the Bipartisan Confirmation of Career Prosecutor\
  \ Steve Dettelbach to be the First Senate-Confirmed ATF Director in 7\_Years"
---
 
As I’ve made clear time and time again, the answer to the rise in crime
my administration inherited is not to defund law enforcement; it’s to
provide law enforcement with the resources and support they need to 
succeed in working effectively with the communities they serve.

The Senate just took an important, bipartisan step by confirming Steve
Dettelbach, an extraordinarily qualified and decorated career prosecutor
with strong support across the law enforcement community, to be the
first permanent head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives in over 7 years.

Steve’s distinguished prosecutorial experience spans over two decades at
the Department of Justice under four different administrations, two
Republican and two Democratic. His work and reputation have earned him
the support of former ATF directors who’ve led the department over the
last 40 years, in addition to a wide range of law enforcement
organizations and leaders, including police chiefs and sheriffs across
the country. He was also endorsed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Following the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, today’s
vote is another important sign that both parties can come together to
support law enforcement and stand up against the horrific scourge of gun
violence. I thank the Senate for their support. And it is my hope that
we can continue working together to keep Americans safe – especially our
children – from mass shootings like those in Uvalde, Buffalo, and
Highland Park, as well as the daily acts of gun violence that don’t make
national headlines.

We have so much more to do. I will continue to call on Congress to build
on this momentum and ban assault weapons, expand background checks, and
pass safe storage laws. At the same time, my Administration will build
on our record of taking historic executive action. And as ATF Director,
Steve will play a leading role in ensuring robust implementation of the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and driving forward other executive
actions to fight crime and save lives.
