Director Jim Murray has led a long and distinguished career in federal
and military service for three decades, including the last three years
as Director of the United States Secret Service.Â Jim embodies the
meaning of service over self, and protected the families of U.S.
Presidents like they were part of his own. We are incredibly grateful
for his service to our country and our family.
