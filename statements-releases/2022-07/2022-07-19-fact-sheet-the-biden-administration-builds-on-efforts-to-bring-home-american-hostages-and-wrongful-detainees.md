title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration Builds on Efforts to Bring Home American\
  \ Hostages and Wrongful\_Detainees"
---
 
Today, President Biden reaffirms his commitment to bring home Americans
held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad by issuing a new executive
order (E.O.), *Bolstering Efforts to Bring Hostages and Wrongfully
Detained United States Nationals Home*. This E.O. expands the tools
available to deter and disrupt hostage-taking and wrongful detentions.
 It creates new ways to impose costs on terrorist organizations,
criminal groups, and other malicious actors who take hostages for
financial, political, or other gains and thus threaten the integrity of
the international political system and the safety of U.S. nationals and
other persons abroad.  This E.O. advances the unwavering commitment of
the United States to bring home Americans who are held hostage or
wrongfully detained.  
  
In addition, the Biden-Harris Administration is introducing a new risk
indicator—the “D” indicator—to the State Department’s Travel Advisories
to inform American travelers of the risk of wrongful detention by a
foreign government.  This additional risk indicator will highlight the
elevated risk that Americans face in particular countries and provide
Americans with comprehensive safety and security information with which
to make informed travel decisions.  The “D” indicator joins the existing
“K” indicator that covers risk of kidnapping and hostage-taking by
non-state actors, as well as a range of other existing risk indicators. 
State Department Travel Advisories are continuously revised and updated
based on a comprehensive review of all available safety information and
ongoing developments.  
  
The executive order will generate expanded and enhanced ways to address
the hostage-taking and wrongful detention of Americans abroad.  This
E.O. reflects the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued commitment to
bringing them home.  In particular, this E.O. draws on the 2020
Robert *Levinson* Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking
Accountability *Act and* reinforces the Administration’s tool kit in key
ways.  Specifically, this E.O.:

-   Reinforces the U.S. Government’s efforts to support families of
    Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage overseas;
-   Authorizes agencies to impose costs and consequences, including
    financial sanctions, on those who are involved, directly or
    indirectly, in hostage-taking or wrongful detentions to support
    expanded and ongoing interagency efforts; 
-   Directs relevant parts of the U.S. Government to bolster their
    engagement and sharing of relevant information, including
    intelligence information, consistent with the protection of sources
    and methods, with families regarding their loved ones’ status and
    U.S. Government efforts to secure their release or return, as
    appropriate; and
-   Charges experts across the interagency to develop options and
    strategies to deter future hostage-taking and wrongful detentions.

This E.O. is informed by our regular communications with the families
and other stakeholders who have undertaken incredible advocacy efforts
on behalf of their loved ones.  The Biden-Harris Administration
appreciates the continued diligence of such families and considers them
essential partners in our efforts to bring Americans home.  President
Biden and experts across the Administration will draw on this E.O. to
advance our efforts and remain committed to reuniting Americans held
hostage and wrongfully detained with their families.
