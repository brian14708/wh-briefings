title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Inflation Reduction Act of\_2022"
---
 
This afternoon, I spoke with Senators Schumer and Manchin and offered
my support for the agreement they have reached on a bill to fight
inflation and lower costs for American families.  

With this agreement, we have a chance to make prescription drugs
cheaper by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prices and we can lower
health insurance costs for 13 million Americans, by an average of $800 a
year, for families covered under the Affordable Care Act.  

We will improve our energy security and tackle the climate crisis –
by providing tax credits and investments for energy projects.   This
will create thousands of new jobs and help lower energy costs in the
future.

This bill will reduce the deficit beyond the record setting $1.7
trillion in deficit reduction we have already achieved this year, which
will help fight inflation as well.  

And we will pay for all of this by requiring big corporations to pay
their fair share of taxes, with no tax increases at all for families
making under $400,000 a year.

This is the action the American people have been waiting for.  This
addresses the problems of today – high health care costs and overall
inflation – as well as investments in our energy security for the
future.  

I will have more to say on this later.  For now, I want to thank Senator
Schumer and Senator Manchin for the extraordinary effort that it took to
reach this result.  

If enacted, this legislation will be historic, and I urge the Senate to
move on this bill as soon as possible, and for the House to follow as
well.
