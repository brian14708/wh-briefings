title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden to Sign Executive Order Protecting Access to\
  \ Reproductive Health Care\_Services"
---
 
Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court issued a decision that overturned *Roe
v. Wade* and eliminated a woman’s Constitutional right to choose.  This
decision expressly took away a right from the American people that it
had recognized for nearly 50 years – a woman’s right to make her own
reproductive health care decisions, free from government interference. 
Fundamental rights – to privacy, autonomy, freedom, and equality – have
been denied to millions of women across the country, with grave
implications for their health, lives, and wellbeing. This ruling will
disproportionately affect women of color, low-income women, and rural
women.  
  
President Biden has made clear that the only way to secure a woman’s
right to choose is for Congress to restore the protections of *Roe* as
federal law. Until then, he has committed to doing everything in his
power to defend reproductive rights and protect access to safe and legal
abortion.  
  
Today, President Biden will sign an Executive Order Protecting Access to
Reproductive Health Care Services. This Executive Order builds on the
actions his Administration has already taken to defend reproductive
rights by:

-   Safeguarding access to reproductive health care services, including
    abortion and contraception;  
-   Protecting the privacy of patients and their access to accurate
    information;  
-   Promoting the safety and security of patients, providers, and
    clinics; and  
-   Coordinating the implementation of Federal efforts to protect
    reproductive rights and access to health care.

**SAFEGUARDING ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES**  
  
The President has directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services
(HHS) to take the following actions and submit a report to him within 30
days on efforts to:

-   **Protect Access to Medication Abortion.**  HHS will take additional
    action to protect and expand access to abortion care, including
    access to medication that the FDA approved as safe and effective
    over twenty years ago. These actions will build on the steps the
    Secretary of HHS has already taken at the President’s direction
    following the decision to ensure that medication abortion is as
    widely accessible as possible.  
-   **Ensure Emergency Medical Care.**  HHS will take steps to ensure
    all patients – including pregnant women and those experiencing
    pregnancy loss – have access to the full rights and protections for
    emergency medical care afforded under the law, including by
    considering updates to current guidance that clarify physician
    responsibilities and protections under the Emergency Medical
    Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).   
-   **Protect Access to Contraception.**  HHS will take additional
    actions to expand access to the full range of reproductive health
    services, including family planning services and providers, such as
    access to emergency contraception and long-acting reversible
    contraception like intrauterine devices (IUDs).  In all fifty states
    and the District of Columbia, the Affordable Care Act guarantees
    coverage of women’s preventive services, including free birth
    control and contraceptive counseling, for individuals and covered
    dependents. The Secretary of HHS has already directed the Centers
    for Medicare and Medicaid Services to take every legally available
    step to ensure patient access to family planning care and to protect
    family planning providers.  
-   **Launch Outreach and Public Education Efforts. ** HHS will increase
    outreach and public education efforts regarding access to
    reproductive health care services—including abortion—to ensure that
    Americans have access to reliable and accurate information about
    their rights and access to care.  
-   **Convene Volunteer Lawyers.**  The Attorney General and the White
    House Counsel will convene private pro bono attorneys, bar
    associations, and public interest organizations to encourage robust
    legal representation of patients, providers, and third parties
    lawfully seeking or offering reproductive health care services
    throughout the country.  Such representation could include
    protecting the right to travel out of state to seek medical care.
    Immediately following the Supreme Court decision, the President
    announced his Administration’s position that Americans must remain
    free to travel safely to another state to seek the care they need,
    as [the Attorney General made clear in his
    statement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s),
    and his commitment to fighting any attack by a state or local
    official who attempts to interfere with women exercising this right.

**PROTECTING PATIENT PRIVACY AND ACCESS TO ACCURATE INFORMATION**  
  
The President’s Executive Order takes additional steps to protect
patient privacy, including by addressing the transfer and sales of
sensitive health-related data, combatting digital surveillance related
to reproductive health care services, and protecting people seeking
reproductive health care from inaccurate information, fraudulent
schemes, or deceptive practices.  The Executive Order will:

-   **Protect Consumers from Privacy Violations and Fraudulent and
    Deceptive Practices.**  The President has asked the Chair of the
    Federal Trade Commission to consider taking steps to protect
    consumers’ privacy when seeking information about and provision of
    reproductive health care services.  The President also has directed
    the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Attorney General and
    Chair of the FTC, to consider options to address deceptive or
    fraudulent practices, including online, and protect access to
    accurate information.
-   **Protect Sensitive Health Information.**  HHS will consider
    additional actions, including under the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA), to better protect sensitive
    information related to reproductive health care. The Secretary of
    HHS has already directed the HHS Office for Civil Rights to take
    initial steps to ensure patient privacy and nondiscrimination of
    patients, as well as providers who provide reproductive health care,
    including by:  
    -   Issuing [new
        guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/phi-reproductive-health/index.html)
        to address how the HIPAA Privacy Rule protects the privacy of
        individuals’ protected health information, including information
        related to reproductive health care. The guidance helps ensure
        doctors and other medical providers and health plans know that,
        with limited exceptions, they are not required – and in many
        cases, are not permitted – to disclose patients’ private
        information, including to law enforcement.   
    -   Issuing [a how-to
        guide](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/cell-phone-hipaa/index.html)
        for consumers on steps they can take to make sure they’re
        protecting their personal data on mobile apps.

**PROMOTING SAFETY AND SECURITY**  
  
The Executive Order addresses the heightened risk related to seeking and
providing reproductive health care and will:

-   **Protect Patients, Providers, and Clinics.**  The Administration
    will ensure the safety of patients, providers, and third parties,
    and to protect the security of other entities that are providing,
    dispensing, or delivering reproductive health care services.  This
    charge includes efforts to protect mobile clinics, which have been
    deployed to borders to offer care for out-of-state patients. 

**COORDINATING IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS**  
  
To ensure the Federal government takes a swift and coordinated approach
to addressing reproductive rights and protecting access to reproductive
health care, the President’s Executive Order will:

-   **Establish an Interagency Task Force.**  The President has directed
    HHS and the White House Gender Policy Council to establish and lead
    an interagency Task Force on Reproductive Health Care Access,
    responsible for coordinating Federal interagency policymaking and
    program development.  This Task Force will also include the Attorney
    General.  In addition, the Attorney General will provide technical
    assistance to states affording legal protection to out-of-state
    patients as well as providers who offer legal reproductive health
    care. 

**EXECUTIVE ORDER BUILDS ON ADMINISTRATION’S ACTIONS TO PROTECT ACCESS
TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE**  
  
In addition to the actions announced today, the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken the following steps to protect access to
reproductive health care and defend reproductive rights in the wake of
the Supreme Court decision in *Dobbs*.  On the day of the decision, [the
President strongly denounced the
decision](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-court-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/)
as an affront to women’s fundamental rights and the right to choose In
addition to action mentioned above, the Biden-Harris Administration is:

-   **Supporting Providers and Clinics. ** The Secretary of HHS directed
    all HHS agencies to ensure that all HHS-funded providers and clinics
    have appropriate training and resources to handle family planning
    needs, and [announced nearly $3 million in new
    funding](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/06/30/hhs-announces-new-grants-to-bolster-family-planner-provider-training.html)
    to bolster training and technical assistance for the nationwide
    network of Title X family planning providers.  
-   **Promoting Access to Accurate Information.**  On the day of the
    Supreme Court’s decision, HHS launched
    [ReproductiveRights.gov](https://reproductiverights.gov/), which
    provides timely and accurate information about reproductive rights
    and access to reproductive health care.  This includes
    know-your-rights information for patients and providers and
    promoting awareness of and access to family planning services, as
    well as guidance for [how to file a patient privacy or
    nondiscrimination
    complaint](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints/index.html) with its
    Office for Civil Rights.   
-   **Providing Leave** **for Federal Workers Traveling for Medical
    Care. ** The Office of Personnel Management [issued
    guidance](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/sick-leave-faqs.pdf)
    affirming that paid sick leave can be taken to cover absences for
    travel to obtain reproductive health care.  
-   **Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services for Service
    members, DoD Civilians, and Military Families.**  The Department of
    Defense (DoD) issued a memo to the Force, DoD civilians and military
    families on ensuring access to essential women’s health care
    services. The memo reiterates that the Department will continue to
    provide seamless access to reproductive healthcare for military and
    civilian patients, as permitted by federal law.  Military providers
    will continue to fulfill their duty to care for Service members,
    military dependents and civilian personnel who require pregnancy
    termination in the cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of
    the mother.
