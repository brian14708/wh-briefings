title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Senate Passage of the CHIPS and Science Act\
  \ to Lower Costs, Bolster Our Competitive Edge and National\_Security"
---
 
Today the Senate passed an historic bill that will lower costs and
create jobs.  As Americans are worried about the state of the economy
and the cost of living, the CHIPS bill is one answer: it will accelerate
the manufacturing of semiconductors in America, lowering prices on
everything from cars to dishwashers.  It also will create jobs –
good-paying jobs right here in the United States.  It will mean more
resilient American supply chains, so we are never so reliant on foreign
countries for the critical technologies that we need for American
consumers and national security. I want to thank Senators in both
parties for their hard work on this legislation.  
  
For decades, some “experts” said we needed to give up on manufacturing
in America.  I never believed that.  Manufacturing jobs are back. 
Thanks to this bill, we are going to have even more of them.  The House
should promptly pass it and send this bill to my desk.
