title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Opening of Saudi\_\
  Airspace"
---
 
President Biden welcomes and commends the historic decision by the
leadership of Saudi Arabia to open Saudi airspace to all civilian
carriers without discrimination, a decision that includes flights to and
from Israel. This decision is the result of the Presidentâ€™s persistent
and principled diplomacy with Saudi Arabia over many months, culminating
in his visit today. This decision paves the way for a more integrated,
stable, and secure Middle East region, which is vital for the security
and prosperity of the United States and the American people, and for the
security and prosperity of Israel. The President will have more to say
on this breakthrough later today, as we embark on his historic flight
directly from Israel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
