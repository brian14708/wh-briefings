title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Launches Effort to Create More\
  \ Affordable and Equitable Outdoor Recreation\_Opportunities"
---
 
As part of the President’s America the Beautiful Initiative, the
Biden-Harris Administration today launched an interagency effort, called
the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR), that will
work to create more safe, affordable, and equitable opportunities for
Americans to get outdoors.

The FICOR – which includes leaders from the Departments of the Interior,
Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense – will focus on improving access to
nature, expanding outdoor recreation opportunities, and providing the
public with improved and more affordable experiences on America’s public
lands and waters.

Increasing access to outdoor recreation is one of the six areas of focus
outlined in President Biden’s America the Beautiful Initiative. The
FICOR will help coordinate policies, facilitate partnerships, and
improve implementation on issues such as:  

-   Investing in resilient recreation infrastructure, such as electric
    vehicle charging stations, trails, campgrounds, visitor centers,
    docks, and boating access;
-   Bolstering education and career opportunities in conservation,
    outdoor recreation, habitat restoration, and resource management
    work, and  providing comprehensive visitor information for the
    hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, birding, climbing, and boating
    communities;
-   Cooperating with State, Tribal, territorial, and local governments,
    including those in communities near Federal lands and waters; and
-   Improving equitable access to Federal lands and waters and creating
    a welcoming visitor experience in collaboration with private,
    public, Tribal, and nonprofit organizations.

The launch of the FICOR renews and re-energizes a body that was
originally created in 2011 but was suspended by the previous
administration. Prior to being suspended, the FICOR successfully
launched [recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/), helped the
[Bureau of Economic
Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/outdoor-recreation-satellite-account-us-and-states-2020)
begin tracking outdoor recreation as an economic sector, and worked to
establish the [*Every Kid* *Outdoors*
*Pass*](https://www.everykidoutdoors.gov/pass.htm).

With outdoor recreation continuing to grow rapidly as an economic
sector, including by contributing [1.8 percent of GDP and generating
$374.3
billion](https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/outdoor-recreation-satellite-account-us-and-states-2020)
in economic output, and America’s parks and public lands experiencing
record-level visitation, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking
unprecedented steps to expand equitable access to the outdoors and to
protect natural, cultural, and historic resources.

In addition to launching the FICOR, the Administration has:

-   **Launched historic investments through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law in the restoration of Federal lands and waters,
    including by improving availability of and equitable access to
    outdoor recreation opportunities**.
    -   Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo announced funding
        opportunities from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
        Administration’s (NOAA) $2.96 billion in Bipartisan
        Infrastructure Law funds to address the climate crisis and
        strengthen coastal resilience and infrastructure. Over the next
        five years, NOAA’s targeted investments in the areas of habitat
        restoration, coastal resilience, and climate data and services
        will advance ongoing Federal efforts toward building climate
        resilience. Projects focused on building “Climate Ready Coasts”
        will invest in natural infrastructure projects that power
        outdoor recreation along our coasts by restoring coastal
        habitats, removing marine debris, storing carbon, and creating
        jobs.

    -   As the largest Federal provider of water-based outdoor
        recreation in America, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
        is investing $120 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
        and the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022
        to improve recreation facilities across the nation. These
        investments will promote equitable access to outdoor recreation
        opportunities and support local communities. USACE recreation
        areas had 268 million visits in the last fiscal year, resulting
        in spending that supports approximately 217,000 jobs and
        generates nearly $14.5 billion for local economies.
-   **Expanded hunting and sport fishing opportunities on National
    Wildlife Refuge System lands and waters.**

        System](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-largest-expansion-fishing-and-hunting-us-fish-and)
        lands and waters in 2021, the largest expansion of outdoor
        recreation opportunities in recent history. The Department is
        continuing to explore opportunities to provide additional access
        to refuge system lands. Hunting, fishing, and other outdoor
        activities contributed more than $156 billion in economic
        activity in communities across the United States in 2016,
        according to the Service’s National Survey of Fishing, Hunting,
        and Wildlife-Associated Recreation, published every five years.
        More than 101 million Americans — 40 percent of the U.S.
        population age 16 and older — pursue wildlife-related
        recreation, including hunting and fishing.

        in Northwest Montana as the 568th and newest unit of the
        National Wildlife Refuge System, managed by the U.S. Fish and
        Wildlife Service. This expansion – the first new unit in the
        Refuge System for the Biden-Harris Administration – is the
        culmination of a 20-year, locally-led effort to conserve
        important big game corridors and recreational areas in the
        region. The Service worked in partnership with the Trust for
        Public Land and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes
        (CSKT) to purchase the 38,052-acre conservation easement from
        its continuing owner, Southern Pine Plantations.

    -   The USDA Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management [are
        considering](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/06/23/usda-forest-service-announces-plans-open-comments-rainy-river)
        a 20-year withdrawal of 225,000 acres of U.S. Forest System
        lands in Minnesota to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area
        Wilderness – the most visited wilderness area in the country.
        The Rainy River watershed flows north toward the Boundary Waters
        Canoe Area Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park, landscapes
        renowned for high-quality fishing, wildlife viewing, and
        recreational opportunities due to the large number of
        interconnected lakes and pristine water quality. The proposed
        mineral withdrawal aims to prevent further negative
        environmental impacts from future mining operations. It also
        evaluates the impacts of future mining on important social,
        cultural, and economic values.
