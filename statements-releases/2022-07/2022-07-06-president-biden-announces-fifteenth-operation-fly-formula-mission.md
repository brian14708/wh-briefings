*Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of over 3.1 million
8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula on July 17 and 22*

  
Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
a flight, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Kendamil baby
formula from England to New York, NY via flights on July 17 and 22
respectively. These two deliveries will include in total approximately
200,000 pounds of Kendamil EU Classic First Infant Milk Stage 1 and
Kendamil EU Organic First Infant Milk Stage 1, the equivalent of
approximately 3.1 million 8-ounce bottles. The product will be available
at Target stores. Parents and Pediatricians can learn more about
Kendamil infant formula at <https://us.kendamil.com>  and compare its
nutritional content per 100kcal with other leading formula brands at
<https://us.kendamil.com/pages/compare-kendamil>.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency
is exercising enforcement discretion so that Kendamil can export
additional infant formula into the U.S., including Kendamil EU Classic
First Infant Milk Stage 1 and Kendamil EU Organic First Infant Milk
Stage 1. Kendamil plans to export approximately 58 million 8-ounce
bottle equivalents into the U.S. market over the next 6 months.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S.
health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. By
July 10, Operation Fly Formula will have transported more than 43
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S.

In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
at whitehouse.gov/formula.
