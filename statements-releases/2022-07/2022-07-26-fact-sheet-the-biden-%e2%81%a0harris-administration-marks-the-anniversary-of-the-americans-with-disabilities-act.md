title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Marks the Anniversary of\
  \ the Americans with Disabilities\_Act"
---
 
Today, on the 32nd Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), we celebrate the inclusion and access promoted by this landmark
civil rights law for disabled Americans. Grounded in four core outcomes
of full participation, equal opportunity, independent living, and
economic self-sufficiency, the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis
of disability in public accommodations, employment, transportation, and
community living and provides recourse for people with disabilities who
faced discrimination. The nation has made significant progress since the
law was signed, but there is more work to do to live up to the promise
of the ADA.  

Today, President Biden signed a proclamation marking the 32<sup>nd</sup>
anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Vice President
Harris is meeting with advocates from the disability community. Vice
President Harris and advocates will discuss reproductive rights and the
impact the overturning of Roe v. Wade will have on people with
disabilities.

Over the past year the Biden-Harris Administration has taken additional
steps to build on our record of advancing equity for Americans with
disabilities.

**Expanding Competitive Integrated Employment Opportunities**

-   People with disabilities experience [higher rates of
    unemployment](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/research-evaluation/statistics),
    they receive only a [fraction of the minimum wage or market
    salary](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/workers-with-disabilities/section-14c/certificate-holders#:~:text=The%20following%20employers%20hold%20or,for%20the%20work%20they%20perform.)
    for performing the same work, and many are [segregated away from
    traditional
    work](https://www.ncd.gov/publications/2018/new-deal-real-deal).
    This month the Departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human
    Services, and the Social Security Administration will issue a joint
    memorandum identifying all available resources to help state and
    local government agencies, employers, and non-profit organizations
    make it easier for individuals with disabilities to successfully
    obtain and engage in competitive integrated employment. The guidance
    will encourage these entities to, where possible, mix and match
    resources such as funding sources, staff supports, and equipment
    from different agencies.

-   [Section 511 of the Rehabilitation
    Act](https://dhs.sd.gov/rehabservices/docs/Section_511_Act.pdf) and
    [Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards
    Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/workers-with-disabilities)
    limit employers’ ability to pay less than minimum wages to workers
    with disabilities. To help disabled workers understand their rights
    under federal law and to ensure employers comply with those
    requirements and do not discriminate, the Department of Labor
    published a [Field Assistance
    Bulletin](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/fab/2022-4.pdf)
    in June 2022 on when the Department of Labor can—and will—enforce
    these laws against employers.

**Ensuring Access to Educational Programs and Supportive Services**

-   The American Rescue Plan (ARP) provided more than $3 billion to fund
    the Department of Education’s Individuals with Disabilities
    Education Act (IDEA) [formula
    grants](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/leg/arp/index.html) so
    that all 50 states, Tribes, and territories could help more children
    with disabilities recover from the pandemic and succeed in the
    classroom. In addition, through the FY22 Omnibus, President Biden
    secured an additional $14.5 billion to support the education of
    students with disabilities, including $13.3 billion for Part B
    grants to states to support school-aged children with disabilities
    and $905 million for grants to support early childhood intervention
    services.  

<!-- -->

-   **Expanded school-based health services.** Funding from the ARP is
    increasing student access to school-based health services, including
    mental health services. To date, the number of school social workers
    has increased by 53% and the number of counselors by 18% since the
    years before the pandemic. In addition, to ensure young people with
    disabilities, including those with developmental delays, receive the
    supportive services they need, the Departments of Education and
    Health and Human Services issued [joint
    recommendations](https://www2.ed.gov/documents/students/hhs-ed-dcl-early-childhood-mental-health-20220615.pdf)
    in June 2022 for improving collaboration and coordination between
    education and public health officials to meet the socio-emotional
    development and mental health needs of young children, as well as
    the needs of their families, from the prenatal period through age 5.

<!-- -->

-   **Helped schools fulfill their responsibility to meet the needs of
    students with disabilities.** The Department of Education released
    [two guidance
    documents](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-guidance-helps-schools-support-students-disabilities-and-avoid-discriminatory-use-discipline)
    and a [resource
    guide](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/files/guide-positive-proactive-approaches-to-supporting-children-with-disabilities.pdf)
    on how to avoid discriminatory school discipline on students with
    disabilities.

**Securing Access to High-Quality, Affordable Health Care**

-   **Improved Equitable Access to Health Care.** The Department of
    Health and Human Services (HHS) invested $150 million in ARP funding
    in disability and aging networks to expand the capacity of state and
    local public health systems to meet the needs of people with
    disabilities and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS
    deployed [innovative
    approaches](https://acl.gov/covid19/vaccination-and-booster-resources-our-networks)
    to help people with disabilities and older adults get their COVID-19
    vaccines and boosters, such as in-home options, accessible
    vaccination sites, transportation supports, and mobile vaccination
    units. The Health Resources and Services Administration has
    distributed more than six million N95 masks and nearly 7 million
    at-home self-test kits, of which 31% were given to older adults
    and/or individuals with disabilities. In June 2022, the
    Administration [launched an
    initiative](https://acl.gov/covid19/tests-people-who-are-blind-or-have-low-vision)
    to provide more than 2 million free accessible at-home COVID-19
    tests nationwide for people who are blind or have low vision.

<!-- -->

-   **Increased Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Funding.** To
    ensure people with disabilities receive the care they need,
    President Biden’s ARP temporarily increased Medicaid funding for
    home and community-based services (HCBS). Every state elected to
    participate in this program and has submitted a detailed plan for
    how they will use these funds. The administration estimates that
    this change will ultimately result in $25 billion in increased
    funding, allowing states to develop [innovative ways to address
    existing HCBS workforce and structural
    issues](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/home-community-based-services/guidance/strengthening-and-investing-home-and-community-based-services-for-medicaid-beneficiaries-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-section-9817/index.html),
    expand the capacity of critical services, and begin to meet the
    needs of people with disabilities, family caregivers, and providers.
    In June 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services [notified
    states](https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/smd22002.pdf)
    that they now have an additional year — through March 31, 2025 — to
    use funding made available by the ARP.

<!-- -->

-   **Strengthening the Home Care Workforce.** One in eight Medicaid
    enrollees (or about 11 million Americans) is an individual with
    disabilities. In order to live independently, many people with
    disabilities require home care. During the pandemic, 38 states
    reported that at least one Medicaid home care provider permanently
    closed during the pandemic, hindering people with disabilities from
    accessing services they need to live independently. This fall, HHS,
    in collaboration with the Department of Labor, will launch a
    technical assistance center to help states and communities leverage
    existing federal funding opportunities to increase the number of
    home care workers.

<!-- -->

-   **Combatting Long COVID.** In April 2022, the President issued a
    [Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/05/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-accelerates-whole-of-government-effort-to-prevent-detect-and-treat-long-covid/)
    directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate a
    new whole-of-government approach to prevent, detect, and treat Long
    COVID. HHS will produce two reports as a result: one that provides
    the first-ever interagency national research action plan on Long
    COVID; and a second that outlines services and supports across
    federal agencies to assist people experiencing Long COVID,
    individuals who are dealing with a COVID-related loss, and people
    who are experiencing mental health and substance use issues related
    to the pandemic.

**Expanding Access to Affordable Housing, Transportation, and
Broadband**

-   **Investing in accessible transportation.** The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides funds to improve accessibility for
    all riders on U.S. rail systems. Today, the Federal Transit
    Administration (FTA) is announcing the first $343 million of $1.75
    billion that will be awarded to transit agencies this year to make
    it easier for people to get on board at the nation’s oldest rail
    public transportation systems. The funding will help agencies
    retrofit subway stations so people who need an elevator,
    escalator, or ramp – including people who use wheelchairs or have
    limited mobility – can reliably access the rail systems serving
    their communities. 

<!-- -->

-   **Launched a new Housing and Services Resource Center.** In December
    2021, the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Health
    and Human Services launched a new joint [Housing and Services
    Resource Center (HSRC)](https://acl.gov/HousingAndServices) for
    people who provide housing resources and homelessness services,
    behavioral and mental health services, independent living services
    and other supportive services to help people with disabilities and
    older adults live independently in the community. 

<!-- -->

-   **Expanded Broadband Access.** Sixty-nine percent of people with
    disabilities who live just above the federal poverty threshold and
    over 66% of those who live below that threshold do not have internet
    access in their homes despite the internet being a vital platform
    for people with disabilities. BIL provides $14.2 billion to develop
    a robust, longer-term broadband affordability program. The Federal
    Communications Commission’s [Affordable Connectivity Program
    (ACP)](https://www.fcc.gov/acp) is providing a discount on broadband
    services and connected devices to households with incomes at or
    below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines ($27,180 for a family
    of 1).

**Ensure Full Inclusion of People with Disabilities in the Federal
Government and Enforce the Civil Rights of People with Disabilities**

-   **Advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA)
    in the federal workforce.** Executive Order (EO) 14035 on Diversity,
    Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce
    launched a whole-of-government initiative to cultivate a diverse
    federal workforce and expand its scope to include equity and
    accessibility. To deliver upon the Administration’s [DEIA strategic
    plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Strategic-Plan-to-Advance-Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-and-Accessibility-in-the-Federal-Workforce-11.23.21.pdf),
    in March 2022, federal agencies finalized key steps they will take
    to strengthen their workforce policies, practices, and culture to be
    more accessible for people with disabilities, such as improving the
    accessibility of their websites, enhancing technological access and
    supports for employees with disabilities, and fostering
    relationships with universities and institutions who work
    specifically with underserved communities, including people with
    disabilities.

-   **Improving Airport Accessibility and Implementing A Historic
    Airline Passengers with Disabilities Bill of Rights**. In 2021, the
    [GAO reported](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-354.pdf) that
    within one single year airline passengers with disabilities lodged
    30,000 complaints, citing lack of accessibility at airports and on
    planes, customer service challenges, and lack of information on
    disability-related travel concerns. The Biden Administration is
    addressing these issues in two concrete and immediate ways. First,
    earlier this month, the [FAA announced the first $1
    billion](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/biden-administration-announces-nearly-1b-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-funding-improving)
    in competitive airport terminal awards from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. Accessibility enhancements were a key feature of
    terminal project improvements with 73 of the 85 airports’ terminal
    projects containing an element that provides greater access to
    individuals with disabilities. Second, the Department of
    Transportation (DOT), in response to and in collaboration with
    disabled people, recently developed the [Airline Passengers with
    Disabilities Bill of
    Rights](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/disabilitybillofrights).
    This landmark document will empower air travelers with disabilities
    to understand and assert their rights by laying out information on
    seating accommodations, assistance with accessing key functional
    areas of the terminal, and timely resolution of any
    disability-related issues through the intervention of a Complaint
    Resolution Official who should be trained and able to resolve the
    disability-related issue immediately. In addition, the Bill of
    Rights reiterates that passengers with disabilities who are not
    satisfied with air travel services may file a complaint with the
    airline or DOT for resolution. DOT could impose sanctions and
    require the airline to take remedial action to prevent future
    violations.

**Protect and Strengthen Economic Security for People with
Disabilities**

-   **Raised Wages for Federal Contractors to $15 per hour.** AbilityOne
    is a federal procurement program that creates employment
    opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant
    disabilities to manufacture products and provide services to the
    Federal government. Under existing law since 1938, many AbilityOne
    contractors have been able to pay less than the minimum wage to
    their workers with disabilities.As a result of President Biden’s
    [Executive Order
    13658](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/27/executive-order-on-increasing-the-minimum-wage-for-federal-contractors/),
    after January 2022, contractors are required to pay a [minimum wage
    of $15 per
    hour](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/government-contracts/eo14026)
    for workers performing work on or in connection with covered federal
    contracts. In July, AbilityOne published a final rule that codifies
    the wage protections of the EO and expands those protections to
    cover product contracts as well.

-   **Promoting Equitable Access to Unemployment Compensation
    Programs.** With funding from the American Rescue Plan, the
    Department of Labor [issued guidance to states regarding $260
    million](https://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/UIPL/UIPL_23-21.pdf)[ available
    in grants for activities that promote equitable
    access](https://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/UIPL/UIPL_23-21.pdf)
    to unemployment insurance systems, including among people with
    disabilities. To date, the department has announced more than $85
    million in awards to 17 states and the District of Columbia, with
    more awards on the way.

**Advance Global Disability Rights**

-   **Advancing disability-inclusive development and humanitarian action
    around the world.** As a part of the Global Disability Summit (GDS),
    USAID committed to [concrete
    actions](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/feb-16-2022-usaid-announces-commitments-global-disability-summit)
    to support disabled people, including disability inclusion and
    equity as a cross-cutting requirement of all humanitarian assistance
    programming, strengthening disability data and evidence for
    education programming, utilizing best practices and standards,
    championing disability-inclusive climate action, and supporting
    disabled persons organizations to respond to the underlying causes
    of inequality that are worsened by humanitarian emergencies.

**Increasing Access to Democracy for Voters with Disabilities.**

-   [Executive Order 14019 on Voting
    Access](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/),
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published
    a [report about the challenges facing voters with
    disabilities](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1273.pdf),
    which addressed feedback provided by stakeholders from disability
    rights advocates to voting technology vendors. The NIST report
    identified 24 recommendations to reduce systemic barriers; enhance
    voter registration; increase the accessibility of the National Mail
    Voter Registration Form, vote-by-mail, and in-person voting
    technology; increase polling location accessibility; and improve
    poll worker training.
