title: "Statement by President\_Biden Welcoming\_Important Steps Towards EU Integration\_\
  for Albania and North\_Macedonia"
---
 
The United States welcomes the important steps the European Union is
taking to advance the integration of the Western Balkans into the
Euro-Atlantic community by opening EU accession talks with Albania and
North Macedonia. In a moment when Russia has shattered peace in Europe,
it is more important than ever to support the aspiration for a Europe
whole, free, and at peace. A democratic, secure, and prosperous Western
Balkans remains essential to this vision. The United States will
continue to be a strong and reliable partner as those nations work to
defend human rights, strengthen democratic reforms, and uphold the rule
of law. The steps that the EU, Albania, and North Macedonia have taken
in recent days should inspire all EU aspirants in the
region to increase their commitment to strengthening their democracies.
