title: "President\_Biden Names Twenty-Fourth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing the nominations of eight new federal
judicial nominees and his intent to nominate a ninth federal judicial
nominee—all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and
devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.

For example, if confirmed, this slate would include:

• The first openly LGBT judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of California  
• The second Latina to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California  
• The second AAPI woman—and first Chinese American woman—to serve on the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California

This is President Biden’s twenty-fourth round of nominees for federal
judicial positions and his eleventh slate of nominations in 2022,
bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 132.

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
