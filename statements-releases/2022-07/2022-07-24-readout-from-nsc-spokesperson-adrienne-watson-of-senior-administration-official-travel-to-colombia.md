On Friday, July 22, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer
traveled to Colombia and met with President Ivan Duque, President-Elect
Gustavo Petro, Vice President-Elect Francia Marquez, and Colombian
elected officials. He was joined by National Security Advisor to the
Vice President Phil Gordon, Assistant Secretary of State for Western
Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols, and National Security Council Senior
Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez.  

During the visit, Mr. Finer thanked President Duque on behalf of
President Biden for his partnership, particularly his extraordinary
efforts on climate change and regional migration. Mr. Finer also
congratulated the incoming government of President-Elect Petro and Vice
President-Elect Marquez and stressed the Biden-Harris Administration’s
commitment to forging a close relationship, based on the principles of
equal partnership between sovereign nations and building on that
established between successive United States and Colombian
administrations over two centuries.

Mr. Finer and the incoming administration discussed the full range of
issues in the bilateral relationship, with many areas of common ground,
including combating climate change, economic development, particularly
in rural areas, and expanding implementation of Colombia’s 2016 peace
accord. They committed to engage further in the weeks and months ahead.
