Deputy National Security Advisory for Cyber and Emerging Technologies
Anne Neuberger traveled to the Republic of Korea (ROK) July 25-27 to
deepen U.S.-ROK Alliance cooperation on cyber related issues. DNSA
Neuberger’s trip follows up on President Biden’s joint commitment with
President Yoon during his trip to the ROK in May to expand our bilateral
cooperation on regional and international cyber issues and confront
cyber threats, including from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

During her meetings with Korean counterparts, DNSA Neuberger
highlighted the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to working with
our partners to secure critical infrastructure and government systems;
prepare for cyber incidents; reinforce respect for international law and
norms of responsible behavior; and cooperate to deter disruptive and
destabilizing cyber activity. She also highlighted the U.S. commitment
to cooperation with the ROK to combat cybercrime and associated money
laundering, secure cryptocurrency, build capacity, and share
information.
