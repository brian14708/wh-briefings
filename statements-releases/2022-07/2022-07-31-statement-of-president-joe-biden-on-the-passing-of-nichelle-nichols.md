title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Nichelle\_Nichols"
---
 
In Nichelle Nichols, our nation has lost a trailblazer of stage and
screen who redefined what is possible for Black Americans and women.

A daughter of a working-class family from Illinois, she first honed her
craft as an actor and singer in Chicago before touring the country and
the world performing with the likes of Duke Ellington and giving life to
the words of James Baldwin.

During the height of the Civil Rights Movement, she shattered
stereotypes to become the first Black woman to act in a major role on a
primetime television show with her groundbreaking portrayal of Lt. Uhura
in the original Star Trek. With a defining dignity and authority, she
helped tell a central story that reimagined scientific pursuits and
discoveries. And she continued this legacy by going on to work with NASA
to empower generations of Americans from every background to reach for
the stars and beyond.

Our nation is forever indebted to inspiring artists like Nichelle
Nichols, who show us a future where unity, dignity, and respect are
cornerstones of every society.
