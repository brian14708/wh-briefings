REMARKS AS PREPARED

Thank you, Vivian.  I’m grateful to you, Cecilia, and everyone at the
Aspen Institute for spotlighting President Biden’s competition agenda. 
It’s great to be here.

A little over a year ago, President Biden issued a landmark Executive
Order on Competition.  That day, he articulated both the opportunity and
the challenge.  “The heart of American capitalism,” the President
explained, “is a simple idea: open and fair competition.”  But he also
warned that “capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism; it’s
exploitation.”<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>

This isn’t the first time an American President has trained his focus on
competition.  Theodore Roosevelt confronted an economy with industry
after industry dominated by trusts.  Franklin Roosevelt faced a highly
cartelized economy struggling to recover from the Great Depression. 

Both Roosevelts transformed antitrust enforcement in their time and set
precedents for rising to this challenge on behalf of the American
people.  And both Roosevelts understood something important: antitrust
policy doesn’t operate in a vacuum; it is interwoven with the fabric of
the economy. 

Consider one example.  Teddy Roosevelt is of course remembered for
“trust-busting”—in particular against
railroads,<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>
meatpackers,<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and Standard
Oil<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> in the courts.  But his
insight was broader: not only was it necessary to vigorously enforce
antitrust laws, but it was also critical to reshape the regulatory
framework—to work with Congress and to create rules of the road (or
rules of the rail) that kept these early common carriers from using
their market position to privilege incumbents and discriminate against
new entrants.<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>

That basic insight—using tools from across the government to implement
*structural* changes to enhance competition—is more relevant than ever
today.  We face an economy today with challenges impossible for the
Roosevelts to imagine.  But there are familiar echoes.  

For President Biden, a strong competition policy is an indispensable
part of an economic strategy for the twenty-first century.  He believes
driving structural changes that promote competition across the economy
holds the prospect of generating more innovation, productivity, and
opportunity in America, while lowering prices for consumers and raising
wages for workers.

For decades, the competitive attributes of our economy have been
atrophying.  Most industries have become less competitive.  Both
consumers and workers have been left with fewer options.   
  

Reversing these trends is a significant task. It amounts to turning
around the proverbial aircraft carrier.  But now, one year in, we can
begin to see the ship turning in the right direction.  We’ve already
delivered on many key promises, with more announcements coming soon.
 And under the direction of the President’s executive order—and through
our White House Competition Council—we are changing how the government
approaches competition policy, and indeed economic policy.  If done
right, these changes will pay dividends for years to come as we continue
the hard work of shifting course.

Today, I’d like to address the competition challenges we face, the
progress we’ve made during the last year, and the work that lies ahead. 

1.  **Today’s Competition Challenges**

Let’s talk, first, about the competition challenges we’re confronting.

A growing body of academic research has demonstrated our economy is
suffering from a loss of competition and rising corporate concentration.
 Six years ago, my colleagues at the Council of Economic Advisers
sounded the alarm around what they described as “increasing industry
concentration, increasing rents accruing to a few firms, and lower
levels of firm entry and labor market
mobility.”<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>

Those concerns emanated from stark realities: Over the prior decades,
concentration had increased in more than three-quarters of U.S.
industries,<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> while both investment
and labor’s share of the economy
decreased.<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>  This occurred during a
period of both low productivity growth and rising
inequality.<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a>

The core problem involves what economists call excessive market power.
 Careful work by leading thinkers—including Jonathan
Baker,<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Fiona Scott
Morton<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a> and Nancy
Rose<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a>—has documented the rise of
market power.   A striking conclusion comes from a landmark study by
John Kwoka, which surveyed the impact of nearly four dozen major
mergers.  More than 80 percent of those mergers led to price
*increases*.  The average price increase was around 10 percent\[13\]—and
even more dramatic in some industries, like hospital
care<a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a> and airline
tickets.<a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a>

These studies have upended the long-held assumption in some academic
quarters that mergers generally—or indeed inherently—increase efficiency
and lower prices.  The best research does not support that assumption,
and that must inform our approach.

Recent research has also helped underscore how lack of competition can
hurt workers—something that’s particularly important to President Biden.
 Because of work by economists like José
Azar,<a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Ioana
Marinescu,<a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a> Marshall
Steinbaum,<a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a> and Eric
Posner,<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a> we can now see more
clearly how fewer employers competing over the same talent pool reduces
employees’ bargaining power.  A recent Treasury Department report found
that a lack of labor-market competition decreases wages by roughly 20
percent, as compared to a fully competitive
market.<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>  This is one way that
lack of competition has aggravated our inequality
problems.<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a>

In addition, lack of competition can dampen innovation.  The empirical
research favors a competition policy that encourages rival companies to
reduce costs, strengthen quality, and develop new products, while
retaining rewards for
innovation.<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a>  No pressure, no
diamonds.

In short, our competition challenges ripple across our economy, harming
workers, consumers, small businesses, our economic growth and
competitiveness.  One study by Thomas Philippon aggregated the harms
from higher prices and lower wages and found that lack of competition
could be costing the median American household some $5,000 every
year.<a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23">[23]</a>

1.  **President Biden’s Competition Executive Order**

It was against this backdrop that President Biden issued his executive
order last July.<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a>

This historic order has galvanized a government-wide effort to promote
competition across our economy.  At its core, it did three things:

***First***, it directed 72 specific actions by more than a dozen
agencies to take on concrete competition problems—from non-compete
agreements to unjustifiable occupational licensing requirements, to
prescription drugs and Internet bills, to airline tickets and device
repairs, to personal banking and
meat-processing.<a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a>  Our agencies
worked hard to deliver over the last year.  Here are just a few examples
of what’s changing as a result:  

-   The FDA is changing its regulations so that hearing aids for
    mild-to-moderate hearing loss can be sold
    over-the-counter.<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a>  Roughly
    48 million Americans suffer from hearing
    loss.<a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27">[27]</a>  We expect this to be
    a gamechanger—spurring innovation and reducing hearing-aid prices.

<!-- -->

-   The Agriculture Department is issuing a suite of new rules under the
    Packers and Stockyards Act, including finally changing the unfair
    contracting system for poultry
    farmers.<a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a>

<!-- -->

-   Just last week, the Patent and Trademark Office and FDA announced
    plans to scrutinize drug patents that are driving up
    prices.<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a>

These efforts aren’t just about opening up markets to promote
competition.  They’re about looking inward, too—because government
regulations can themselves get in the way of innovation and entry.
 Indeed, sometimes powerful incumbents have enlisted government to
entrench themselves—so we’re working to lift regulatory barriers to
encourage challengers to enter markets and compete.

We’re proud that the vast majority of the actions we’re taking have
attracted bipartisan support.  They’re also spurring the private sector
and state legislatures to act.  After President Biden’s executive order
endorsed a “right to repair,”
Apple<a href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a> and
Microsoft<a href="#_ftn31" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a> announced they’d
allow people to fix their own devices, and New York just passed the
nation’s first “Fair Repair
Law.”<a href="#_ftn32" id="_ftnref32">[32]</a>

***Second***, the order called on the traditional antitrust agencies—the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission—to fully and
vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.  The President nominated Jonathan
Kanter to head DOJ’s Antitrust Division and Lina Khan lead the FTC.
 Both received broad bipartisan support in the Senate and are now ably
leading these efforts.  

Their work requires developing sensible frameworks and pursuing cases
zealously in a challenging legal environment.  It requires thinking
forward to new industries and new technologies—including the challenges
posed by the rise of the dominant Internet platforms. 

And it requires resources to rebuild capability.  During just the last
decade, our economic output increased by nearly
half,<a href="#_ftn33" id="_ftnref33">[33]</a> and the annual number of
completed mergers and acquisitions
doubled.<a href="#_ftn34" id="_ftnref34">[34]</a>  Yet total
appropriations for DOJ’s Antitrust
Division<a href="#_ftn35" id="_ftnref35">[35]</a> and the
FTC<a href="#_ftn36" id="_ftnref36">[36]</a> have been essentially
flat—and *decreased* in real terms.  Keep in mind, these agencies’ core
missions involve bringing complex cases against some of the
best-resourced companies in the world.  

Even under these constraints, our antitrust enforcement agencies have
achieved important but underreported legal victories over the past year.
 The FTC, for example, worked with the Pentagon to challenge a vertical
merger and keep the largest defense contractor from acquiring a major
missile-component producer—likely saving taxpayers
billions.<a href="#_ftn37" id="_ftnref37">[37]</a>  And DOJ blocked a
$30 billion merger between two of the world’s largest insurance brokers
that would have raised prices.<a href="#_ftn38" id="_ftnref38">[38]</a>

It’s unacceptable for these agencies’ resources to lag so far behind the
growth of the economy they’re charged with protecting.  That’s why
President Biden’s Budget calls for boosting funding for both agencies,
and that’s why we’ve supported passing the Merger Filing Fee
Modernization Act.  Congress should act swiftly to deliver these
enhanced resources.

***Finally***, the executive order prioritized *structural* change in
our competition policy by establishing the White House Competition
Council.  The Council, which I chair, currently includes 17 federal
agencies, and their leaders meet with the President twice a
year.<a href="#_ftn39" id="_ftnref39">[39]</a>  This body
institutionalizes competition policy as part of our overall economic
policy. 

This structural element of establishing a Competition Council may sound
at first like government arcana—but in fact it’s profoundly important to
turning this aircraft carrier around.  Because what we need, at core, is
capacity, creativity, and coordination across the federal government.
And I want to take a moment to thank every cabinet secretary and leader
of the 17 Council members for their leadership over the course of the
last year.  

This structure marks a fundamental innovation by President
Biden—something that’s never been done before in history: Agencies are
now working together to leverage *all* legally available tools to
promote competition.  That means not only more coordination and
collaboration, but also a newfound ability to survey the entire economic
landscape and assess how competition policy intersects with other areas,
like trade policy and supply chains.

One year in, the Competition Council has spurred collaboration and
cross-pollination between agencies.  To take just one example, the
Justice and Agriculture Departments together launched
FarmerFairness.gov, a one-stop shop for reporting suspected legal
violations in agriculture.<a href="#_ftn40" id="_ftnref40">[40]</a>
 Make no mistake, that’s not just another website—it reflects an
innovative approach to enforcement, where these two departments now
review every complaint together to assess how to best deploy *both* sets
of legal authorities.

The Competition Council has also successfully set priorities in critical
areas that are particularly important to our economy, like ocean
shipping.  Competition and performance issues in ocean shipping have
spillover effects across the economy, because many businesses rely on it
to transport their goods.

The ocean-freight system is dominated by three global alliances.  The
impact has been stark: during the pandemic, the price of shipping a
container rose more than
10-fold.<a href="#_ftn41" id="_ftnref41">[41]</a>  We’re proud that
Congress answered President Biden’s call to crack down on these price
hikes and unfair practices by passing the bipartisan Ocean Shipping
Reform Act—the most significant reform of ocean shipping rules in
decades.<a href="#_ftn42" id="_ftnref42">[42]</a>

We’re putting forward an array of other priorities, too—from opening up
labor markets<a href="#_ftn43" id="_ftnref43">[43]</a> to fighting
misleading pricing.<a href="#_ftn44" id="_ftnref44">[44]</a>  Another
key area is promoting competition in the tech sector, to give small
businesses and startups a better chance to compete on a level playing
field. That’s why I want to reinforce our Administration’s call for
Congress to pass bipartisan tech antitrust legislation.

Finally, the Competition Council is helping embed competition thinking
into agencies’ operations.  Our agencies are going beyond the executive
order’s immediate directives to new frontiers.  The Transportation
Department just issued rules to make our new, federally funded
electric-vehicle charging network open and
interoperable.<a href="#_ftn45" id="_ftnref45">[45]</a>  That wasn’t
specified in the executive order, but thanks to the Competition
Council’s work, we recognized the risks and potential and took action.

1.  **Reinforcing the Case for Competition**

Across each of these areas—concrete agency actions; reinvigoration of
antitrust enforcement; and structural change in our approach to
competition policy—we’ve made great progress.

But before we look forward, I want to pause to clarify some things we
*haven’t* been doing. 

***First***, we have not, and will not, adopt a blanket policy that “big
is bad,” or that there’s a one-size-fits-all approach to antitrust and
competition policy.  Not in E.O. 14036, and not in any of our work.  We
do take the view that market structure matters, and that we need be
concerned about highly concentrated markets—particularly in an
environment where our antitrust agencies have been under-resourced for
so long.  But that’s different from fighting bigness for bigness’s sake.

And ***second***, we don’t see competition as the singular cure for
inflation, nor do we see it as the driving cause of the global inflation
we are dealing with today.  At the same time, it *is* easier for firms
to maintain higher prices in a market with just a few
rivals.<a href="#_ftn46" id="_ftnref46">[46]</a>  That’s why promoting
competition is one tool—not the only one, but one tool—that can help
lower price pressures in the economy across time.

Looking ahead, the case for bolstering competition is particularly
powerful because it supports another important objective: resilience.  A
market with more competitors is usually better-equipped to handle
disruptions and deliver to businesses and consumers what they need.  

Consider:

-   After a cyberattack hit the country’s second-largest meat processing
    company last year, the company had to suspend production at its
    plants—which process one-quarter of America’s beef and one-fifth of
    its pork.<a href="#_ftn47" id="_ftnref47">[47]</a>

<!-- -->

-   And as we saw with infant formula this year, the closure of a single
    plant—owned by a company that controls almost half the
    market—created a national
    shortage.<a href="#_ftn48" id="_ftnref48">[48]</a>  

This is one more reason sound competition policy belongs at the center
of our economic policy.  By addressing the underlying structural problem
of competition, we make our supply chains more resilient—more capable of
dealing with whatever shocks may come. 

1.  **Looking Ahead**

I’ve talked about what we’ve done in the last year, and why.  But
there’s much more ahead.

In the coming months, we’ll deliver on more of the executive order’s
commitments—everything from new rules to provide airline
travelers<a href="#_ftn49" id="_ftnref49">[49]</a> and broadband
customers<a href="#_ftn50" id="_ftnref50">[50]</a> with upfront
information to comparison-shop, to the Treasury Department collaborating
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on
fintech.<a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51">[51]</a>

We’ll also keep pushing to institutionalize competition work across the
government.  Right now, we’re focused on bringing in the sharpest talent
to drive this work.  We’ll have more to say soon, but for all the
economists, policy experts, and litigators out there—now is the time for
you to consider public service.  Your country needs you, and it’s an
exciting and historic moment.  Help us keep turning the ship.

**Conclusion**

America has boldly recalibrated its competitiveness before—and
instituted durable, structural change.  Teddy Roosevelt did it. 
Franklin Roosevelt did it, too.  Today, we stand at another inflection
point.  It’s within our grasp to do it again.

We know that innovation and openness are part of America’s economic
DNA.  This is a nation that’s led technological revolutions across
industries for two centuries, and repeatedly transformed the global
economy for the better.  

President Biden’s actions to promote competition carry that same
spirit.  We’re confronting decades of growing market power and corporate
concentration.  That won’t be reversed overnight.  But we’re going to
keep working tirelessly to turn this ship around—and set us on a course
that better serves America’s economic dynamism.

Thank you—and I look forward to this conversation.
