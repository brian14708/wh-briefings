title: "Fact Sheet: Vice President Harris Announces Commitments to Strengthen U.S.\
  \ Partnership with the Pacific\_Islands"
---
 
On July 12, Vice President Harris will participate virtually in the
Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ meeting at the invitation of the Forum
Chair Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji. As part of this
engagement with Forum leaders, the Vice President will announce new
commitments to deepen U.S. partnership with the region and to deliver
concrete results for Pacific people. These actions advance the
Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the
U.S.-Pacific Islands partnership and to support Pacific regionalism,
with a strong and united Pacific Islands Forum at the center.  
   
This milestone reflects the United States’ robust and growing commitment
to the Pacific Islands region. It follows President Biden’s appointment
of a Special Presidential Envoy for Compact Negotiations and the launch
of the Partners in the Blue Pacific, a new coordination initiative among
the United States, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom
to support Pacific priorities more effectively. It also builds on five
decades of close cooperation with the Pacific Islands Forum, including
as a founding Dialogue Partner; $350 million in annual U.S. assistance
to the Pacific; and deep people-to-people ties, including among the 1.4
million Pacific Islanders who live across the United States.  
   
With this foundation, the Vice President is announcing the following
actions. The Biden-Harris Administration will:  
 

-   **Establish New U.S. Embassies in Kiribati and Tonga:** The
    Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that our close partnership
    with the Pacific requires regular exchange between our governments
    at all levels, from our leaders to our diplomats around the world.
    To that end, the United States, subject to congressional
    notification, will commence discussions with Kiribati and Tonga
    about our interest in establishing U.S. embassies in those
    countries. The United States is on track to reopen its embassy in
    Solomon Islands.
-   **Triple Request for U.S. Funding for Economic Development and Ocean
    Resilience:** For 33 years, the South Pacific Tuna Treaty has served
    as a cornerstone of political and economic cooperation between the
    United States and Pacific Islands, enabling U.S. fishing-fleet
    access to the Pacific, supporting livelihoods across the region, and
    providing a platform for broader cooperation, including to combat
    the scourge of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.
    Vice President Harris will announce that the United States is
    prepared to request from the U.S. Congress $60 million per year for
    the next ten years—nearly triple the current levels and $600 million
    in total—in connection with a new Economic Assistance Agreement with
    the Forum Fisheries Agency.
-   **Appoint the First-Ever U.S. Envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum:**
    A resilient and prosperous Pacific Islands region requires a strong
    and united Pacific Islands Forum—the preeminent driver of action in
    the region. The Biden-Harris Administration will redouble our
    commitment to the Pacific Islands Forum by appointing, for the first
    time, a designated U.S. Pacific Islands Forum Envoy. In doing so,
    the United States will further increase our overall diplomatic
    footprint across the Pacific Islands.
-   **Design and Release the First-Ever U.S. National Strategy on the
    Pacific Islands**: The Biden-Harris Administration will craft and
    publish the first-ever U.S. strategy on the Pacific Islands—a
    whole-of-government strategy to prioritize the Pacific Islands in
    American foreign policy and drive effective implementation. It will
    be nested under the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States,
    which the Biden-Harris Administration released earlier this year in
    Fiji. The U.S. National Strategy on the Pacific Islands will align
    with the goals, areas of focus, and principles of the Pacific
    Islands Forum’s 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.
-   **Bring the Peace Corps Back to the Pacific:** The longevity of our
    ties with the Pacific Islands depends on close people-to-people
    relationships. Peace Corps volunteers will soon return to Fiji,
    Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu, and the Peace Corps will work with the
    region to explore program expansion to additional Pacific Island
    countries.
-   **Progress Toward Re-establishing a United States Agency for
    International Development (USAID) Regional Mission for the Pacific
    in Suva, Fiji: **USAID provides life-saving humanitarian and
    development assistance across the Pacific Islands, from Kiribati in
    the wake of drought to Tonga in the wake of volcanic eruptions and
    tsunami waves to economic assistance in Papua New Guinea and Solomon
    Islands. The Vice President will announce that USAID is taking steps
    to expand its presence in the Pacific, subject to congressional
    notification, to improve close cooperation with its host country
    partners.

-   **Implement and Advance the Partners in the Blue Pacific**: Emerging
    challenges, from the climate crisis to infrastructure needs, require
    cooperation across borders. To that end, the United States and its
    allies and partners—Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the United
    Kingdom—established a new coordination mechanism, the Partners in
    the Blue Pacific (PBP). The PBP is dedicated to supporting Pacific
    priorities more effectively and efficiently, to bolstering Pacific
    regionalism, and to expanding opportunities between the Pacific and
    the world. Our countries provide a combined $2.1 billion in
    development assistance for the region, and we will seek to drive
    additional focus and resources by welcoming further members and
    observers, including in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Above all, at
    every stage, the PBP will be led and guided by the Pacific Islands,
    including close consultations on its flagship projects.
