title: "Message to the Congress on Bolstering Efforts to Bring Hostages and Wrongfully\
  \ Detained United\_States Nationals\_Home"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

     Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50
U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive
Order declaring a national emergency with respect to hostage-taking and
the wrongful detention of United States nationals.

     Hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of United States
nationals are heinous acts that undermine the rule of law.  Terrorist
organizations, criminal groups, and other malicious actors who take
hostages for financial, political, or other gain — as well as foreign
states that engage in the practice of wrongful detention, including for
political leverage or to seek concessions from the United States —
threaten the integrity of the international political system and the
safety of United States nationals and other persons abroad.  I have
determined that hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of United
States nationals abroad constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
States.

     I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 19, 2022.
