title: "Statement from President\_Biden on House Passage of Assault Weapons\_Ban"
---
 
When I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – the first
significant piece of gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years – I said
that there was still work to be done to keep our communities safe and
keep dangerous firearms out of dangerous hands. When guns are the number
one killer of children in America, when more children die from guns than
active-duty police and active-duty military combined, we have to act.
Today, House Democrats acted by unifying to pass an assault weapons ban
to keep weapons of war off our streets, save lives in this country, and
reduce crime in our communities.

The majority of the American people agree with this common sense action.
The Senate should move quickly to get this bill to my desk, and I will
not stop fighting until it does. There can be no greater responsibility
than to do all we can to ensure the safety of our families, our
children, our homes, our communities, and our nation.
