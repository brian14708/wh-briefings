title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with Governors on Reproductive\_\
  Rights"
---
 
Today, President Biden convened nine Democratic Governors from across
the country to discuss efforts to defend reproductive rights. These
Governors collectively represent tens of millions of women. They are
each taking action to protect access to abortion care, including by:
announcing funding for reproductive health care services; educating the
public; supporting the codification of the right to access an abortion
into state law and state constitutions; issuing executive actions to
defend patients, including out-of-state patients, providers, and third
parties; and even taking action
[together](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/06/24/west-coast-states-launch-new-multi-state-commitment-to-reproductive-freedom-standing-united-on-protecting-abortion-access/)
to support abortion access. These steps by Democratic Governors are
critical as states enact and enforce laws to ban abortion and
criminalize their citizens in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision
in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization,* which overturned *Roe
v. Wade*.

In the meeting, the President highlighted the impact the decision will
continue to have on the health and safety of millions of women. He
reiterated [his Administration’s
commitment](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-actions-in-light-of-todays-supreme-court-decision-on-dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/)
to defend women’s freedom to travel for lawful abortion care, as well as
access to critical, FDA-approved medications for reproductive health
care, including medication abortion and contraception. The President
made clear that the filibuster should not stand in the way of restoring
*Roe* into federal law. And he warned of Congressional Republican
efforts to pass a nationwide ban on abortion.

The President thanked the Governors for their work on this issue, and
told them his Administration looks forward to continued partnership to
protect access to reproductive health care.

The conversation was moderated by Jennifer Klein, Director of the White
House Gender Policy Council. Governors from today’s meeting included:

-   Governor Kate Brown, Oregon
-   Governor Roy Cooper, North Carolina
-   Governor Kathy Hochul, New York
-   Governor Jay Inslee, Washington
-   Governor Ned Lamont, Connecticut
-   Governor Dan McKee, Rhode Island
-   Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, New Mexico
-   Governor Jared Polis, Colorado
-   Governor J.B. Pritzker, Illinois
