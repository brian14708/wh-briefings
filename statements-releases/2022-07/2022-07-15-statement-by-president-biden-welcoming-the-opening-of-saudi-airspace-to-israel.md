title: "Statement by President\_Biden Welcoming the Opening of Saudi Airspace to\_\
  Israel"
---
 
Saudi Arabia’s historic decision to open its airspace for all civilian
planes, including those flying to and from Israel, is an important step
towards building a more integrated and stable Middle East region.  While
this opening has long been discussed, now, thanks to months of steady
diplomacy between my Administration and Saudi Arabia, it is finally a
reality. Today, I will be the first president of the United States to
fly from Israel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As we mark this important
moment, Saudi Arabia’s decision can help build momentum toward Israel’s
further integration into the region, including with Saudi Arabia. I will
do all that I can, through direct diplomacy and leader-to-leader
engagement, to keep advancing this groundbreaking process.
