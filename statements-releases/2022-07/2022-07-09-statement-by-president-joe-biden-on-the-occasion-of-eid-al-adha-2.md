Jill and I send our warmest greetings to Muslims across the United
States and around the world celebrating Eid al-Adha. The Eid traditions
and Hajj rituals that commemorate the devotion of Abraham and his son to
God are an opportunity for Muslims to renew their faith, and a reminder
of the common roots of the world’s great Abrahamic religions. And the
act of sharing the sacrifice with those less fortunate in service of God
mirrors our common commitment to work together to meet the challenges of
our world today.  
  
While COVID-19 restrictions remain, Muslims draped in white will be able
to gather from around the world for the first time in two years to
perform the Hajj. It’s a symbol of the progress we have made in fighting
this pandemic and of all work we must still do to strengthen our
recovery. Let us all take this opportunity to renew our shared
commitment to work for peace, care for the vulnerable, and pursue
greater equality and opportunity for all people.  
   
Here in the United States, Muslim Americans are leading on the
frontlines, together with members of all faith communities, to assist
those suffering from hunger and conflict, at home and abroad. To all
those celebrating, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a joyous
holiday filled with community, celebration, compassion, and service. Eid
Mubarak and Hajj Mabroor!
