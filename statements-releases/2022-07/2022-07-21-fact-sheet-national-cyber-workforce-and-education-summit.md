On July 19, 2022, National Cyber Director Chris Inglis hosted the
National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit at the White House. The
event focused on building our Nation’s cyber workforce, improving
skills-based pathways to cyber jobs, educating Americans so that they
have the skills they need to thrive in our increasingly digital society,
and improving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in
the cyber field. Bringing together entities who employ, train, and
educate cyber professionals and Americans at large, the event involved
senior U.S. Government officials, senior executives from the private
sector, and thought leaders from across the cyber community and the
education sector.

Participants included Ambassador Susan E. Rice, White House Domestic
Policy Advisor; Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo; Secretary of
Labor Martin J. Walsh; Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N.
Mayorkas; and Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. Other U.S.
Government participants included Jen Easterly, Director of the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; Laurie Locascio,
Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology; Anne
Neuberger, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National
Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology on the National
Security Council; George Barnes, Deputy Director of the National
Security Agency; and Principal Deputy National Cyber Director Kemba
Walden. The Biden-Harris Administration and the various stakeholders in
this area are committed to meeting the challenges and opportunities
relating to cyber workforce and education, which will help improve the
economy, secure Americans and our Nation’s infrastructure, advance our
digital way of life, and enable our society to maximize cyber
capabilities to achieve our highest aspirations.

The Summit included three roundtable discussions: the “All” roundtable
focused on ways to help ensure that all Americans are equipped with the
skills and knowledge to effectively and safely engage in our global
digital ecosystem; the “Many” roundtable explored ways to improve
practices in cyber-adjacent fields that are not focused solely on cyber
but are still impacted by it, are related to it, or benefit from it; and
the “Few” roundtable discussed the jobs and career pathways that are
specifically focused on cyber.

In connection with the Summit, the Biden-Harris Administration announced
the following actions:

-   **National Cyber Director Chris Inglis** committed to developing a
    National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy in coordination with
    other elements of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) as
    well as Federal departments and agencies, with input from key public
    and private stakeholders. The National Cyber Workforce and Education
    Strategy will aim to address the challenges and opportunities in
    these critical areas, improve collaboration across government-wide
    efforts, help align resources to aspirations, and implement
    Biden-Harris Administration priorities on education and workforce
    development.
