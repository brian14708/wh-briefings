**Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of 802,446 8-ounce
bottle equivalents of Nestlé Health Science Alfamino*® *Infant and
 Alfamino*® *Junior formula on July 21 and 22**

Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
two flights, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Nestlé Health
Science amino acid-based formula from Switzerland to John F. Kennedy
Airport in New York on July 21 and 22. This delivery will include
approximately 74,403 pounds of Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® Infantand
Alfamino® Junior formula, the equivalent of 802,446 8-ounce bottles.
These products will be distributed primarily to hospitals and home
health care providers.  
  
In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency
is exercising enforcement discretion so that Nestlé can export
additional infant formula into the U.S. Nestlé will import both standard
and specialty infant formulas including Nestlé NAN® SupremePro 1, Nestlé
NAN® SupremePro 2, Nestlé NAN® EXPERTpro SensiPro Premium Instant
Starter Formula, Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® Infant and Alfamino®
Junior, Vitaflo PKU start™, Gerber® Good Start® Gentle and Gerber® Good
Start® Extensive HA®. Over time Nestlé plans to bring approximately 42
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market.  
  
President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S.
health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves, hospitals
and home health care providers faster. By July 24, Operation Fly Formula
will have transported more than 61 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to
the U.S.  
  
In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
at whitehouse.gov/formula.
