title: "Biden Administration Announces Nearly $1B in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\
  \ Funding Improving Airport Terminals across\_U.S."
---
 
*Projects will increase airport capacity, energy efficiency and
accessibility*

*Funding going to communities small, medium and large across country*

**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) will award nearly $1 billion from
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to 85 airports
across the country to improve terminals of all sizes. The grants expand
capacity at our nation’s airport terminals, increase energy efficiency,
promote competition and provide greater accessibility for individuals
with disabilities. Building better airport terminals will improve
customer experiences, move goods through the economy more efficiently to
lower prices and enhance U.S. competitiveness.

Two grants will also be awarded to build and improve new air traffic
control towers.

“Americans deserve modern airports that meet the needs of their families
and growing passenger demand. Funded through President Biden’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, today’s grants will improve airport
terminals while also creating good jobs in communities across the
country,” **said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.**

and how the funds will be invested.

“The work that goes in to build safer, more accessible and sustainable
terminals will provide opportunities for people across the nation. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a critical investment not only in our
nation’s infrastructure, but an investment in the future of our
country’s workforce,” **said FAA Deputy Administrator A. Bradley Mims.**

Historically, the FAA has invested in runways, traffic-control towers
and back-of-house infrastructure. Thanks to the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, there is dedicated funding to support modernizing
airport terminals across the country.

70 grants contain an element that will **<u>expand terminal
capacity</u>**. Among them are:

-   **Pittsburgh International Airport (Pittsburgh, Pa.)**: $20 million
    to construct a new 700,000-square-foot landside terminal adjacent to
    the existing airside terminal and includes an improved passenger
    security screening checkpoint and checked baggage inspection system,
    baggage handling equipment, U.S. Customs and Border Protection area,
    and associated public spaces and support functions to serve
    passengers and meet the operational needs of the airport.
-   **Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (Chattanooga, Tenn.):** $5
    million for phase one of a terminal expansion project that will
    expand its second level by nearly 27,000 square feet to allow for
    two new gates, one expanded gate, a new set of restrooms, and
    additional passenger queuing, hold room and circulation space. This
    phase will also reorient the TSA Checkpoint to allow for an
    additional screening lane and expand the terminal rotunda sufficient
    to provide adequate passenger queuing space. The project will
    increase terminal capacity, improve ADA accessibility, increase
    energy efficiency, promote airline competition, and create jobs.

    and refillable water bottle stations and service animal relief
    areas.
-   **Bishop International Airport (Flint, Mich.):** $3.5 million to
    replace the terminal roof, which has failed in many places. It will
    be replaced with energy efficient materials, including improved
    insulation. This will result in decreased heating and cooling needs
    and reduce energy consumption.

47 grants contain an element that will go **to improving airport access
to historically disadvantaged populations and rural airports.** Among
them are:

-   **Dexter Regional Airport (Dexter, Maine)**: $760,000 to build a new
    800 square foot terminal building replacing the existing 50-year-old
    200 square foot terminal building. It includes the reconstruction of
    the access road. The existing terminal building is beyond its useful
    life and does not meet current standards or needs for a basic
    general aviation terminal building. It does not meet ADA
    requirements and energy efficiencies. The new terminal building will
    enhance and meet all these needs and requirements. This project
    provides access to improved terminal facilities for a disadvantage
    population area in this rural part of Maine.
-   **Washington Municipal Airport (AWG) Washington, Iowa**: $129,675 to
    install a solar power system and associated electrical efficiency
    enhancements for the general aviation terminal.

    renovation of the existing terminal building. The project will
    enable increased terminal capacity, replace aging and obsolete
    infrastructure, improve airfield safety, upgrade the facility to ADA
    standards, and increase energy efficiency.

One grant will increase **<u>multimodal transportation access</u>**.
That grant goes to:

-   **Gainesville Regional Airport (Gainesville, Fla.):** $1.67 million
    to improve a multi-modal ground transport facility. This project
    consists of multi-modal ground transport facility improvements,
    including lighted, accessible, covered walkways to the commercial
    airline terminal, a covered passenger waiting area, accessible
    restrooms, and queuing lanes for taxis and city busses arriving and
    departing the terminal. The project will reduce curbside congestion,
    increase ADA accessibility, improve accessibility for historically
    disadvantaged populations, and provide construction jobs.
