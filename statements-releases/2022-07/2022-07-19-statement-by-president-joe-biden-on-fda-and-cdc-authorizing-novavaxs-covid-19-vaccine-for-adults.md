  s COVID-\u206019 Vaccine for\_Adults"

Today is another step forward in our nation’s fight against the virus.
Following an independent scientific review by the Food and Drug
Administration last week and today by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Novavax’s protein-based COVID-19 vaccine for adults has
been authorized. We now have four safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines
available to protect Americans against serious illness,
hospitalizations, and death.  
   
When I took office, my Administration took decisive action to fix a
broken COVID-19 response and stand up a historic vaccination program
that has gotten over 260 million Americans at least their first shot,
and nearly 110 million people a booster shot. This unprecedented effort
has already saved over 2 million American lives, but more people need to
roll up their sleeves, particularly as we confront BA.5.  
   
The science and data are clear: vaccines continue to protect people from
serious illness, hospitalizations, and death—and with BA.5 increasing
infections, it is essential that people get themselves and their kids
vaccinated and stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. I
encourage everyone to get their booster if they are eligible. If you’re
age 50 or older, or a moderately or severely immunocompromised
individual, and haven’t gotten a vaccine shot this year—you should get
one right away. It is free, easy, and could save your life.  
   
Over the past 18 months, my Administration has left no stone unturned to
ensure Americans have easy and convenient access to lifesaving tools,
including vaccines, treatments, tests and more. These tools work even in
the face of BA.5—they protect people, keep people out of the hospital,
and save lives. While we know COVID-19 isn’t over, we can manage this
moment and continue to minimize COVID-19’s impact on our daily lives.
