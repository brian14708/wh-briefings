  \ Assault\_Organizations"

Officials from the White House Gender Policy Council, Office of Public
Engagement, and Office of the Vice President convened a listening
session on the impact that abortion bans and other restrictions have on
survivors of sexual assault and/or domestic violence and their ability
to access reproductive health care. The advocates and leaders who
participated represented national, state-wide, and local organizations
that provide services, support, and advocacy for survivors. They shared
insights from service providers working with survivors in states where
abortion is now banned, or severely curtailed, following the Supreme
Court’s ruling in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization*. They
also discussed the ways in which restrictions on survivors’ most
personal health care decisions violate their privacy and create
additional safety concerns for victims of domestic violence and sexual
assault. Advocates also raised the disproportionate impact that these
state bans have on survivors from historically marginalized or
underserved communities.

While critical of the abortion bans in several states that have no
exceptions for rape or incest, advocates also highlighted how those that
do have such limited exceptions also fail to meet the needs of
survivors; most victims of sexual violence do not report it, nor should
they have to in order to be able to access a full range of reproductive
health care options, including abortion.  Advocates who work with
survivors of sexual and domestic violence indicated how concepts such as
bodily autonomy and consent are crucial to the work of preventing sexual
violence. They emphasized that taking away survivors’ right to make
decisions about their own reproductive health further compounds the
trauma they experience, and has long-term implications. Advocates also
highlighted how crucial it is to protect the confidentiality and
autonomy of all survivors in order to protect their safety and
well-being.

White House officials thanked the leaders and advocates for their
dedication to helping survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.
They underscored the President’s commitment to supporting all survivors
in their ability to access services, safety, justice, and healing, as
well as his commitment to defending reproductive rights for all
Americans.

Organizations that participated in the listening session included:

-   National Alliance to End Sexual Violence
-   National Network to End Domestic Violence
-   National Coalition Against Domestic Violence
-   Esperanza United
-   New Mexico Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs
-   Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence
