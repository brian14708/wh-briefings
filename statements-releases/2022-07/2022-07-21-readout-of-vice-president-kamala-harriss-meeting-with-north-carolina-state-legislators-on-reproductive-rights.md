title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with North Carolina\
  \ State Legislators on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened more than 20 North Carolina
state legislators, local leaders, and advocates who are fighting on the
frontlines to protect reproductive rights.  The Vice President convened
state legislators from across the country on July 8, 2022 at the White
House; on July 14, 2022 in Orlando, Florida; on July 16, 2022 in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and on July 18, 2022 in Atlantic City, New
Jersey.  
   
During the meeting, the legislators, advocates, and providers in
attendance discussed the importance of building a broad coalition to
protect reproductive rights. The state legislators described how
Republican leaders in North Carolina are pushing for extreme laws that
would take away the right of women to make decisions about their own
bodies. The Vice President thanked North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper
for using every tool to protect access to reproductive health care,
including a recent state executive order issued to protect patients
seeking care from harassment and intimidation, and his veto of extreme
legislative attacks on reproductive rights.  
   
The Vice President shared actions the Administration is taking on a
national level in response to the Supreme Court overturning *Roe v.
Wade*, including protecting access to abortion medication, defending the
Constitutional right to travel, and addressing patient privacy. The Vice
President encouraged the state legislators to keep defending the rights
of women in North Carolina and said she looks forward to continuing to
fight alongside them to protect the people of our nation.
