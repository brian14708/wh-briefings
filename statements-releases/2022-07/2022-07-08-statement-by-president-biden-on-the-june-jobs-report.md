Today, we learned that our private sector has recovered all of the jobs
lost during the pandemic, and added jobs on top of that. This has been
the fastest and strongest jobs recovery in American history, and it
would not have been possible without the decisive action my
Administration took last year to fix a broken COVID response, and pass
the American Rescue Plan to get our economy back on track.

In the second quarter of this year, we created more jobs than in any
quarter under any of my predecessors in the nearly 40 years before the
pandemic. We have more Americans working in the private sector today
than any day during Donald Trump’s Presidency – more people than any
time in our history.

The historic strength of our job market is one reason our economy is
uniquely well positioned to tackle a range of global economic challenges
– from global inflation to the economic fallout from Putin’s war. No
country is better positioned than America to bring down inflation,
without giving up all of the economic gains we have made over the last
18 months.

Of course, having added a record number of new jobs, and achieved
historically low levels of unemployment, additional job growth from this
strong position will be slower. That is not a bad thing, because our
economy should move to stable growth for the years ahead.

The best way to achieve that goal is for Congress to pass legislation
that lowers costs for families – from prescription drugs to utility
costs – while reducing the federal budget deficit, in addition to
passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act.
