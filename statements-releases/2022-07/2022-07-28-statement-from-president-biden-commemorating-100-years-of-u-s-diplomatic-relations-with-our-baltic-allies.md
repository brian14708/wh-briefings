  \ Relations with our Baltic\_Allies"

Today, we mark 100 years of unbroken diplomatic relations between the
United States and our three Baltic Allies — Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania.  Through a century of struggle and reclamation, the United
States has always stood by the legitimate governments of these three
countries.  Back in 1940, as Soviet Troops occupied the Baltic nations
by force, our State Department issued the Welles Declaration.  It
affirmed the “universally known” policy of the United States – that
we believe in sovereignty, self-determination and territorial
integrity, and that we oppose predatory actions carried out by threats
or force.  More than 60 years later, when I was a Senator, the United
States proudly welcomed the Baltic states as Allies in NATO.  At every
turn, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to their freedom and
sovereignty. As we celebrate our long-standing friendship, we also
reaffirm that universally known policy.

With sovereignty and territorial integrity in Europe once more under
assault, we are united with our Allies and partners to defend freedom,
democracy, and security.  The United States stands shoulder-to-shoulder
with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to counter Russia’s brutal and
unprovoked war on Ukraine and to hold Russia accountable.  Few know
better what is at stake.  And as Allies, we will continue to strengthen
the security of Europe and defend every inch of NATO territory.  The
United States will continue working closely with Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania on the full range of global challenges to ensure the next
century brings greater peace, security, and freedom for all.
