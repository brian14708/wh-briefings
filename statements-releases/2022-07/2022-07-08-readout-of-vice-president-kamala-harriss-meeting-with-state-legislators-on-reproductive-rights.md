title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with State Legislators\
  \ on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, July 8, 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris convened state
legislative leaders from Indiana, Florida, South Dakota, Nebraska, and
Montana who are fighting on the frontlines to protect reproductive
rights. All five states have Republican-controlled state legislatures
and Republican governors, and may soon call special sessions to pass
abortion bans. The convening follows meetings about reproductive rights
that the Vice President has held with health care providers, faith
leaders, constitutional law and privacy experts, advocates, and
Attorneys General.  
   
During the meeting, the Vice President discussed actions the
Administration is taking to defend abortion rights, including the
President’s signing of the Executive Order Protecting Access to
Reproductive Health Care Services. The Vice President reiterated the
Administration’s commitment to partnering with elected leaders at the
local, state, and federal level to protect reproductive health care
access.    
   
The state legislative leaders shared what is happening in their states
as extremist legislators are fighting to further limit reproductive
health care access following the Supreme Court overruling *Roe v. Wade.*
They discussed the importance of patient privacy and spoke out against
government inference in decisions that should be made between a woman
and her doctor. They also shared concerns about other rights that are
being attacked on the state level, including voting rights and LGBTQI+
rights. The Vice President and the state leaders reaffirmed their
commitment to working together to protect reproductive rights and
freedoms for all women, no matter where they live.  
   
State legislative leaders included:

-   Indiana House Minority Leader Representative Phil GiaQuinta
-   Florida incoming House Democratic Leader Representative Fentrice
    Driskell
-   South Dakota House Minority Whip Erin Healy
-   Nebraska Senator Patty Pansing Brooks
-   Montana Senator Diane Sands
