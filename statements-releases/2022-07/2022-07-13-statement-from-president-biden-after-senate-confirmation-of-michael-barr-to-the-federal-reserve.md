title: "Statement from President\_Biden after Senate Confirmation of Michael Barr\
  \ to the Federal\_Reserve"
---
 
The Federal Reserve plays the primary role in fighting inflation and
regulating financial institutions. Todayâ€™s confirmation of Michael Barr
as Vice Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve is important
progress for my plan to tackle inflation and for sound oversight as we
transition to steady and stable growth. The Senate has now confirmed my
full slate of nominees, a historic and experienced group that includes
Jerome Powell, Dr. Lael Brainard, Dr. Lisa Cook, and Dr. Philip
Jefferson. They bring the skill and knowledge needed at this critical
time for our economy and families across the country to fight inflation,
to ensure ordinary Americans get a fair shake, and to protect the
stability of our economy.
