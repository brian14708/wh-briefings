title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with New Jersey State\
  \ Legislators on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened more than 20 New Jersey
state legislators, local leaders, and advocates who are fighting on the
frontlines to protect reproductive rights. Today’s meeting in Atlantic
City, New Jersey follows engagements about reproductive rights that the
Vice President held with health care providers, faith leaders,
constitutional law and privacy experts, advocates, state Attorneys
General, and other state legislators. The Vice President convened state
legislators at the White House on July 8, 2022; in Orlando, Florida on
July 14, 2022; and in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 16, 2022.  
   
The Vice President thanked the state legislators for their work
protecting abortion access, highlighting the legislation passed so far
to codify the right to abortion, provide funding to support reproductive
health care services, and protect providers and privacy. The Vice
President also thanked the leaders for pursuing further action to
protect access to care, including by passing additional
legislation. She also encouraged the legislators to look for ways to
support and coordinate with state legislators from other states as part
of a broad coalition to protect abortion access.  
   
The participants discussed how people do not need to give up their own
beliefs to agree that the government should not interfere with women’s
decisions over their own bodies. They agreed that everyone deserves to
have access to health care and noted the importance of keeping equity at
the center of the conversation. The leaders also discussed the need to
improve maternal health care systems across New Jersey and the country,
noting the connection between maternal health care and reproductive
health care. The Vice President told the state legislators, local
leaders, and the advocates that she looks forward to continuing to work
together to protect reproductive rights and freedoms.
