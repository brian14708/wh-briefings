title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Indiana State\
  \ Legislators on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened more than 30 state
legislators in Indianapolis, Indiana to discuss the fight to protect
reproductive rights. Her visit coincided with the first day of
the Indiana state legislature’s special session to consider a total
abortion ban with limited exceptions.    
   
The Vice President thanked the leaders for their courageous work
fighting against the extreme proposal from Indiana Republican
legislators. She expressed that our nation is experiencing a health care
crisis, and we must do everything we can to protect access to
reproductive health care. The Vice President shared steps the
Administration is taking following President Biden’s Executive Order
Protecting Access to Reproductive Healthcare Services, and she conveyed
the Administration’s commitment to continuing the fight to defend
reproductive rights.  
   
The participants discussed how abortion restrictions harm families by
taking away their power to make intimate and fundamental decisions about
planning their lives. They also noted the economic impact that such an
abortion restriction would have on the state of Indiana – deterring
economic investments, and impacting whether people choose to seek their
educations and pursue their careers in the state. They raised concerns
about the health of women, noting that Indiana has one of the worst
maternal mortality rates in our nation, which will worsen once
reproductive health care is further restricted. The Vice President and
the state legislators agreed to work together to protect the health, the
safety, and the wellbeing of the women of America, including the women
of Indiana.

-   Rep. Phil GiaQuinta, Indiana House Minority Leader
