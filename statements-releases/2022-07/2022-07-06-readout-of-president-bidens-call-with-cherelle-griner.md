title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with Cherelle\_Griner"
---
 
President Biden, joined by Vice President Harris, spoke today with
Cherelle Griner, the wife of Brittney Griner who is wrongfully detained
in Russia under intolerable circumstances. The President called Cherelle
to reassure her that he is working to secure Brittney’s release as soon
as possible, as well as the release of Paul Whelan and other U.S.
nationals who are wrongfully detained or held hostage in Russia and
around the world. He also read her a draft of the letter the President
is sending to Brittney today.  
  
The President offered his support to Cherelle and Brittney’s family, and
he committed to ensuring they are provided with all possible assistance
while his administration pursues every avenue to bring Brittney home.
Today’s call follows calls that National Security Advisor Sullivan and
Secretary of State Blinken have had with Cherelle in recent weeks and
this past weekend. The President directed his national security team to
remain in regular contact with Cherelle and Brittney’s family, and with
other families of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad,
to keep them updated on efforts to secure the release of their loved
ones as quickly as possible.
