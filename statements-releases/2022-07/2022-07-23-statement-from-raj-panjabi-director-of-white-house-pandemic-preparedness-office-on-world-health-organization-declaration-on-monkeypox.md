  \ Office, on World Health Organization Declaration on\_Monkeypox"

Today’s decision by the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the
current monkeypox outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern is a call to action for the world community to stop the spread
of this virus. A coordinated, international response is essential to
stop the spread of monkeypox, protect communities at greatest risk of
contracting the disease, and combat the current outbreak. 

Since the earliest days of the outbreak, the Biden Administration has
deployed a robust and comprehensive strategy to combat monkeypox here in
the US, including dramatically scaling the procurement, distribution,
and production of vaccines, expanding access to testing and treatments,
and communicating with communities most at risk of contracting the
virus.  But that is not enough.  As the Department of Health and Human
Services has said, we must step up our work to aggressively combat this
virus and protect communities in the United States that have been
affected by monkeypox.
