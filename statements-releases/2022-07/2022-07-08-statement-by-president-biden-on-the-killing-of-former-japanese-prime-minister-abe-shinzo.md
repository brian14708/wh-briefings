title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Killing of Former Japanese Prime Minister\
  \ Abe\_Shinzo"
---
 
I am stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened by the news that my friend
Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan, was shot and killed while
campaigning. This is a tragedy for Japan and for all who knew him. I had
the privilege to work closely with Prime Minister Abe. As Vice
President, I visited him in Tokyo and welcomed him to Washington. He was
a champion of the Alliance between our nations and the friendship
between our people. The longest serving Japanese Prime Minister, his
vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. Above all, he cared
deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their
service. Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work
of democracy. While there are many details that we do not yet know, we
know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence
always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it.
The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my
deepest condolences to his family.
