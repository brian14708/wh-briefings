  \ to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to\_Atrocities"
---
 
The public release of the first-ever [U.S. Strategy to Anticipate,
Prevent, and Respond to
Atrocities](https://www.state.gov/atrocity-prevention/), along with the
2022 Report to Congress Pursuant to Section 5 of the Elie Wiesel
Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018, reaffirms the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to atrocity prevention as a
core national security commitment and core moral responsibility of the
United States.  The mass violence against men, women, and children in
Ukraine serves as a solemn reminder of the unspeakable human toll of
these vicious acts and the traumatic consequences for communities for
future generations.

While the Report takes stock of our efforts as a whole-of-government
over the last year to respond to the world’s gravest crimes, the
Strategy lays out a future vision of a comprehensive approach to
atrocity prevention, coordinated through the White House-led Atrocity
Prevention Task Force.  The Strategy consolidates and further
institutionalizes a U.S. governmental process to detect and respond to
early warning signs of atrocities and broadens U.S. involvement to
engage with our international partners and civil society, including
through multilateral fora.   It complements and builds upon the [U.S.
Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote
Stability](https://www.state.gov/stability-strategy/) and the [U.S
Strategy on Women, Peace, and
Security](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WPS_Strategy_10_October2019.pdf). 
Through these guiding documents, we acknowledge the importance of these
various efforts working together to reinforce stability and build
sustainable peace.  We also note the disproportionate impact of violence
targeted at women and girls, including through the use of
conflict-related sexual violence.  And as we support efforts to hold
perpetrators accountable, the Strategy enumerates several tools that the
United States can bring to bear to recognize the loss and suffering of
victims and survivors and to promote peace, reconciliation, and
democracy, including by working with allies and partners.

Above all, the Report and Strategy highlight the imperative for our
collective ability and will to foresee and prevent atrocities and other
crimes.  We call upon our partners to further prioritize atrocity
prevention, dedicate resources and personnel for these efforts, and
continue pursuing the goal of “Never Again.”
