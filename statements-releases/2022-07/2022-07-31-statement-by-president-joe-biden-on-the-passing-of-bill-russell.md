title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden On the Passing of Bill\_Russell"
---
 
The promise of America is that we are all created equal and deserve to
be treated equally throughout our lives. We’ve never fully lived up to
that promise, but Bill Russell made sure we never walked away from it.

By August 1963, he had won six of what would be 11 NBA championships in
his 13 years in the league with the Boston Celtics, a defining career
that would include five regular season Most Valuable Player awards, an
Olympic gold medal, and serving as the first Black coach of any major
sports league in America.

But on the historic day of August 28, 1963, there he was at the steps of
the Lincoln Memorial as a towering champion for freedom, equality, and
justice as Dr. King delivered a dream for the Nation.

That was Bill Russell. From a childhood in segregated Louisiana to a
career playing on the biggest stages in sports at the height of the
Civil Rights Movement, Bill faced the hostility and hate of racism
embedded in every part of American life. Yet, he never gave up.
Throughout his life, he forced us to confront hard truths. And on this
day, there are generations of Americans who are reflecting on what he
meant to them as someone who played for the essential truth that every
person is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect.

Bill Russell is one of the greatest athletes in our history – an
all-time champion of champions, and a good man and great American who
did everything he could to deliver the promise of America for all
Americans.
