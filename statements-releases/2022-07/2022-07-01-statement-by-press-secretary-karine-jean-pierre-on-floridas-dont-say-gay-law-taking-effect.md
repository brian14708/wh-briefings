title: "Statement by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Florida\u2019s \u201CDon\u2019\
  t Say Gay\u201D Law Taking\_Effect"
---
 
Today, some of Florida’s most vulnerable students and families are more
fearful and less free. As the state’s shameful “Don’t Say Gay” law takes
effect, state officials who claim to champion liberty are limiting the
freedom of their fellow Americans simply to be themselves. Already,
there have been reports that “Safe Space” stickers are being taken down
from classrooms. Teachers are being instructed not to wear rainbow
clothing. LGBTQI+ teachers are being told to take down family photos of
their husbands and wives—cherished family photos like the ones on my own
desk.  
   
This is not an issue of “parents’ rights.” This is discrimination, plain
and simple. It’s part of a disturbing and dangerous nationwide trend of
right-wing politicians cynically targeting LGBTQI+ students, educators,
and individuals to score political points. It encourages bullying and
threatens students’ mental health, physical safety, and well-being. It
censors dedicated teachers and educators who want to do the right thing
and support their students. And it must stop.  
   
President Biden has been very clear that every student deserves to feel
safe and welcome in the classroom. The Department of Education will be
monitoring this law, and any student or parent who believes they are
experiencing discrimination is encouraged to file a complaint with the
Department’s Office for Civil Rights. Our Administration will continue
to fight for dignity and opportunity for every student and family—in
Florida and around the country.
