Director Inglis met with officials from the Governments of Israel, the
Netherlands, and the United Kingdom to share lessons learned on
enhancing national cybersecurity, growing the cyber talent pool, and
ensuring the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. He also solicited
feedback on themes of the Biden-Harris Administration’s forthcoming
