Tomorrow, President Biden will announce a number of initiatives to
support the Palestinian people by:

-   Improving access to health care and technology;
-   Rolling out long overdue 4G digital connectivity to both Gaza and
    the West Bank;
-   Bolstering economic growth;
-   Providing critical services for Palestinian refugees;
-   Reducing food insecurity;
-   Fostering people-to-people dialogue to support peace. 

President Biden will also announce new contributions totaling $316
million to support the Palestinian people. This is on top of the more
than half a billion dollars the United States has provided to the
Palestinian people since the Biden Administration restored much needed
funding to the Palestinians.

**Improve Healthcare Access for Palestinians**

-   During his visit to the Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem,
    the President will announce the United States intends to provide a
    new multi-year U.S. contribution of up to $100 million for the East
    Jerusalem Hospital Network (EJHN), subject to congressional
    approval.  The EJHN is a grouping of six hospitals in East Jerusalem
    providing specialized services including oncology, dialysis,
    neo-natal intensive care, and specialized maternity, ophthalmology,
    and emergency services to 50,000 patients from East Jerusalem, the
    West Bank, and Gaza annually.  The funding is provided by the U.S.
    Agency for International Development (USAID) and paired with health
    system and hospital reforms.

**Bolstering the Digital Economy to Improve Palestinian Economic
Growth**

-   To boost Palestinian businesses and improve connectivity for
    Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, Israel has committed to
    speeding up the long overdue transformation of 3G to 4G in the West
    Bank and afterwards 2G to 4G in Gaza.  Israeli and Palestinian teams
    will work together immediately to start the technological surveys,
    with an aim to roll out an advanced infrastructure for 4G by the end
    of 2023.  This commitment will accelerate digital transformation and
    foster a more well-connected Palestinian economy.  It will also
    generate jobs, increase productivity, and increase online operations
    in the health and education sectors.

**Improve the Travel Experience from the West Bank to Jordan**

-   President Biden supports creating a more autonomous, efficient, and
    reliable Palestinian experience of traveling abroad.  He will
    announce that Israel is prepared to take measures to increase
    efficiency and accessibility to the Allenby Bridge for the benefit
    of Palestinians.  In order to upgrade facilities, Israel has agreed
    to enable access 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by September 30,
    2022.  A working group will assess several measures including the
    use of biometric passports and will complete its assessments within
    the next month and discuss conclusions with U.S. partners.  In
    addition, the working group will consider steps to establish
    Palestinian Authority presence on Allenby Bridge while maintaining
    Israel’s security considerations.

**Support Critical Services for Palestinian Refugees**

-   The United States believes that Palestinian refugees deserve to live
    in dignity, to see their basic needs addressed, and to have hope for
    the future.  President Biden will announce an additional $201
    million for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
    (UNRWA) to continue delivering critical services to Palestinian
    refugees in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. 
    UNRWA’s comprehensive services remain a lifeline to millions of
    vulnerable Palestinians – consistent with its mandate to provide
    assistance and protection to Palestinian refugees pending a just and
    lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  These
    services directly contribute to maintaining regional stability,
    which is beneficial to the interests of the United States, our
    allies, and our partners.  This contribution cements the United
    States’ status as UNRWA’s largest donor.  These new funds bring the
    total United States assistance to UNRWA during the Biden
    Administration to more than $618 million.  The United States is
    committed to supporting UNRWA to provide the most effective and
    efficient assistance possible and to continue to improve its
    operations and delivery.  UNRWA’s work must be done while fully
    respecting the UN principles of neutrality, tolerance, human rights,
    equity, and non-discrimination.  

**Re-Launching Israeli-Palestinian Economic Discussions and Promoting
Steps to Improve Lives**

-   President Biden will share with President Abbas that Israel intends
    to convene the Joint Economic Committee with the Palestinians. 
    Restarting discussions through the Joint Economic Committee has been
    a longstanding request of the Palestinian Authority.  The committee
    last met in 2009 and is the mandated entity under the Oslo Accords
    for the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to meet to
    discuss joint economic issues, including wastewater, clean energy,
    and other measures that impact Palestinian lives in the West Bank. 
    President Biden also announced that Israel agreed to increase the
    number of permits for Palestinians in Gaza to work and do business
    in Israel to 15,500.  The Biden Administration strongly supports
    increased access and movement for Palestinians, and this is a
    positive step toward that goal.  Additionally, Israel agreed to
    approve the registration of 5,500 previously unregistered
    Palestinians on the Palestinian Population Register.

**Ensure Food Security for Palestinians**

-   In response to rising food insecurity for Palestinians in the wake
    of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Biden will announce
    that the United States is providing $15 million in additional
    humanitarian assistance for vulnerable Palestinians.  Via funding to
    the UN World Food Program and two non-governmental organizations,
    the United States is providing electronic food vouchers,
    multipurpose cash assistance, and emergency livelihoods support,
    helping more than 210,000 food-insecure people meet their household
    food needs in coming months.  This funding is part of the pledge of
    additional U.S. government resources that President Biden made at
    the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Germany in late June to protect the
    world’s most vulnerable populations from the escalating global food
    security crisis.

**Fostering People-to-People Ties**

-   To build grassroots support for peace through an eventual negotiated
    two-state solution, President Biden will announce two new grants
    under the Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act
    (MEPPA).  MEPPA authorizes up to $250 million dollars over five
    years to implement projects led by both Israelis and Palestinians
    establishing the environment necessary to achieve long term peace. 
    The first new grant, for $2.21 million to the Peres Center for
    Peace, will support collaboration and professional exchanges between
    the Palestinian and Israeli health sectors as they work to build
    mutual trust, confidence, and understanding between the two
    societies.  The second new grant, for $5 million to AppleSeeds, will
    provide young Palestinian and Israeli professionals the opportunity
    to work together and learn critical technology and leadership. For
