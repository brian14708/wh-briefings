title: "President\_Biden Names Twenty-First Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing five new federal judicial nominees, all of
whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule
of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.

For example, if confirmed, this slate would include:

-   The first Asian American judge to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the Third Circuit
-   The first Asian American and second Latina judge to serve on the
    U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania 

This is President Biden’s twenty-first round of nominees for federal
judicial positions and his eighth slate of nominations in 2022, bringing
the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 112.

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
