*‘Biden signs landmark bipartisan gun measure, says ‘lives will be
saved’’  
‘Wolf visits White House, says American Rescue Plan funds ‘greatly
benefited’ Pennsylvania’s workforce, COVID-19 economic recovery’  
‘Intel CEO, Commerce secretary push for Congress to act on aid package’*

This week, Americans are reading about how Members of Congress, state
and local leaders, gun violence survivors, families, and advocates
joined President Biden at a White House event commemorating the passage
of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – the most significant
legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years.

Governors, mayors, and local leaders joined Vice President Harris, Labor
Secretary Marty Walsh, American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling,
and White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie
Rodriguez for a White House American Rescue Plan Summit. Following the
half-day Summit, elected officials spoke to local reports about how more
than $40 billion of American Rescue Plan funds have been committed to
strengthening and expanding our workforce in the states.

Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu also traveled to Milwaukee,
Wisconsin and spoke with local press outlets about President Biden’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is rebuilding infrastructure in the
Badger State by improving roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes to
provide clean water, expanding high speed internet, and creating
millions of good-paying union jobs that don’t require a college degree.

And Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo led a White House Regional Press
Call for reporters in Indiana, Missouri and Ohio to underscore the
urgent need for Congress to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which
will spur American manufacturing, strengthen our supply chains, and help
lower costs for families.

See a round-up of the local coverage below.
