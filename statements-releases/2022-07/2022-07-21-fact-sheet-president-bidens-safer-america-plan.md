President Biden knows what works to make our communities safer:
investing in community policing and crime prevention. We need to fund
police who walk the beat, know the neighborhood, are accountable to
those they are sworn to serve, and build community trust and safety. We
need to invest in mental health and substance use treatment services,
crisis responders, and social workers to reduce the burden on police
officers and prevent violent crime. We need to expand community violence
interventions – led by trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence
and trauma. We need to enforce our commonsense gun laws, require
background checks for all gun sales in order to keep firearms out of the
hands of felons and domestic abusers, and ban assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines – weapons of war that have no place in our
communities.  
  
President Biden has taken action to make our communities safer during
his first 18 months in office:

-   **Funded the police and improved police accountability**. Other
    politicians talk about funding the police, but President Biden and
    Congressional Democrats actually got it done by enacting the
    American Rescue Plan (ARP). [Over $10 billion in ARP
    funds](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/13/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-call-for-state-and-local-leaders-to-dedicate-more-american-rescue-plan-funding-to-make-our-communities-safer-and-deploy-these-dollars-quickly/)
    have already been committed to policing and other public safety
    efforts – including at least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds
    committed in more than 300 communities across the country. Along
    with ongoing support from the Justice Department, ARP investments
    made 2021 among the largest single-year commitments of federal
    resources for state and local law enforcement and public safety on
    record. President Biden also signed a historic [executive
    order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/05/25/executive-order-on-advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and-public-safety/)
    to advance effective, accountable policing that will build public
    trust and strengthen public safety. Leading civil rights
    organizations and law enforcement organizations such as the
    International Association of Chiefs of Police, Major Cities Chiefs
    Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National
    Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives support this
    order.  
-   **Tackled gun violence**. President Biden is implementing his
    comprehensive
    [strategy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/)
    to reduce gun crime. The Biden Administration has taken [more
    executive
    action](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-administrations-21-executive-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence/)
    to reduce gun violence than any other president at this point in
    their Administration, including by reining in the proliferation of
    ghost guns and cracking down on gun traffickers and rogue gun
    dealers. The President was the first president in nearly 30 years to
    bring together Members of Congress from both parties to take action
    on gun violence, signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The
    President also secured Senate confirmation of career prosecutor
    Steve Dettelbach to serve as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol,
    Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, empowering this law enforcement
    agency with its first confirmed leader since 2015.  
-   **Investing in community-led crime prevention and intervention.**
    States and cities across the country have used ARP funding to invest
    in public safety strategies such as summer jobs for young adults and
    substance use and mental health services. Through the bipartisan
    budget deal and the Bipartisan Safer communities Act, the President
    has secured $300 million to expand community violence interventions.
    The Biden Administration has also made changes to [26 different
    federal
    programs](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-more-details-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-investments-in-community-violence-interventions/)
    to direct additional funding to evidence-based violence
    interventions. And, the Department of Labor is [investing in job
    programs](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20220307) to
    help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their
    communities.

The President believes we can and must do more to reduce crime and save
lives. Today, President Biden is building on this progress with his
Safer America Plan[. President Biden’s fiscal year 2023
budget](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf)
requests a fully paid-for new investment of approximately $35 billion to
support law enforcement and crime prevention – in addition to the
President’s $2 billion discretionary request for these same programs.
The plan he is releasing today outlines, for the first time, how this
$37 billion will be used to save lives and make communities safer.  
  
Specifically, the Safer America Plan:

-   **Funds the police and promotes effective prosecution of crimes
    affecting families today.** The Safer America Plan will provide
    communities the resources they need to keep our streets safe,
    including by helping them hire and train 100,000 additional police
    officers for accountable community policing (nearly $13 billion over
    the next five years through the COPS Hiring Program) and setting
    aside dedicated funds for small law enforcement agencies. At the
    same time, this plan will invest nearly $3 billion to help
    communities clear court backlogs and solve murders so we can take
    shooters and other violent criminals off the streets, including by
    helping communities set up task forces to share intelligence to
    bring down the gun violence rate. The plan also aims to crack down
    on other serious crimes affecting families today. The plan will
    impose tougher penalties for fentanyl trafficking. To tackle
    organized retail theft, the plan calls on Congress to pass
    legislation to require online marketplaces, like Amazon, to verify
    third-party sellers’ information, and to impose liability on online
    marketplaces for the sale of stolen goods on their platforms.  
-   **Invests in crime prevention and a fairer criminal justice
    system.** The Safer America Plan will invest in services that
    address the causes of crime and reduce the burdens on police so they
    can focus on violent crime, including mental health and substance
    use disorder services; crisis responders, violence interrupters, and
    social workers; and expanding access to job training, education,
    housing, and other supportive services that prevent crime and
    advance equity. The Plan establishes a new $15 billion grant program
    called Accelerating Justice System Reform that cities and states can
    use over the next 10 years to advance strategies that will: (1)
    prevent violent crime and/or (2) ease the burden on police officers
    by identifying non-violent situations that may merit a public health
    response or other response. It also invests an additional $5 billion
    in evidence-based community violence intervention programs. The plan
    proposes to end the crack-powder disparity, making the fix
    retroactive. The plan will help formerly incarcerated individuals
    successfully reenter society, including by lifting nearly all
    restrictions on eligibility and access to vital federal benefits and
    programs that people need to get back on their feet after leaving
    incarceration.  
-   **Takes additional commonsense steps on guns** **to keep dangerous
    firearms out of dangerous hands.** The President has already
    proposed to increase funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
    Firearms and Explosives (ATF) by 13% so ATF can hire new agents and
    investigators to help cities trace firearms and analyze ballistics
    from crime scenes. The President will also continue to call on
    Congress to take additional actions on guns, including requiring
    background checks for all gun sales, banning assault weapons and
    high-capacity magazines, closing the dating violence restraining
    order loophole, and banning the manufacture, sale, or possession of
    unserialized “ghost guns.”
