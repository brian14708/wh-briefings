title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Second Quarter GDP\_Report"
---
 
Coming off of last year’s historic economic growth – and regaining all
the private sector jobs lost during the pandemic crisis – it’s no
surprise that the economy is slowing down as the Federal Reserve acts to
bring down inflation. But even as we face historic global challenges, we
are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger
and more secure. Our job market remains historically strong, with
unemployment at 3.6% and more than 1 million jobs created in the second
quarter alone. Consumer spending is continuing to grow. Earlier this
week, I met with the Chairman of SK Group from Korea, just one of the
companies investing more than $200 billion in American manufacturing
since I took office, powering a historic recovery in American
manufacturing.

My economic plan is focused on bringing inflation down, without giving
up all the economic gains we have made. Congress has an historic chance
to do that by passing the CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction
Act without delay.
