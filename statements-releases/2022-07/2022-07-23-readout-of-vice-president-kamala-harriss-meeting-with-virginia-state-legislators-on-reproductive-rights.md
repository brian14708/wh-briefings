title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Virginia State\
  \ Legislators on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened more than 20 Virginia state
legislators and advocates who are fighting on the frontlines to protect
reproductive rights.  The Vice President convened state legislators from
across the country on July 8, 2022 at the White House; on July 14, 2022
in Orlando, Florida; on July 16, 2022 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; on
July 18, 2022 in Atlantic City, New Jersey; and on July 21, 2022 in
Charlotte, North Carolina.  
   
The Vice President thanked the leaders for their work defending women’s
reproductive rights and freedoms in Virginia. She spoke about how people
do not need to abandon their faith to believe the government should not
interfere in the ability of women to make decisions about their own
bodies. She also expressed concerns about other rights that are in
jeopardy, including the right to marry someone you love and the ability
to access contraception. The Vice President shared actions the
Administration is taking to defend abortion access, and she spoke about
the importance of building a movement to protect reproductive rights.
The participants spoke about the intersection between the maternal
health crisis and the health care crisis that women are facing in the
wake of the Supreme Court overturning *Roe v. Wade*. They shared how
more must be done to fight for the health, safety, and wellbeing of
women, and they agreed to continue working together to defend
reproductive health care in Virginia and across the nation.
