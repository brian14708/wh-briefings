title: "Vice President Harris to Address the Pacific Islands\_Forum"
---
 
On Tuesday July 12 in Washington, D.C., Vice President Kamala Harris
will participate virtually in the annual leaders’ meeting of the Pacific
Islands Forum, which is taking place in Suva, Fiji. The Vice President
will underscore the commitment of the United States to the Pacific
Islands region and discuss opportunities to deepen U.S. engagement in
the region and areas to deliver concrete results for the people of the
Pacific. The Vice President will celebrate the longstanding bonds
between the United States and the Pacific Islands and will outline our
ongoing work to strengthen them. This engagement builds on President
Biden’s remarks to the Pacific Islands Forum meeting last year and
Secretary Blinken’s trip to Fiji earlier this year.
