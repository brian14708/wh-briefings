title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Disability Rights\
  \ Leaders on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, on the 32<sup>nd</sup> anniversary of the signing of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Vice President Kamala Harris
hosted a roundtable conversation with disability rights leaders to
discuss access to reproductive health care. The meeting built on the
Vice President’s engagements on reproductive rights with health care
providers; faith leaders; constitutional law, privacy, and technology
experts; advocates; and state attorneys general, and it followed recent
meetings that the Vice President has convened with state legislators and
local leaders in Indianapolis, Indiana; Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte,
North Carolina; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;
and Orlando, Florida. Vice President Harris also convened legislators
from Florida, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, and Nebraska in Washington
D.C. to discuss the reproductive rights challenges in those states.  
Vice President Harris discussed how disparities in health care access
continue to exist in our country for people with disabilities, and she
conveyed that those challenges are being exacerbated following the
Supreme Court overturning *Roe v. Wade*. The participants shared stories
of challenges that are disproportionately facing people with
disabilities as it relates to reproductive health care and abortion
access.  
   
Vice President Harris emphasized the Administration’s commitment to
protecting reproductive rights and shared how the Administration will
continue to fight for the bodily autonomy and self-determination of all
individuals with disabilities. The participants discussed how there is
significant work to be done to fulfill the promise of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, and Vice President Harris thanked them for their
leadership in shining a spotlight on the need for equity and access. She
spoke about the importance of coalition-building in the movement to
protect reproductive care for all people.
