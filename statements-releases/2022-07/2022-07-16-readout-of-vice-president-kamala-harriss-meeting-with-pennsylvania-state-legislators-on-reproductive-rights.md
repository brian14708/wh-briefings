title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Pennsylvania\
  \ State Legislators on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened more than 30 Pennsylvania
state legislators who are fighting on the frontlines to protect
reproductive rights. Today’s meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
follows engagements about reproductive rights that the Vice President
held with health care providers, faith leaders, constitutional law and
privacy experts, advocates, state Attorneys General, and other state
legislators. The Vice President convened state legislators from across
the country on July 8, 2022 at the White House, and on July 14, 2022,
she convened Florida state legislators in Orlando, Florida.  
   
During the meeting, the participants discussed what they can
collectively do to fight for the rights of the American people and
defend a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. The state
legislators described how Republican legislators in Pennsylvania are
pushing for extremist laws that endanger women and jeopardize privacy
rights. They discussed the intersection of attacks on abortion access
and attacks on voting rights and LGBTQI+ rights – noting the importance
of building coalitions to defend our democracy and work toward progress.

The Vice President thanked the legislators for defending reproductive
rights and freedoms. She conveyed the Administration’s commitment to
protecting access to reproductive health care and patient privacy, and
she encouraged the state legislators to keep defending the rights of
women in Pennsylvania and to work with leaders from states across the
country who are experiencing similar challenges. The Vice President
reiterated the importance of engaging at the local, state and federal
level to defend democracy, strengthen the rule of law, and protect
reproductive health care.
