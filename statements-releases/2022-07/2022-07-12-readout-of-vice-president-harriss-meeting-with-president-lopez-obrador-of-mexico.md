Vice President Kamala Harris hosted President Lopez Obrador of Mexico
for breakfast at the Naval Observatory today to deepen the longstanding
cooperation between the United States and Mexico. The Vice President
conveyed her appreciation for the close friendship and shared values
between Mexico and the United States. Vice President Harris and
President Lopez Obrador had a wide-ranging discussion about our common
challenges and opportunities as neighbors, partners, and friends. They
discussed our shared work to address the root causes of migration from
Northern Central America and the need to collaborate on concrete next
steps in this effort. The leaders discussed the importance of
public-private partnerships in generating investment-led growth, and
agreed to explore further cooperation in this area under the U.S.-Mexico
High Level Economic Dialogue (HLED), with a particular focus on economic
development initiatives in southern Mexico.
