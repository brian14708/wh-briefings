title: "FACT SHEET: 10 Ways the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Is Responding to\
  \ Extreme\_Heat"
---
 
This summer, millions of Americans are grappling with extreme heat and
record-breaking temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit – sending
tens of thousands of Americans to the emergency room, increasing health
problems, and putting seniors, children, and workers at risk. As the
impacts of extreme heat are intensifying across the country due to
climate change, President Biden and Vice President Harris are taking
action to protect communities, including by:  

1.  **Lowering cooling costs for families**: In April, the
    Administration released $385 million through the Low-Income Home
    Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), including to reduce summer
    cooling costs. Last week, the Department of Health and Human
    Services released
    [guidance](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-im-2022-06-heat-stress-flexibilities-and-resources-fy2022)
    to help states use this funding to get more air conditioners and
    electric heat pumps into homes.

<!-- -->

1.  **Supporting community cooling centers**: The new LIHEAP guidance
    also helps states, Tribes, and territories establish community
    cooling centers in public facilities where people can keep cool
    during the hottest periods of the day. Additionally, the
    Environmental Protection Agency is using [American Rescue Plan
    funding](https://www.epa.gov/arp/schools-community-cleaner-air-and-cooling-centers)
    to help create cooling centers in public school facilities.

<!-- -->

1.  **Keeping workplaces safe**: In April, Vice President Harris and
    Labor Secretary Walsh
    [launch](https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/04122022)ed
    the first national program to protect indoor and outdoor workers
    from heat stress. Since then, the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration (OSHA) has already conducted over 500 heat-related
    inspections, focused on over 70 high-risk industries across 43
    states.

<!-- -->

1.  **Developing the first national heat standard to protect workers:**
    OSHA has initiated the
    [rulemaking](https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure/rulemaking) process
    toward the first-ever national heat standard to ensure protections
    in indoor and outdoor workplaces across the country.

<!-- -->

1.  **Providing real-time data and response resources:** To equip local
    officials and the public with robust and accessible information, the
    Administration has launched [Heat.gov](https://heat.gov/), a new
    centralized portal with real-time, interactive data and resources on
    extreme heat conditions, preparedness, and response.

<!-- -->

1.  **Identifying and addressing disproportionate impacts:** Recent [EPA
    analysis](https://www.epa.gov/cira/social-vulnerability-report)
    confirms that climate-driven changes in extreme temperatures
    disproportionately impact groups that are socially vulnerable. EPA’s
    [Let’s Talk About Heat
    Challenge](https://www.epa.gov/innovation/lets-talk-about-heat-challenge)
    is supporting local communication strategies to inform people of
    extreme heat risks and ways to keep safe, with a focus on engaging
    underserved and overburdened communities.

<!-- -->

1.  **Leveraging nature to cool down cities**: The National Ocean and
    Atmospheric Administration is [helping communities map urban heat
    islands](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-and-communities-to-map-heat-inequities-in-14-us-cities-and-counties),
    areas that can be up to 20 degrees hotter due to factors including
    higher pavement concentration and lower tree cover. The U.S.
    Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service has developed a [guide
    for communities](https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/gtr/gtr_nrs203.pdf)
    and is helping to
    [fund](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/urban-forests/ucf)
    urban tree and greening projects to reduce extreme temperatures and
    heat exposure.

<!-- -->

1.  **Investing in proactive resilience projects:** Last week, President
    Biden
    [announced](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/20/fact-sheetpresident-bidens-executive-actions-on-climate-to-address-extreme-heat-and-boost-offshore-wind/)
    that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will have $2.3
    billion for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities
    (BRIC) program to help communities increase resilience to heat
    waves, drought, wildfires, flood, hurricanes, and other hazards by
    preparing before disaster strikes.

<!-- -->

1.  **Funding innovative cooling technologies:** The Department of
    Homeland Security recently
    [announced](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2022/07/05/dhs-prize-winners-announced-challenge-counter-extreme-temperatures)
    winners of the first-ever Cooling Solutions Challenge prize
    competition, supporting innovative ideas to help first responders,
    individuals, households, or displaced populations keep cool during
    extreme heat events.

<!-- -->

1.  **Helping health professionals prepare and respond**: The Department
    of Health and Human Services, through the Administration’s new
    Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, launched a [Climate and
    Health
    Outlook](https://www.hhs.gov/climate-change-health-equity-environmental-justice/climate-change-health-equity/climate-health-outlook/index.html)
    to inform health professionals of climate events expected in the
    next 30-90 days and support proactive action to reduce health risks
    from heat waves and other extreme weather events.
