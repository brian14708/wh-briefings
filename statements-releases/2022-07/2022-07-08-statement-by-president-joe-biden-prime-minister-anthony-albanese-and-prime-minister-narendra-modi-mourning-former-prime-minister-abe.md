  \ Minister Narendra Modi Mourning Former Prime Minister\_Abe"

We, the leaders of Australia, India, and the United States, are shocked
at the tragic assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe. Prime Minister Abe was a transformative leader for Japan and for
Japanese relations with each one of our countries. He also played a
formative role in the founding of the Quad partnership, and worked
tirelessly to advance a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.
Our hearts are with the people of Japan — and Prime Minister Kishida— in
this moment of grief. We will honor Prime Minister Abe’s memory by
redoubling our work towards a peaceful and prosperous region.
