title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Shooting in Highland Park,\_Illinois"
---
 
Jill and I are shocked by the senseless gun violence that has yet again
brought grief to an American community on this Independence Day.  As
always, we are grateful for the first responders and law enforcement on
the scene. I have spoken to Governor Pritzker and Mayor Rotering, and
have offered the full support of the Federal government to their
communities. I also surged Federal law enforcement to assist in the
urgent search for the shooter, who remains at large at this time.
 Members of the community should follow guidance from leadership on the
ground, and I will monitor closely as we learn more about those whose
lives have been lost and pray for those who are in the hospital with
grievous injuries.  

I recently signed the first major bipartisan gun reform legislation in
almost thirty years into law, which includes actions that will save
lives. But there is much more work to do, and I’m not going to give up
fighting the epidemic of gun violence.
