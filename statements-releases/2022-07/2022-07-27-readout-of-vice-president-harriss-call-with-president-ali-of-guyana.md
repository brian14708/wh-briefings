efforts to strengthen partnerships with Caribbean nations, and to
underscore the continued importance the United States places on the
U.S.-Guyana relationship. In
[April](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/04/29/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-in-a-virtual/),
the Vice President convened a virtual meeting with Caribbean leaders and
in

at the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, President Biden and the
Vice President convened Caribbean leaders for an in-person meeting. In
today’s call, the Vice President and President Ali reviewed progress
made since these engagements, including the work of three short-term
joint U.S.-Caribbean committees that President Biden and the Vice
President launched at the Summit of the Americas to produce concrete,
near-term solutions on areas of immediate concern for Caribbean leaders:
food security, energy security, and access to development financing. The
Vice President welcomed progress made on these three areas, and
reiterated the interest of the United States in addressing the unique
vulnerabilities and urgent economic challenges facing Caribbean
nations.  
   
In particular, the Vice President and President Ali discussed the work
of the U.S.-Caribbean food security committee, which President Ali leads
for the Caribbean. The Vice President thanked President Ali for his
leadership and noted that addressing food insecurity is a global
priority for the Biden-Harris Administration, which is working with the
international community to provide immediate aid to the hungry and to
promote investment in agriculture to increase food production. The Vice
President and President Ali discussed the recent commitment of the
United States to provide $28 million for food security assistance to
Caribbean nations and other ways the United States can support the
Caribbean in this area.  
   
The Vice President and President Ali discussed the importance of a
sustainable energy future. As part of that, they discussed the
implementation of the [U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate
Crisis
2030](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/09/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-the-u-s-caribbean-partnership-to-address-the-climate-crisis-2030-pacc-2030/)
(PACC 2030), which the Vice President launched in June to facilitate
clean energy infrastructure development and strengthen climate
resiliency in the Caribbean. The Vice President highlighted efforts to
accelerate PACC 2030’s energy infrastructure development timeline by
incorporating these lines of effort into the work of the U.S.-Caribbean
short-term energy and finance committees.    
   
The Vice President noted that she looked forward to continuing her
collaboration with President Ali in promoting inclusive democracy,
economic development, and security for all Guyanese, and underscored the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to strengthening U.S.
partnerships with the Caribbean.
