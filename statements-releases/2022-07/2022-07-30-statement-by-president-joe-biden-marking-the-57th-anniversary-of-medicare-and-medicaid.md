title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden Marking the 57th Anniversary of Medicare\
  \ and\_Medicaid"
---
 
Today is the 57<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid – two
programs that have given millions of Americans the security and dignity
of affordable health care coverage. Nearly 140 million Americans benefit
from these programs, including millions of seniors, pregnant women,
families, and people with disabilities.  
   
Republicans in Congress are proposing to put Medicare and Medicaid on
the chopping block every five years – meaning 140 million Americans
would lose the peace of mind of knowing they have access to affordable
health care.  
   
Congressional Democrats and I are fighting to strengthen these programs,
so no American has to face a choice between health care and putting food
on the table. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will keep the
Affordable Care Act improvements under the American Rescue Plan that
have saved 13 million Americans an average of $800 per year on health
insurance premiums, and will protect 3 million Americans from becoming
uninsured. It will also allow Medicare to negotiate a better deal on
prescription drugs – lowering costs for potentially millions of seniors
and other beneficiaries. And, this legislation caps out-of-pocket drug
costs at $2,000 per year, saving Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and
other chronic illnesses thousands of dollars annually. For decades,
Congressional Democrats have been fighting for this – and we are poised
to come together and get it done.  
   
Today, as we recognize the anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid,
Congress has an opportunity to make history and strengthen the health
and financial security of millions of Americans. I urge Congress to pass
the Inflation Reduction Act quickly, so we can lower health care costs
for millions of Americans.
