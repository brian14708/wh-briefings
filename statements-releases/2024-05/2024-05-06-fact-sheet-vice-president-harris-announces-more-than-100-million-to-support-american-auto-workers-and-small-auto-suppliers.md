title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces More Than $100 Million to Support\
  \ American Auto Workers and Small Auto\_Suppliers"
---
 
*Actions announced during the Vice President’s nationwide Economic
Opportunity Tour build on the Administration’s historic investments in
the auto sector to ensure U.S. leadership in the clean vehicle future*

Today, as part of her Economic Opportunity Tour, Vice President Harris
will join Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, Acting Secretary of
Labor Julie Su, Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves, and Michigan
Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II in Detroit, Michigan to announce
new funding and resources for small- and medium-sized auto manufacturers
and autoworkers.  
  
For decades, trickle-down economics drove manufacturers overseas at the
expense of good-paying manufacturing jobs that sustained the American
middle class. Thanks to President Biden and Vice President Harris’s
Investing in America agenda, since they took office, companies have
announced more than $170 billion in investments in electric vehicle (EV)
and battery supply chain manufacturing, making the U.S. the global
leader for EV manufacturing investment, and the U.S. auto industry has
added over 250,000 jobs, after losing 90,000 jobs under the previous
Administration. More than 20 auto and battery plants have been announced
under President Biden and Vice President Harris, after no new net plants
were opened under the previous Administration.  
  
Historic contracts secured by the United Auto Workers with the Big 3
Detroit automakers—Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis—as well as
recent organizing victories like at Volkswagen in Chattanooga,
Tennessee, ensure that these jobs of the future will provide comparable
wages, retirement security, and respect at work.  
  
**<u>To ensure that the future of the auto industry is made in America
by American autoworkers, today, Vice President Harris will
announce:</u>**  
  
**More than $100 million in funding for small- and medium-sized auto
parts manufacturers to expand or retool manufacturing facilities:**

-   The Department of Energy will set aside** $50 million of
    its **[**Automotive Conversion Grants
    Program**](https://www.energy.gov/mesc/articles/mesc-seeks-input-state-partnerships-enable-automotive-conversion-grants-small-and) for
    partnerships with states to help small- and medium-sized suppliers
    convert from manufacturing internal combustion engine parts to
    manufacturing parts for the EV supply chain. This funding will
    maintain the Domestic Conversion Grant’s same focus on supporting
    retooling to keep good, good-paying and union jobs in the same
    communities as automakers and auto suppliers transition to electric
    vehicle manufacturing here in America. The Department of Energy
    recently requested [public
    input](https://www.energy.gov/mesc/articles/mesc-seeks-input-state-partnerships-enable-automotive-conversion-grants-small-and) on
    the design of these state-federal partnerships in order to best
    support small- and medium-sized manufacturers in the auto supply
    chain.  
     
-   The Department of Energy is setting aside up to **$50 million of its
    Industrial Assessments Center **[**Implementation Grants
    Program**](https://www.energywerx.org/opportunities/iacimplementationgrants) to
    help auto suppliers kickstart manufacturing diversification and
    conversion projects. Specifically, this program, which was funded by
    President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and is covered under
    the President’s [Justice40
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
    provides grants of up to $300,000 to entities that have received an
    Industrial Assessment Center assessment to improve their facilities’
    energy and material efficiency, cybersecurity, or productivity, or
    reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.  
     
-   The Small Business Administration will leverage its [Small Business
    Investment
    Company](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/investment-capital/sbic-directory) program
    to catalyze **millions of dollars in private capital for the EV
    supply chain** to help small and medium-sized manufacturers grow and
    diversify their businesses. The Department of Energy will partner
    with the Small Business Administration to provide technical
    expertise to de-risk private investments and lower the cost of
    capital for small and medium-sized manufacturers.  
     
-   The Small Business Administration plans to establish
    a **new **[**Working Capital Pilot
    Program**](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/26/2024-06421/data-collection-available-for-public-comments) under
    its signature 7(a) lending program to provide lines of credit to
    small businesses, including auto parts manufacturers and
    distributors, to support their domestic or export finance needs. The
    program will be paired with business counseling from the Small
    Business Administration.

**Actions to expand workforce training and improve job quality in the EV
supply chain with a focus on Auto Communities in the Midwest:**

-   Last month, President
    Biden [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-workforce-hubs-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-good-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/) the
    second round of Investing in America Workforce Hubs—including
    an **electric vehicle hub in Michigan**, which will be led by the
    Department of Energy and Department of Labor in partnership with the
    State of Michigan. Workforce Hubs are place-based initiatives
    focused on partnerships for job-training to ensure all Americans can
    access the good jobs created by the President’s Investing in America
    agenda. As part of the Hub, the White House and agency partners will
    bring together state and local partners, unions, employers,
    philanthropy, non-profits, community colleges, high schools, and
    other stakeholders to tackle discrete workforce challenges in the
    Michigan electric vehicle supply chain—and to ensure that the
    workers, unions, and businesses that have historically powered the
    auto industry lead the next generation of clean vehicles.

-   The Department of Energy is **opening applications for its new
    Community Workforce Readiness Accelerator for Major Projects (RAMP)
    Fellowship**. Fellows will spend two years building and scaling
    projects that expand workforce development partnerships to serve
    local and underrepresented populations in communities that have
    received major clean energy and manufacturing investments, including
    Michigan.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Energy recently made available [**$24
    million**](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-24-million-expand-americas-clean-energy-workforce)** in
    grants** **for EV and other clean energy and advanced manufacturing
    workforce training** at community colleges, trade schools, union
    training programs, and registered apprenticeships through the
    Industrial Assessment Centers Program, which aims to deliver on the
    President’s [Justice40
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/).  
     
-   Led by the Department of Energy, the [Battery Workforce
    Initiative](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-and-dol-announce-new-effort-support-and-expand-americas-battery-workforce) will
    fill a critical gap in the battery industry by
    developing **standardized training guidelines for key battery
    manufacturing occupations**, including operators and machine
    repairers, which will increase the quality of these jobs while
    responding to industry demand for skilled workers. The Department of
    Energy will pilot this workforce curriculum with union
    manufacturers. Under the Battery Workforce Initiative, the
    Department of Labor will also implement model safety and health
    management practices focused on battery manufacturing, as well as
    assess the need for an industry-wide standard.  
     
-   The Department of Labor will organize **EV workforce convenings in
    Ohio and Indiana**. As part of the [Building Pathways to
    Infrastructure Jobs Grant
    Program](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20230926), the
    Department of Labor recently awarded $7 million across Indiana and
    Ohio to develop sector partnerships that bring together the public
    workforce and education system, community-based organizations,
    employers, and labor unions focused on the EV industry. These sector
    partnerships will work collaboratively to design and scale
    worker-centered training programs, help suppliers in auto
    communities analyze the impact of the EV transition on their labor
    force needs, and spread awareness of existing workforce development
    technical assistance and funding resources.

**New technical assistance programs to help small and medium-sized auto
parts manufacturers and their communities take advantage of growth in
the EV sector and other markets:**

-   The Department of Energy, in collaboration with industry experts,
    will **develop a Small Supplier EV Transition Playbook** to help
    internal combustion engine suppliers navigate the transition of
    their business model to EV or adjacent markets. This playbook will
    describe new products that ICE suppliers could produce based on
    existing manufacturing capabilities, outline workforce and technical
    changes needed to succeed in new industries, and guide suppliers
    through available federal resources. Applications for partnerships
    are open through May 23, 2024, and playbook will provide guidance to
    be used by the Transition Network described below.  
     
-   The Federal government will **launch the Auto Supplier Transition
    Network**, which will provide research and hands on, locally based
    technical assistance in auto communities to help small and
    medium-sized auto suppliers, unions, and auto communities navigate
    the opportunities in the EV transition and broader clean energy
    manufacturing acceleration. These providers will serve as regional
    hubs for technical, financial, industry, and workforce resources
    needed to support individual suppliers. These providers will offer
    technical, financial, industry, and workforce resources at no or
    below market rate costs and include:

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Energy’s [Industrial Assessment
    Centers](https://www.energy.gov/mesc/industrial-assessment-centers-iacs) can
    provide no-cost assessments to help small and medium-sized auto
    suppliers improve energy performance and productivity. Auto
    suppliers that receive an assessment can also apply for Industrial
    Assessments Center implementation grants of up to $300,000 to
    kickstart manufacturing diversification and conversion projects.  
     
-   [Manufacturing Extension Partnership
    Centers,](https://www.nist.gov/mep/centers) public-private
    partnerships located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico that help
    small and midsized manufacturers with workforce development, market
    research, launching new products, and much more—often in partnership
    with Industrial Assessment Centers. Manufacturing Extension
    Partnerships will help small and medium-sized suppliers implement
    recommendations from the Small Supplier EV Transition Toolkit.  
     
-   The International Trade Administration [local
    offices](https://www.trade.gov/locations), which can serve as
    coordinators and multipliers to educate companies about these
    programs.  
     
-   Small Business Administration [district
    offices](https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-locations/sba-district-offices),
    which offer business development services and training to help small
    businesses grow.  
     
-   U.S. Department of Agriculture [Rural Development State
    Offices](https://www.rd.usda.gov/about-rd/offices/state-offices),
    which are locally-based and can help small businesses and
    manufacturers in rural areas expand or improve.

These actions build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing
commitment to ensuring that the workers and businesses that built the
auto industry remain community anchors for generations to come,
including the more than 250,000 auto workers in small- and medium-sized
auto parts suppliers across the country. As part of that commitment,
last fall, the Department of Energy announced the availability of up to
$15.5 billion in grant and loan funding to retool and convert auto
factories transitioning to electric vehicles, prioritizing applications
from facilities at risk of closing or recently closed, and rewards
applicants that retain existing workers, have strong labor partnerships,
pay high wages, and convert facilities while remaining in the same
community.  
  
Today’s announcement is also an important milestone in the Biden-Harris
Administration’s effort to help small businesses grow and thrive,
including minority and veteran-owned businesses and businesses in
distressed and disadvantaged communities. Traditionally underserved
small businesses are growing at near-historic rates, with Black business
ownership growing at the fastest pace in 30 years and Latino business
ownership growing at the fastest pace in more than a decade.

**As President Biden and Vice President Harris continue to invest in all
of America, their agenda is lowering costs for Michigan families:**

-   Saving 2.2 million Michigan Medicare beneficiaries money on
    prescription drugs, insulin, and vaccines.
-   Saving 418,000 Michiganders hundreds of dollars per year on health
    insurance.
-   Michigan families will get lower utility bills thanks to $211
    million in home energy rebates and new tax credits for
    energy-efficient appliances.
-   President Biden is taking on corporate rip-offs like junk fees to
    lower costs for Michigan families on everything from airfares to
    event tickets to overdraft fees.
-   President Biden would lower housing costs with a $10,000 tax credit
    for first-time homebuyers, expanded rental assistance, and by
    building more than 2 million homes.
-   President Biden would lower child care costs by guaranteeing child
    care for families making up to $200,000, with most families paying
    no more than $10 a day.

**Congressional Republicans have no plan to lower costs—in fact, their
plan would increase costs for Michiganders by:**

-   Increasing costs for health care, prescription drugs, and insulin by
    siding with Big Pharma to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and
    Affordable Care Act and slash Medicare.
-   Cutting Social Security by $1.5 trillion and raising Medicare costs
    for seniors by transitioning Medicare to a system that would raise
    premiums.
-   Raising taxes for middle-class families by repealing the Inflation
    Reduction Act and Affordable Care Act.
-   Raising housing costs by cutting rental assistance and programs to
    build new homes.
