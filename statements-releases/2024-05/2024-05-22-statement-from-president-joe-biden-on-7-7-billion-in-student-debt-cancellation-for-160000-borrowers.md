title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on $7.7 Billion in Student Debt Cancellation\
  \ for 160,000\_Borrowers"
---
 
Today, my Administration is canceling student debt for 160,000 more
people, bringing the total number of Americans who have benefitted from
our debt relief actions to 4.75 million. Each of those borrowers has
received an average of over $35,000 in debt cancellation. These 160,000
additional borrowers are people enrolled in my Administration’s SAVE
Plan; are public service workers like teachers, nurses, or law
enforcement officials; or are borrowers who were approved for relief
because of fixes we made to Income-Driven Repayment. 

Today’s announcement comes on top of the significant progress we’ve made
for students and borrowers over the past three years. That includes
providing the largest increases to the maximum Pell Grant in over a
decade; fixing Public Service Loan Forgiveness so teachers, nurses,
police officers, and other public service workers get the relief they
are entitled to under the law; and holding colleges accountable for
taking advantage of students and families. And last month, I laid out my
Administration’s new plans that would cancel student debt for more than
30 million Americans when combined with everything we’ve done so far. 

From day one of my Administration, I promised to fight to ensure higher
education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.
I will never stop working to cancel student debt – no matter how many
times Republican elected officials try to stop us.
