title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Landslide in Papua New\_Guinea"
---
 
Jill and I are heartbroken by the loss of life and devastation caused by
the landslide in Papua New Guinea. Our prayers are with all the families
impacted by this tragedy and all the first responders who are putting
themselves in harm’s way to help their fellow citizens.

I have directed my Administration to stay in close touch with our Papua
New Guinean partners as they lead rescue and recovery efforts. We stand
ready to assist. And at this dark hour, we will continue to coordinate
with Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand, and our Quad partners
to ensure we’re meeting our commitment to partner in delivering
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief across the Indo-Pacific.

The United States stands with Papua New Guinea—our close partner and
friend—today and always.
