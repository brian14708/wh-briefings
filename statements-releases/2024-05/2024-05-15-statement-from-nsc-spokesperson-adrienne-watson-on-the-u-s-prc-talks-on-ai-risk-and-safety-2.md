Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Technology
and National Security Tarun Chhabra and Department of State Acting
Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technology Seth Center led an
interagency U.S. delegation with officials from the White House, the
Department of State, and the Department of Commerce to meet with a PRC
delegation including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of
Science and Technology, National Development and Reform Commission,
Cyberspace Administration of China, Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, and the Chinese Communist Party Office of the Central
Foreign Affairs Commission on May 14 in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss
artificial intelligence (AI) risk and safety.  This meeting followed the
Woodside summit between President Biden and President Xi Jinping in
November 2023, where both leaders affirmed the need to convene U.S. and
PRC government experts to address the risks associated with advanced AI
systems. 

In a candid and constructive discussion, the United States and PRC
exchanged perspectives on their respective approaches to AI safety and
risk management.  The United States reiterated the importance of
harnessing the benefits of AI for sustainable
development, for developing and developed countries alike.  The United
States underscored the importance of ensuring AI systems are safe,
secure, and trustworthy in order to realize these benefits of AI, and of
continuing to build global consensus on that basis.  The United
States also raised concerns over the misuse of AI, including by the
PRC. 

The United States affirmed the need to maintain open lines of
communication on AI risk and safety as an important part of responsibly
managing competition.
