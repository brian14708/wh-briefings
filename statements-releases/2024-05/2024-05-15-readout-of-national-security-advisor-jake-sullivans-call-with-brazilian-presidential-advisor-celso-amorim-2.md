National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by telephone yesterday
with Brazilian Presidential Advisor Celso Amorim. He expressed his
condolences on behalf of President Biden and the people of the United
States to those who have been impacted by the devastating flooding and
landslides in southern Brazil. The National Security Advisor reiterated
the United States continued support and commitment to work closely with
Brazil on providing necessary assistance. The two discussed progress on
deepening our bilateral relationship and addressing global and regional
challenges, including efforts to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza and
secure a ceasefire and hostage deal that would bring American and
Brazilian hostages home, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and the electoral
process in Venezuela.
