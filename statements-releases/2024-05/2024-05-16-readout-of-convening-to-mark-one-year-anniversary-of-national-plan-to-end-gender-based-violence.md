title: "Readout of Convening to Mark One-Year Anniversary of National Plan to End\
  \ Gender-Based\_Violence"
---
 
Yesterday, nearly one year since the White House released the first-ever
[U.S. National Plan to End Gender-Based
Violence](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2023/05/25/release-of-the-national-plan-to-end-gender-based-violence-strategies-for-action/),
senior Biden-Harris Administration officials hosted advocates from
across the country to discuss the Administration’s historic efforts to
prevent and address gender-based violence. Ending gender-based violence
has been a cornerstone of President Biden’s career—including his
championing of the original Violence Against Women Act in 1994 as a U.S.
Senator. As President, he has signed historic legislation to secure the
highest-ever funding to support implementation of the Violence Against
Women Act, expand the reach of services to underserved communities, and
increase housing protections for survivors.

Participants in the convening discussed the Administration’s commitment
to ending gender-based violence wherever it occurs—at home, at work, in
schools, in communities, and online—as well as the substantial progress
that has been made towards implementing the U.S. National Plan.
Participants also discussed new Administration actions aimed at
addressing gender-based violence, including:

-   **Release of the Final Report and Blueprint of the White House Task
    Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse.** Established through
    a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/06/16/memorandum-on-the-establishment-of-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/)
    signed by President Biden in June 2022, the [White House Task Force
    to Address Online Harassment and
    Abuse](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/16/fact-sheet-presidential-memorandum-establishing-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/)
    issued a [final
    Blueprint](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White-House-Task-Force-to-Address-Online-Harassment-and-Abuse_FINAL.pdf)
    that outlines comprehensive actions from more than a dozen federal
    agencies, including enhanced protections for students, children and
    youth, as well as programs that represent a record investment of
    more than $36 million in dedicated funding to address
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence in the U.S. and
    globally.

-   **New “Safe Leave” Options for Federal Employees.** The Office of
    Personnel Management issued guidance for federal agencies on the use
    of “safe leave” to support federal employees’ access to paid leave
    and leave without pay for purposes related to seeking safety and
    recovering from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,
    or stalking. The updated guidance highlights options for federal
    employees to take leave to obtain medical treatment, seek assistance
    from organizations that provide services to survivors, seek
    relocation, and take related legal action. Today’s new guidance,
    consistent with a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-support-and-advance-womens-economic-security/)
    signed by President Biden in February 2023, will help ensure that
    federal employees have access to leave when they need it.

-   **Survivor-Centered Initiatives Under the Violence Against Women Act
    (VAWA).** In continuing to implement the VAWA Reauthorization Act of
    2022, the Department of Justice recently announced new targeted
    [grants](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/media/1325916/dl?inline) and
    [initiatives](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/media/1344841/dl) to
    address the intersectional needs and lived experiences of survivors.
    To increase additional pathways to justice for survivors, DOJ
    recently released a
    [solicitation](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/media/1351556/dl?inline)
    for the first-ever Restorative Practices Pilot Program to support,
    enhance, and expand existing restorative practice programs that
    prevent or address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual
    assault, or stalking, and build evidence for victim-centered,
    trauma-informed, and culturally responsive restorative practices
    addressing these harms. DOJ also launched the [Healing and Response
    Teams Special
    Initiative](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/media/1350851/dl?inline) to
    fund pilot sites using a Tribal-based model of care to respond to
    cases of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People related to intimate
    partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and sex trafficking.

-   **New Protections to Promote Survivor Privacy, Safety, and Economic
    Security.** The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [called
    on](https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-safe-connected-cars-domestic-violence-survivors)
    auto manufacturers and wireless service providers to help protect
    survivors from the misuse of connected car tools by abusers by
    helping ensure that smart car services are not being used to stalk,
    harass, or intimidate survivors of domestic violence. FCC then
    issued a [proposed
    rule](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-rules-protect-survivors-using-connected-cars)
    to that effect, which follows a separate FCC
    [rule](https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-adopts-rules-implementing-safe-connections-act-survivors-domestic-abuse)
    that allows a survivor of domestic abuse to separate a mobile phone
    line from an account with an abuser. The Department of the Treasury
    and Internal Revenue Service will also issue new guidance
    implementing a provision of SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 affirming that
    survivors of domestic abuse may qualify to receive penalty-free
    distributions from an employer-sponsored retirement plan to provide
    additional flexibility for a survivor who may need access to funds
    to, for instance, support relocation.   The distribution from the
    retirement plan is included in gross income, unless the amount is
    subsequently repaid to the plan or rolled over to an Individual
    Retirement Account, but it is not subject to the 10% penalty tax
    that normally applies to an early distribution. 

These announcements build on the Administration’s previous efforts to
address gender-based violence. For instance, the Administration has
strengthened gender-based violence protections for Tribal communities,
helped keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, restored and
strengthened vital protections from sexual violence and other sex-based
harassment for students, taken bold action to strengthen accountability
for sexual violence in the military and advance bipartisan military
justice reform, provided guidance to employers on how to prevent
discrimination and make people feel safe on the job, and increased
access to resources for survivors. This work is guided by the U.S.
National Plan, which adopted a comprehensive, government-wide approach
to end sexual violence, intimate partner violence, stalking, online
harassment and abuse, and other forms of gender-based violence.

Participants in today’s convening included:

-   Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
    Gender Policy Council
-   Jessica Rosenworcel, Chairwoman of the Federal Communications
    Commission
-   Charlotte Burrows, Chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
