Fighting inflation and lowering costs is my top economic priority. I
know many families are struggling, and that even though we’ve made
progress we have a lot more to do. Inflation has fallen more than 60%
from its peak, and core inflation fell to its lowest level in three
years. Prices are still too high—so my agenda will give families
breathing room by building two million new homes to lower housing costs,
taking on Big Pharma to lower prescription drug prices, and calling on
grocery chains making record profits to lower grocery prices for
consumers.

Rather than bringing solutions, Congressional Republicans want to
increase costs by going back to their same old trickle-down economics.
Republicans want to slash taxes for the ultra-wealthy and big
corporations, and raise taxes for middle class families. They would
protect special interests and Big Pharma, and undermine workers and
seniors by slashing Social Security and Medicare. All that would send
inflation skyrocketing. I have a different vision for the future: one in
which we take on special interests to lower costs and give the middle
class a fair shot.
