title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting With Brown v. Board Plaintiffs\
  \ and their\_Families"
---
 
In honor of the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Brown v. Board of
Education, President Joe Biden hosted a delegation of plaintiffs and
family members representing the historic decision in the Oval Office.
Members of the delegation represented litigants from the five cases that
were combined under the Brown v. Board decision, including *Brown v.
Board of Education of Topeka, Briggs v. Elliott, Davis v. County School
Board of Prince Edward County, Belton (Bulah) v. Gebhart, and Bolling v.
Sharpe*.

President Biden reiterated his longstanding effort to honor the legacy
of historic changemakers that paved the way for progress and hard-fought
rights for Black Americans and all Americans. The President and the
delegation also highlighted the continued need to advance educational
equity and underscored the White House’s strong commitment to addressing
racial disparities in our education system, despite attacks on
educational rights, the erasure of Black history, and the elimination of
affirmative action in university admissions. President Biden and Vice
President Harris remain committed to driving greater equality and
opportunity within our education system and society.
