On May 31, President Joe Biden will welcome Prime Minister Alexander De
Croo of Belgium for a meeting at the White House. The leaders will
reaffirm the close partnership between the United States and Belgium to
address global challenges. They will discuss their shared commitment to
continue supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s war, including our
efforts to make the greatest use of the immobilized Russian sovereign
assets. President Biden will also recognize Belgium’s contributions to
transatlantic security and Ukraine’s defense.
