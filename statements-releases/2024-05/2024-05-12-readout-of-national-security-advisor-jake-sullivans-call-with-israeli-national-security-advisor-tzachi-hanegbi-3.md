National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with his Israeli
counterpart Tzachi Hanegbi.  He expressed his condolences on behalf of
President Biden and the American people on Israel’s Memorial Day.  He
emphasized that this is the first Memorial Day to commemorate the
victims of Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attacks that killed over 1,000
Israelis. Mr. Sullivan affirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to Israel’s
security and the defeat of Hamas in Gaza. They also discussed the
situation in Gaza and ongoing efforts to secure the release of
hostages.  Mr. Sullivan reiterated President Biden’s longstanding
concerns over the potential for a major military ground operation into
Rafah, where over one million people have taken shelter. He discussed
alternative courses of action to ensure the defeat of Hamas everywhere
in Gaza. Mr. Hanegbi confirmed that Israel is taking U.S. concerns into
account.  Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Hanegbi then reviewed the substantive
discussions to date of the Strategic Consultative Group. They agreed to
establish another in-person meeting soon.
