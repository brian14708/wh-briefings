title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Iowa Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Iowa and ordered Federal aid to supplement State,
tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe
storms, tornadoes, and flooding from May 20 to May 21, 2024.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Adair, Montgomery, Polk, and Story.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for debris removal and emergency protective measures
under the Public Assistance program in Adair County.  
  
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Mr. DuWayne Tewes of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.  
  
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.  
  
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](//fema.net/hqss/rrshare/SHARE/AGREES/Florida/2022/4673%20Ian/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
