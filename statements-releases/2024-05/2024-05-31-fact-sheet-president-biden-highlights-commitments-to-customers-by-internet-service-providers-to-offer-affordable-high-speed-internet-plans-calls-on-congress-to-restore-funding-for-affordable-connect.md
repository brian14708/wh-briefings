title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Highlights Commitments to Customers by Internet\
  \ Service Providers to Offer Affordable High-Speed Internet Plans, Calls on Congress\
  \ to Restore Funding for Affordable Connectivity\_Program"

As part of the President’s Investing in America agenda, the Biden-Harris
Administration has made historic progress towards lowering costs –
including internet costs – for American families across the country. The
Affordable Connectivity Program, enacted under the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law as the largest and most successful internet
affordability program in our nation’s history, has helped over 23
million households save $30-75 each per month on their monthly internet
bills, bringing millions of families online for the first time and
making historic progress towards closing the digital divide.  
  
**Today, May 31<sup>st</sup>, is the final day that households will
receive any benefit from the Affordable Connectivity Program on their
internet bills. Without Congressional action to extend funding for the
program, millions of households are now at risk of losing their internet
connections. President Biden is once again calling on Congress to extend
funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program, so tens of millions of
Americans can continue to access this essential benefit.**  
  
In the absence of funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program,
President Biden remains committed to doing everything possible to ensure
families continue to access affordable high-speed internet. **Today, the
White House highlights voluntary commitments to customers from over a
dozen internet service providers to offer plans at $30 or less to
low-income households through 2024, so that families across America can
continue accessing low-cost internet. This includes commitments from
small, rural carriers that serve a single region and larger providers
that cover multiple states.**  
   
These internet service providers—many of which have a long history of
low-cost internet offers—collectively cover **up to 10 million ACP
households** and are voluntarily offering their current ACP subscribers
and other eligible households a high-speed internet plan for $30 per
month or less, with no fees and data caps, until the end of 2024:

President Biden knows that even $30 is too much for some families, which
is why he will continue calling on Congress to extend funding for the
Affordable Connectivity Program. On October 25, 2023, the Biden-Harris
Administration sent Congress a [supplemental
request](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Summary-of-Funding-Request-to-Meet-Critical-Needs.pdf) for
$6 billion to extend funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program.
Today, the President is repeating that call once again.  

Additionally, through a historic $90 billion in high-speed internet
investments, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue working to
ensure everyone in America can access affordable, reliable high-speed
internet:

-   The $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD)
    Program, funded by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
    requires every state and territory to develop a low-cost plan to
    ensure networks built with BEAD funding are affordable to the
    communities and people they connect;  
-   The Middle Mile program, funded with $1 billion from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law, is funding the construction of 12,000 miles of
    regional fiber networks, which lowers the cost of building “last
    mile” connections directly to homes and businesses;  
-   The Administration has distributed nearly 30,000 connected devices
    to students and communities, including more than 3,600 through the
    Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, to ensure that Tribal
    communities have the tools and resources they need to get online;  
-   And already, projects to connect unserved communities to high-speed
    internet funded by this Administration’s Investing in America agenda
    are under construction or complete in well over half of states,
    meaning that rural families stuck with only expensive connections
    that don’t meet their needs will soon have another more affordable
    option.
