title: "White\_House Readout of Meeting with Community Lenders Expanding Capital for\
  \ Underserved\_Communities"
---
 
This week, the White House welcomed the Board of Directors of the
Opportunity Finance Network (OFN), a leading national network of more
than 400 community development financial institutions (CDFIs) working to
ensure communities underserved by traditional finance have access to
affordable, responsible financial products and services.  A dozen OFN
leaders representing community development loan funds, banks, venture
capital funds, and credit unions met with Biden-Harris Administration
officials from the Domestic Policy Council, National Economic Council,
Office of Public Engagement, and U.S. Department of the Treasury to
discuss the President and Vice President’s ongoing efforts to catalyze
equitable development and economic growth by expanding access to capital
for historically underserved communities. Officials reiterated the
critical role that CDFIs play in ensuring that federal investments and
community finance policies can be leveraged to unlock the economic
potential of communities whose talent and ingenuity has too often been
left on the sidelines. The group discussed the Administration’s historic
support for CDFIs and community investment – including through
Treasury’s $8.5 billion Emergency Capital Investment Program and nearly
$10 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) program– and
ongoing implementation of the President Biden’s Investing in America
agenda.
