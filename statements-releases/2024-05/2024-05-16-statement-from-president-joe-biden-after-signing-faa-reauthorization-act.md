title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden After Signing FAA Reauthorization\_Act"
---
 
The bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization is a big
win for travelers, the aviation workforce, and our economy. It will
expand critical protections for air travelers, strengthen safety
standards, and support pilots, flight attendants, and air traffic
controllers.  
   
It also builds on my Administration’s efforts to improve the travel
experience for airline passengers, affirming the Department of
Transportation’s rule that mandated automatic refunds when flights are
cancelled or significantly delayed. It also makes sure families can sit
together without paying extra fees. Passengers shouldn’t have to jump
through endless hoops just to get the refunds that they are owed, and
corporations shouldn’t rip off hardworking Americans through hidden junk
fees.  
   
I want to thank members of both parties who worked together over many
months to pass this long-term reauthorization.
