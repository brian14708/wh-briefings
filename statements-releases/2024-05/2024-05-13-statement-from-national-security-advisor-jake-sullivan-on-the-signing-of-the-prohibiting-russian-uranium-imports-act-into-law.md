title: "Statement From National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Signing of the\
  \ Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act into\_Law"
---
 
*Following the President’s signing of H.R. 1042, the *[*Prohibiting
Russian Uranium Imports
Act*](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1042/text?s=4&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22hr+1042%22%7D)*,
into law, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan released the following
statement:*  
   
Today, President Biden signed into law a historic series of actions that
will strengthen our nation’s energy and economic security by
reducing—and ultimately eliminating—our reliance on Russia for civilian
nuclear power.  
   
This new law reestablishes America’s leadership in the nuclear sector.
It will help secure our energy sector for generations to come.
And—building off the unprecedented $2.72 billion in federal funding that
Congress recently appropriated at the President’s request—it will
jumpstart new enrichment capacity in the United States and send a clear
message to industry that we are committed to long-term growth in our
nuclear sector.  
   
This law also delivers on multilateral goals we have set with our allies
and partners, including our pledge last December—alongside Canada,
France, Japan, and the United Kingdom—to collectively [invest $4.2
billion](https://www.energy.gov/articles/cop28-us-canada-france-japan-and-uk-announce-plans-mobilize-42-billion-reliable-global) to
expand enrichment and conversion capacity in our countries. I am proud
to say that with these funds from Congress, we have well-exceeded that
pledge and working with industry to realize this ambition.  
   
The [*Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports
Act*](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1042/text?s=4&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22hr+1042%22%7D) demonstrates
the impact and innovation we can achieve through bipartisan cooperation.
We are grateful to Congress for its continued support for civil nuclear
energy as a vital part of our efforts to build a clean economy in the
United States. Under President Biden’s leadership, we will continue to
work together to realize both our climate and energy security
imperatives.
