title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Final Rule to Expand Health\
  \ Coverage for DACA\_Recipients"

Dreamers throughout this country are serving in our military, teaching
in our classrooms, and leading our small businesses as entrepreneurs.
They are our neighbors, classmates, and loved ones. Our nation is
fortunate that America is their home.  
  
Thanks to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), more than
800,000 Dreamers have been able to live, study, and work in the only
home they have ever known while making our nation a better place. It is
why I fought to defend and protect DACA as Attorney General of
California and a U.S. Senator from California.  
  
Now as Vice President, I have worked alongside President Biden to take
steps to preserve and fortify DACA. Today, we are building on this
progress by ensuring DACA recipients also have access to affordable
health care, which will improve the health of all communities. This
announcement will bring relief to more than 100,000 people and help them
thrive while working to achieve their aspirations.  
  
President Biden and I will continue to do everything in our power to
protect DACA, but it is only a temporary solution. Congress must act to
ensure Dreamers have the permanent protections they deserve.
