title: "Fact Sheet: Third Ministerial Meeting on the Los Angeles DeclarationOn Migration\
  \ and Protection in\_Guatemala"
---
 
Nearly two years ago, in response to the historic challenge of migration
and forced displacement, President Biden launched the Los Angeles
Declaration on Migration and Protection, with 20 leaders from across the
Western Hemisphere. The Los Angeles Declaration is a first-of-its-kind
framework to promote coordinated action under three core pillars: (1)
addressing root causes and supporting the integration of migrants to
foster long-term stabilization; (2) expanding lawful pathways; and (3)
strengthening humane enforcement.  
   
On May 7, 2024, Guatemala hosted the third Los Angeles Declaration
Ministerial with foreign ministers and senior representatives from 21
endorsing countries. Secretary of State Antony Blinken led the U.S.
delegation, alongside White House Coordinator for the Los Angeles
Declaration Marcela Escobari, Department of Homeland Security Senior
Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary Kristie
Canegallo, and USAID Acting Assistant Administrator for Latin America
and the Caribbean Michael Camilleri. The United States is grateful for
President Arévalo’s leadership in hosting the Ministerial.  
   
On behalf of the United States, Secretary Blinken announced $578 million
in humanitarian, development, and economic assistance to support partner
countries and host communities in responding to urgent humanitarian
needs, expanding lawful pathways, and supporting the regularization and
integration of migrants. The United States also announced expanded
enforcement partnerships to deter irregular migration, including
increased consequences for the smuggling networks that prey on
vulnerable migrants. The U.S. Government reiterated its commitment to
work alongside partners to establish a permanent, regionally-driven
Secretariat to ensure that coordinated progress is sustained under the
Los Angeles Declaration.  
   
The endorsing countries presented progress toward their commitments
under the Los Angeles Declaration and announced the following new
initiatives.  
   
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Strengthening Humane
Enforcement  
</span> 

-   The United States took steps on May 6 to impose visa restrictions on
    executives of several Colombian maritime transportation companies
    for facilitating irregular migration to the United States. These are
    part of a broader set of U.S. actions targeting owners, executives,
    and senior officials of companies providing transportation by land,
    sea, or charter air designed for use primarily by persons intending
    to irregularly migrate to the United States. Earlier restrictions
    were placed on individuals in the charter air sector.

<!-- -->

-   The International Air Transport Association and several of its
    member airlines committed to concerted action to limit the use of
    commercial flights for irregular migration.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Costa Rica announced the establishment of a
    new Biometric Data Sharing Partnership to enhance Costa Rica’s
    biometric collection and matching, and strengthen its border
    management, thereby increasing safety and security in the region.
    The United States and Costa Rica also signed a memorandum of
    understanding outlining bilateral cooperation in countering
    trafficking in persons.

<!-- -->

-   The United States is deploying additional resources to Guatemala to
    increase security at land, air, and sea ports throughout the
    country, increasing screening and vetting in the region.

<!-- -->

-   The United States will expand public awareness of the CBP One™
    mobile app among migrants seeking to enter the United States. From
    January 2023 through the end of March 2024, more than 547,000
    individuals have used CBP One™ and presented themselves to a port of
    entry for processing, instead of risking their lives at the hands of
    smugglers.

<!-- -->

-   The United States leads the Countering Human Trafficking and Migrant
    Smuggling Action Package Committee under the Los Angeles
    Declaration, coordinating international efforts to target,
    investigate, arrest, and prosecute human smuggling organizations
    that are preying on vulnerable migrants. 

<!-- -->

-   Partner countries reaffirmed their commitment to stem
    extracontinental irregular migration through increased use of
    transit visas, passenger vetting, and enforcement measures against
    entities and individuals that profit from irregular migration.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Expanding Lawful Pathways for
Migration and Protection</span>

-   President Biden rebuilt our refugee resettlement program and led a
    historic expansion of lawful pathways to the United States and
    partner countries.  Under the President’s Safe Mobility Offices
    initiative to deter irregular migration and expand lawful pathways
    in the Western Hemisphere, we are on track to increase six-fold the
    number of approved refugees from the region.  Already, over 21,000
    individuals have been approved to resettle safely and legally in the
    United States through the Safe Mobility Offices in Guatemala, Costa
    Rica, Colombia, and Ecuador.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala and the United States announced that the Safe Mobility
    Offices in Guatemala will expand eligibility to include Hondurans,
    Salvadorans, and Nicaraguans present in Guatemala. 

<!-- -->

-   Costa Rica and the United States announced that the Safe Mobility
    Offices in Costa Rica will expand eligibility to accept
    Ecuadorians. 

<!-- -->

-   The United States reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening lawful
    pathways. Under the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) parole
    process, flows of irregular migrants from these four countries have
    been reduced significantly, while 435,000 vetted and cleared
    individuals of these nationalities have been approved to lawfully
    enter the United States. Applicants must have a U.S.-based financial
    supporter, pass vetting and background checks, and meet other
    established criteria to receive advanced travel authorization. Once
    paroled on a case-by-case basis, CHNV nationals are eligible to
    apply for work authorization and start work immediately.

<!-- -->

-   USAID announced plans to launch a new regional labor mobility
    initiative — “Alianza de Movilidad Laboral para las Américas” or
    “Labor Neighbors” — to increase access to lawful temporary labor
    pathways for new migrant-source and destination countries. The
    initiative will work with international organizations and other
    partners to provide technical assistance to countries across the
    region to identify eligible workers to meet pressing labor needs.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Labor launched a $3 million project to strengthen
    protections for workers participating in U.S. temporary foreign
    worker programs. The United States also announced it is joining the
    International Labor Organization’s Fair Recruitment Initiative and
    its Advisory Committee. The initiative seeks to ensure that domestic
    and cross-border recruitment practices are grounded in international
    labor standards, promote gender equality, and prevent human
    trafficking and forced labor. These steps reinforce the Biden
    Administration’s Presidential Memorandum on Advancing Worker
    Empowerment, Rights, and High Labor Standards Globally and its
    steadfast commitment to protecting worker rights at home and around
    the world.

<!-- -->

-   Mexico announced that, since 2022, it has issued over 17,500
    temporary visas to individuals seeking international protection to
    address labor shortages in the country. Additionally, Mexico has
    launched a pilot program in collaboration with the Haitian Embassy,
    International Organization for Migration, and the Tent Partnership
    to expand labor pathways, offering job opportunities and work
    permits to Haitian migrants.

<!-- -->

-   Costa Rica committed to continue modernizing its asylum system
    through digitalization, data-driven solutions, and adopting
    practices to streamline refugee status determination with support
    from UNCHR and the international community.   

<!-- -->

-   Canada confirmed it will take UNHCR referrals from the Safe Mobility
    Offices, as part of Canada’s ongoing commitment to this important
    initiative. Canada has also made significant progress on its
    commitment to welcome 15,000 migrants from the Americas region.
    Canada is also investing $75 million Canadian dollars over six years
    to fund capacity building projects to strengthen migration and
    protection systems in the region.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Addressing Root Causes and
Supporting the Integration of Migrants to Foster Long-term
Stabilization</span>

-   The United States reaffirmed its commitment to addressing the root
    causes of irregular migration. The U.S. International Development
    Finance Corporation is announcing the approval of a $20 million
    direct loan to Cosami, a savings and loan cooperative, for
    low-income mortgages in rural Guatemala. Cosami’s assistance will
    help finance the construction of borrowers’ first homes, helping to
    improve living conditions, create jobs, and promote economic growth
    in lower-income communities.

<!-- -->

-   With initial support from the U.S. Government, the International
    Organization for Migration launched a new online platform and data
    portal for the Los Angeles Declaration, which enables endorsing
    countries to obtain, share, and disseminate best practices and data.

<!-- -->

-   Ecuador announced that, under a new regularization program, those
    who have already registered will be able to complete their process
    to obtain a temporary resident visa and more migrants will be able
    to apply for a temporary visa.

<!-- -->

-   Colombia announced a plan for regularization of irregular migrants
    through special permits for parents and legal guardians of children
    with valid Temporary Protective Status. Colombia also announced a
    new special permanent visa for Latin American and Caribbean migrants
    without regular status in the country. The Colombian government
    estimates these actions will benefit up to 600,000 individuals.

<!-- -->

-   Costa Rica committed to expand the Special Temporary Category
    regularization pathway and reduce barriers to access with continued
    assistance from the international community.
