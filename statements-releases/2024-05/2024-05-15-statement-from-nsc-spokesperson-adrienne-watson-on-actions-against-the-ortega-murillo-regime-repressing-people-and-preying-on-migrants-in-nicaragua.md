title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Actions Against the Ortega-Murillo\
  \ Regime Repressing People and Preying on Migrants in\_Nicaragua"
---
 
Today, the United States is taking coordinated action in response to the
Ortega-Murillo regime’s continued repression of the people of Nicaragua
and ongoing exploitation of vulnerable migrants, including via the
facilitation – and profiting off of – irregular migration to the United
States.  These actions are taken as part of the President’s efforts to
crack down on irregular migration and in support of his affirmative
agenda for the Western Hemisphere for a more democratic, secure, and
prosperous region.

The United States is taking the following specific actions:

1.  The Departments of the Treasury, State, and Homeland Security
    jointly issued a [policy
    alert](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/05/15/disrupting-irregular-migration-best-practices-response-recent-developments-aviation)
    to travel companies with information about the ways smuggling
    networks and transnational criminal organizations prey on vulnerable
    migrants, ongoing U.S. actions to hold these malicious practices
    actors accountable, and key steps that the travel industry can take
    to avoid complicity in the exploitation of migrants.

1.  The [Department of the
    Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2339)
    sanctioned a Russian Military Training Center that supports
    repressive actions by the Nicaraguan National Police to persecute
    political opposition and two gold companies that enrich the
    Ortega-Murillo regime. 

<!-- -->

1.  Additionally, the [Department of
    State](https://www.state.gov/promoting-accountability-for-nicaraguan-officials/)
    imposed visa restrictions on over 250 members of the Nicaraguan
    government, non-government actors, and their immediate family
    members for their roles in supporting the Ortega-Murillo regime’s
    attacks on human rights and fundamental freedoms and repression of
    civil society organizations.

The Administration urges the Nicaraguan regime to cease its systemic
violations of human rights and to stop its cynical practice of selling
short-term visas upon arrival in Managua that support the exploitation
of vulnerable migrants, to the financial benefit of the regime.
