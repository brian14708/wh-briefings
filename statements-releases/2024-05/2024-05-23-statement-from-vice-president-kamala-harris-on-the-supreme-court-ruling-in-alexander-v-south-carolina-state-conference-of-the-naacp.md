  \ Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the\_NAACP"

The sacred right to vote is the fundamental freedom that unlocks all
others. Today’s Supreme Court decision deprives Americans of that sacred
freedom and further harms our democracy.  
   
Let us be clear: Voters should choose their elected officials – not the
other way around. Extremist elected officials’ attempt to dilute the
rights of voters based on race is wrong.  
   
South Carolinians and people across America deserve to have their voices
heard and their votes counted. President Biden and I will continue
fighting to protect Americans from discrimination at the ballot box, and
we once again urge Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
