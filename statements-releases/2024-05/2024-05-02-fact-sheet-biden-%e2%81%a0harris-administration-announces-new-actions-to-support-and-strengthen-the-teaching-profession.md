title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Support\
  \ and Strengthen the Teaching\_Profession"
---
 
Today, ahead of Teacher Appreciation Week, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing new efforts to strengthen the teaching
profession and support schools across the country, including actions to
increase teacher recruitment and retention, [new
data](https://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/202404-plsf-forgiveness-by-cd.pdf)
on how fixes to Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) are benefitting
teachers in every state and Congressional district, and new funding to
increase pipelines for special education teachers.  
   
Our nation’s teachers prepare and inspire the next generation of leaders
who are critical to our future. President Biden has been clear since day
one that to address these long-standing staffing challenges facing our
schools, exacerbated by the pandemic, teachers, paraprofessionals, and
other school staff need to be paid competitively and treated with the
respect and dignity that they deserve, including through improved
working conditions for staff and learning conditions for students.  
   
Later today, First Lady Jill Biden, a life-long educator, will host the
first-ever Teachers of the Year State Dinner at the White House
to honor the 2024 [National Teacher of the
Year](https://ntoy.ccsso.org/), Missy Testerman, and state teachers of
the year from across the United States for their excellence in
education.    
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has strengthened the teaching profession
by:

-   **Encouraging states to increase teacher pay,** with 30 states and
    the District of Columbia taking action to raise teacher pay. To
    support COVID-19 recovery, the Administration secured $130 billion
    for the largest-ever investment in public education in history
    through the American Rescue Plan provided to more than 15,000 school
    districts and secured nearly $2 billion in additional Title I
    funding to date; both funding streams can be used to support teacher
    salaries in our most underserved schools. These funds can also be
    used to support high-quality teacher pipeline programs and hire more
    professionals across the education workforce.  
-   **Fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program,** which has
    helped nearly 876,000 borrowers engaged in public service – such as
    teachers – have their federal student loans forgiven. Prior to the
    Biden-Harris Administration, only 7,000 borrowers had received
    relief under this program.  
-   **Returning schools to pre-pandemic staffing levels.** While teacher
    shortages remain, staffing at schools has recovered above
    pre-pandemic levels, including 40 percent more social workers and 25
    percent more nurses, providing critical supports to students that
    also helps support teaching and learning.  
-   **Expanding Registered Teacher Apprenticeship programs to** **34
    states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico,** providing an
    affordable and high-quality path to become a teacher in communities
    across the country. 
-   **Securing a total of nearly $2.7 billion of investment in
    teachers** in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 budget to help states and
    communities address teacher shortages, including in areas such as
    special education, Career and Technical Education, and bilingual
    education, and in underserved communities, through increased teacher
    recruitment, support, and retention.

 Additional details on these actions are described further below.  
  
**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to
support teachers:**

-   **Establishing a new technical assistance center to help states and
    communities increase teacher recruitment and retention.** This week,
    the Department of Education will release a Notice of Final
    Priorities and a Notice Inviting Applications and for the
    Comprehensive Centers grant program, which will support a Center on
    Strengthening and Supporting the Educator Workforce. This new Center
    will provide universal and targeted intensive capacity-building
    services designed to support States as they in turn support their
    districts, schools and partners in designing and scaling practices
    that establish and enhance high-quality, comprehensive,
    evidence-based, and affordable educator pathways (including educator
    residency and Grow Your Own programs, and emerging pathways into the
    profession such as registered apprenticeship programs for teachers),
    and in improving educator diversity, recruitment, and retention.   
-   **Providing data from each Congressional district showing the
    effects of the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to fix the PSLF
    program.** The [data released
    today](https://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/202404-plsf-forgiveness-by-cd.pdf)
    shows the distribution across the country of $62.8 billion in
    approved debt relief across 876,000 borrowers in every state and
    Congressional district. These are individuals who worked for at
    least 10 years in public service while repaying their loans.  
-   **Increasing funding to support a strong pipeline of special
    education teachers.** To date, the Administration has secured a $25
    million increase in funding for the Personnel Preparation grant
    program under Part D of the Individuals with Disabilities Education
    Act compared to the beginning of the Administration, a 28 percent
    increase dedicated to growing our nation’s supply of special
    educators – a persistent shortage area. Funding under this grant can
    be used to support the preparation and development of special
    educators, including increasing the supply of special education
    faculty available to establish or scale up preparation programs for
    special educators at institutions of higher education. In the coming
    week, the Department will make about $10 million in new awards to
    grantees implementing programs under Part D of IDEA to help shore up
    the supply of special educators nationwide.

**These announcements build on actions the Biden-Harris Administration
have taken since day one to support our nation’s teachers. To date, the
Administration has:**

-   **Supported a strong educator workforce jobs recovery and helped
    rehire through the American Rescue Plan.** As a result of the
    President’s decisive action to provide our schools with historic
    funds through the American Rescue Plan, we now have more people
    working in public schools than before the pandemic. Our schools lost
    hundreds of thousands of local public education jobs in just three
    months during the pandemic. Since President Biden took office,
    schools have added 638,000 education jobs. As of March 2024, there
    were 23,000 more employees in local public education than in
    February 2020. But there is still work to do. Teacher shortages
    remain and vary significantly across communities, disproportionately
    impacting students of color, students with disabilities, English
    learners, and students from low-income backgrounds.

-   **Increased** **investments by $112 million in preparing,
    recruiting, developing, and retaining teachers since the beginning
    of this Administration.** As a result of the additional funds the
    Administration has secured in these programs since the beginning of
    the Administration and through FY23, an additional $112 million has
    been invested in supporting educators through Department of
    Education’s competitive grant programs, in addition to the tens of
    billions invested in staffing through the American Rescue Plan. For
    example, the Administration has increased annual funding for the
    Teacher Quality Partnership Grant program by 34 percent, which
    supports year-long teacher residency programs that have been shown
    to increase teacher effectiveness, retention, and diversity.  
-   **Funded educator diversity efforts nationwide.** The Administration
    has prioritized efforts to increase educator diversity across 15
    competitive grant programs that support teacher preparation,
    development, recruitment, and retention. These programs awarded
    nearly $450 million to 263 grantees, 92 percent of which were to
    grantees that addressed specific priorities related to educator
    diversity. For example, this year the Department plans to award $15
    million to fund up to 27 new awards to Historically Black Colleges
    and Universities (HBCUs), Tribally Controlled Colleges and
    Universities (TCCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs)
    through the Augustus F. Hawkins program, which works to increase the
    numbers of diverse personnel in early intervention, special
    education, and related services.  
-   **Expanded high-quality teacher preparation programs through
    Registered Teacher Apprenticeships.** At the beginning of this
    Administration, there were no Registered Apprenticeship Programs for
    teachers. Today, there are registered programs in 34 states, the
    District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. These programs can serve to
    provide affordable and high-quality pathways into the profession,
    allowing apprentices to earn a salary and benefits while they
    prepare to become a teacher, including by scaling up evidence-based
    Grow Your Own and Teacher Residency programs, which help to increase
    teacher retention, effectiveness, and diversity.  
-   **Relieved teacher student loan debt through forgiveness, repayment,
    and grant programs.** The Administration has approved almost $160
    billion in student debt forgiveness for nearly 4.6 million borrowers
    through various actions, including $62.8 billion in forgiveness for
    almost 876,000 borrowers through fixes to PSLF. The Administration
    has also secured the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and
    launched the new [SAVE
    plan](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan) – the
    most affordable student loan repayment plan ever. The Administration
    estimates that a first-year teacher with a bachelor’s degree would
    save $17,000 in payments on the SAVE plan while seeking PSLF. This
    Administration also implemented changes to the TEACH Grant program
    to support teacher recruitment and retention in our most underserved
    communities. The TEACH Grant provides up to $16,000 to undergraduate
    and graduate students who commit to teaching in a high-need field
    and school serving students from low-income backgrounds for four
    years.  
-   **Secured first-ever funding for the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of
    Excellence Grants.** The Department held the first-ever competition
    for the Augustus F. Hawkins Grant program, awarding $23 million to
    date to teacher preparation programs at HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs to
    increase the number of well-prepared teacher candidates, including
    teacher candidates of color and bilingual and multilingual
    educators, in the field. The Department is currently administering
    an additional competition for the Hawkins grant program with $15
    million in funding available, with applications due in June 2024.  
-   **Launched a campaign to elevate the teaching profession and call
    for increasing teacher pay.** The Department launched “Teachers:
    Leaders Shaping Lives” – a campaign to elevate the teaching
    profession and promote educator diversity. The new [Public Service
    Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=&v=n0sMm1iut44)
    was developed in partnership with TEACH.org and the One Million
    Teachers of Color Campaign at the Hunt Institute. This
    Administration believes that educators should be treated with
    dignity and respect and receive the pay they deserve – and has
    encouraged all states to increase compensation so that teachers are
    paid a livable and competitive wage. Since the 2021-22 school year,
    30 states and the District of Columbia have taken action at the
    state level to increase teacher pay.  
-   **Provided extensive Technical Assistance and Guidance on how to use
    federal and other resources to implement evidence-based strategies
    to support teacher preparation, recruitment, retention, development,
    and advancement.** This includes; (1) establishing
    the [Strengthening and Diversifying the Educator Workforce
    Workgroup](https://compcenternetwork.org/ccnetwork-highlights/topic/7123/educator-workforce) which
    brings together States from across the country to share resources
    and discuss lessons learned and best practices for supporting
    teacher development, recruitment, retention and diversity; (2)
    updating
    [guidance](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/cte/perkins-educator-prep.pdf)
    on the use of Perkins V funds to improve the recruitment,
    preparation, retention, and growth of future educators, including
    Career and Technical Education teachers; (3) issuing a collection
    of [seven
    briefs](https://region9cc.org/recruit_retain_teachers_briefs) outlining
    the most common challenges related to recruiting and retaining
    teachers from underrepresented backgrounds or with certain
    certifications; (4) sharing best practices, key resources, and
    making data on job recovery, educator preparation, educator
    diversity, and compensation, and other related issues easier to
    access and use through the Department’s [Raise the Bar: Eliminating
    Educator Shortages
    website](https://www.ed.gov/raisethebar/educators); and (5) issuing
    [guidance](https://www2.ed.gov/documents/coronavirus/reopening-2.pdf)
    on how American Rescue Plan funds can be used to stabilize the
    teacher workforce and support teacher well-being.
