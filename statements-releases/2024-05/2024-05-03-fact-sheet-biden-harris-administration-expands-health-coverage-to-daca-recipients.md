*President Biden Announces Final Rule that will Allow Eligible DACA
Recipients to Enroll in Affordable Care Act Coverage*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is expanding access to
affordable, quality health care coverage to Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.  In 2012, President Obama and then
Vice President Biden created the DACA policy to transform the lives of
eligible Dreamers – young people who came to this country as
children—allowing them to live and work lawfully in our country.  Over
the last decade, DACA has brought stability, possibility, and progress
to hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.   
   
While President Biden continues to call on Congress to provide a pathway
to citizenship to Dreamers and others, he is committed to protecting and
preserving DACA and providing Dreamers with the opportunities and
support they need to succeed, including access to affordable, quality
health care coverage.  Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration’s
actions, today’s final rule will remove the prohibition on DACA
recipients’ eligibility for Affordable Care Act coverage for the first
time, and is projected to help more than 100,000 young people gain
health insurance.  Starting in November, DACA recipients can apply for
coverage through HealthCare.gov and state-based marketplaces, where they
may qualify for financial assistance to help them purchase quality
health insurance. Four out of five consumers have found a plan for less
than $10 a month, with millions saving an average of about $800 a year
on their premiums.  
   
President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that health care
should be a right, not a privilege. Together, they promised to protect
and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, lowering costs and expanding
coverage so that every American has the peace of mind that health
insurance brings.  Today’s final rule delivers on the President’s
commitment by giving DACA recipients that same peace and opportunity.
   
   
Today’s rule also reinforces the President’s enduring commitment to DACA
recipients and Dreamers, who contribute daily to the strength and
vitality of our communities and our country.  On day one of his
Administration, President Biden committed to preserving and fortifying
the DACA policy.  While only Congress can provide Dreamers permanent
status and a pathway to citizenship, the Biden-Harris Administration has
continued to vigorously defend DACA against ongoing legal challenges and
strengthened DACA by codifying the 2012 policy in a final rule.
