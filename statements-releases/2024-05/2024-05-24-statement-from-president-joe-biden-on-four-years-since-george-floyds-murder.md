  s\_Murder"

The day before George Floyd’s funeral, his young daughter Gianna told
me, “Daddy changed the world.” Four years after her father’s murder,
there is no doubt that he has.

George Floyd should be alive today. His murder shook the conscience of
our nation and reminded us that our country has never fully lived up to
its highest ideal of fair and impartial justice for all under the law.
What we witnessed as a result was one of the largest modern civil rights
movements in our Nation’s history, with people from every background
marching together against racism and systemic injustice.

Two years ago, alongside George Floyd’s family, civil rights leaders,
and law enforcement officials, I signed an executive order to implement
key aspects of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act with respect to
federal law enforcement, including: restricting chokeholds and no-knock
warrants, and establishing a database for police misconduct—all measures
to advance effective, transparent and accountable policing.

My Administration has made significant progress in implementing this
Executive Order, and will continue our work to build public trust and
strengthen public safety. But real and lasting change at the state and
local level will only come when Congress acts. That’s why I will
continue to urge Congress to send the George Floyd Justice in Policing
Act, which ensures law enforcement accountability, to my desk.

As we mark this solemn day tomorrow, we join George Floyd’s family in
remembering his life and his legacy. We are vigilant of Black and brown
communities who all too often have borne the brunt of injustice; and we
recommit ourselves to honoring George Floyd’s legacy by ensuring our
Nation lives up to its founding ideal that we are all created equal and
deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.
