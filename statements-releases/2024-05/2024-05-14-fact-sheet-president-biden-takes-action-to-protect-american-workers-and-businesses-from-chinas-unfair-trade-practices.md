title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Takes Action to Protect American Workers and\
  \ Businesses from China\u2019s Unfair Trade\_Practices"
---
 
President Biden’s economic plan is supporting investments and creating
good jobs in key sectors that are vital for America’s economic future
and national security. China’s unfair trade practices concerning
technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation are
threatening American businesses and workers. China is also flooding
global markets with artificially low-priced exports. In response to
China’s unfair trade practices and to counteract the resulting harms,
today, President Biden is directing his Trade Representative to increase
tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on $18 billion of
imports from China to protect American workers and businesses.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda has
already catalyzed more than $860 billion in business investments through
smart, public incentives in industries of the future like electric
vehicles (EVs), clean energy, and semiconductors. With support from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation
Reduction Act, these investments are creating new American jobs in
manufacturing and clean energy and helping communities that have been
left behind make a comeback.  
   
As President Biden says, American workers and businesses can outcompete
anyone—as long as they have fair competition. But for too long, China’s
government has used unfair, non-market practices. China’s forced
technology transfers and intellectual property theft have contributed to
its control of 70, 80, and even 90 percent of global production for the
critical inputs necessary for our technologies, infrastructure, energy,
and health care—creating unacceptable risks to America’s supply chains
and economic security. Furthermore, these same non-market policies and
practices contribute to China’s growing overcapacity and export surges
that threaten to significantly harm American workers, businesses, and
communities.  
   
Today’s actions to counter China’s unfair trade practices are carefully
targeted at strategic sectors—the same sectors where the United States
is making historic investments under President Biden to create and
sustain good-paying jobs—unlike recent proposals by Congressional
Republicans that would threaten jobs and raise costs across the board.
The previous administration’s trade deal with
China [failed](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/china-bought-none-extra-200-billion-us-exports-trumps-trade-deal) to
increase American exports or boost American manufacturing as it had
promised. Under President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, nearly
800,000 manufacturing jobs have been created and new factory
construction has doubled after both fell under the previous
administration, and the trade deficit with China is the lowest in a
decade—lower than any year under the last administration.  
   
We will continue to work with our partners around the world to
strengthen cooperation to address shared concerns about China’s unfair
practices—rather than undermining our alliances or applying
indiscriminate 10 percent tariffs that raise prices on all imports from
all countries, regardless whether they are engaged in unfair trade. The
Biden-Harris Administration recognizes the benefits for our workers and
businesses from strong alliances and a rules-based international trade
system based on fair competition.  
   
**Following an in-depth review by the United States Trade
Representative, President Biden is taking action to protect American
workers and American companies from China’s unfair trade practices. To
encourage China to eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding
technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation, the
President is directing increases in tariffs across strategic sectors
such as steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles,
batteries, critical minerals, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes, and
medical products.**  
   
**<u>Steel and Aluminum</u>**  
   
The tariff rate on certain steel and aluminum products under Section 301
will increase from 0–7.5% to 25% in 2024.  
   
Steel is a vital sector for the American economy, and American companies
are leading the future of clean steel. Recently, the Biden-Harris
Administration announced $6 billion for 33 clean manufacturing projects
including for steel and aluminum, including the first new primary
aluminum smelter in four decades, made possible by the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. These investments
will make the United States one of the first nations in the world to
convert clean hydrogen into clean steel, bolstering the U.S. steel
industry’s competitiveness as the world’s cleanest major steel
producer.  
   
American workers continue to face unfair competition from China’s
non-market overcapacity in steel and aluminum, which are among the
world’s most carbon intensive. China’s policies and subsidies for their
domestic steel and aluminum industries mean high-quality, low-emissions
U.S. products are undercut by artificially low-priced Chinese
alternatives produced with higher emissions. Today’s actions will shield
the U.S. steel and aluminum industries from China’s unfair trade
practices.  
   
**<u>Semiconductors</u>**  
   
The tariff rate on semiconductors will increase from 25% to 50% by
2025.  
   
China’s policies in the legacy semiconductor sector have led to growing
market share and rapid capacity expansion that risks driving out
investment by market-driven firms. Over the next three to five years,
China is expected to account for almost half of all new capacity coming
online to manufacture certain legacy semiconductor wafers. During the
pandemic, disruptions to the supply chain, including legacy chips, led
to price spikes in a wide variety of products, including automobiles,
consumer appliances, and medical devices, underscoring the risks of
overreliance on a few markets.  
   
Through the CHIPS and Science Act, President Biden is making a nearly
$53 billion investment in American semiconductor manufacturing capacity,
research, innovation, and workforce. This will help counteract decades
of disinvestment and offshoring that has reduced the United States’
capacity to manufacture semiconductors domestically. The CHIPS and
Science Act includes $39 billion in direct incentives to build,
modernize, and expand semiconductor manufacturing fabrication facilities
as well as a 25% investment tax credit for semiconductor companies.
Raising the tariff rate on semiconductors is an important initial step
to promote the sustainability of these investments.  
   
**<u>Electric Vehicles (EVs)</u>**  
   
The tariff rate on electric vehicles under Section 301 will increase
from 25% to 100% in 2024.  
   
With extensive subsidies and non-market practices leading to substantial
risks of overcapacity, China’s exports of EVs grew by 70% from 2022 to
2023—jeopardizing productive investments elsewhere. A 100% tariff rate
on EVs will protect American manufacturers from China’s unfair trade
practices.  
   
This action advances President Biden’s vision of ensuring the future of
the auto industry will be made in America by American workers. As part
of the President’s Investing in America agenda, the Administration is
incentivizing the development of a robust EV market through business tax
credits for manufacturing of batteries and production of critical
minerals, consumer tax credits for EV adoption, smart standards, federal
investments in EV charging infrastructure, and grants to supply EV and
battery manufacturing. The increase in the tariff rate on electric
vehicles will protect these investments and jobs from unfairly priced
Chinese imports.  
   
**<u>Batteries, Battery Components and Parts, and Critical
Minerals</u>**  
   
The tariff rate on lithium-ion EV batteries will increase from 7.5%% to
25% in 2024, while the tariff rate on lithium-ion non-EV batteries will
increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026. The tariff rate on battery parts will
increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2024.  
   
The tariff rate on natural graphite and permanent magnets will increase
from zero to 25% in 2026. The tariff rate for certain other critical
minerals will increase from zero to 25% in 2024.  
   
Despite rapid and recent progress in U.S. onshoring, China currently
controls over 80 percent of certain segments of the EV battery supply
chain, particularly upstream nodes such as critical minerals mining,
processing, and refining. Concentration of critical minerals mining and
refining capacity in China leaves our supply chains vulnerable and our
national security and clean energy goals at risk. In order to improve
U.S. and global resiliency in these supply chains, President Biden has
invested across the U.S. battery supply chain to build a sufficient
domestic industrial base. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the
Defense Production Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the
Biden-Harris Administration has invested nearly $20 billion in grants
and loans to expand domestic production capacity of advanced batteries
and battery materials. The Inflation Reduction Act also contains
manufacturing tax credits to incentivize investment in battery and
battery material production in the United States. The President has also
established the American Battery Materials Initiative, which will
mobilize an all-of-government approach to secure a dependable, robust
supply chain for batteries and their inputs.  
   
**<u>Solar Cells</u>**  
   
The tariff rate on solar cells (whether or not assembled into modules)
will increase from 25% to 50% in 2024.  
   
The tariff increase will protect against China’s policy-driven
overcapacity that depresses prices and inhibits the development of solar
capacity outside of China. China has used unfair practices to dominate
upwards of 80 to 90% of certain parts of the global solar supply chain,
and is trying to maintain that status quo. Chinese policies and
nonmarket practices are flooding global markets with artificially cheap
solar modules and panels, undermining investment in solar manufacturing
outside of China.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments in the
U.S. solar supply chain, building on early U.S. government-enabled
research and development that helped create solar cell technologies. The
Inflation Reduction Act provides supply-side tax incentives for solar
components, including polysilicon, wafers, cells, modules, and backsheet
material, as well as tax credits and grant and loan programs supporting
deployment of utility-scale and residential solar energy projects. As a
result of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, solar
manufacturers have already announced nearly $17 billion in planned
investment under his Administration—an 8-fold increase in U.S.
manufacturing capacity, enough to supply panels for millions of homes
each year by 2030.  
   
**<u>Ship-to-Shore Cranes</u>**  
   
The tariff rate on ship-to-shore cranes will increase from 0% to 25% in
2024.  
   
The Administration continues to deliver for the American people by
rebuilding the United States’ industrial capacity to produce port cranes
with trusted partners. A 25% tariff rate on ship-to-shore cranes will
help protect U.S. manufacturers from China’s unfair trade practices that
have led to excessive concentration in the market. Port cranes are
essential pieces of infrastructure that enable the continuous movement
and flow of critical goods to, from, and within the United States, and
the Administration is taking action to mitigate risks that could disrupt
American supply chains. This action also builds off of ongoing work to
invest in U.S. port infrastructure through the President’s Investing in
America Agenda. This port security initiative includes bringing port
crane manufacturing capabilities back to the United States to support
U.S. supply chain security and encourages ports across the country and
around the world to use trusted vendors when sourcing cranes or other
heavy equipment.  
   
**<u>Medical Products</u>**  
   
The tariff rates on syringes and needles will increase from 0% to 50% in
2024. For certain personal protective equipment (PPE), including certain
respirators and face masks, the tariff rates will increase from 0–7.5%
to 25% in 2024. Tariffs on rubber medical and surgical gloves will
increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026.  
   
These tariff rate increases will help support and sustain a strong
domestic industrial base for medical supplies that were essential to the
COVID-19 pandemic response, and continue to be used daily in every
hospital across the country to deliver essential care. The federal
government and the private sector have made substantial investments to
build domestic manufacturing for these and other medical products to
ensure American health care workers and patients have access to critical
medical products when they need them. American businesses are now
struggling to compete with underpriced Chinese-made supplies dumped on
the market, sometimes of such poor quality that they may raise safety
concerns for health care workers and patients.  
   
Today’s announcement reflects President Biden’s commitment to always
have the back of American workers. When faced with anticompetitive,
unfair practices from abroad, the President will deploy any and all
tools necessary to protect American workers and industry.
