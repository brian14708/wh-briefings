title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Supreme Court Ruling in Alexander\
  \ v. South Carolina State Conference of\_NAACP"

The right to vote is the foundation of American democracy.  Key to that
right is ensuring that voters pick their elected officials — not the
other way around. The Supreme Court’s decision today undermines the
basic principle that voting practices should not discriminate on account
of race and that is wrong.   
   
This decision threatens South Carolinians’ ability to have their voices
heard at the ballot box, and the districting plan the Court upheld is
part of a dangerous pattern of racial gerrymandering efforts from
Republican elected officials to dilute the will of Black voters. Vice
President Harris and I are ironclad in our commitment to protecting the
sacred right to vote, and we will not stop fighting until Congress
passes both the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and
strengthen the Voting Rights Act, and the Freedom to Vote Act to ensure
fair Congressional maps for all Americans.
