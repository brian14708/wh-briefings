title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Senate Vote on the Bipartisan Border\
  \ Security\_Agreement"

Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or
fixing America’s broken immigration system. If they did, they would have
voted for the toughest border enforcement in history. Instead, today,
they put partisan politics ahead of our country’s national security.  
    
By blocking the bipartisan border agreement, Republicans in Congress
said no to legislation that would hire more Border Patrol Agents, add
more immigration judges and asylum officers to process cases in months
and not years. They said no to new technology to detect and stop
fentanyl from entering the United States, and no to resources to go
after drug traffickers. They rejected an agreement that would give me,
as President, a new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the
border when the system is overwhelmed.  
   
This agreement would have also expanded access to lawful immigration
pathways proven to reduce irregular migration, expedited access to work
authorization for those who are eligible, and ensured that unaccompanied
children who arrive at the border have access to legal counsel. While it
did not include everything I wanted, such as finally delivering a
pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, it would have been the largest
reform of our immigration laws in decades.  
   
So I want to be absolutely clear: while Congressional Republicans are
choosing to stand in the way of border enforcement, I will not stop
fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel
need. If you believe, as I do, that we need reform now, doing nothing is
not an option. We must make our border more secure and we must make sure
the United States remains a beacon of hope and opportunity. Today and
every day, I remain committed to taking action to address our broken
immigration system.
