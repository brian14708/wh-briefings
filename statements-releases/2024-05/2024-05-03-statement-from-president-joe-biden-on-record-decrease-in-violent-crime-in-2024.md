title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Record Decrease in Violent Crime in\_\
  2024"
---
 
Americans are safer from violent crime today than a year ago. Today, an
independent organization of police chiefs from the nation’s largest
cities released data showing that, compared to a year earlier, violent
crime declined across every category in the first quarter of 2024 and
murders are down 17%. These decreases build on substantial decreases in
previous years.  
   
After the prior Administration oversaw the largest one-year increase in
murders ever recorded, violent crime is at a near fifty-year low. This
crime reduction is not an accident. It’s the result of extraordinary
efforts from law enforcement and community leaders. It’s also the result
of historic steps by my Administration to stop the flow of illegal guns
and make the largest-ever federal investment in fighting and preventing
crime because of my American Rescue Plan. Despite every Republican in
Congress voting against it, that plan passed, and it has enabled cities
and states to invest over $15 billion in public safety and violence
prevention, putting cops on the beat for accountable community policing
as well as interrupting and preventing crime.  
   
We can’t stop now. My Safer America Plan calls on Congress to invest $37
billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention, including by
funding 100,000 additional police officers for accountable community
policing, investing $5 billion in community violence interventions, and
enacting commonsense gun safety reforms such as a ban on assault weapons
and high-capacity magazines and a universal background check
requirement.  
   
Make no mistake: America is making progress against crime – saving
lives, and restoring security and peace of mind. We need that progress
to continue. Every family deserves to live in a safe community. I won’t
stop until they do.
