Today in Israel, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with
Israeli Leader of the Opposition Yair Lapid, Minister of Defense Yoav
Gallant, Chief of Defense Herzi Halevi, and War Cabinet members Benny
Gantz and Gadi Eizenkot to discuss the situation in Gaza and the United
States’ unwavering support for Israel. 

In his discussions with Minister Gallant and General Halevi, Mr.
Sullivan received updated briefings on Israeli military operations in
Gaza, and reiterated the President’s longstanding position on Rafah.
Minister Gallant and General Halevi briefed Mr. Sullivan on new
alternative approaches to defeating Hamas in Rafah to address the
concerns that have been expressed by the U.S. side through the Strategic
Consultative Group process.  The two sides agreed to continue
discussions. Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed the United States commitment to
securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas. 

Mr. Sullivan also discussed the importance of Israel and Egypt
concluding talks to reopen the Rafah crossing as soon as possible,
and the need for Egypt to ensure the continued flow of humanitarian
assistance through Kerem Shalom. Mr. Sullivan emphasized the imperative
to further surge assistance throughout Gaza, using all available
crossings including Rafah, Erez East, Erez West, and the multinational
humanitarian maritime corridor. Mr. Sullivan underscored the critical
need for effective deconfliction mechanisms to ensure humanitarian
workers can safely deliver aid to those in need throughout Gaza. 

In his meetings with Mr. Gantz, Mr. Eisenkot and separately with Mr.
Lapid, Mr. Sullivan reiterated the US commitment to see Hamas defeated,
all hostages released, and the opportunity available for Israel to
secure its future and people through a more integrated Middle East
region.
