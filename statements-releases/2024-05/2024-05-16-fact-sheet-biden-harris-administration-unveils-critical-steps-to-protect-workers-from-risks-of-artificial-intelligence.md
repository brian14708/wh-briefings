title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Unveils Critical Steps to Protect\
  \ Workers from Risks of Artificial\_Intelligence"
---
 
Since taking office, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the
entire Biden-Harris Administration have moved with urgency to harness
the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to spur innovation and
advance opportunity, while also taking action to ensure workers share in
these gains. As part of these efforts, President Biden’s landmark
[Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and
Use of Artificial
Intelligence](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/)
directed the Department of Labor to establish a set of key principles
that protect workers and ensure they have a seat at the table in
determining how these technologies are developed and used. The
Biden-Harris Administration is today unveiling these principles and
announcing that technology companies Microsoft and Indeed have committed
to adopt these principles as appropriate to their workplace.

**<u>Pursuant to President Biden’s landmark Executive Order, the
following principles apply to the development and deployment of AI
systems in the workplace:</u>**

-   **Centering Worker Empowerment**: Workers and their representatives,
    especially those from underserved communities, should be informed of
    and have genuine input in the design, development, testing,
    training, use, and oversight of AI systems for use in the workplace.
-   **Ethically Developing AI**: AI systems should be designed,
    developed, and trained in a way that protects workers.
-   **Establishing AI Governance and Human Oversight**: Organizations
    should have clear governance systems, procedures, human oversight,
    and evaluation processes for AI systems for use in the workplace.
-   **Ensuring Transparency in AI Use**: Employers should be transparent
    with workers and job seekers about the AI systems that are being
    used in the workplace.
-   **Protecting Labor and Employment Rights**: AI systems should not
    violate or undermine workers’ right to organize, health and safety
    rights, wage and hour rights, and anti-discrimination and
    anti-retaliation protections.
-   **Using AI to Enable Workers:** AI systems should assist,
    complement, and enable workers, and improve job quality.
-   **Supporting Workers Impacted by AI**: Employers should support or
    upskill workers during job transitions related to AI.
-   **Ensuring Responsible Use of Worker Data:** Workers’ data
    collected, used, or created by AI systems should be limited in scope
    and location, used only to support legitimate business aims, and
    protected and handled responsibly.

These principles should be considered during the whole lifecycle of AI –
from design to development, testing, training, deployment and use,
oversight, and auditing. The principles are applicable to all sectors
and intended to be mutually reinforcing, though not all principles will
apply to the same extent in every industry or workplace. The principles
are not intended to be an exhaustive list but instead a guiding
framework for businesses. AI developers and employers should review and
customize the best practices based on their own context and with input
from workers. The Administration welcomes additional commitments from
other technology companies who wish to adopt these principles.
