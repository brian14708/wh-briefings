title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Public and Private Sector Commitments\
  \ to Advancing Digital Inclusion in\_Africa"
---
 
In March and April 2023, Vice President Harris embarked on a historic
trip to Africa, with a focus on investing in African innovation. In
addition to her bilateral meetings in Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia, the
Vice President met with young artists, tech entrepreneurs, students,
women business leaders, and farmers, in an effort to highlight and
advance the extraordinary creativity, ingenuity, and dynamism on the
continent.  
   
As the Vice President said in her
[speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/03/28/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-to-ghanaian-youth-at-black-star-gate/)
in Accra to nearly 8,000 Ghanaian youth, “African ideas and innovations
will shape the future of the world…. And so we must invest in the
African ingenuity and creativity, which will unlock incredible economic
growth and opportunities, not only for the people of the 54 countries
that make up this diverse continent, but for the American people and
people around the world. So the Biden-Harris administration and the
American people stand ready to partner with you, to help accelerate the
innovation and entrepreneurship that is already underway.”  
   
As part of her trip, the Vice President worked with African partners to
galvanize U.S., African, and global private sector investments for the
continent, such as more than [$7
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/31/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-over-7-billion-in-private-sector-and-u-s-government-commitments-to-promote-climate-resilience-adaptation-and-mitigation-across-africa/)
in climate adaptation, resilience, and mitigation commitments and [$1
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/29/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-global-initiatives-on-the-economic-empowerment-of-women-totaling-over-1-billion/)
in commitments to empower African women—advancing women’s economic
security and closing the gender digital divide—including the
announcement of the Women in the Digital Economy Fund (WiDEF).  
   
Building on these efforts, during her trip and over the past year, the
Vice President has worked to promote digital inclusion in Africa. In her
speech in Accra, the Vice President said that the United States is
committed to build collaborations between public and private industries
to increase digital inclusion on the continent of Africa. She said the
United States will “double down” on our effort to mobilize millions of
dollars in public and private capital from the United States, Africa,
and around the world to increase digital inclusion.  
   
She has focused her efforts on digital inclusion because Africa’s
digital ecosystem has great potential to promote economic opportunity,
advance social equality and gender equality, and create jobs. Africa’s
digital transformation has opened new markets for U.S. exports and
services; deepened partnership among African governments, the U.S.
private sector, educational institutions, and the African diaspora; and
increased productivity, competitiveness, and e-government service
delivery. And while Africa has continued growth in its digital
infrastructure over the past decade, and is leading the world in digital
solutions in some areas, there are places on the continent where there
is a lag, and we must close the digital divides – across gender,
urban/rural, income, age, ethnicity, and ability.  
   
To that end, in Lusaka, the Vice President convened business and
philanthropic leaders to promote digital inclusion across the continent.
In this convening, the Vice President issued a [“Call to
Action”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/01/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-in-meeting-with-private-sector-and-philanthropic-leaders-on-digital-inclusion-in-africa/)
to business and philanthropic leaders to make direct investments and
social impact commitments in support of the [Digital Transformation with
Africa](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/14/fact-sheet-new-initiative-on-digital-transformation-with-africa-dta/)
(DTA) initiative. President Biden launched DTA at the U.S.-Africa
Leaders Summit in December 2022, as part of the broader Partnership for
Global Infrastructure and Investment, to expand digital access and
literacy and strengthen digital enabling environments across the
continent. Since DTA’s launch, the United States government has invested
$82 million in new digital infrastructure, programming, and projects in
Africa.   
   
Today, the Vice President is announcing the following public-private
partnerships, coordinated on behalf of the U.S. government and under the
President’s Digital Transformation with Africa initiative by the
Department of Commerce, which are responsive to her Call to Action in
Lusaka, and a series of additional U.S. government and private sector
initiatives to promote digital inclusion on the continent.  
   
**<u>Mobilizing Access to the Digital Economy (MADE) Alliance:
Africa</u>**

-   Digital transformation requires an ecosystem of complementary
    partners to drive connectivity, skilling, employment, financial, and
    other critical services via digital access. To coordinate efforts
    and multiply their impact, the **African Development Bank Group**
    and **Mastercard** are launching today, in response to the Vice
    President’s Call to Action, the Mobilizing Access to the Digital
    Economy (MADE) Alliance: Africa, which aims to provide **digital
    access to critical services for 100 million individuals and
    businesses in Africa over the next 10 years**. MADE Alliance: Africa
    will have an initial focus on supporting the agricultural sector and
    women, including a pilot program launching this year to provide
    digital access for three million farmers in Kenya, Tanzania, and
    Nigeria, and quickly expanding to Uganda, Ethiopia, and Ghana, and
    the rest of the continent thereafter.

<!-- -->

-   Founding Alliance partners each commit to reach at least 10 million
    individuals with other Alliance partners over the first five years
    by focusing on their complementary strengths while working in the
    same communities:
    -   **African Development Bank Group** will invest $300 million to
        supporting Alliance programs, providing funding for digital
        infrastructure and incentivizing ecosystem actors to enhance
        digital access.  
         
    -   **Mastercard** will register 15 million users in Africa onto its
        Community Pass platform, providing the interoperable digital
        infrastructure to facilitate involvement from a range of
        ecosystem participants.  
         
    -   **Equity Bank Group** will provide accessible, affordable, and
        inclusive financial services to farmers and micro-, small-, and
        medium-sized agricultural businesses to support building of the
        digital ecosystem.  
         
    -   **Microsoft** will empower community hubs and digital agents
        with the necessary connectivity, digital tools, and skilling to
        become pivotal digital interaction points for essential
        community services.  
         
    -   **Heifer International** will catalyze last mile digital
        visibility and traceability in agriculture through ecosystem
        strengthening and curated financial and technical support for
        micro, small, and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs.  
         
    -   **Unconnected.org** will contribute its technology and
        management expertise to provide meaningful internet access at
        affordable costs through savings on hardware, software and
        connectivity services.

<!-- -->

-   The MADE Alliance: Africa will develop commercially sustainable
    models that uplift local private sector institutions to drive
    sustainable digital access to critical services. For the first
    program to support 3 million farmers across Kenya, Tanzania, and
    Nigeria, the Alliance is working with local banks to provide digital
    identities and access to high-quality seeds and agricultural inputs.
    Additionally, **Syngenta Foundation** will develop sustainable
    models for first mile delivery to reach 2 million smallholder
    farmers in Kenya and Nigeria via local entrepreneurs.

<!-- -->

-   Mastercard is entering into a Public Private Partnership with the
    International Trade Administration, a bureau within the **U.S.
    Department of Commerce**, to advance digital access and inclusion in
    Africa based on a mutual interest to support the aims of the U.S.
    Government’s Digital Transformation with Africa initiative,
    including through the MADE Alliance: Africa. ITA represents the
    Department in its role as co-chair of the Africa Digital Policy
    Council (ADPC) and co-lead for Pillar I of the DTA initiative, which
    focuses on digital economy and infrastructure. 

**<u>Partnership for Digital Access in Africa (PDAA)</u>**

-   The non-profit **Partnership for Digital Access in Africa (PDAA)**
    was created, in response to the Vice President’s Call to Action, to
    bring together private and public sector leaders from Africa, the
    United States, and other parts of the world to bridge Africa’s
    digital divide. To advance the goals of DTA, PDAA will support
    African institutions to double the number of people connected to,
    and meaningfully using, the internet in Africa, from 40% to 80%,
    connecting one billion people by 2030, and to increase connectivity
    for women and girls from 30% to 80%.   
      
    PDAA intends to support DTA along three core pillars:

1.  **Expand affordable internet and broadband services**: PDAA and
    partners will make the highest performance and lowest cost broadband
    available to as many Africans as possible.  
     
2.  **Lower device cost:** PDAA and partners will work to improve
    accessibility by making internet-enabled devices (smartphones) and
    digital technology more affordable throughout Africa. PDAA and its
    partners will work to ensure an equitable gender ratio of those who
    have access to these devices, further advancing the goal of
    increasing connectivity for women and girls in Africa.  
     
3.  **Enhance digital skills:** PDAA and partners will assist in the
    upskilling of millions of Africans with the necessary capacity to
    effectively and efficiently use digital technology and to maximize
    their chances of meaningful employment.

-   PDAA has aligned goals with initial partners including **World Bank
    Group’s International Finance Corporation, Smart Africa**,
    **America’s Frontier Fund**, the **African Leadership Group**,
    **LifeHikes**, **SpaceX, HMD Global,** and **Nokia**.

<!-- -->

-   PDAA has entered into a Public Private Partnership with the
    International Trade Administration, a bureau within the **U.S.
    Department of Commerce**, to advance digital access and inclusion in
    Africa based on a mutual interest to support the aims of the U.S.
    Government’s DTA initiative.

**<u>Women in the Digital Economy Fund (WiDEF) and Initiative</u>**

-   The digital gender divide hampers women’s economic participation and
    limits their access to critical online services, undermining
    economic growth, sustainable development, and women’s full
    participation in the 21<sup>st</sup> century economy. To help close
    this gap and improve women’s livelihoods, economic security, and
    resilience, Vice President Harris launched the Women in the Digital
    Economy Fund (WiDEF) in 2023, with an initial $50 million investment
    from USAID and $10 million investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates
    Foundation, half of which focused on Africa. Today, the Vice
    President is pleased to announce that the Fund and related Women in
    the Digital Economy Initiative have now generated **over $1 billion
    in public and private commitments** to accelerate gender digital
    equality.  Together with the Women in the Sustainable Economy (WISE)
    Initiative, which Vice President Harris launched during the Asia
    Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders’ week in November 2023,
    total commitments for women’s economic empowerment initiatives
    announced by the Vice President have reached $3 billion. 

<!-- -->

-   Building on the Vice President’s leadership, today’s announcement
    includes an additional $500,000 in direct U.S. contributions to the
    Fund and $46 million in aligned U.S. commitments to the Initiative,
    for a total of $102 million in U.S. direct and aligned commitments
    since the launch of WiDEF pending Congressional Approval. The Vice
    President is also announcing $145 million in new, aligned partner
    commitments to the Women in the Digital Economy Initiative from
    government, multilateral, private sector, philanthropic, and civil
    society partners to accelerate progress towards the historic [G20
    Leaders’
    commitment](https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/CPV/G20-New-Delhi-Leaders-Declaration.pdf)
    to halve the digital gender divide by 2030.

-   The U.S. government is announcing additional direct and aligned
    investments from the U.S. Agency for International Development, the
    Millennium Challenge Corporation, the U.S. Department of State, and
    the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.  New aligned
    investments with a focus on Africa include:
    -   The **U.S. Agency for International Development** (USAID) will

        budgeting tools.  
    -   The **Millennium Challenge Corporation** (MCC) will provide an
        estimated $40 million through 2029 to initiatives that aim to
        support women to acquire digital and financial literacy skills
        in Indonesia, Lesotho, Côte d’Ivoire, and Togo. Country
        initiatives include a digital innovation partnership with the
        **World Bank** in Lesotho to work with local financial
        institutions to pilot digital finance products for women
        entrepreneurs; the Digifemmes MCC partnership with **USAID**,
        **Microsoft**, and the **Government of Cote d’Ivoire** to
        empower women-led SMEs with skills to grow their business
        activities and access opportunities in the digital economy; and
        the Nana Tech program to provide digital and data skills to
        women-owned SMEs in MCC’s Togo Threshold program.  
    -   The **U.S. Department of State** has awarded a $300,000 grant
        through 2025 to the **International Telecommunication Union**
        under the EQUALS Global Partnership for Gender Equality in the
        Digital Age to help reduce the many barriers faced by women and
        girls in harnessing the benefits of digital access and
        transformation, including in Burundi, Libya, and the Dominican
        Republic.

        divide by advancing more trustworthy artificial intelligence.
        Initiatives seek to empower consumers, including women, to
        demand better online privacy and safe online experiences; to
        support activists and thought leaders shaping the future of our
        online lives through funding, mentorship, and
        networking—including with a focus on women’s digital and human
        rights across Africa through the Africa Mradi program and with a
        focus on technology through the Responsible Computing Challenge;
        and to research threats to a healthy internet, highlighting
        bright spots, and providing solutions, such as how artificial
        intelligence can support greater inclusion and gender equity.   
         
    -   **Jersey** is providing $5 million by 2027 to support the
        digital financial inclusion of over 72,000 women and girls,
        especially those in rural areas, in Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda,
        Nepal, and Zambia. Programs seek to facilitate enterprise
        development, improve livelihoods, and build resilience among
        marginalized and previously excluded groups through access to

        farmers—access to affordable credit to buy clean energy tools
        that support farmers’ incomes, such as solar-powered irrigation
        pumps. The program will also provide farmers with
        gender-sensitive financial literacy training. The program will
        create additional economic opportunities by aiming for at least
        70% of the digital field agents working directly with farmers to
        be women.   
         
    -   **Pfizer** has invested $300,000 by 2024 to develop and launch
        the “Living With” app in Africa to help reduce the stigma of a
        cancer diagnosis and increase women’s ability to learn about the
        disease, treatments, and how they can navigate the emotional,
        physical and practical challenges of living with cancer. The app
        has launched in Kenya and will be available soon in Nigeria and

        States with a new inclusive curriculum and wide dissemination of
        online content to develop their voice, agency, and life
        skills—an investment toward their target of accelerating digital
        equity for 150 million people by 2030. In Nigeria, HP and Girl
        Rising are collaborating with 1 Million Teachers to deliver a
        gender-focused online course as part of the Black Belt Program,
        designed to empower teachers—82,500 of which are female—to
        provide students with skills, resources, and mentors through an
        online platform, and to network the teachers through an online
        community platform.   
         
    -   **Unilever PLC** is reaching 2.5 million small and medium
        enterprises by 2026, with a significant focus on women, working
        to raise the living standards of women in their value chain
        through digital technology programs in India, Indonesia,
        Madagascar, Côte d’Ivoire, Pakistan, Ethiopia, the Philippines,
        and Thailand. Programs include a mobile platform through which
        micro-retailers and small and medium enterprises can purchase
