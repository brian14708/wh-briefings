title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Ramps Up Actions to Counter\
  \ Antisemitism on College Campuses and Protect Jewish\_Communities"
---
 
Today, during Holocaust Remembrance Day, the Biden-Harris Administration
announced several new actions to counter the abhorrent rise of
Antisemitism in the United States. President Biden will speak at the
Days of Remembrance commemoration hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum, reaffirming our Nation’s sacred commitment to the Jewish people
following the Holocaust: Never Again.  
  
This year’s remembrance is particularly sobering, as it comes seven
months after the terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel on October
7<sup>th</sup>, the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the
Holocaust. Since that time, there has been an alarming rise of
Antisemitic incidents across the country and throughout the world—most
recently, in instances of violence and hate during some protests at
college campuses across the Nation.  
  
Today’s new actions build on the work of the President’s [National
Strategy to Counter
Antisemitism](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/U.S.-National-Strategy-to-Counter-Antisemitism.pdf),
the first-ever such strategy, which was released one year ago this
month. The strategy represents the most comprehensive and ambitious U.S.
government effort to counter Antisemitism in American history. It
includes over 100 actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken, and
continues to take, to address the rise of Antisemitism in the United
States, as well as over 100 calls to action for Congress, state and
local governments, companies, technology platforms, students, educators,
civil society, faith leaders, and others. It has involved actions by the
Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to provide greater security
to Jewish institutions, as well as actions by the Department of
Education to address antisemitism and by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum to further support education around Jewish history.   
  
The Biden-Harris Administration has taken aggressive action to implement
the strategy and to speak out forcefully against hate of all kinds,
especially in the wake of the October 7<sup>th</sup> attacks. Through
the [National Security
Supplemental](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/13/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-senate-passage-of-the-national-security-supplemental/),
President Biden secured an additional $400 million for the Nonprofit
Security Grant Program, which funds security improvements and training
to nonprofits and houses of worship, including campus organizations and
community centers. This funding has been critical to the security of
Jewish institutions. Last week, for example, the Biden-Harris
Administration sent a guide to the leadership of more than 5,000
colleges and universities with information on resources to promote
campus safety from the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and
Education.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced additional actions to
counter Antisemitism in Year Two of the Strategy, building on its work
over the past year:

-   Today, the Department of Education’s (ED) Office for Civil Rights
    (OCR) issued new guidance through a [Dear Colleague
    Letter](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/colleague-202405-shared-ancestry.pdf)
    to every school district and college in the country, providing
    examples of Antisemitic discrimination, as well as other forms of
    hate, that could lead to investigations for violations of Title VI
    of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI). This guidance is meant
    to ensure that colleges and universities do a better job of
    protecting both Jewish students and all of their students.  
-   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will work with interagency
    partners to build an online campus safety resources guide and
    landing page to provide the range of financial, educational, and
    technical assistance to campuses in one, easy-to-use website.  
-   DHS will develop and share best practices for community-based
    targeted violence and terrorism prevention to reduce these assaults
    and attacks. Federal agencies will elevate ongoing efforts to
    address the fear felt in targeted communities and ensure that
    resources are widely known among communities that need them.  
-   The Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism
    at the Department of State will convene technology firms to identify
    best practices to address Antisemitic content online. Departments
    and agencies will continue to provide technology companies with
    relevant information about symbols and themes associated with
    violent extremism online to help them enforce their terms of
    service.

These new actions build on actions taken to date:  
  
**Title VI Enforcement**  

-   ED-OCR has opened more than 100 investigations over the past seven
    months into complaints alleging discrimination based on shared
    ancestry or ethnic characteristics, including Antisemitism. The
    previous administration opened 27 such investigations in all four
    years.  
-   On Friday, Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent [a
    letter](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/secletter/240503.html)
    to more than 5,000 leaders at institutions of higher education
    across the country to reiterate that federal law protects against
    Antisemitic discrimination that violates Title VI. He also shared a
    [Campus Safety Resource
    Guide](https://sites.ed.gov/cfbnp/federal-campus-safety-resources/)
    to serve as a one-stop-shop of federal resources. ED OCR has issued
    several
    [Dear](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/antisemitism-dcl.pdf?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=)
    [Colleague
    Letters](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-202311-discrimination-harassment-shared-ancestry.pdf?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=)
    to every school district and college in the country and conducted
    training and outreach reminding them of their obligation to provide
    educational environments free from discrimination, as well as the
    tools available to report discriminatory incidents. OCR maintains a
    [website](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/sharedancestry.html)
    with more resources on shared ancestry discrimination.

<!-- -->

-   ED OCR updated its [complaint
    form](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintform.pdf)
    specifying that Title VI’s protection from discrimination, including
    harassment, based on race, color, or national origin includes
    discrimination against students based on shared ancestry or ethnic
    characteristics, including those who are or are perceived to be
    Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Hindu, or Sikh.  
-   Eight Cabinet-level agencies clarified for the first time in writing
    that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits certain
    forms of antisemitic, Islamophobic, and related forms of
    discrimination in federally funded programs and activities. In
    addition, these agencies—the Departments of Agriculture (USDA),
    Health and Human Services (HHS), DHS , Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD), Interior, Labor (DOL), Treasury, and Transportation
    (DOT)—have taken a number of steps to raise awareness of Title VI
    protections and other relevant statutes among Jewish and other
    communities, including by translating Title VI fact sheets into
    languages such as Yiddish and Hebrew and creating new Title VI
    landing pages to serve as a one-stop-shop of resources.

**Campus and School Safety**

-   Since October 7<sup>th</sup>, FBI and DHS have taken steps to expand
    and deepen engagements with campus law enforcement and others to
    improve school safety. DHS has engaged with schools to identify
    security enhancements and raise awareness of SchoolSafety.gov, which
    offers school safety information and resources. DHS also has shared
    information via threat briefings and partner calls with the
    International Association of Campus Law Enforcement
    Administrators. The Federal Emergency Management Agency offers a
    training course called [Crisis Management Affecting Institutions of
    Higher Education: A Collaborative Community
    Approach](https://teex.org/class/mgt361/), through which campus
    members can learn how to effectively manage a crisis using a whole
    community approach, effective crisis communication, and more.  
-   In the wake of October 7<sup>th</sup>, DHS’s Cybersecurity
    Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) tasked its field force to
    proactively engage with schools to understand and address their
    needs. CISA has further expanded security capacity-building services
    to synagogues, community centers, and Jewish day schools. These
    services include risk assessments, planning assistance, and active
    shooter and bomb prevention-related training. CISA has held sessions
    on active shooter preparedness; an introduction to bomb threat
    management; tabletop exercise packages for synagogues; and a
    training on responding to suspicious behaviors and items. Since June
    2023, CISA personnel have conducted over 400 in-person visits with
    Jewish houses of worship and other institutions. Additional security
    trainings, information and resources are found
    [here](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/10/10/resources-and-information-faith-and-community-leaders-regarding-israel-hamas).  
-   USDA has held sessions with university leaders from 80 land-grant
    universities and rural colleges to share promising practices to
    address Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate.  
-   Under the National Strategy, the Department of Justice (DOJ)
    launched a pilot curriculum for middle and high school-age youth
    designed to prevent youth hate crimes and identity-based bullying.
    In year two of the National Strategy, the curriculum will be rolled
    out this August, before the school year begins.

**Community Safety Resources**

-   DHS broadened access to the Nonprofit Security Grant Program by
    holding several webinars, expanding its Protecting Places of Worship
    Week of Action, and leveraging partnerships with DOJ. During the
    Biden-Harris Administration, this program has made 2,960 grants to
    Jewish institutions for a total of $397 million in funding to Jewish
    institutions.  
-   To assist campus public safety and law enforcement identify
    available federal financial assistance opportunities, DHS published
    [guidance](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_gpd-ib-504.pdf)
    clarifying the eligibility of law enforcement agencies at
    institutions of higher education to receive both State Homeland
    Security Program (SHSP) and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI)
    grant funding.  
-   DHS hosts the [Prevention Resource
    Finder](https://www.dhs.gov/prevention) to provide stakeholders the
    full range of federal resources available to help prepare for and
    prevent targeted violence and terrorism across our country.
    Resources on the website include community support resources, grant
    funding opportunities, information-sharing platforms, evidence-based
    research, and training opportunities for campuses and communities to
    reduce the risk of hate-based and targeted violence. Since its
    launch in March 2023, it has been viewed over 58,000 times.  
-   Through the DHS [Center for Prevention Programs and
    Partnerships](https://www.dhs.gov/CP3) (CP3), DHS is strengthening
    the country’s ability to prevent targeted violence and terrorism
    nationwide through funding, training, increased public awareness,
    and partnerships across government, the private sector, and local
    communities.  
-   The [U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment
    Center](https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/ntac) (NTAC)
    conducts training on threat assessments and the prevention of
    targeted violence. These resources examine attacks against colleges
    and universities, among other locations.

**Hate Crimes Prevention and Response**  

-   The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) widely disseminated its
    updated [hate crimes threat response
    guide](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/hate-crime-threat-response-guide-updated-11-8-2023.pdf/view)
    to inform Americans about steps they can take if they receive a
    threat. The guide, published on the FBI’s hate crimes
    resource [page](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights/hate-crimes),
    has been shared with organizations and state and local law
    enforcement entities across the nation. The FBI reviews every tip it
    receives to ascertain the credibility of the information and, if it
    learns of a credible threat, quickly takes action. FBI’s campus
    liaisons enhance information-sharing with campuses.  
-   DOJ has expanded its engagement with Jewish community groups in
    support of the National Strategy. The FBI has held over 650
    engagements with faith-based and community organizations since
    October 7<sup>th</sup>. DOJ and the FBI have used robust and diverse
    outreach to local law enforcement agencies to improve the reporting
    of hate crime data. DOJ’s United Against Hate community outreach and
    engagement initiative has held over 300 engagements involving over
    10,000 participants to educate community members about hate crimes,
    build trust between community and law enforcement, and strengthen
    local networks to combat unlawful acts of hate. DOJ’s [Community
    Relations Service](https://www.justice.gov/crs) provides mediation,
    training and consultation services to assist communities come
    together, develop solutions to conflict and prevent future conflict.
    DOJ has also developed and released
    [two](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-03/combating_religious_discrimination.pdf)
    [documents](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-03/combating_national_origin_discrimination.pdf)
    that explain civil rights law prohibiting national origin
    discrimination and religious discrimination and provide information
    to the public on identifying and reporting national origin and
    religious discrimination in the civil and criminal context.  
-   Throughout the spring, USDA is providing hate crime trainings,
    including Antisemitic hate crimes, for law enforcement agents of the
    U.S. Forest Service. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has
    distributed [new
    resources](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/spirituality/jewish.htm) on
    Jewish American heritage through the National Park Service.

**Addressing Discrimination and Religious Accommodations**  

-   USDA is making kosher food more accessible by working to ensure
    equal access to all USDA feeding programs for customers with
    religious dietary needs.  
-   The Department of Defense (DOD) leveraged existing survey data to
    estimate the prevalence of Antisemitic and Islamophobic behavior in
    the military workplace and to evaluate its policies to counter
    discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and extremist activity.
    This analysis was the first to specifically estimate Antisemitic and
    Islamophobic activity in the military workplace.  
-   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has disseminated
    [materials](https://www.eeoc.gov/anti-arab-anti-middle-eastern-anti-muslim-and-antisemitic-discrimination-are-illegal)
    on nondiscrimination and religious accommodation in the workplace
    and has held more than 50 outreach and training events on
    Antisemitism at its field offices around the country.  
-   The HHS Office for Civil Rights
    [issued](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/01/25/hhs-office-civil-rights-issues-guidance-to-clarifying-obligations-ensure-religious-non-discrimination-patient-visitation.html)
    a Dear Colleague letter and
    [guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/faqs-patient-visitation/index.html)
    to U.S. hospital and long-term care facility administrators,
    reminding organizations of their legal obligations under relevant
    regulations and federal civil rights laws to ensure that facility
    visitation policies do not unlawfully discriminate against patients
    or other individuals receiving care, including on the basis of
    religion. HHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration’s National Child Traumatic Stress Network has
    released a
    [toolkit](https://www.nctsn.org/resources/talking-to-children-about-hate-crimes-and-anti-semitism)
    of behavioral health resources pertaining to the Israel-Hamas war,
    as well as additional
    [resources](https://www.nctsn.org/resources/talking-to-children-about-hate-crimes-and-anti-semitism)
    on how to talk with children and youth about hate crimes and
    identity-based violence, including Antisemitism.  
-   DOL published a “Know Your Rights”
    [resource](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/KnowYourRightsForUnionMembersAntidiscriminationFactSheet.pdf)
    for union members regarding their right to be free from
    discrimination based on religion, national origin, or race in the
    workplace.  
-   On Thursday, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) will convene
    state education officials to discuss best practices in Holocaust
    education, including the incorporation of the history of
    Antisemitism, and opportunities to expand such education.  
-   The USHMM concluded its first tour of the *Americans and the
    Holocaust* traveling exhibitions. Launched in fall 2021, the
    exhibition visited 41 states, reaching more than 330,000 visitors.
    Thirty-four college courses have incorporated content from this
    exhibition. The USHMM and American Library Association will launch a
    second tour of the exhibition in September 2024 at an additional 50
    libraries.  
-   Several federal agencies have incorporated information about
    Antisemitism, workplace religious accommodations, and related topics
    into employee training programs as they carry out their obligations
    under Executive Order 14035 (Executive Order on Diversity, Equity,
    Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce). To support
    this work, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) surveyed federal
    agencies about their existing trainings. OPM, EEOC, and the White
    House Office of Management and Budget have provided learning
    sessions for agency diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility
    officers on Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of
    discrimination, as well as workplace religious accommodations.
