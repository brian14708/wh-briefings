title: "Readout of White\_House Office of Gun Violence Prevention Convening of Local\
  \ Offices of Violence\_Prevention"
---
 
Today, the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention convened over
80 leaders from state and local Offices of Violence Prevention (OVPs),
representing 50 cities from across the country. The convening brought
together key violence prevention leaders to:

-   Share common challenges that their offices face;
-   Identify what collaboration with local, state, and federal offices
    can and should look like;
-   Discuss the importance of raising awareness around gun violence
    prevention work; and
-   Receive information on federal resources available to the OVPs.

Today’s conversations build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s long
record of empowering grassroots leaders, who know their communities, to
intervene against and prevent crime.  
  
Representatives from across the federal government highlighted the
[resources their agencies
offer](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CVI-Funding-Resources.pdf)
to support the work that local OVPs do. Job training and reentry
services grants from the Department of Labor, funding for law
enforcement to support the basic needs of victims in underserved
communities from the Department of Justice, awards from the Department
of Education to increase the number of qualified mental health service
providers in schools, and much more. The White House Office of Gun
Violence Prevention amplified these
[resources](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CVI-Funding-Resources.pdf) to
make them readily accessible for community leaders nationwide.  
  
Today’s convening builds on President Biden’s and Vice President Harris’
historic investments in community violence intervention to prevent gun
violence and save lives, particularly in communities that have been
disproportionately harmed by the direct and indirect consequences of gun
violence. The President’s American Rescue Plan has helped states and
over one thousand cities, towns, and counties across the country to
invest over $15 billion in public safety and violence prevention.
Communities have invested those funds to support additional police
officers, expand community violence intervention, add crisis responders,
establish OVPs, and more.  And today we are seeing real results: Cities
around the country are experiencing historic declines in violent crime,
and homicides are estimated to be down nationally 12% from 2022 to
2023.  
  
The President continues to use every tool at his disposal to keep
Americans safe from violent crime, including the epidemic of gun
violence that is tearing communities apart nationwide.  The Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act – the first significant gun safety law to pass in
nearly 30 years – made $15 billion available for violence prevention. 
The Biden-Harris Administration also established the first ever federal
grant program dedicated to supporting community violence intervention
and agencies across the government have identified multiple funding
sources that can be used for community violence intervention and
community safety.
