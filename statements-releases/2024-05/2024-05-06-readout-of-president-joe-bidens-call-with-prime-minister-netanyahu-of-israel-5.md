President Biden spoke this morning with Prime Minister Netanyahu. The
President reaffirmed his message on Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance
Day.  The two leaders discussed the shared commitment of Israel and the
United States to remember the six million Jews who were systematically
targeted and murdered in the Holocaust, one of the darkest chapters in
human history, and to forcefully act against antisemitism and all forms
of hate-fueled violence. President Biden updated the Prime Minister on
efforts to secure a hostage deal, including through ongoing talks today
in Doha, Qatar. The Prime Minister agreed to ensure the Kerem Shalom
crossing is open for humanitarian assistance for those in need.  The
President reiterated his clear position on Rafah.
