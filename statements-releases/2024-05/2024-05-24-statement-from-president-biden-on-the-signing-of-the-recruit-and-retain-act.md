title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Signing of the Recruit and Retain\_\
  Act"
---
 
Today, I was pleased to sign the Recruit and Retain Act, which will
build on the progress my Administration has made in making communities
safer. Police officers work tirelessly every day to ensure the safety of
our neighborhoods and communities. This bipartisan legislation will help
police departments do their work more safely and effectively by helping
them recruit and retain additional police officers by making better use
of the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program. Three
decades ago, I was proud to be one of the original creators of COPS,
which has helped to put 136,000 more cops in police departments
nationwide to ensure accountable community policing. This important
legislation will add new flexibility to COPS to help police departments
attract officers they need and hire more diverse officers from the
communities they serve.

My Administration has made significant progress in reducing crime, and
as a result violent crime is near a 50-year low. But there’s more we can
and must do. My Safer America Plan support law enforcement and crime
prevention, by hiring 100,000 police officers for accountable community
policing, and investing in community violence interventions.
