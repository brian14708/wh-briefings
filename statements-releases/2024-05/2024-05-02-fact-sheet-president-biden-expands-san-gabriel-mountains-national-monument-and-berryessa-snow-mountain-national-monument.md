*Actions will protect nearly 120,000 acres of culturally, ecologically,
and historically important lands in California while expanding outdoor
access for local communities*

*President Biden on track to conserve more lands and waters than any
President in history*

Since their first day in office, President Biden and Vice President
Harris have delivered on the most ambitious climate and conservation
agenda in history. This includes the President’s [*America the Beautiful
Initiative*](https://www.conservation.gov/pages/america-the-beautiful-initiative),
which is supporting locally led conservation efforts across the country
with a goal to protect, conserve, and restore at least 30 percent of
U.S. lands and waters by 2030. The Biden-Harris Administration has
already conserved more than 41 million acres of lands and waters –
putting President Biden on track to conserve more lands and waters than
any President in history.  
   
Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s unprecedented
commitment to protect America’s natural wonders for future generations,
honor areas of cultural significance to Tribal Nations and Indigenous
peoples, and expand access to nature, President Biden will sign
proclamations expanding the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and
the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument. Together, these actions
will protect nearly 120,000 acres of lands in California of scientific,
cultural, ecological, and historical importance, adding unparalleled
value to these already beloved national monuments and expanding outdoor
access to nearby underserved and disadvantaged communities. The
proclamation for the Berryessa Snow Mountain expansion also renames the
ridgeline at the heart of the expansion, previously known as “Walker
Ridge,” to Molok Loyuk, which means Condor Ridge in the language of the
area’s Patwin people.  
   
These expansions honor Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples by
protecting sacred ancestral places and their historically important
features, while conserving our public lands, protecting scientific
features, including critical wildlife habitat and migration corridors,
safeguarding clean water, and supporting local economies. Federal,
state, and local leaders, Tribal governments, Indigenous communities,
and a coalition of community-based and conservation organizations came
together to advocate for the additional protections for both of these
national monuments. The sites protected through these expansions will
ensure that future generations can experience, learn from, and enjoy
these irreplaceable resources.  
   
Vice President Harris has been a critical leader on efforts to ensure
protections for California public lands, including the lands protected
by these proclamations. In 2018, then-Senator Harris introduced the “San
Gabriel Mountains Foothills and Rivers Protection Act,” the first Senate
proposal to expand the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. In
addition, then-Senator Harris introduced the “Protecting Unique and
Beautiful Landscapes by Investing in California (PUBLIC) Lands Act,” a
legislative package of three bills, including the “San Gabriel Mountains
Protection Act,” that together would have increased protections and
access for over 1 million acres of California lands, including nearly
600,000 acres of new wilderness and over 100,000 acres of new national
monument lands. The proclamation that the President is signing today
will permanently protect the lands in the San Gabriel Mountains covered
by those bills.

in Colorado from further oil and gas leasing which will protect pristine
lands and thousands of sacred sites.  
   
**<u>Expanding San Gabriel Mountains National Monument</u>**  
   
President Biden is taking action to expand the San Gabriel Mountains
National Monument, which President Obama designated in 2014, near Los
Angeles, California. The proclamation will add 105,919 acres of U.S.
Forest Service lands to the south and west of the current monument’s
346,177 acres; protect additional cultural, scientific, and historic
objects; and expand access to outdoor recreation on our shared public
lands for generations to come.  
   
Since time immemorial, the rich landscape within the expansion area has
sustained Indigenous peoples, including the people known as the
Gabrielino, Kizh, or Tongva, and the Chumash, Kitanemuk, Serrano, and
Tataviam peoples. Today, their descendants are part of Tribal Nations
and other Indigenous peoples in the region, some of whose members
continue to use the area for ceremonial purposes, as well as for
collecting traditional plants important for basketry, food, and
medicine.  
   
The lands added to the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument contain
spectacular cultural, geological, and ecological resources. A diversity
of animals, birds, reptiles, and other wildlife, including numerous
sensitive, threatened, and endangered species, live among the unique
geological and ecological features of the area, including its unusual
canyons, chapparal and coastal sage scrub lands, riparian woodlands, and
conifer forests. These lands also provide homes to some of California’s
most imperiled and iconic birds, including the endangered California
condor. The area includes key habitats that support wetland-dependent
plant species, sensitive fish and amphibians, and migration
corridors. The area also holds important geologic significance; the
exceptional landscape of the San Gabriel Mountains, shaped by massive
geologic forces over hundreds of millions of years, provides views deep
into ancient earth.  
   
Though it is adjacent to highly developed areas of Los Angeles, the
expansion area includes highly secluded and largely undeveloped areas,
such as the 4,700-acre Arroyo Seco inventoried Roadless Area—an iconic
landscape feature. The expanded monument’s natural lands and increased
proximity to the city make it a unique place of rejuvenation and
recreation for the people of the ever-changing urban and suburban
communities of the greater Los Angeles region.  
   
President Biden’s proclamation directs the U.S. Forest Service to manage
the area according to the same terms, conditions, and management as the
original national monument designation, which respects grazing permits,
water rights, existing infrastructure, military use of airspace, state
management of wildlife, and wildfire response, among other things. The
proclamation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a
management plan for expansion area, incorporating Indigenous Knowledge
and maximum community input. With this designation, the U.S. Forest
Service will establish a Federal Advisory Committee to provide
information and advice regarding the development of the management plan
and management of the expansion. The committee will include state
agencies and local governments; Tribal nations and Indigenous
communities with cultural, traditional, or ancestral ties to the area;
recreational users; conservation organizations; wildlife, hunting, and
fishing organizations; the scientific community; business owners; and
the general public in the region.  
   
To better manage the high levels of visitation to this popular area, the
Administration, alongside state and private partners, is also [investing
to improve outdoor recreation infrastructure, restore and protect
resources, and increase
staffing](https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/san-gabriel-mountains-national-monument-facts-sheet.pdf)
to create an improved visitor experience in the existing and expanded
national monument.    
   
**<u>Expanding Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument</u>**  
   
President Biden will also sign a proclamation expanding the Berryessa
Snow Mountain National Monument, originally designated by President
Obama in 2015, in northern California. This expansion honors Tribal
Nations and Indigenous peoples through the protection of this sacred
California landscape and its historically and biologically important
features, while conserving our public lands and growing America’s
outdoor recreation economy. The expansion will add 13,696 acres of
public lands, managed by the Department of the Interior, to the
monument’s original 330,000 acres, which are jointly managed by the
Bureau of Land Management and the U.S Forest Service.   
   
The expansion area includes the portion of Molok Luyuk that is outside
the boundary of the existing monument. The striking 11-mile
north-to-south ridgeline, sacred to the Patwin people, is dotted with a
mosaic of unique geologic and hydrologic features. The ridge is flanked
by iconic California chapparal-covered canyons, oak and cypress
woodlands, and spring-fed meadows. Unusual and rare serpentine wetlands
dot Molok Luyuk and its downward slopes are fed by the numerous seeps
and springs scattered across the area, underpinning the region’s
prolific botanical richness—nearly 500 native California plant species
have been identified within the expansion area, including at least 38
different special-status plants. Molok Luyuk also serves as a wildlife
corridor for species such as tule elk, mountain lions, and bears, and is
home to iconic species such as bald and golden eagles. Conserving this
area fortifies protection for the scientifically critical north-south
migration corridor provided by the existing monument.  
   
The name Molok Luyuk recalls a time when California condors were a
common sight soaring above the ridge, and the Patwin people would
celebrate them with dances and ceremonies. On a clear day, the highest
points of Molok Luyuk offer a commanding view of the surrounding rugged
and undeveloped landscape, encompassing Mount Shasta to the north, Mount
Tamalpais to the southwest, and Sutter Buttes to the east. The view of
the sun rising over Sutter Buttes to the east is central to the Patwin
origin story. The expansion area contains evidence of occupation by
Indigenous people for more than 10,000 years.  
   
This expansion of the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument honors
the Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians, Kletsel Dehe Wintun Nation,
Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, and other Tribal Nations and Indigenous
leaders who worked tirelessly to ensure protection of these sacred lands
for generations to come. In order to reflect the historic, spiritual,
and cultural significance of Molok Luyuk to the Patwin people, the
President has also directed that the ridgeline be officially renamed
*Molok Luyuk.* To further honor the ties of the Patwin people to these
lands, the President’s proclamation also directs the Secretary of the
Interior to explore co-stewardship of the area with Tribal Nations.  
   
The proclamation directs the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to manage
the area according to the same terms, conditions, and management as the
original national monument designation, which respects grazing permits,
water rights, military use of airspace, state management of wildlife,
and wildfire response among other things. It also directs the BLM to
include the expansion area in the monument plan for the entire monument
and to issue a travel management plan.  
   
**<u>Background on Antiquities Act Designations</u>**  
   
Today’s expansions only reserve federal lands and do not affect the
property rights of state or private land owners. Any existing state or
private lands within the boundaries are not included in the monuments.  
   
Today’s designations mark President Biden’s ninth and tenth uses of the
Antiquities Act. President Theodore Roosevelt first used the Antiquities
Act in 1906 to designate Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming.
Since then, 18 presidents of both parties have used this authority to
protect unique natural and historic features in America, including the
Statue of Liberty, Colorado’s Canyon of the Ancients, and the Grand
Canyon.
