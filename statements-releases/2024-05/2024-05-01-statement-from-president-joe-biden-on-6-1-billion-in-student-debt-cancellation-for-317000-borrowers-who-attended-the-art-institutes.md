title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on $6.1 Billion in Student Debt Cancellation\
  \ for 317,000 Borrowers who Attended the Art\_Institutes"
---
 
Today, my Administration is approving $6.1 billion in student debt
cancellation for 317,000 borrowers who attended the Art Institutes. This
institution falsified data, knowingly misled students, and cheated
borrowers into taking on mountains of debt without leading to promising
career prospects at the end of their studies.

While my predecessor looked the other way when colleges defrauded
students and borrowers, I promised to take this on directly to provide
borrowers with the relief they need and deserve. Over the last three
years, my Administration has approved nearly $29 billion in debt relief
for 1.6 million borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them, closed
abruptly, or were covered by related court settlements, compared to just
53,500 borrowers who had ever gotten their debt cancelled through these
types of actions before I took office. And in total, we have approved
debt cancellation for nearly 4.6 million Americans through various
actions.

Today’s announcement builds on all we’ve done to fix broken student loan
programs and bring higher education more in reach. That includes:
providing the largest increases to the maximum Pell Grant in over a
decade, fixing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Income Driven
Repayment so borrowers get the relief they are entitled to under the
law, launching the SAVE Plan – the most affordable repayment plan ever,
and pursuing new plans that would cancel student debt for more than 30
million Americans when combined with everything we’ve done so far.

We will never stop fighting to deliver relief to borrowers, hold bad
actors accountable, and bring the promise of college to more Americans.
