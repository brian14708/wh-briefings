title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Principles for\
  \ High-Integrity Voluntary Carbon\_Markets"
---
 
Since Day One, President Biden has led and delivered on the most
ambitious climate agenda in history, including by securing the Inflation
Reduction Act, the largest-ever climate investment, and taking executive
action to cut greenhouse gas emissions across every sector of the
economy. The President’s Investing in America agenda has already
catalyzed more than $860 billion in business investments through smart,
public incentives in industries of the future like electric vehicles
(EVs), clean energy, and semiconductors. With support from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation
Reduction Act, these investments are creating new American jobs in
manufacturing and clean energy and helping communities that have been
left behind make a comeback.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to taking ambitious action
to drive the investments needed to achieve our nation’s historic climate
goals – cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reaching
net zero by 2050. President Biden firmly believes that these investments
must create economic opportunities across America’s diverse businesses –
ranging from farms in rural communities, to innovative technology
companies, to historically- underserved entrepreneurs.

**As part of this commitment, the Biden-Harris Administration is today
releasing a**
[**Joint**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VCM-Joint-Policy-Statement-and-Principles.pdf)[**Statement
of Policy and new Principles for Responsible Participation in Voluntary
Carbon**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VCM-Joint-Policy-Statement-and-Principles.pdf)[**Markets
(VCMs)**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/VCM-Joint-Policy-Statement-and-Principles.pdf)**that
codify the U.S. government’s approach to advance high-integrity VCMs.**
The principles and statement, co-signed by Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Energy Secretary Jennifer
Granholm, Senior Advisor for International Climate Policy John Podesta,
National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard, and National Climate Advisor
Ali Zaidi, represent the U.S. government’s commitment to advancing the
responsible development of VCMs, with clear incentives and guardrails in
place to ensure that this market drives ambitious and credible climate
action and generates economic opportunity.

The President’s Investing in America agenda has crowded in a historic
surge of private capital to take advantage of the generational
investments in the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law. High-integrity VCMs have the power to further crowd in private
capital and reliably fund diverse organizations at home and abroad
–whether climate technology companies, small businesses, farmers, or
entrepreneurs –that are developing and deploying projects to reduce
carbon emissions and remove carbon from the atmosphere.  
However, further steps are needed to strengthen this market and enable
VCMs to deliver on their potential. Observers have found evidence that
several popular crediting methodologies do not reliably produce the
decarbonization outcomes they claim. In too many instances, credits do
not live up to the high standards necessary for market participants to
transact transparently and with certainty that credit purchases will
deliver verifiable decarbonization. As a result, additional action is
needed to rectify challenges that have emerged, restore confidence to
the market, and ensure that VCMs live up to their potential to drive
climate ambition and deliver on their decarbonization promise. This
includes: establishing robust standards for carbon credit supply and
demand; improving market functioning; ensuring fair and equitable
treatment of all participants and advancing environmental justice,
including fair distribution of revenue; and instilling market
confidence.

**The Administration’s Principles for Responsible Participation
announced today deliver on this need for action to help VCMs achieve
their potential. These principles include:**

1.  Carbon credits and the activities that generate them should meet
    credible atmospheric integrity standards and represent real
    decarbonization.  
2.  Credit-generating activities should avoid environmental and social
    harm and should, where applicable, support co-benefits and
    transparent and inclusive benefits-sharing.  
3.  Corporate buyers that use credits should prioritize measurable
    emissions reductions within their own value chains.  
4.  Credit users should publicly disclose the nature of purchased and
    retired credits.  
5.  Public claims by credit users should accurately reflect the climate
    impact of retired credits and should only rely on credits that meet
    high integrity standards.  
6.  Market participants should contribute to efforts that improve market
    integrity.  
7.  Policymakers and market participants should facilitate efficient
    market participation and seek to lower transaction costs.  

**The Role of High-Quality Voluntary Carbon Markets in Addressing
Climate Change  
**  
President Biden, through his executive actions and his legislative
agenda, has led and delivered on the most ambitious climate agenda in
history. Today’s release of the Principles for Responsible Participation
in Voluntary Carbon Markets furthers the President’s commitment to
restoring America’s climate leadership at home and abroad by recognizing
the role that high- quality VCMs can play in amplifying climate action
alongside, not in place of, other ambitious actions underway.

High-integrity, well-functioning VCMs can accelerate decarbonization in
several ways. VCMs can deliver steady, reliable revenue streams to a
range of decarbonization projects, programs, and practices, including
nature-based solutions and innovative climate technologies that scale up
carbon removal. VCMs can also deliver important co-benefits both here at
home and abroad, including supporting economic development, sustaining
livelihoods of Tribal Nations, Indigenous Peoples, and local
communities, and conserving land and water resources and biodiversity.
Credit-generating activities should also put in place safeguards to
identify and avoid potential adverse impacts and advance environmental
justice.

To deliver on these benefits, VCMs must consistently deliver
high-integrity carbon credits that represent real, additional, lasting,
unique, and independently verified emissions reductions or removals. Put
simply, stakeholders must be certain that one credit truly represents
one tonne of carbon dioxide (or its equivalent) reduced or removed from
the atmosphere, beyond what would have otherwise occurred.  
In addition, there must be a high level of “demand integrity” in these
markets. Credit buyers should support their purchases with credible,
scientifically sound claims regarding their use of credits. Purchasers
and users should prioritize measurable and feasible emissions reductions
within their own value chains and should not prioritize credit price and
quantity at the expense of quality or engage in “greenwashing” that
undercuts the decarbonization impact of VCMs. The use of credits should
complement, not replace, measurable within-value-chain emissions
reductions.

VCMs have reached an inflection point. The Biden-Harris Administration
believes that VCMs can drive significant progress toward our climate
goals if action is taken to support robust markets undergirded by
high-integrity supply and demand. With these high standards in place,
corporate buyers and others will be able to channel significant,
necessary financial resources to combat climate change through VCMs. A
need has emerged for leadership to guide the development of VCMs toward
high-quality and high-efficacy decarbonization actions. The Biden-Harris
Administration is stepping up to meet that need.

**Biden-Harris Administration Actions to Develop Voluntary Carbon
Markets**

These newly released principles build on existing and ongoing efforts
across the Biden-Harris Administration to encourage the development of
high-integrity voluntary carbon markets and to put in place the
necessary incentives and guardrails for this market to reach its
potential. These include:

-   **Creating New Climate Opportunities for America’s Farmers and
    Forest Landowners.** Today, The Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)
    Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) published a [Request for
    Information
    (RFI)](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/05/28/usda-publishes-request-information-support-next-steps-implementing)
    in the Federal Register asking for public input relating to the
    protocols used in VCMs. This RFI is USDA’s next step in implementing
    the [Greenhouse Gas Technical Assistance Provider and
    Third-Party](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/02/27/usda-announces-progress-newly-authorized-climate-programs)
    [Verifier
    Program](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/02/27/usda-announces-progress-newly-authorized-climate-programs)
    as part of the Growing Climate Solutions Act. In February 2024, USDA
    announced its intent to establish the program, which will help lower
    barriers to market participation and enable farmers, ranchers, and
    private forest landowners to participate in voluntary carbon markets
    by helping to identify high-integrity protocols for carbon credit
    generation that are designed to ensure consistency, effectiveness,
    efficiency, and transparency. The program will connect farmers,
    ranchers and private landowners with resources on trusted
    third-party verifiers and technical assistance providers. This
    announcement followed a previous report by the USDA, [The General
    Assessment of
    the](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/10/23/usda-releases-assessment-agriculture-and-forestry-carbon-markets)
    [Role of Agriculture and Forestry in the U.S. Carbon
    Markets](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/10/23/usda-releases-assessment-agriculture-and-forestry-carbon-markets),
    which described how voluntary carbon markets can serve as an
    opportunity for farmers and forest landowners to reduce emissions.
    In addition to USDA AMS’s work to implement the Growing Climate
    Solutions Act, USDA’s Forest Service [recently announced $145
    million
    inawards](https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/newsroom/releases/usda-announces-145m-investing-america-agenda-help-landowners-access)
    under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to underserved and
    small- acreage forest landowners to address climate change, while
    also supporting rural economies and maintaining land ownership for
    future generations through participation in VCMs.
-   **Conducting First-of-its-kind Credit Purchases.** Today, the
    Department of Energy (DOE) [announced the
    semifinalists](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-12-million-accelerate-americas-carbon-dioxide-removal-industry)
    for its $35 million [Carbon Dioxide
    Removal](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/articles/doe-announces-35-million-accelerate-carbon-dioxide-removal?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)
    [Purchase Pilot
    Prize](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/articles/doe-announces-35-million-accelerate-carbon-dioxide-removal?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)
    whereby DOE will purchase carbon removal credits directly from
    sellers on a competitive basis. The Prize will support technologies
    that remove carbon emissions directly from the atmosphere, including
    direct air capture with storage, biomass with carbon removal and
    storage, enhanced weathering and mineralization, and planned or
    managed carbon sinks. These prizes support technology advancement
    for decarbonization with a focus on incorporating environmental
    justice, community benefits planning and engagement, equity, and
    workforce development. To complement this effort, the Department of
    Energy also issued a notice of intent for a [Voluntary
    Carbon](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/articles/us-department-energy-announces-intent-launch-voluntary-carbon-dioxide-removal)
    [Dioxide Removal Purchase
    Challenge,](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/articles/us-department-energy-announces-intent-launch-voluntary-carbon-dioxide-removal)
    which proposes to create a public leaderboard for voluntary carbon
    removal purchases while helping to connect buyers and sellers.  
-   **Advancing Innovation in Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) Technology.**
    Aside from direct support for voluntary carbon markets, the
    Biden-Harris Administration is investing in programs that will
    accelerate the development and deployment of critical carbon removal
    technologies that will help us reach net zero. For example, DOE’s
    [Carbon](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot) [Negative
    Shot](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot) pilot
    program provides $100 million in grants for small projects that
    demonstrate and scale solutions like biomass carbon removal and
    storage and small mineralization pilots, complementing other funding
    programs for small marine CDR and direct air capture pilots. DOE’s
    [Regional Direct Air Capture
    Hubs](https://www.energy.gov/oced/DACHubs) program invests up to
    $3.5 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in demonstration
    projects that aim to help direct air capture technology achieve
    commercial viability at scale while delivering community benefits.
    Coupled with DOE funding to advance monitoring, measurement,
    reporting, and verification technology and protocols and Department
    of the Treasury implementation of the expanded 45Q tax credit under
    the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. is making comprehensive
    investments in CDR that will enable more supply of high- quality
    carbon credits in the future.
-   **Leading International Standards Setting.** Several U.S.
    departments and agencies help lead the United States’ participation
    in international standard-setting efforts that help shape the
    quality of activities and credits that often find a home in VCMs.
    The Department of Transportation and Department of State co-lead the
    United States’ participation in the [Carbon Offsetting and Reduction
    Scheme for International
    Aviation](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/aee/corsia)
    (CORSIA), a global effort to reduce aviation-related emissions. The
    Department of State works bilaterally and with international
    partners and stakeholders to recognize and promote best practice in
    carbon credit market standard-setting—for example, developing the
    G7’s Principles for High-Integrity Carbon Markets and leading the
    United States’ engagement on designing the Paris Agreement’s
    [Article 6.4 Crediting
    Mechanism](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-64-mechanism).
    The U.S. government has also supported a number of initiatives
    housed at the World Bank that support the development of standards
    for jurisdictional crediting programs, including the [Forest Carbon
    Partnership Facility](https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/) and
    the [Initiative for Sustainable
    ForestLandscapes,](https://www.biocarbonfund-isfl.org/) and the
    United States is the first contributor to the new
    [SCALE](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/scale) trust fund.
-   **Supporting International Market Development.** The U.S. government
    is engaged in a number of efforts to support the development of
    high-integrity VCMs in international markets, including in
    developing countries, and to provide technical and financial
    assistance to credit-generating projects and programs in those
    countries. The State Department helped found and continues to
    coordinate the U.S. government’s participation in the [LEAF
    Coalition](https://www.leafcoalition.org/home), the largest
    public-private VCM effort, which uses jurisdictional-scale
    approaches to help end tropical deforestation. The State Department
    is also a founding partner and coordinates U.S. government
    participation in the
    [Energy](https://www.state.gov/united-states-and-partners-announce-energy-transition-accelerator-framework/)
    [Transition
    Accelerator,](https://www.state.gov/united-states-and-partners-announce-energy-transition-accelerator-framework/)
    which is focused on sector-wide approaches to accelerate just energy
    transitions in developing markets. USAID also has a number of
    programs that offer financial aid and technical assistance to
    projects and programs seeking to generate carbon credits in
    developing markets, ensuring projects are held to the highest
    standards of transparency, integrity, reliability, safety, and
    results and that they fairly benefit Indigenous Peoples and local
    communities. This work includes the [Acorn Carbon
    Fund,](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/sep-06-2023-usaid-announces-35-million-support-african-climate-leadership)
    which mobilizes $100 million to unlock access to carbon markets and
    build the climate resilience of smallholder farmers, and supporting
    high-integrity carbon market development in a number of developing
    countries. In addition, the Department of the Treasury is working
    with international partners, bilaterally and in multilateral forums
    like the G20 Finance Track, to promote high-integrity VCMs globally.
    This includes initiating the first multilateral finance ministry
    discussion about the role of VCMs as part of last year’s Asia
    Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.  
-   **Providing Clear Guidance to Financial Institutions Supporting the
    Transition to Net Zero.** In September 2023, the Department of the
    Treasury released its [*Principles for
    Net-*](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/NetZeroPrinciples.pdf)
    [*Zero Financing and
    Investment*](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/NetZeroPrinciples.pdf)
    to support the development and execution of robust net- zero
    commitments and transition plans. Later this year, Treasury will
    host a dialogue on accelerating the deployment of transition finance
    and a forum on further improving market integrity in VCMs.  
-   **Enhancing Measuring, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification
    (MMRV)** The Biden-Harris Administration is also undertaking a
    whole-of-government effort to enhance our ability to measure and
    monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a critical function
    underpinning the scientific integrity and atmospheric impact of
    credited activities. In November 2023, the Biden-Harris
    Administration released the first-ever [National Strategy to Advance
    an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas
    Measurement,](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/11/29/biden-harris-administration-releases-national-strategy-to-enhance-the-nations-greenhouse-gas-measurement-and-monitoring-capabilities/)
    [Monitoring, and Information
    System](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/11/29/biden-harris-administration-releases-national-strategy-to-enhance-the-nations-greenhouse-gas-measurement-and-monitoring-capabilities/),
    which seeks to enhance coordination and integration of GHG
    measurement, modeling, and data efforts to provide actionable GHG
    information. As part of implementation of the National Strategy,
    federal departments and agencies such as DOE, USDA, the Department
    of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, and the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration are engaging in collaborative
    efforts to develop, test, and deploy technologies and other
    capabilities to measure, monitor, and better understand GHG
    emissions.
-   **Advancing Market Integrity and Protecting Against Fraud and
    Abuse.** U.S. regulatory agencies are helping to build
    high-integrity VCMs by promoting the integrity of these markets. For
    example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) proposed
    new guidance at COP28 to outline factors that derivatives exchanges
    may consider when listing [voluntary carbon credit derivative
    contracts](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8829-23) to
    promote the integrity, transparency, and liquidity of these
    developing markets. Earlier in 2023, the CFTC issued a
    [whistleblower
    alert](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8723-23) to
    inform the American public of how to identify and report potential
    Commodity Exchange Act violations connected to fraud and
    manipulation in voluntary carbon credit spot markets and the related
    derivative markets. The CFTC also stood up a new [Environmental
    Fraud Task
    Force](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8736-23) to
    address fraudulent activity and bad actors in these carbon markets.
    Internationally, the CFTC has also promoted the integrity of the
    VCMs by Co-Chairing the Carbon Markets Workstream of the
    International Organization of Securities Commission’s Sustainable
    Finance Task Force, which recently published a [consultation on 21
    good
    practices](https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD749.pdf)
    for regulatory authorities to consider in structuring sound,
    well-functioning VCMs.  
-   **Taking a Whole-of-Government Approach to Coordinate Action.** To
    coordinate the above actions and others across the Administration,
    the White House has stood up an interagency Task Force on Voluntary
    Carbon Markets. This group, comprising officials from across federal
    agencies and offices, will ensure there is a coordinated,
    government- wide approach to address the challenges and
    opportunities in this market and support the development of
    high-integrity VCMs.

The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that the future of VCMs and
their ability to effectively address climate change depends on a
well-functioning market that links a supply of high-integrity credits to
high-integrity demand from credible buyers. Today’s new statement and
principles underscore a commitment to ensuring that VCMs fulfill their
intended purpose to drive private capital toward innovative
technological and nature-based solutions, preserve and protect natural
ecosystems and lands, and support the United States and our
international partners in our collective efforts to meet our ambitious
climate goals.
