title: "FACT SHEET: Global Health Worker Initiative (GHWI) Year Two Fact\_Sheet"
---
 
As we celebrate two years since the launch of the Global Health Worker
Initiative (GHWI), the United States continues to demonstrate our
commitment to global health and to the global health workforce,
providing more than $10.5 billion in global health program funding with
Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 funds. Recognizing that strategic and sustained
investments in health workers are critical to overcoming the setbacks
from COVID-19 and to achieving sustained progress toward the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), the United States contributes more than $1.5
billion annually to support health workers and strengthen the health
workforce globally through our bilateral health programs, such as the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the U.S.
President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), and global health security
programs. For the first time in FY24, USAID is receiving $10 million in
new funding to support the GHWI and the President’s 2025 Budget
requested $20 million to build on this important work.  
   
All countries, including the United States, must take action now to be
prepared for the next pandemic and to achieve the health-related SDG
targets, which include ending HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria as a
public health threat by 2030, achieving universal health coverage and
access to essential health services, and preventing child and maternal
deaths.  
   
Health care workers need safe, healthy, supportive working environments
to do their jobs – yet across the globe, health workers have to operate
in increasingly difficult, even dangerous conditions with limited
protections of their rights. Far too many health workers face inadequate
pay, safeguards, and equipment, and lack access to mental health and
psychosocial support services, and, in many cases, health workers face
harassment and violence with targeted attacks on the rise. These
challenges have a disproportionate impact on women, who represent 70% of
the health workforce, which further hinders women’s economic
security.    
   
Through the GHWI, the United States has partnered with countries and
communities around the world to support efforts to build a stronger
health workforce and make health workers safer and better equipped to
provide high-quality care. 

   
**PILLAR 1: PROTECTING AND SUPPORTING HEALTH WORKERS**  
The United States has invested in efforts to protect and support health
workers around the world so that they can continue providing services
safely while also taking care of their well-being.  
 

-   **The United States supports global efforts to monitor a growing
    number of attacks on health workers. ** The U.S. Agency for
    International Development (USAID) supported the operation of the
    World Health Organization’s (WHO) Surveillance System for Attacks on
    Health Care (SSA) to document and disseminate data on attacks on
    health workers across countries experiencing complex humanitarian
    emergencies.  Since January 1, 2024, this WHO website has documented
    395 attacks in 12 countries and territories, resulting in 160 deaths
    and 267 injuries of health workers. 

<!-- -->

-   **The United States is supporting efforts to address workplace
    safety concerns in health settings. ** In Ukraine, over the past
    year, USAID has helped safeguard health workers while maintaining
    access to health care following the Russian invasion through
    adoption of innovative telemedicine solutions, including the
    training of 724 health and information technology workers and the
    facilitation of 2,130 technical support sessions. As a result,
    health workers have provided over 10,000 telemedicine visits
    following the training.  In addition, the CDC supported training of
    laboratory staff in infection prevention and control (IPC) practices
    in Uganda, upgraded and certified biosafety cabinets in Senegal, and
    supported disease-specific testing for numerous disease outbreaks,
    including support for molecular serotype testing for dengue during
    an active outbreak in Bangladesh.

**PILLAR 2: EXPANDING THE GLOBAL HEALTH WORKFORCE AND ACCELERATING
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT**  
The United States is continuing efforts to create career pathways,
improve labor protections, and expand opportunities for paid employment
for health workers, including community health workers to address
systemic barriers and to close critical skill gaps.

-   **The United States has launched new effort to improve working
    conditions and encourage fair labor standards. ** Through USAID’s
    Gender Equity and Quality (GEEA) Fund, USAID established its first
    partnership with a global union federation to advance the
    representation and rights of health and care workers. This
    multi-country activity strengthens health and care workers’
    organizations, and health worker leaders that advocate for improved
    working conditions, safeguards, and equitable employment in
    Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ghana, and Philippines. This work
    advances women’s economic security by addressing key barriers that
    disproportionately impact women who are more likely to be employed
    in the health sector, by encouraging fair labor standards and social
    protections.   In addition, USAID, together with UNICEF, WHO and
    other global and regional partners, launched the Community Health
    Delivery Partnership (CHDP) to build a common country-led,
    data-driven agenda to improve alignment, high-level advocacy, and
    accountability focusing on community health workers’ status, rights,
    and protections. To date, the partnership has mobilized over 500
    participants from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi,
    Uganda, and Philippines.

-   **The United States provides critical support to health workers who
    provide essential HIV, TB, and malaria services. ** PEPFAR helps
    fund salaries for critical health staff in more than 55 countries
    where the United States supports the expansion and continuation of
    HIV and TB services—this includes more than 346,000 doctors and
    medical officers, nurses and midwives, social workers, laboratory
    staff, pharmacists, public health professionals, and community
    health workers and other community-based cadres.  PEPFAR also
    supports health workforce management and policies, health workforce
    training, recruitment, and retention, and human resources
    information systems.  Over the past year, PMI provided training,
    supervision, and equipment to approximately 100,000 community health
    workers across Africa and southeast Asia. This support enables
    community health workers to deliver case management of malaria at
    the community level, most often through integrated platforms that
    enable treatment of other common childhood illnesses such as
    diarrhea and pneumonia.

-   **The Peace Corps, through its Advancing Health Professionals (AHP)
    Program**, has recruited and deployed U.S. health professionals
    to (1) train health workers in clinical pharmacy and pharmacognosy
    at the University of Malawi College of Medicine;  (2)  provide
    training in medical-surgical nursing  to third-year nursing students
    to advance the primary health care (PHC) system in Uganda; (3) 
    design the Emergency Medical Care (EMC) professional courses
    curriculum for undergraduates in Eswatini; (4) train nurse
    practitioners to treat more complex diseases (through task shifting)
    in Liberia; and (5) train local providers of HIV treatment for
    indigenous populations in Panama.

<!-- -->

-   **Skilled public health workers are essential to rapidly detect and
    respond to disease outbreaks.** CDC’s Field Epidemiology Training
    Program (FETP) builds global health workforce capacity in countries
    around the world by better equipping health workers to meet
    population health needs. When avian influenza A H5N1 resurfaced in
    2023, CDC’s FETP-trained health workers in Cambodia swiftly joined
    an international investigation team from various sectors, including
    the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nation’s Food and
    Agriculture Organization (FAO), to address this highly pathogenic
    virus of international concern.  Their expertise played a pivotal
    role in the rapid response and implementation of disease control
    measures during the outbreak, underscoring the critical contribution
    of health workforce development programs to global health security
    and improving health threat management on a global scale. 

<!-- -->

-   **The United States is working to ensure that a strong health
    workforce is part of building a strong primary health care
    system. ** Through Primary Impact, USAID is working to accelerate
    essential health care provision by supporting country-led plans to
    strengthen primary health care and investing in the health workforce
    in seven countries, including Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Malawi,
    Kenya, Indonesia and the Philippines.  In early 2024, Primary Impact
    programs expanded to India, Madagascar, Rwanda, Uganda, and
    Vietnam.  In Kenya, USAID has supported the establishment of 108
    Primary Health Care Networks across 25 counties, supporting the
    rollout of multidisciplinary health teams and a new community health
    promoter cadre who are equipped with digital devices that link to an
    electronic community health information system.

-   **CDC supports the Stop Transmission of Polio (STOP) Program**, in
    collaboration with WHO and UNICEF to augment and build capacity of
    the immunization workforce in the most difficult settings. This
    program recruits and trains international public health experts and
    deploys them to countries around the world to strengthen national
    immunization surveillance programs, support supplemental
    immunization activities, respond to disease outbreaks, and help
    support polio eradication. During the past year, CDC trained and
    deployed 61 experts, while also supporting the activities of an
    additional 120 experts already trained and deployed in 32
    countries. 

**PILLAR 3: ADVANCING EQUITY AND INCLUSION**  
Over the past year, the United States has supported efforts to build a
more diverse health workforce and health leadership and advance training
opportunities for career growth and workforce retention. This has
included increasing partnerships and efforts to build capacity for the
roles of local community and faith-based organizations as service
providers to populations that are under-served and most vulnerable. 

-   **The United States has increased its investment in nurses, who
    serve as the backbone of patient care. ** In March, PEPFAR launched
    a Nursing Leadership Initiative in Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire,
    Eswatini, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zambia. Through the
    initiative, PEPFAR is providing $8 million in 2024 to support nurses
    at the forefront of the HIV/AIDS response. This initiative aims
    to: (1) enhance nurses’ skill sets to lead planning and delivery of
    HIV/AIDS-related services; (2) help nurses to identify, advocate,
    and leverage innovative digital solutions to enhance quality service
    delivery; (3) protect nurses by enhancing their infection prevention
    and control skills, providing supportive work environments, and
    supporting mental health needs; (4) invest in the development,
    retention, and equitable distribution of the nursing workforce;
    and (6) enhance nurses’ communications and leadership skill sets.

-   **The United States builds capacity of community and faith-based
    partners who play a critical role in the delivery of health
    services. ** Through New Partnerships Initiatives (NPI) investments,
    USAID worked with local community and faith-based partners in
    Pakistan, Malawi, South Sudan, Kenya and Haiti to train community
    health workers and volunteers to conduct community outreach to
    advance social and behavior change among youth, women and men in
    underserved and hard-to-reach communities. Community health worker
    and volunteer efforts led to improved community awareness of
    available services and increased use of locally available family
    planning and maternal health services.

-   **The United States has partnered with HBCUs to train at-risk
    adolescents to work in health-related fields.** The Department of
    Health and Human Services (HHS) in partnership with Historically
    Black Colleges and Universities Global Health Consortium (HBCU GHC),
    partnered with the Government of Malawi to train and employ
    adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) as Disease Control
    Surveillance Assistants.  With funding from PEPFAR, this partnership
    has recruited and trained 220 graduates of the DREAMS Program for
    AGYW from the three districts with the highest rates of new HIV
    infections among AGYW – 98 percent of these graduates have been
    retained and are currently employed providing essential primary
    health and HIV services with a special focus on AGYW health needs. 

<!-- -->

-   **The Department of Defense has worked to combat stigma and
    discrimination in military health services. ** Since 2018, the
    Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP) has led a
    comprehensive initiative to combat stigma and discrimination in
    military health services across over 30 countries. This effort has
    resulted in the establishment of Codes of Conduct in more than
    twenty Ministries of Defense (MOD) Health Facilities, driving policy
    adjustments within MODs to enable service members to serve and
    deploy on Peacekeeping Missions without bias. With DHAPP’s support,
    healthcare workers are now providing stigma-free healthcare,
    fostering inclusivity and support within both military and civilian
    communities.  

<!-- -->

-   **The United States is training health workers in equity research.**
    As the largest funder of health research in the world, the National
    Institutes of Health (NIH) has trained more than 7500 researchers in
    more than 130 countries since 1989 through the Fogarty International
    Center (FIC).  In the past year, NIH has supported neurology
    research in Zambia and 8 centers to undertake collaborative cancer
    research through the Global Training for Research and Equity in
    Cancer program.  Research training topics include cancer genetics,
    epidemiology, bioinformatics, clinical research, and implementation
    research.

**PILLAR 4: DRIVING AND INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AND
INNOVATION**  
Over the past year, the United States has continued to expand digital
strategies that equip health workers to provide more efficient,
quality-integrated service delivery, including telehealth services that
can expand the reach of health services to remote, underserved and
marginalized communities.

-   **CDC has developed two health informatics training programs:**
    GEEKS (Growing Expertise in E-Health Knowledge and Skills), a tiered
    training to apply skills to improve vaccine coverage and strengthen
    disease surveillance systems; and I-LEAD (Inter-governmental
    Learning Exchange to Advance Data-Driven Decision-Making), a
    leadership program that enables participants to develop and
    implement digital health solutions.  Over the past year, GEEKS has
    trained more than 400 participants and implemented 29 projects,
    while I-LEAD has trained more than 194 participants from 20
    countries.

-   **PMI invests in digital decision-making and data-collection tools
    for community health workers.** These tools can improve the quality
    of care and job performance by health workers while generating data
    to identify underserved populations, document program impact on
    morbidity and mortality, and better forecast commodity needs.
    Through PMI’s digital community health initiative, digital community
    health assessments were conducted in 27 PMI partner countries.
    During the past year, activities identified in these initial
    assessments were implemented in 8 countries, including support for a
    community electronic medical record system in Rwanda and a community
    health worker registry in Zambia.

<!-- -->

-   **Virtual learning strategies can now reach the most difficult and
    remote settings.** The United States has supported Project ECHO, a
    model in which health workers participate in a virtual community of
    practice with their peers where they share knowledge, experience and
    feedback. Project ECHO has programs in more than 80 countries with
    attendees in many more and has reached more than two million health
    workers with these trainings.  While these efforts started prior to
    the COVID-19 pandemic, Project ECHO provided an essential lifeline
    when many countries were locked down, and this initiative has
    continued to expand post-COVID. In many settings, virtual
    engagements have replaced or augmented costly in-person trainings,
    and the model has well-demonstrated impact.  For example, the
    Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP) supports
    Project ECHO in 46 countries, including advanced clinical HIV
    training sessions in 16 countries.  U.S. agencies have also funded
    Project ECHO to train health workers on COVID-19, public health
    emergency management, tuberculosis (TB), One Health, infection
    prevention and control, antimicrobial resistance, and laboratory
    skills.
