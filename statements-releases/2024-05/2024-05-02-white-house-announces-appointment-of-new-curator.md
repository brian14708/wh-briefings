WASHINGTON – This week, the White House announced the appointment of
Donna Hayashi Smith as the new Curator. Ms. Hayashi Smith, the ninth
White House Curator, joined the Executive Residence Office of the
Curator in 1995 and has served under five administrations. She began her
career as the administrative and collections assistant, then became the
White House collections manager and registrar. Most recently, she was
the associate Curator of the collections and registrar, a position where
she was responsible for caring for and tracking over 60,000 objects in
the White House Collection. She also led the Office of the Curator
through its American Alliance of Museums re-accreditation in 2022,
ensuring that the White House continues to be recognized nationally as
an accredited museum. Ms. Hayashi Smith has been serving as the acting
White House Curator since the retirement of her predecessor, Lydia
Tederick, after her decades of service.   

“Donna Hayashi Smith brings years of experience to this position, along
with unique perspectives from serving under five administrations. She
understands the history and legacy of the White House, as well as the
intricate innerworkings of the building itself,” **said First Lady Jill
Biden.** “I look forward to continuing our work together to preserve the
White House’s living history, increasing opportunities for Americans to
see themselves reflected here, and making the “People’s House” more
accessible to the millions of people who visit our Nation’s Capital each
year.”

Originally from Wahiawa, Hawaii, Ms. Hayashi Smith received her Bachelor
of Arts degree in Art History from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In
1990, she moved to Washington, D.C. for a Smithsonian Institution
minority fellowship at the National Museum of American History and was
hired as a museum aide at the National Museum of American Art a year
later. Shortly after arriving at the White House, Hayashi Smith earned a
Master of Arts degree in Museum Studies at the George Washington
University while continuing her work in the Office of the Curator.  Ms.
Hayashi Smith is the first Asian American to hold the title of Curator
of the White House.
