title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Attempted Assassination of Slovakia\
  \ Prime Minister Robert\_Fico"

I am alarmed to hear reports of an attack on Slovak Prime Minister
Robert Fico.  Jill and I are praying for a swift recovery, and our
thoughts are with his family and the people of Slovakia. We condemn this
horrific act of violence. Our embassy is in close touch with the
government of Slovakia and ready to assist.
