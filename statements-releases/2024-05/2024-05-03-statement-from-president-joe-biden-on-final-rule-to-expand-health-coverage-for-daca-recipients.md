title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Final Rule to Expand Health Coverage\
  \ for DACA\_Recipients"
---
 
Today, my Administration is expanding affordable, quality health care
coverage to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.
Dreamers are our loved ones, our nurses, teachers, and small business
owners. And they deserve the promise of health care just like all of
us.  
   
Nearly twelve years ago, President Obama and I announced the DACA
program to allow our young people to live and work in the only country
they’ve called home. Since then, DACA has provided more than 800,000
Dreamers with the ability to work lawfully, pursue an education, and
contribute their immense talents to make our communities better and
stronger.  
   
I’m proud of the contributions of Dreamers to our country and committed
to providing Dreamers the support they need to succeed. That’s why I’ve
previously directed the Department of Homeland Security to take all
appropriate actions to “preserve and fortify” DACA. And that’s why today
we are taking this historic step to ensure that DACA recipients have the
same access to health care through the Affordable Care Act as their
neighbors.  
   
On Day One of my administration, I sent a comprehensive immigration
reform plan to Congress to protect Dreamers and their families. Only
Congress can provide Dreamers permanent status and a pathway to
citizenship. Congress must act.
