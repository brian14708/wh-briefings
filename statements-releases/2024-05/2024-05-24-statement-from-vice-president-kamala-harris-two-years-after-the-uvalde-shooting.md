title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris Two Years After the Uvalde\_\
  Shooting"
---
 
Two years ago, 19 beautiful children and two selfless teachers were
killed in their classrooms during a senseless mass shooting carried out
with a weapon of war. They should still be with us – playing sports,
creating art, dancing, laughing, learning, teaching, and making new
memories with their families and friends. Today, we are remembering
their stories, standing with their loved ones, and thinking of their
community.  
  
In the months and years since these 21 Americans lost their lives and 17
others were injured, the families in Uvalde have powerfully channeled
their anguish into advocacy – demanding action to change the
unacceptable fact that gun violence is the leading cause of death for
children in our nation. With their help, President Biden and I fought to
pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun
safety law in nearly 30 years. Working with gun safety advocates in
Uvalde and across the country, we have also taken more action to reduce
gun violence than any other Administration in history. This includes
closing the gun show loophole, investing in student mental health,
launching the first-ever red flag law resource center, and establishing
the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.

While we have made necessary progress together, there is more work to be
done to ensure that every person in our nation has the freedom to live
safe from the horror of gun violence. Congress and state legislators
throughout America must have the courage to act by banning assault
weapons and high-capacity magazines, passing red flag laws, and making
background checks universal. These commonsense solutions will save lives
and ensure that fewer children, families, and communities experience the
unimaginable trauma and pain that Uvalde has suffered during these last
two years.
