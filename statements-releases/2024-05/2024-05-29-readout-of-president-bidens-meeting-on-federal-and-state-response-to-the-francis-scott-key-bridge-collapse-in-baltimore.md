title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting on Federal and State Response to\
  \ the Francis Scott Key Bridge Collapse in\_Baltimore"
---
 
Yesterday, President Biden met with Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Chief
of Engineers and Commanding General of the Army Corps of Engineers
Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon, and Deputy Commandant for Operations
of the United States Coast Guard Vice Admiral Pete Gautier for an
operational update on the Federal and State response to the collapse of
the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.  
   
During the meeting, the President underscored his Administration’s
commitment to standing with Baltimore every step of the way in this
recovery. The group discussed progress toward fully reopening the
federal shipping channel, including last week’s key milestones of
removing the cargo ship M/V DALI and expanding the channel to a width of
400 feet and a depth of 50 feet, allowing for the transit of all
deep-draft commercial vessels calling on the Port of Baltimore. The
meeting also focused on continued support for impacted workers, small
business owners, and families of the victims of the bridge collapse. The
group also discussed how Baltimore is open for business, and the
President reiterated his support for bringing commerce and tourism back
to the city.  
   
Prior to the President’s meeting, the White House convened a meeting
between Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Maryland Secretary of
Transportation Paul Wiedefeld and senior officials from the White House,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, Department of
Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, and Office of the
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. The meeting is one of a
series of regular meetings the White House has convened to ensure close
coordination between the federal government and the state of Maryland in
responding to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, supporting affected
communities, and ongoing planning to rebuild the bridge. The White House
will continue to work in lockstep with state and federal partners to
minimize the impacts of the devastating collapse and to help Baltimore
and the state of Maryland recover.
