title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions and Resources\
  \ for Increasing Student Attendance and Engagement as Part of the White\_House Every\
  \ Day Counts\_Summit"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments to help
ensure that all children can thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century – and
that begins with students being in school every day. Chronic absenteeism
– students missing 10% or more of school – emerged as a serious
challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic due to school closures, which
began during the previous Administration. The U.S. rate of chronic
absenteeism reached about 31% in the 2021-2022 school year. There have
been improvements in the 2022-2023 school year, with some American
schools and school systems demonstrating significant progress based on
proven strategies.   
   
But absenteeism remains a challenge for many schools, both in the United
States and around the world. Students who are chronically absent
are [much less
likely](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chronic-absenteeism-an-old-problem-in-search-of-new-answers/) to
read at grade level and to graduate high school. According to the
[Council of Economic
Advisers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/09/13/chronic-absenteeism-and-disrupted-learning-require-an-all-hands-on-deck-approach/),
absenteeism can account for up to 27% and 45% of the post-pandemic test
score declines in math and reading, respectively.  
   
Eliminating as few as 10 absences per year could have [significant
impacts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272721000773)
on the probability of students graduating high school and enrolling in
college. A [new
brief](https://www.gradpartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EGC-GP-NPSS-May-2024-Brief.pdf)
released today shows that some districts are improving a lot and others
much less. That is consistent with
[other](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22226/w22226.pdf)
[research](https://fordhaminstitute.org/sites/default/files/publication/pdfs/042022-imperfect-attendance-toward-fairer-measure-student-absenteeism_0.pdf)
showing that district, school, and teacher responses can make a
significant difference to absenteeism.  
   
We as a country should not accept chronic absenteeism as a new normal.
Earlier this year, the Administration announced its [Improving Student
Achievement
Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/17/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-improving-student-achievement-agenda-in-2024/).
**<u>And</u>** **<u>today at the White House, the Administration will
host the</u>** [**Every Day Counts
Summit**](https://youtube.com/live/EqWe0dwnm1c) **<u>featuring
bipartisan state and local education leaders who are tackling
absenteeism head on using evidence-based approaches.</u>**  
   
Today, **the Administration is calling on states, cities and towns, and
schools to cultivate a “culture of attendance” and send a clear message
that students need to be in school.** To support effective
communications, the Administration is sharing tools for messaging
effectively to parents about attendance. In addition, the Administration
supports efforts by state and local leaders to **report in real time on
student absences by school**—in order to track progress and address
challenges as they occur. At the Summit, the state superintendents for
Alabama and Indiana will share the ways they are gathering, sharing, and
using data already.  
   
In addition to prioritizing and reporting on absenteeism, the
Administration’s strategy calls for adopting four other strategies:

1.  Increasing effective communication with families, including the use
    of tactics like texting, which may be part of creating what
    Attendance Works refers to as a “[culture of
    attendance](https://www.attendanceworks.org/resources/toolkits/for-principals-leading-attendance/cultivate-a-school-wide-culture-of-attendance/#:~:text=All%20schools%20should%20have%20a,going%20to%20class%20every%20day.)”;
2.  Visiting families at home to help find supportive solutions;
3.  Making school more relevant for students so they want to be there;
    and
4.  Meeting the basic needs of students and families, including through
    investing in Full-Service Community Schools, which, among other
    features, connect families to supports such as health care, housing,
    and child care.

The Governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and leaders from four
school districts, will talk about how they are advancing these
strategies.   
  
As part of the Every Day Counts Summit, the Administration is announcing
these new actions:

-   **Targeting competitive federal grant programs to activities
    intended to increase student attendance and engagement.** This
    month, the U.S. Department of Education issued a Notice Inviting
    Applications for the [Education Innovation and Research grant
    program](https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-discretionary-grants-support-services/innovation-early-learning/education-innovation-and-research-eir/fy-2024-competition/),
    making available approximately $250 million to create, develop,
    implement, and replicate evidence-based solutions that accelerate
    student achievement, including those designed to reduce chronic
    absenteeism and increase student engagement. In the coming weeks,
    the Department will also release Notices Inviting Applications for
    the Stronger Connections Technical Assistance and Capacity Building
    grant program and the Promise Neighborhoods grant program, both of
    which can support student attendance and engagement.  
-   **Publishing new resources and tools on the effective use of data to
    identify students who are chronically absent and intervene early.**
    The Department of Education’s Institute for Education Sciences will
    issue resources supporting schools in using [data and early warning
    systems](https://ies.ed.gov/blogs/ncee/post/ies-resources-for-supporting-student-engagement-and-attendance#UsingData)
    to help identify patterns in student attendance, build positive
    school climate and strong [family
    relationships](https://ies.ed.gov/blogs/ncee/post/ies-resources-for-supporting-student-engagement-and-attendance#FamilyPartnerships),
    and effectively
    [communicate](https://ies.ed.gov/blogs/ncee/post/ies-resources-for-supporting-student-engagement-and-attendance#TextMessaging)
    with parents on school attendance  – including personalized
    notifications about how many days a student has missed. In addition,
    the Department’s Student Engagement and Attendance Center is
    releasing a [new
    toolkit](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2024/05/Action-Planner-for-Reengaging-Students-to-Support-Everyday-Attendance.-FINAL.pdf)
    for states and districts to examine root causes of chronic
    absenteeism and identify interventions. The Department’s National
    Center for Education Statistics will also collect new data on causes
    of chronic absenteeism this June through its School Pulse Panel
    survey and the Department will publish new data on school attendance
    at the state, local, and school levels later this year.  
-   **Releasing a** [**new
    resource**](https://cte.ed.gov/unlocking-career-success/news-and-guidance/news)
    **for increasing student attendance, engagement, and success through
    career-connected learning, with examples and connections that
    schools can use to increase career pathways.** The Department of
    Education’s Office of Career, Technical and Adult education
    previously announced $25 million in grant awards to advance
    Career-Connected High Schools, supporting a critical strategy to
    combat absenteeism for high school students – making school more
    relevant.  
    |
-   **Issuing a new resource on addressing transportation needs to
    improve school attendance.** Many students miss school because of
    transportation issues, especially in vulnerable communities. To
    address this issue, many transit agencies, school districts and
    local governments across the country work together to offer free or
    reduced transit fares for students. In time for back to school, the
    Federal Transit Administration and the Department of Education will
    distribute a resource highlighting ways to make bus and train
    transit a viable and affordable option for young people to get to
    and from school.

**To support these efforts and the evidence-based strategies described
above, several new commitments to tackling absenteeism in every corner
of the country will be announced at the Summit:**

-   Overdeck Family Foundation and the Ad Council Research Institute
    have committed to working together on a new messaging toolkit for
    states, school districts, and principals based on new research
    around effectively communicating with parents and families to
    increase student attendance. This messaging toolkit will be ready in
    time for back to school.  
-   The National Partnership for Student Success Support Hub at the
    Johns Hopkins Everyone Graduates Center is releasing a [Digital
    Backpack – “Resources to Address Chronic Absenteeism in Your
    Community” ](https://www.partnershipstudentsuccess.org/chronic-absence-digital-backpack/)–
    that includes a curated set of publicly available resources for easy
    reference. The Annenberg Center at Brown University and Research for
    Action are releasing a new [Ed Research for Action
    Brief](https://edresearchforaction.org/research-briefs/strengthening-school-connectedness-to-increase-student-success) designed
    to support an evidence-based approach to increasing school
    connectedness. The GRAD Partnership is also releasing a
    [resource ](https://www.gradpartnership.org/resources/chronic-absenteeism-response/)with
    guiding questions and action planning templates that schools and
    districts can use to create a comprehensive approach to reducing
    absenteeism that is customized to local conditions and [additional
    resources](https://www.gradpartnership.org/resources/absenteeism-toolkit) for
    addressing school-wide attendance patterns and meeting individual
    student needs.   
-   The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which represents 67,000
    pediatricians across the U.S., will engage its members to reinforce
    the key role of our nation’s pediatricians in addressing school
    attendance through individual interactions with patients and their
    parents, as well as through systems-level partnerships with schools.
    AAP has worked with partners in K-12 to reinforce the link between
    school attendance and good health and stress the value of developing
    strong school attendance habits as early as preschool. AAP will
    provide resources to parents with guidance for when to keep children
    home from school, tips for concerned parents on addressing school
    avoidance, and guidance on how best to prepare for the start of each
    school year.

Today’s announcements build on the previous actions of the
Administration, including targeting federal competitive [grant
programs](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/03/2020-07014/applications-for-new-awards-comprehensive-literacy-state-development-program)
to prioritize [evidence-based
approaches](https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/program-and-grantee-support-services/student-engagement-and-attendance-technical-assistance-sea-center/)
to supporting student  achievement, including those that address chronic
absenteeism; issuing [a
letter](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/secletter/240322.html) to
state education leaders sharing effective strategies for addressing
chronic absenteeism and the federal resources available to support their
efforts; and explaining the
[flexibility](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2024/01/ARP-Liquidation-Extension-Letter-1.9.24-final-for-signature-v3.pdf)
available for pandemic relief funds to support these activities through
the 2024-25 school year.  
  
To support and sustain state and local investments in increasing student
attendance and engagement, the Administration’s Fiscal Year 2025 Budget
proposal includes [$8 billion in mandatory
funding](https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget25/justifications/e-aag.pdf)
for Academic Acceleration and Achievement Grants to help close
opportunity and achievement gaps, including supporting evidence-based
strategies to increase student attendance and engagement.  
  
The Administration has also provided resources and opportunities to
support states, districts, and schools including:

-   **The Department of Education provided**
    [**guidance**](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2023/09/ARP-HCY-DCL-9.12.2023.pdf)
    **to states on how to use American Rescue Plan Homeless Children and
    Youth funds for transportation to and from schools for students
    experiencing homelessness**. Students experiencing homelessness face
    particular challenges in attending school regularly. More than half
    of students experiencing homelessness were chronically absent in the
    2021-2022 school year.   
-   **Providing funding through the STOP School Violence Program**, **in
    part through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, to improve school
    safety by providing students, teachers, and staff with the tools
    they need to recognize, respond quickly to, and prevent acts of
    violence.** This program funds measures that promote a positive and
    healthy school climate including, anti-bullying training, enhancing
    access to school-based behavioral health services, implementing
    appropriate social and emotional learning programs, and hiring
    personnel to help create a welcoming school climate, all of which
    have been proven to increase student attendance and engagement.
