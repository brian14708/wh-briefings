Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre: “With Memorial Day
weekend and the start of the summer driving season around the corner,
the Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to lower gas prices
with the [sale of one million barrels of
gasoline](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-announces-sale-northeast-gasoline-supply-reserve-americans-hit-road) from
the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. This builds on other actions by
President Biden to lower gas and energy costs—including historic
releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the largest-ever
investment in clean energy. While Congressional Republicans fight to
preserve tax breaks for Big Oil at the expense of hardworking families,
President Biden is advancing a more secure, affordable, and clean energy
future to lower utility bills while record American energy production
helps meet our immediate needs.”

The Biden administration will release 1 million barrels of gasoline from
reserves held in the Northeast to reduce prices at the pump ahead of the
Fourth of July holiday and summer driving season.  
  
“By strategically releasing this reserve in between Memorial Day and
July 4th, we are ensuring sufficient supply flows to the tri-state
\[region\] and northeast at a time hardworking Americans need it the
most,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement Tuesday.

The Biden administration said Tuesday it is releasing 1 million barrels
of gasoline from a Northeast reserve established after Superstorm Sandy
in a bid to lower prices at the pump this summer.  
  
\[…\] The move, which the department said is intended to help “lower
costs for American families and consumers,″ follows a mandate from
Congress to sell off the 10-year-old Northeast reserve and then close
it. The language was included in a spending deal Congress approved in
March to avert a partial government shutdown.

Gasoline prices at the pump are little changed from a year ago, but the
Biden administration on Tuesday said it’s taking action to help lower
prices at the pump for the summer.  
  
The U.S. Department of Energy announced Tuesday that it will release 1
million barrels of gasoline from the nation’s Northeast Gasoline Supply
Reserve to help lower retail prices of the fuel ahead of this weekend’s
Memorial Day start to the summer driving season.

The Biden administration on Tuesday announced the release of 1 million
barrels of gasoline, a move aimed at cutting prices at the pump this
summer \[…\]  
  
The administration’s move comes as summer driving season gets underway,
when prices typically bump up as a result of demand from travelers and
changes made in the formulation of the fuel to meet summer air quality
rules. Congress had earlier mandated that the reserve, which was created
in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, be shut down, which prompted the
sale.

prices in check for consumers ahead of the July 4 holiday.

In an effort to lower gas prices as summer travel looms, the Biden
administration said Tuesday that it is releasing 1 million barrels of
gasoline from a Northeast reserve established after Superstorm Sandy.  
  
The sale, from storage sites in New Jersey and Maine, will be allocated
in increments of 100,000 barrels at a time. The approach will create a
competitive bidding process that ensures gasoline can flow into local
retailers ahead of the July 4 holiday and sold at competitive prices,
the Energy Department said. The move is intended to help “lower costs
for American families and consumers,″ the department said in a
statement.

The Biden administration said Tuesday it is releasing nearly one million

\[…\] According to the Department of Energy, the barrels come from
storage sites in New Jersey and Maine and will be delivered to awarded
retailers and terminals no later than June 30. The move is an attempt by
the administration to “lower costs for American families and consumers,”
while also following a congressional mandate to sell off the 10-year-old
reserve.

for the tri-state and northeast regions during a period of high
demand.  
  
“The Biden-Harris Administration is laser-focused on lowering prices at
the pump for American families, especially as drivers hit the road for
