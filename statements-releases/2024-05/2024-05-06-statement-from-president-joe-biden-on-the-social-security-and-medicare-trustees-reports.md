  Reports"

Medicare is stronger and Social Security remains strong. As long as I am
President, I will keep strengthening Social Security and Medicare and
protecting them from Republicans’ attempts to cut benefits Americans
have earned. Since I took office, my economic plan and strong recovery
from the pandemic have helped extend Medicare solvency by a decade, with
today’s report showing a full five years of additional solvency. My plan
would extend Medicare solvency permanently by asking the wealthy to pay
their fair share and lowering prescription drug costs. And I am
committed to extending Social Security solvency by asking the
highest-income Americans to pay their fair share without cutting
benefits or privatizing Social Security.

Republicans in Congress have a very different vision. Their budget sides
with the wealthy and special interests to cut Social Security by over
$1.5 trillion, increase the retirement age, raise prescription drug
costs, and transition Medicare to a system that would raise premiums for
many seniors. These changes are cruel and unnecessary. I will always
fight for America’s seniors and prevent Republicans from cutting Social
Security and Medicare.
