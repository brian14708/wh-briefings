As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s unprecedented commitment to
protect America’s natural wonders for future generations, honor areas of
cultural significance to Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples, and
expand access to nature, yesterday President Biden [signed
proclamations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-expands-san-gabriel-mountains-national-monument-and-berryessa-snow-mountain-national-monument/)
expanding the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and the Berryessa
Snow Mountain National Monument. Together, these actions protect nearly
120,000 acres of lands in California.

The Biden-Harris Administration has already conserved more than 41
million acres of lands and waters, putting President Biden on track to
conserve more lands and waters than any President in history.

*Leaders from California and across the country praised the
announcement. Here’s what they’re saying:*

**<u>Tribal and Community Leaders</u>**

**Anthony Roberts, Chairman, Yocha Dehe Tribe:** “We thank President
Biden for expanding the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument and
protecting Molok Luyuk, an area steeped in thousands of years of rich
history and profound meaning to the Patwin people, whose traditional
territory stretches south from these hills to the shores of San Pablo
Bay and east to the Sacramento River. Elements of the natural landscape
on the ridge have traditional cultural significance to us. We look
forward to the day when condors fly over Molok Luyuk once again.”
\[Statement, 05/02/2024\]

**Lynn Valbuena, Chairwoman, San Manuel Band of Missions Indians**: “The
San Manuel Band of Mission Indians is grateful for President Biden’s
action today to expand the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. The
San Gabriel Mountains are culturally significant to the Serrano and
other Indigenous peoples. It feels good to know that these mountains and
lands will now be protected for future generations of our people.”
\[Statement, o5/02/2024\]

**Rudy Ortega Jr., L.H.D., President, Fernandeño Tataviam Band of
Mission Indians:** “We are thrilled that the San Gabriel Mountains
National Monument is expanding. We thank the Biden administration for
making this longstanding vision a reality. Expanding the Monument helps
protect lands of cultural importance to my people who are part of this
nation’s history and who have cared for these lands since time
immemorial. It also further protects areas that are critical for our
environment and the wildlife and plants that depend on this landscape.”
\[Statement, 05/02/2024\]

**Chief Anthony Morales, Gabrieleno San Gabriel Band of Mission
Indians:** “We add our voices in celebration of expanding the San
Gabriel Mountains National Monument. The San Gabriel Mountains are

Protecting more of this important region helps protect our traditional
plants and cultural resources. We join Senator Padilla and
Representative Chu in thanking President Biden for using the Antiquities
Act to expand the monument.” \[Statement, 05/02/2024\]

**David Diaz, Executive Director, Active San Gabriel Valley**: “For San
Gabriel Valley residents, the San Gabriel Mountains are the backdrop to
our lives. They are a place of unreal beauty, connection, and
rejuvenation, and offer multiple benefits to our community. We thank
Representative Chu and Senator Padilla for their leadership to complete
the vision of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, and we thank
President Biden for taking action. We are looking forward to leading
adventures into the western Angeles National Forest so they can feel the
shade of a coast live oak, spend quality time with their family and
enjoy views from our beautiful mountains.” \[Statement, 05/02/2024\]

**Belén Bernal, Executive Director, Nature for All:** “Our local
community is overjoyed to see this next step in a 20-year effort to
permanently protect the San Gabriel Mountains. The area included in the
expanded San Gabriel Mountains National Monument is the closest section
of the National Forest to the San Fernando Valley; this action helps
ensure environmental justice for communities who lack access to green
and open spaces throughout Los Angeles County. Thank you, President
Biden, for taking this action to benefit the health and well-being of
millions of Angelenos and to Vice President Harris for championing the
protection of these special public lands!” \[Statement, 05/02/2024\]

**Mary Creasman, Chief Executive Officer, California Environmental
Voters:** “The expansion of our national monuments and protection of our
public lands are key nature-based solutions to the climate and
biodiversity crises. These additions to the San Gabriel Mountains and
Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monuments include must-protect areas
that provide communities with critical drinking water, create access to
greenspaces for underserved communities, hold historical and cultural
significance to California Tribes and Indigenous community leaders, and
serve as wildlife corridors and habitats for imperiled animals and
native plants. We thank President Biden for his leadership and urge him
to look to additional places in California for national monument
designation, so we can make more progress towards our 30×30 goals.”

Tribes, communities, and organizations to protect California’s
remarkable biodiversity and our connections to it.” \[Statement,

Mountain National Monument with the addition of Molok Luyuk. It is
critical that wildlife never lose access to this important corridor

Area, and today’s action ensures they won’t. As someone who has worked
to protect this incredibly diverse and unique landscape for the better
part of two decades, this is incredibly exciting and personally

habitat, and address the threats of drought, wildfires, and climate
change. We applaud President Biden for recognizing the value and
fragility of these lands and the importance of their protection for both
people and wildlife.” \[Statement, 05/02/2024\]

**Walter “Redgie” Collins, Legal and Policy Director, California
Trout:** “The expansion of the San Gabriel National Monument is cause
for celebration. Beyond providing expanded outdoor access and protecting
precious water resources and culturally significant sites, the expansion
will also protect higher reaches of the greater San Gabriel River
watershed, which we know to hold endangered Southern steelhead genetics.
At CalTrout, we dream of a future where our local communities are able
to see Southern steelhead spawn in great numbers in Southern California
rivers and streams once again – we thank the Biden Administration for

California Creative Corps Grantee:** “Expanding the Berryessa Snow
Mountain National Monument is a win-win for Colusa County. Doing so will

outdoor education opportunities for county residents, provide a mandate
to safeguard the habitats of endangered plants and animals, and
streamline planning for land managers so we can protect and honor this
land for generations to come. We’re lucky to have this spectacular
landscape right in our backyard. Preserving it is the right thing to
do.” \[Statement, 05/02/2024\]

Alliance:** “Expanding protected lands and recognizing tribal cultures
within these lands is the type of management needed to both address

The San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, serving as the backyard to
the nation’s second-largest urban center, and the Berryessa Snow

of low-income Americans. I am thrilled to see President Biden exercise
his authority to permanently protect the entire San Gabriel Mountains

tribal origin stories into the Berryessa Snow Mountain National
Monument. These monuments have fostered a lifelong connection to nature
for millions of Californians, and their expansions will ensure future

the long-awaited expansion,” Napolitano said. “This expansion will

County. As California is continuously faced with droughts, forest fires,
and the growing impacts of climate change, it is critical that we

ecstatic that @POTUS is expanding the San Gabriel Mountains National
Monument! This will protect & expand access to sacred natural, cultural,
& recreational treasures for the 18 million+ Angelenos living near these
beautiful public lands. 10 years ago, @BarackObama responded to my call
with indigenous leaders, community activists, & nature-lovers for
permanent protection for the San Gabriel Mountains by declaring 346,000
acres as a National Monument. Even then, we recognized that our work
wasn’t finished. It’s been an honor working with @SenAlexPadilla to
advocate for expanding the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. The
benefits are immense: enhanced access to nature for underserved
communities and safeguarding one-third of LA County’s drinking water
resources. Today’s expansion would not be possible without the tireless
efforts of @CalNatResources, @HildaSolis, @lanatureforall,
@Pasadena\_Mayor, @envirovoters, and many others to preserve the San
Gabriels for present and future generations. Their dedication has been
invaluable. I am deeply grateful to President Biden for his decisive

unique public lands in the world. President Biden’s bold action will not
only preserve the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and Berryessa
Snow Mountain National Monument for generations to come, but also
underscore our collective commitment to the protection of our public
heritage and public lands. Along with Senators Padilla and Feinstein,
and Representative Chu, I’ve fought to protect the San Gabriel
Mountains. And the expansion of these monuments will provide increased
access to green spaces for millions of Californians and boost local
economies through sustainable tourism. As we continue to take on the

area will ensure we also honor the heritage of the Patwin People who
called these lands home long before we arrived. This designation will
ensure that the Tribes have a leadership role in the cultural and
restorative management practices to protect the unique history and
biodiversity of the area. Colusa will only benefit further from creating
equity and balance by expanding this monument.” \[Statement,

**Tom Stallard, Woodland City Councilmember**: “It is entirely
appropriate that we show deference and courtesy to Native People by
expanding Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument to include
additional lands sacred to them and referring to it in a way that honors
their people by using their native language. Thank you to President
Biden for taking action to protect Molok Luyuk.” \[Statement,

**<u>Environmental Leaders</u>**

**Maite Arce, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hispanic Access
Foundation:** “Los Angeles is one of the top cities in the country with
the highest concentration of Latinos. The San Gabriel Mountains make up
70% of Los Angeles County’s open space and are the backyard for many
Latino and culturally diverse communities in the area that have limited
access to green spaces in their neighborhoods. The designation expansion
ensures permanent protection of the San Gabriels, which are critical for
the health and wellbeing of millions of people and future generations.”

**Jamie Williams, President, The Wilderness Society:** “We thank
President Biden for expanding the San Gabriel Mountains and Berryessa
Snow Mountain National Monuments, a representation of our vision for a
future where people and nature flourish together. This dual expansion
gets us closer to realizing that vision by advancing 30×30 conservation

unity.”

**Gene Karpinski, President, League of Conservation Voters:** “The
Biden-Harris administration has done more for conservation than any
other first-term president in history. They have protected a historic 41
million acres and counting, and are continuing to deliver on
community-led conservation with this latest expansion of San Gabriel
Mountains and Berryessa Snow Mountains National Monuments. With these
expansions, the administration is increasing equitable access to the
outdoors in one of the country’s most populated areas while protecting
clean water sources, healthy ecosystems, and vital cultural resources in
Southern California. Expanding Berryessa Snow Mountains National
Monument to include Molok Luyuk also honors its cultural importance to
the Yocha Dehe Wintun peoples, as well as other California Tribes, and
conserves the region’s incredible biodiversity. National monuments are a
win-win to permanently protect our cultural and natural resources and
advance equity in the outdoors. We join local partners and Tribal
leaders in celebrating these expansions, and we look forward to
supporting the Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to protect even
more places worthy of national monument designation.”

**Ben Jealous, Executive Director, Sierra Club: “**National monuments
protect more than landscapes. They preserve the historical, cultural,
and spiritual legacies of the people who have made this country what it
is. Expanding the San Gabriels monument and protecting Molok Luyuk will
have significant and immediate benefits for the communities, wildlife,
and ecosystems of California. Millions of people will have greater
access to nature, vital habitat will be preserved for imperiled species,
and critical water resources will be safeguarded for those who rely on
them. Since day one, President Biden has made it clear that he is
serious about protecting public lands and preserving the legacies etched
into those landscapes. We urge him to continue to build his monumental
legacy.”

**Jennifer Rokala, Executive Director, Center for Western Priorities:**
“Today’s announcement not only adds to President Biden’s conservation
legacy, but also amplifies his commitment to environmental justice and
Tribal sovereignty. Ensuring communities of color have equitable access
to nearby public lands and honoring Tribally-led land protection efforts
are both vital components of public land conservation. By expanding
these monuments, President Biden is now within arm’s reach of becoming
the most consequential first-term conservation president in recent
history. We’re happy to see his administration continuing to make
progress toward the goal of conserving 30 percent of lands and waters by
2030, and we’re hopeful to see him designate more monuments so that he
can solidify his place in conservation history.”

this effort, and congratulate on-the-ground coalition leaders and

Progress**: “These monument expansions build on President Biden’s legacy
of centering equity and justice in his conservation work. They will
ensure that historically marginalized communities have access to, and
are represented in, the country’s public lands. The San Gabriel
Mountains National Monument expansion provides access to nature for
millions of Southern Californians who live in one of the country’s
largest urban hubs. This is an area where nature deprivation
disproportionately affects people of color and low-income communities.
The Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument expansion honors and
protects sacred lands and safeguards rich wildlife habitat. This
expansion, combined with a commitment to explore Tribal co-stewardship,
centers Indigenous voices, knowledge, and leadership on our public
lands.”

Berryessa Snow Mountain to include Molok Luyuk ensures the protection of
a vital ecosystem important to numerous threatened species of plants and
wildlife, as well as the protection of cultural sites held sacred by
Indigenous people across the region. The expansion of the San Gabriel
