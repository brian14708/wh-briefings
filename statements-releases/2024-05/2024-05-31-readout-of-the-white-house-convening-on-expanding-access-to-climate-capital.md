title: "Readout of The White\_House Convening on Expanding Access to Climate\_Capital"
---
 
Yesterday, Small Business Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman, White
House National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard, and White House National
Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi hosted a Climate Capital Convening at the
White House with investors, climate technology start-up companies, small
business owners, and entrepreneurs.  
  
Participants discussed how President Biden’s historic [Investing in
America
agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) is
catalyzing unprecedented levels of investment in America’s clean energy
economy, as well as opportunities to build on this momentum and expand
capital access for climate-focused start-ups and small businesses across
America. Participants noted that smaller businesses may lack the
resources needed to navigate the full ecosystem of federal funding
opportunities. Additionally, industry identified opportunities to
accelerate construction and deployment, as well as to leverage the
Administration’s convening power and procurement authorities to drive
demand certainty for emerging clean technologies.  
  
To address some of the challenges raised by industry, yesterday, the
Biden-Harris Administration
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/30/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-action-to-expand-access-to-capital-for-small-and-medium-sized-climate-businesses/)
new actions to expand access to capital for small- and medium-sized
climate enterprises and start-ups. First, the White House released a
[Climate Capital
Guidebook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CLIMATE-CAPITAL-GUIDEBOOK-v5.29.2024-730pm.pdf),
a one-stop-shop for information on federal funding programs – such as
grants, loans, tax credits, and equity investments – available to
climate-related start-ups, small- and medium-sized businesses, and their
investors. Second, the Small Business Administration
[announced](https://www.sba.gov/article/2024/05/30/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-resources-advanceclean-energy-economy)
that it is expanding access to its flagship [504 Loan
Program](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/504-loans) – which
provides long-term, fixed rate loans to support capital expenditures –
by lifting the cap on the number of loans that small businesses can take
out for qualifying energy projects, such as solar installations.  
  
Administration officials reiterated the President’s commitment to not
only spurring new investment in climate and clean energy solutions, but
also to ensuring that small- and medium-sized businesses in communities
across the country, particularly places that have been left behind for
too long, share in the benefits of the economic transformation
underway.
