title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces $3 Billion to Replace\
  \ Toxic Lead Pipes and Deliver Clean Drinking Water to Communities Across the\_\
  Country"
---
 
*Funding from* *President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda* *Will
Accelerate Progress Toward* *the President’s* *Commitment to Replace
Every Lead Pipe in the Country Within a Decade*

President Biden believes that every American should be able to turn on
the tap and drink clean, safe water. But over 9 million homes, schools,
daycares, and businesses receive their water through a lead pipe,
putting people at risk of lead exposure. Lead is a neurotoxin that can
irreversibly harm brain development in children, and it can also
accumulate in the bones and teeth, damage the kidneys, and interfere
with the production of red blood cells needed to carry oxygen. Due to
decades of inequitable infrastructure development and underinvestment,
lead poisoning disproportionately affects low-income communities and
communities of color. There is no safe level of exposure to lead. That
is why the President made a **commitment to replace every lead pipe in
the country within a decade** and coordinated a whole of government
effort to deploy resources and leverage every tool across federal, state
and local government to address lead hazards through the [Lead Pipe and
Paint Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/).   
  
As part of this unprecedented commitment, President Biden is traveling
today to Wilmington, North Carolina, to announce **$3 billion through
his Investing in America agenda to replace toxic lead pipes.** This
investment, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
is part of the historic $15 billion in dedicated funding for lead pipe
replacement provided by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Today’s announcement delivers funding to every state and U.S. territory
to help address lead in drinking water while creating good-paying jobs,
many of them union jobs. In addition, this program funding is part of
the President’s Justice40 Initiative, which set a goal that 40% of the
overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged
communities, and is helping address the inequities of lead exposure.  
  
Additionally, to further reduce lead exposure, **the Department of
Housing and Urban Development is announcing today nearly $90 million**
in available funding to reduce residential health hazards in public
housing, including lead-based paint hazards, carbon monoxide, mold,
radon, fire safety, and asbestos, advancing the President’s Lead Pipe
and Paint Action Plan.  
  
Today’s announcement from the EPA builds on more than $20 billion in
water infrastructure investments that state and local governments have
made through the President’s American Rescue Plan. North Carolina has
invested close to $2 billion from the American Rescue Plan in more than
800 clean water, wastewater, and stormwater projects across the state
and is using another $150 million to test for and remove lead hazards in
every school and child care center across the state, a historic effort
to remove lead from North Carolina schools.  
  
**In Wilmington, North Carolina, President Biden will announce $76
million from his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for lead pipe replacement
across the state. The President will also meet with faculty and students
from a Wilmington school that replaced a water fountain with high levels
of lead with funding from his American Rescue Plan.**  
  
EPA estimates North Carolina has an estimated 300,000 lead pipes, and
today the President will highlight his goal of replacing every lead pipe
in the state. With today’s new investment of $76 million, the President
has now delivered $250 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding
to North Carolina for lead pipe replacement. This funding has already
reached over 60 communities across the state to kick start lead pipe
identification and replacement efforts.  
  
One of these communities is Wilmington, North Carolina, which has
already received over $4 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
to identify and replace 325 lead pipes. **Today, President Biden is
announcing that the first Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded lead pipe
replacement in Wilmington is now underway,** kicking off this project
for the city.  
  
**<u>Progress Replacing Lead Pipes Across America</u>**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to accelerate lead pipe
replacement in communities across the country. The total lead pipe
replacement funding announced by the Administration to date **will
replace up to 1.7 million lead pipes**, protecting countless families
and children from lead exposure.  
  
To ensure that communities that bear most of the burden of lead exposure
are not left behind in this opportunity, EPA and the Department of Labor
are partnering directly with disadvantaged communities across the
country to provide the support and technical assistance they need to
secure funding for and execute lead pipe replacement initiatives. EPA
has partnered with over 40 communities to date, and last November
announced it would partner with 200 more communities through the EPA
[Get the Lead
Out](https://www.epa.gov/water-infrastructure/get-lead-out-initiative)
Initiative.  
  
This work is also creating good-paying jobs, many of them union jobs, in
replacing lead pipes – and accelerating the development of a skilled
water workforce. Unions including the Laborers’ International Union of
North America (LIUNA), the United Association of Plumbers and
Pipefitters, and the International Union of Operating Engineers are
already training workers in lead pipe replacement and putting them to
work on neighborhood blocks across the country. The EPA estimates that
**200,000 jobs have been created by the Administration’s investments in
drinking water infrastructure alone.**  
  
In addition, last November, EPA issued a proposal to [strengthen its
Lead and Copper
Rule](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/30/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-action-to-protect-communities-from-lead-exposure/)
that would require water systems to replace lead pipes within 10 years
and drive progress nationwide toward reducing lead exposure.  
  
The examples below highlight several communities where the
Administration’s investments are making an impact:

-   In **Milwaukee, Wisconsin**, $41 million from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law has helped put the city on track to replace all
    its lead pipes within 10 years instead of the initially estimated 60
    years. The city is using a high proportion of union labor to replace
    lead pipes, and will be one of four new [White House Workforce
    Hub](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-workforce-hubs-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-good-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
    cities that were announced by President Biden last week.  
-   Following a lead-in-water crisis, **Benton Harbor, Michigan**,
    successfully replaced all its lead pipes within just two years,
    fueled by $18 million in funding from the President’s American
    Rescue Plan.  
-   **Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,** has received $42 million from the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to replace lead pipes, and is on track
    to replace every lead pipe by 2026. [Vice President Harris visited

    in February to highlight this progress in lead pipe replacement and
    announce new funding for clean water.  
-   **St. Paul, Minnesota,** has received $16 million from the American
    Rescue Plan to replace lead pipes. This funding has enabled the
    city’s Lead-Free St. Paul program to target the replacement of all
    lead pipes by 2032 at no cost to residents.  
-   **Cincinnati, Ohio,** passed an ordinance to develop a program to
    replace all lead pipes in line with the President’s goal, and
    authorized covering the cost of replacing private lead pipes that
    bring water to residents’ homes. A $20 million investment from the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will support this work.  
-   **Tucson, Arizona,** received $6.95 million to develop a Lead
    Service Line inventory for their nine public water systems. The city
    will use this inventory to develop a plan to replace lead service
    lines in the community and improve drinking water quality for
    residents – many of whom live in low-income and disadvantaged
    communities.  
-   **Denver, Colorado,** has replaced almost 25,000 lead service lines
    since the program launched in 2020. Denver plans to replace another
    5,000 this year and is on target to replace 100% by 2031,
    accelerating its lead pipe replacement due to Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law funding.  
-   Last week, at the White House Water Summit, the **Great Lakes and
    St. Lawrence Cities Initiative launched its new** [**Great Lakes
    Lead Pipes
    Partnership**](https://glslcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04.23.24_White-House-Water-Summit-2.pdf)
    **with three of its members – Chicago, Illinois, Detroit, Michigan,
    and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.** This **first-of-its kind, mayor-led
    effort to accelerate lead pipe replacement in cities with the
    heaviest lead burdens** will provide a collaborative forum for
    metropolitan areas in the Great Lakes to share emerging best
    practices to encourage faster, more equitable replacement programs
    and overcome common challenges, including reducing replacement
    costs, improving community outreach, and spurring water workforce
    development.

**<u>Broader Administration Actions to Deliver Clean Water</u>**

The funding announced today is part of the over $50 billion provided by
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to upgrade the nation’s water
infrastructure – **the largest investment in clean** **and safe**
**water in American history.** In addition, over $20 billion from the
American Rescue Plan has been invested in water infrastructure,
including lead pipe replacement, nationwide.

Beyond replacing lead pipes, these broader investments are helping to
expand access to clean drinking water, improve wastewater and sanitation
infrastructure, and remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
contamination in water. The Administration has launched over 1,400 of
these projects to deliver clean water to date.

**Delivering Clean Drinking Water.** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
invests nearly $31 billion in funding to secure clean drinking water
through infrastructure projects such as upgrading aging water mains and
improving water treatment plants.

**Improving Wastewater and Sanitation Infrastructure.** Over 2 million
people in the U.S. live without basic running water or sanitation
systems in their homes. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests nearly
$13 billion to improve wastewater, sanitation, and stormwater
infrastructure.

**Tackling PFAS Pollution in Water.** Exposure to PFAS “forever
chemicals” in drinking water is linked to severe health impacts
including deadly cancers, liver and heart damage, and developmental
impacts in children. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $10
billion to address toxic PFAS pollution in water. In addition, this
month EPA announced the [first-ever national drinking water standard for
PFAS](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/10/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-critical-action-to-protect-communities-from-pfas-pollution-in-drinking-water/)
, which will protect 100 million people from PFAS exposure.

**<u>Lowering Costs for North Carolina Families</u>**

**As the President invests in all of America and all Americans, his
agenda is lowering costs for North Carolina families:**

-   Saving 2.2 million North Carolina Medicare beneficiaries money on
    prescription drugs, insulin, and vaccines.
-   Saving 1 million North Carolinians hundreds of dollars per year on
    health insurance.
-   North Carolina families will get lower utility bills thanks to $209
    million in home energy rebates and new tax credits for
    energy-efficient appliances.
-   President Biden is taking on corporate rip-offs like junk fees to
    lower costs for North Carolina families on everything from airfares
    to event tickets to overdraft fees.
-   President Biden would lower housing costs with a $10,000 tax credit
    for first-time homebuyers, expanded rental assistance, and by
    building more than 2 million homes.
-   President Biden would lower child care costs by guaranteeing child
    care for families making up to $200,000, with most families paying
    no more than $10 a day.

**Congressional Republicans have no plan to lower costs—in fact, their
plan would increase costs for North Carolinians by:**

-   Increasing costs for health care, prescription drugs, and insulin by
    siding with Big Pharma to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and
    Affordable Care Act and slash Medicare.
-   Cutting Social Security by $1.5 trillion and raising Medicare costs
    for seniors by transitioning Medicare to a system that would raise
    premiums.
-   Raising taxes for middle-class families by repealing the Inflation
    Reduction Act and Affordable Care Act.
-   Raising housing costs by cutting rental assistance and programs to
    build new homes.
