title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Senate Plans\
  \ to Vote on the Bipartisan Border Security\_Agreement"
---
 
From his first day in office, President Biden has called on Congress
to fix our broken immigration system. That’s why he introduced a
comprehensive immigration reform plan on day 1. And that’s why, earlier
this year, his Administration reached a bipartisan agreement on the
toughest and fairest set of reforms in decades.

This bipartisan border legislation would deliver the significant policy
changes, resources, and personnel needed to secure our border and make
our country safer. It would add thousands of additional Border Patrol
Agents and Customs and Border Protection personnel; it would invest in
technology to catch fentanyl and go after drug traffickers; add asylum
officers and immigration judgesto improve the adjudication of asylum
cases so they are resolved in a few months and not years; establish a
temporary emergency authority to shut down the border when the system is
overwhelmed; and expand access to lawful immigration pathways while
expediting access to work authorization for those eligible.

We strongly support this legislation and call on every Senator to put
partisan politics aside and vote to secure the border.
