title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Flooding in\_Brazil"
---
 
Jill and I are deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation
caused by the flooding in Brazil. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
people impacted by this tragedy and the first responders working to
rescue and provide medical care to families and individuals. My
administration is in contact with our Brazilian partners, and the United
States is working to provide necessary assistance to the Brazilian
people, in coordination with Brazilian authorities as they lead the
response. The United States stands with Brazil at this difficult time.
