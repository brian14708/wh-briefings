Today, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer spoke with
Papua New Guinea Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso to express condolences
for the tragic loss of life resulting from a landslide last week in
Papua New Guinea. Reiterating President Biden’s condolences in his
statement on May 24, Mr. Finer pledged continued support from the United
States, noting USAID contributions of emergency shelter, water,
sanitation, and other critical assistance being provided through the
International Organization for Migration to those affected by the
disaster, as well as USAID’s humanitarian expert working with government
officials and humanitarian organizations on the ground. Deputy Prime
Minister Rosso thanked Mr. Finer for the U.S. support, and provided
updates on the disaster response. The two discussed priority areas of
cooperation in the deepening U.S.-Papua New Guinea relationship,
including the Defense Cooperation agreement, energy resilience,
governance, and humanitarian assistance, and recognized the need to
accelerate the partnership further.
