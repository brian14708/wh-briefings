title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Confirming 200 Federal\_Judges"
---
 
Today, we reached another milestone in the effort to protect the
freedoms and liberties of all Americans: the confirmation of the
200<sup>th</sup> federal judge since I took office.  
   
These judges are exceptionally well-qualified. They come from every walk
of life, and collectively, they form the most diverse group of judicial
appointees ever put forward by a President – 64% are women and 62% are
people of color. Before their appointment to the bench, they worked in
every field of law—from labor lawyers fighting for working people to
civil rights lawyers fighting to protect the right to vote. And despite
differences in background and experience, they are all committed to
principles that are at the core of our democracy: independence, freedom,
and liberty.  
   
Judges matter. These men and women have the power to uphold basic rights
or to roll them back. They hear cases that decide whether women have the
freedom to make their own reproductive healthcare decisions; whether
Americans have the freedom to cast their ballots; whether workers have
the freedom to unionize and make a living wage for their families; and
whether children have the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean
water.  
   
I thank Leader Schumer, Chair Durbin, Democratic Senators, and
Republican Senators for their steadfast commitment to advancing these
judicial nominations. There is more work to do. Going forward, I will
continue my solemn responsibility of nominating individuals who have
excelled in their professional careers, who reflect the communities they
serve, and who apply the law impartially and without favoritism.
