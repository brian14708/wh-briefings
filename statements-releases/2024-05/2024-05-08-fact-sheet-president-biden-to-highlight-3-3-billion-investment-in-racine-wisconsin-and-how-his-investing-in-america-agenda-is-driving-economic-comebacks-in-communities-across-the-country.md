*Six years ago, the prior administration touted a $10 billion investment
by Foxconn that never materialized – now Microsoft will build a new AI
datacenter on the same land, powering industries of the future in
Wisconsin*  

Today, President Biden will travel to Racine, Wisconsin – the same
location as the failed Foxconn investment that the prior administration
visited six years ago – to showcase a community at the heart of his
commitment to invest in places that have been historically overlooked or
failed by the last administration’s policies. President Biden will
announce a $3.3 billion investment by Microsoft to build a new
artificial intelligence (AI) datacenter in Racine, creating 2,300 union
construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time. Microsoft will
also provide skilling opportunities for thousands more Wisconsinites in
the digital economy. The datacenter will be built on the same land as a
failed $10 billion investment from Taiwanese electronics manufacturer
Foxconn six years ago, which left behind Wisconsin residents and
workers.     
  
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is growing the economy
from the middle-out and bottom-up, giving Americans more breathing room,
and unleashing hundreds of billions of dollars of private sector
investment in industries of the future, including AI, clean energy,
semiconductors, and more. Breaking from failed trickle-down policies of
past administrations, President Biden’s agenda is bringing innovation
hubs to every corner of the country. President Biden is delivering on
his promise to create good jobs that will have a lasting impact on
communities and families.  
  
**Delivering on promises for Racine workers and families  
**  
From after the Civil War through the 1960s, manufacturing powered growth
in Racine, Wisconsin. At its peak, manufacturing employed roughly half
of Racine’s workforce, but over the years, trickle-down economics wore
that away. Manufacturers shut down and shipped jobs overseas.  
  
Six years ago, the prior administration touted a $10 billion investment
by Foxconn that would purportedly create 13,000 manufacturing jobs in
Racine. But after 100 homes and farms were bulldozed to make way for the
manufacturing plant and over $500 million in taxpayer dollars were
invested to prepare the site, no such investment materialized. Foxconn
abandoned plans to manufacture LCD screens in the state and created only
a fraction of the promised jobs. In fact, in the four years prior to
President Biden taking office, 1,000 manufacturing jobs left Racine, and
6,000 manufacturing jobs left Wisconsin.  
  
President Biden promised that unlike his predecessor, he wouldn’t leave
communities like Racine behind. Since President Biden took office,
nearly 4,000 jobs have been added in Racine – a third of them in
manufacturing — and 177,000 jobs have been added in Wisconsin. With new
business applications up 68% from pre-pandemic levels, Racine has
experienced some of the strongest new business growth in the state under
President Biden’s leadership. And, President Biden’s Investing in
America agenda is attracting industries of the future, investing in
workforce pipelines that leave no community behind, and helping Racine
power the AI and innovation economy.  
  
**Building an AI ecosystem in Wisconsin  
**  
On the land left vacant by Foxconn’s failed investment in Racine County,
Microsoft will invest $3.3 billion in a new datacenter. Microsoft is
committed to creating good-paying jobs with growth pathways and
comprehensive benefits such as paid family leave. Microsoft will pair
its datacenter investment with a commitment to investing in innovation
and workforce in Racine and statewide. Microsoft will partner with
Gateway Technical College to develop a Datacenter Academy that trains
1,000 Wisconsinites for datacenter and STEM roles by 2030, and will
employ up to 2,000 people in permanent roles at its Racine facility. 
And, Microsoft will build a Co-Innovation Lab in southeast Wisconsin, as
well as team up with the startup accelerator Gener8tor to train 1,000
business leaders to adopt AI in their operations, so that Wisconsin
manufacturers can seize AI’s promise. Together, these investments will
position the industrial heartland to lead the way in industries of the
future.  
  
President Biden has acted boldly to ensure America leads in AI
innovation, driven by communities like Racine. The President signed a
landmark Executive Order on AI last year that directed actions to
provide AI entrepreneurs access to technical assistance and resources,
help small businesses commercialize AI breakthroughs, and expand grants
for AI research in vital areas like healthcare and climate change. In
January, through the new Regional Innovation Engines (NSF Engines)
program, the Biden Administration announced 10 awards for place-based
research and development partnerships, including ones with a focus on
advancing AI. And, President Biden has taken bold steps to ensure
workers and organized labor are front and center in the growth and
development of AI. The President’s landmark Executive Order on AI
directed new protections for workers, including the release of
**guidance to assist federal contractors and employers with complying
with worker protection laws as they deploy AI in the workplace**. As
part of Microsoft’s efforts to build an AI ecosystem in Wisconsin, their
training programs will help introduce workers to AI skills and
technologies, helping them access and benefit from the AI economy.  
  
**Investing in Wisconsin and Investing in America**

Today’s announcement is part of President Biden’s broader effort to
invest in industries of the future and American workers in communities
across the country. Already, his Investing in America agenda has
unleashed $866 billion in private sector investments in clean energy and
manufacturing, and the Administration has announced 51,000
infrastructure projects across the country. These investments are
creating an environment where companies are building lasting
relationships in communities like Racine. Under the President’s agenda:

1.  The Department of Commerce designated the Wisconsin Biohealth Tech
    Hub as a Tech Hub under the CHIPS and Science Act. The Wisconsin
    Biohealth Tech Hub, serving the Madison and Milwaukee-Waukesha
    regions, aims to position Wisconsin as a global leader in
    personalized medicine, an emerging healthcare approach that tailors
    tests, treatments, and therapies informed by a patient’s unique
    genetic code, medical record, and environment.  
2.  Milwaukee has been named an Investing in America Workforce Hub—an
    initiative to bring together state and local elected officials,
    community leaders, and federal staff to drive evidence-based
    partnerships for place-based workforce development programs.  
3.  Wisconsin has received $6.9 billion from the President’s Investing
    in America agenda for infrastructure and clean energy. That includes
    $1.06 billion to replace the Blatnik Bridge — a 1.5-mile-long bridge
    that connects Duluth, MN and Superior, WI that cannot currently
    carry large or heavy trucks, causing lengthy detours for regional
    freight — $1.6 billion to deliver internet to everyone in Wisconsin,
    and $811 million to provide clean water across Wisconsin.  
4.  The Grow Milwaukee Coalition was selected as one of 22 finalists for
    the Department of Commerce Recompete Distressed Area Pilot Program
    to invest in revitalizing Milwaukee’s historic 30th Street
    Industrial Corridor and connecting the historically segregated Black
    community to economic opportunity across the city. Grow Milwaukee
    will compete for $190 million in total funding for locally-led
    economic development plans.  
5.  Wisconsin has seen an influx of investments from industries of the
    future, including clean energy and advanced manufacturing.  
    1.  Last summer, thanks to President Biden’s Made in America
        policies and commitment to ensure internet access for all
        Americans by 2030, Nokia announced a new partnership with
        Sanmina Corporation to create 200 jobs and manufacture
        fiber-optic broadband electronics in the United States for the
        first time in the company’s history. The investment was in part
        spurred by the Biden-Harris Administration’s investment of $1.1
        billion to connect every home and business in Wisconsin to
        high-speed internet through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  
    2.  Ingeteam, a clean energy manufacturing company with a plant in
        Milwaukee, will begin manufacturing electric vehicle fast
        chargers this year, driven by the Made in America requirements
        for U.S.-made EV charging infrastructure funded by the
        Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

**Giving Racine families breathing room  
**  
In addition to keeping his promise to leave no community behind,
President Biden’s agenda is lowering costs for working families in
Racine and across Wisconsin, including by:

1.  Saving [426,000 Wisconsin
    families](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wisconsin-ACP-Fact-Sheet.pdf)
    $30–75 per month on their internet bills thanks to the Affordable
    Connectivity Program, which Republicans in Congress need to extend
    this month so these families’ internet bills do not increase.  
2.  Saving customers of a [Milwaukee-based utility
    company](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/16/fact-sheet-one-year-in-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act-is-driving-historic-climate-action-and-investing-in-america-to-create-good-paying-jobs-and-reduce-costs/)
    around $2 billion on utility bills thanks to an investment in clean
    energy.  
3.  Saving 1.3 million Wisconsin Medicare beneficiaries money on
    prescription drugs, insulin, and vaccines.  
4.  Saving 266,000 people in Wisconsin hundreds of dollars per year on
    health insurance.  
5.  Canceling student debt for [44,000 borrowers in
    Wisconsin](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Wisconsin-4.12.pdf),
    and announcing in Madison new plans to provide debt relief to [over
    30 million
    Americans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/08/president-joe-biden-outlines-new-plans-to-deliver-student-debt-relief-to-over-30-million-americans-under-the-biden-harris-administration/).  
6.  President Biden would lower housing costs by building more than 2
    million homes.

Congressional Republicans have no plan to lower costs. In fact, their
plan raises cost for working families in Wisconsin by:

1.  Increasing costs for health care, prescription drugs, and insulin by
    repealing the Inflation Reduction Act and Affordable Care Act and
    slash Medicare.  
2.  Increasing utility bills and energy costs by repealing the Inflation
    Reduction Act.  
3.  Cutting Social Security by $1.5 trillion and raising Medicare costs
    for seniors.  
4.  Raising taxes for middle-class families by repealing the Inflation
    Reduction Act and Affordable Care Act.  
5.  Raising housing costs by cutting rental assistance and programs to
    build new homes.  
6.  Repealing the Biden-Harris Administration’s SAVE Plan, which is
    helping millions of Americans save money on their monthly student
    loan payments.
