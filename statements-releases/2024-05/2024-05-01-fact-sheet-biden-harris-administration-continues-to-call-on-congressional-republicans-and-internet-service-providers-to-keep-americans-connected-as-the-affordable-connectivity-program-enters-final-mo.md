title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Continues to Call on Congressional\
  \ Republicans and Internet Service Providers to Keep Americans Connected as the\
  \ Affordable Connectivity Program Enters Final\_Month"
---
 
As part of the President’s Investing in America agenda, a key component
of Bidenomics, the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic
progress towards lowering costs – including internet costs – for
American families across the country. The Affordable Connectivity
Program, enacted under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law as the largest
internet affordability program in our nation’s history, has helped 23
million households save on their monthly internet bills. **Today, May
1<sup>st</sup>, begins the final month that Affordable Connectivity
Program households will receive *any* benefit on their internet bills.
Without Congressional action to extend funding for the program, millions
of Americans will see their internet bills go up or lose internet access
at the end of this month. President Biden is once again calling on
Republicans in Congress to join their Democratic colleagues in support
of extending funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program, so tens of
millions of Americans can continue to access this essential benefit.**

Losing the monthly Affordable Connectivity Program benefit will have
drastic, meaningful impacts on American households, according to survey
data collected by the Federal Communications Commission. More than
**three-quarters of surveyed ACP households** say losing their ACP
benefit would disrupt their service by making them change their plan or
drop internet service entirely. More than **two thirds of households**
had inconsistent internet service or no internet service at all prior to
ACP, and this number is even higher for surveyed households residing in
rural areas. These respondents also reported that ACP has enabled them
to schedule or attend healthcare appoints, apply for jobs, complete
work, and do schoolwork.

During the month of May, as funding for the Affordable Connectivity
Program runs out, millions of households will receive only a partial
subsidy on their internet bills and some will receive no discount at all
if their provider opts out of the partial benefit.

**At this crucial time, the White House is encouraging providers to take
steps to keep their consumers connected by offering low-cost or no-cost
plans or providing discounts.**

On October 25, 2023, President Biden sent Congress a [supplemental
request](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Summary-of-Funding-Request-to-Meet-Critical-Needs.pdf) for
$6 billion to extend funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program.
Despite that request, Republicans in Congress have failed to act.
Without action from Republicans in Congress, this program will sunset at
the end of May and tens of millions of Americans may no longer be able
to afford high-speed internet service. It is time for Republicans in
Congress to step up for families across the country.

See below for the state-by-state breakdown of the number of households
that will see a $30 or $75 per month increase on their internet bill if
Congressional Republicans fail to extend funding for the Affordable
Connectivity Program. This breakdown includes estimates of percentages
of households enrolled in ACP in every Congressional District.
