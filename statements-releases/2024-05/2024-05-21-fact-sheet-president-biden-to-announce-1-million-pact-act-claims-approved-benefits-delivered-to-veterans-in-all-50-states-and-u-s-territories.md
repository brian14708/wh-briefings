title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden to Announce 1 Million PACT Act Claims Approved,\
  \ Benefits Delivered to Veterans in all 50 States and U.S.\_Territories"
---
 
President Biden signed the landmark bipartisan Sergeant First Class
Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics
(PACT) Act into law in August 2022, enacting the most significant
expansion of benefits and services for toxic exposed veterans in more
than 30 years.  Named in honor of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, a
decorated combat medic who died from a rare form of lung cancer, this
historic legislation is delivering timely benefits and services to
veterans—across all generations—who have been impacted by toxic
exposures while serving our country.  
  
**Thanks to this transformational law, the President will announce that
more than 1 million PACT Act related claims have now been granted.  More
than 888,000 veterans and survivors across all 50 states and U.S.
territories are now receiving new service-connected disability
benefits.**  
   
President Biden believes that our nation has a sacred obligation to
properly prepare and equip the troops we send into harm’s way – and to
care for them and their families when they return home. Sometimes
military service can result in increased health risks for our veterans,
and some injuries and illnesses like asthma, cancer, and others can take
years to manifest. These realities can make it difficult for veterans to
establish a direct connection between their service and disabilities
resulting from military environmental exposures such as burn pits – a
necessary step to ensure they receive the disability benefits and health
care they earned. The PACT Act eliminated these barriers and ensures
veterans get the care and services they deserve.  
  
President Biden has made clear that supporting our veterans is a
commitment that unites all Americans – Democrats, Republicans, and
Independents — and it’s why he made supporting our veterans a core
element of his Unity Agenda. Under President Biden’s leadership, the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has processed claims at the fastest
rate in history, and is delivering health care to more veterans than
ever before. Today, to mark a key milestone in this effort, the
President will join veterans and their families at the Westwood Park
YMCA in Nashua, New Hampshire to discuss how the historic PACT Act has
delivered lifesaving health care and benefits to more than 888,000
veterans and survivors.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will also release new national
and state-by-state data on PACT Act claims granted.   
   
The Administration has helped veterans in every state and
territory receive the services and care they deserve by:

-   **Screening veterans for toxic exposures:** More than 5.4 million
    veterans have received free screenings for toxic exposures from VA
    under the PACT Act – a critical step to catching and treating
    potentially life-threatening health conditions as early as
    possible.  
-   **Delivering benefits to veterans and their survivors:** Since
    enactment, VA has delivered more than $5.7 billion in earned PACT
    Act-related benefits to veterans and their survivors. VA is
    delivering these benefits to veterans at the fastest rate in
    history, processing 1.57 million total claims thus far in this
    fiscal year – 28% more year-to-date than the previous all-time
    record. In total, VA has processed 1,327,228 PACT Act claims since
    August 10, 2022.  
-   **Prioritizing veterans with cancer:** As a part of President
    Biden’s Cancer Moonshot, VA has prioritized claims processing for
    veterans with cancer – delivering nearly $637 million in PACT Act
    benefits to veterans with cancer. VA also prioritizes claims for
    veterans with terminal illnesses and veterans experiencing
    homelessness.  
-   **Spreading the word to veterans and their survivors:** Thanks to
    the PACT Act outreach campaign, veterans and survivors are applying
    for their earned benefits at record rates. Since August 2022,
    veterans and survivors have submitted 4.17 million total claims.
    This includes 1,655,810 PACT Act-specific claims applications.  
-   **Increasing VA’s capacity to serve veterans:** Thanks to new PACT
    Act authorities, VA has been able to expand its workforce in order
    to serve veterans as quickly and effectively as possible. In total,
    both the Veterans Health Administration and the Veterans Benefits
    administration have achieved their highest growth rates in 20
    years.  
-   **Eliminating benefits delays for veterans:** Instead of phasing in
    conditions over several years (as outlined in the legislation), the
    Biden-Harris Administration decided to make all conditions in the
    PACT Act presumptive for benefits as of August 10, 2022, the day the
    bill was signed into law. This decision expedited the timeline for
    veterans to receive their earned care and benefits by several
    years.  
-   **Accelerating health care eligibility for veterans:** As of March
    2024, VA opened up eligibility for toxic exposed veterans to enroll
    in VA Health Care without first having to prove a service-connected
    disability and regardless of their deployment location, nearly ten
    years earlier than called for in the PACT Act. Thanks to new PACT
    Act eligibility, more than 145,000 veterans have newly enrolled in
    VA Health Care since August 10, 2022.

These historic efforts to address military toxic exposures build on the
Biden-Harris Administration’s recent work to support our nation’s
veterans, including:

-   Ending veteran homelessness. No one should be homeless in this
    country, especially not those who served it. That’s why President
    Biden is proposing a guaranteed voucher for extremely low-income
    veterans, a population at especially high risk of homelessness. Last
    year, VA found permanent housing for over 46,000 veterans, expanded
    access to health care for homeless Veterans, expanded access to
    legal assistance for homeless Veterans, helped more than 145,000
    Veterans and their families retain their homes or otherwise avoid
    foreclosure, and awarded more than $1 billion in grant funding to
    help homeless Veterans. These efforts are leading to results: from
    2020 to 2023, there was a nearly 5 percent decline in veteran
    homelessness. And, tomorrow, Dallas will announce that it has
    effectively ended veteran homelessness.  
-   Securing jobs for our veterans. Roughly 200,000 service members
    transition from the military each year and the Biden-Harris
    Administration is committed to providing them and their spouses the
    support they need to find good paying jobs. This includes helping
    connect veterans to registered apprentice programs, so they can
    transfer the skills they learned in the military.  
-   Removing barriers to mental health care. Next week, VA will take
    action to remove all cost-sharing for the first three behavioral
    health visits for veterans enrolled in VA health care, helping to
    ensure that all those in need can get the care they need. This
    action builds on VA’s new policy allowing eligible veterans and
    certain former service members in acute suicidal crisis to go to any
    VA or non-VA health care facility for no-cost emergency health care
    – over 50,000 veterans and service members have used this benefit
    since it launched in 2023. VA is doing everything it can, including
    expanding mental health screenings, increasing access to legal and
    financial support, and hiring more mental health professionals, to
    help veterans get the help they need. For veterans and family
    members who may be experiencing a crisis, the Veterans Crisis
    Line is available 24/7 by dialing 988 and then pressing 1.  
-   Supporting veterans and caregivers. Last year, President Biden
    signed an Executive Order directing the VA to cut red tape and give
    veterans who need assistance at home more flexibility to pick their
    own caregivers. As part of those actions, VA also launched a pilot
    program, known as the Virtual Psychotherapy Program for Caregivers,
    to provide mental health counseling services to family caregivers
    caring for our nation’s heroes. The program successfully completed
    its pilot phase and is now a permanent program. Since October 2023,
    the program has provided over 4,937 psychotherapy sessions to family
    caregivers. And, last year, President Biden signed an Executive
    Order calling for the most comprehensive set of administrative
    actions in our nation’s history to support the economic security of
    military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors.
