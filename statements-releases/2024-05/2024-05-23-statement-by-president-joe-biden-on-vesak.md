Jill and I extend warm wishes to Buddhists in the United States and
around the world as they celebrate Vesak. As we honor the birth,
passing, and enlightenment of Buddha, we recognize the American
Buddhists who contribute so much to our communities and our country. For
over 2,500 years, those who adhere to the Buddha’s teachings have
enriched and strengthened this world we share. Vesak is a time to
reflect on the Buddha’s teachings, including the need to work for peace
and justice, and cultivate humility and compassion as we work together
towards a brighter future.
