title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the April Jobs\_Report"
---
 
With today’s report of 175,000 new jobs, the great American comeback
continues. When I took office, I inherited an economy on the brink, with
the worst economic crisis in a century. I had a plan to turn our country
around and build our economy from the middle out and the bottom up. Now
we are seeing that plan in action, with well over 15 million jobs
created since I took office, working-age women employed at a record high
rate, wages rising faster than prices, and unemployment below 4 percent
for a record 27 months in a row.

There’s more work to do. I have a plan to lower the cost of rent and
homeownership by building 2 million homes; to cut taxes for middle-class
families and American workers; and to continue making health care,
prescription drugs, inhalers, and insulin more affordable. Congressional
Republicans have a different vision. They are fighting to slash taxes on
billionaires and let special interests rip off Americans. I will keep
fighting for the middle class and hardworking families I grew up
with—for Scranton, not Park Avenue.
