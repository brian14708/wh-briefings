title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Historic Union Contract in\_Georgia"
---
 
Congratulations to members of the United Steelworkers and to Blue Bird
for proving once again that meeting our clean energy goals is an
opportunity to create good-paying union jobs for American workers. Last
year, I was excited to meet with Delushundra “Dee” Thomas, who helped
organize these workers. Their new contract is a lifechanging agreement
that includes raises, retirement and profit sharing for 1,500
Georgians.  
   
When I think about climate, I think about jobs—good-paying, union jobs.
My Investing in America agenda provided the grants that are helping put
Georgians to work building these electric school buses. I’m grateful to
Secretary Su for working alongside the United Steelworkers and Blue Bird
in their collective bargaining process to make sure their contract
creates good, union jobs and helps workers and the company thrive.  
   
When we invest in American workers, we all win. Congratulations to the
Steelworkers at Blue Bird, whose new contract will improve the lives of
over 1,500 Georgians for years to come.
