---
 
President Biden welcomed Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to the White
House today to celebrate Romania’s 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary as a
member of the NATO Alliance. President Biden thanked Romania for
graciously hosting U.S. servicemembers and for its commitment to
security in NATO’s Eastern Flank, including in the Black Sea region.
President Biden applauded Romania’s defense investments, which
have consistently exceeded its NATO pledge to spend at least 2 percent
of its GDP on defense. The leaders reaffirmed their steadfast support
for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s senseless aggression,
and President Biden expressed his appreciation for Romania’s support to
Ukrainian refugees and efforts to move Ukrainian grain to market.

Both leaders agreed that bilateral cooperation on energy security is
critical. They noted this is one of many areas of our growing economic
and commercial relationship.
