title: The Nairobi-Washington Vision
---
 
We, the leaders of the United States and Kenya, are determined to lead a
global transition to the economies of the future. We share a common
vision for sustainable development and prosperity.  We are determined to
lead a global coalition to accelerate investments toward clean and
resilient economies and supply chains and to provide a better future for
our people. Investment is critical for the United States and other
advanced economies, and it is equally critical for Kenya and countries
around the world to succeed in achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals, bringing benefits to the entire world.

Mounting debt burdens, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the food
insecurity crisis fueled by Russia’s war against Ukraine, have put these
critical investments out of reach for too many developing countries.
More than half of low-income countries are now at high risk of or in
debt distress. In fact, a growing number of developing countries’ debt
payments to the rest of the world are greater than what they are
receiving in new financing.  As a result, many countries are facing
difficult choices between paying back creditors and making critical
investments in their economy and people—like vaccinating children,
building more resilient and sustainable food systems, and addressing the
damaging effects of climate change. 

Even countries like Kenya which are showing strong signs of economic
recovery and investor confidence are allocating a large share of tax
revenues on external debt service payments.  In cases like Kenya’s, the
macroeconomic outlook is encouraging, but access to international
financial markets has been limited, with funding too expensive which
worsens the public debt burden.  It is important that the world use all
tools in the international financial architecture to create fiscal space
and enhance the ability for countries to make critical investments.

Today, we are jointly calling for bold action from the international
community to expand support for developing countries to invest in their
futures. Countries willing to commit to ambitious reforms and
high-quality plans for investments in sustainable development and in
addressing global challenges like climate change, pandemics and health
threats, and fragility and conflict should be buoyed not abandoned by
the international community to meet these ambitions. Our shared vision
not only looks to offer a better deal for such countries today but also
to help build for more resilient and inclusive economies going forward.

Specifically, the *Nairobi-Washington Vision* brings together the
following elements:      

-   **<u>High-ambition countries receive high-ambition financial
    support.</u>** Countries with high ambition with respect to
    investments in their own development, addressing cross-border
    challenges like the clean energy transition and strengthening health
    systems to be better prepared to respond to the next pandemic, and
    undertaking economic reforms to make these investments sustainable
    are met by high ambition from international financial institutions,
    including the IMF and World Bank, and from official bilateral
    creditors.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>International financial institutions step up with coordinated
    packages of support so high ambition countries don’t have to choose
    between servicing their debts and making necessary investments in
    their futures.</u>** International financial institutions ensure
    their programs account for the fiscal space high-ambition countries
    require for needed investment. Together, the IMF and MDBs deliver
    enhanced, coordinated support packages that capitalize on new and
    expanded resources, including by maximizing the right mix of
    financing; scaling up concessional financing with stepped-up support
    from donors; and fully utilizing sustainability-focused funds, the
    broader climate finance architecture, and other pools of
    concessional finance.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Creditor countries provide reprieves for high-ambition
    developing countries.</u> ** Official bilateral creditors pledge to
    sustain positive net inflows by offering debt suspensions,
    reprofilings or restructurings, or new budget-support flows as
    necessitated by countries’ debt sustainability and investment needs.
    Free-riding from individual creditors who get paid back from
    multilateral support should come to an end, and the IMF should
    enforce this norm as well as equitable treatment more broadly with
    its policies, including lending into official arrears. Creditor
    countries should also maximize their use of grant and development
    finance institution flows to support countries’ development and
    climate needs.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>New tools facilitate private sector finance on better
    terms.</u>** MDBs and national development finance institutions
    (DFIs) provide incentives to private sector creditors to replace or
    refinance high-cost private sector sovereign loans and debt with
    lower-cost, longer-term, and more transparent and resilient debt.
    This includes by expanding access to debt guarantees and by creating
    safe harbors for countries that proactively and voluntarily manage
    debt burdens, such as through new concessional finance, debt swaps,
    and debt conversions.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Transparent, sustainable, and resilient financing replaces
    opaque and unsustainable lending.</u>** For example, all creditors
    should adopt clauses to automatically provide sovereign debt service
    suspension when debtor countries experience climate-related
    disasters. Non-disclosure agreements that keep citizens and their
    creditors in the dark about the terms of sovereign lending should no
    longer be used.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Enhanced support crowds in private investment.</u>** Private
    sector-focused MDBs and bilateral official creditors, including
    through DFIs, enhance support for private investments in sustainable
    finance by scaling up vehicles that help mobilize private capital
    and deepen local capital markets. Through these and other tools, the
    private sector is incentivized to expand their portfolio for
    climate-related development finance in emerging economies.
