National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met yesterday with Foreign

at the White House to reaffirm the strong partnership between our two
countries.   
   
The National Security Advisor recognized President Milei’s ongoing
efforts to stabilize Argentina’s economy and reviewed areas where the
United States and Argentina can strengthen their economic cooperation,
including on mobilizing private sector investment in Argentina’s clean
energy and technology sectors. The National Security Advisor also
congratulated Argentina on the recent purchase of F-16s from Denmark,
and discussed further opportunities to deepen our security and defense
partnership.   
   
Additionally, they discussed ways to bolster cooperation to address
important regional and global challenges, including ongoing efforts to
increase humanitarian aid to Gaza and secure a ceasefire and hostage
deal that would bring hostages home, including those from the United
States and Argentina. National Security Advisor Sullivan thanked
Argentina for speaking out to support democracy in Venezuela and
condemn Russia’s war against Ukraine.
