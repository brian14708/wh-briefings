  \ Solar Manufacturing and Protect Manufacturers and Workers from China\u2019s Unfair\
  \ Trade\_Practices"
---
 
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has catalyzed an American
clean energy manufacturing and deployment boom. Through the President’s
Inflation Reduction Act, incentives for manufacturing and deployment of
clean energy, including incentives for domestically-manufactured solar
products, have driven a historic surge in solar installations and
announcements of new U.S. solar module and component manufacturing. The
silicon solar cell was invented and demonstrated in the U.S. at Bell
Labs in 1956, and the U.S. led the world in solar innovation and
manufacturing for decades. China’s anticompetitive subsidization and
trade practices, however, decimated the U.S. solar manufacturing
industry in the 2000s and 2010s. Recently, as solar manufacturing has
made a comeback in the U.S. thanks to President Biden’s leadership,
China has further ramped up solar overcapacity, dumping artificially
cheap modules and components onto the global market and circumventing
trade enforcement measures in an attempt to put other countries’
manufacturers out of business.  
   
Since President Biden took office, companies have announced more than
$17 billion and 335 gigawatts of manufacturing investment throughout the
solar supply chain, with enough announced investment in solar modules to
power 18 million homes. Announced solar module manufacturing capacity
has grown to more than 125 gigawatts, compared to 7 gigawatts of
manufacturing capacity before passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.
American manufacturing is powering a boom in solar deployment, which has
doubled since President Biden took office and reached record highs last
year, with 32.4 gigawatts of solar capacity installed in 2023, a more
than 50 percent increase over 2022 installations.  
   
President Biden believes that American workers and manufacturers can
compete with anyone—as long as the competition is fair. Earlier this
week, the Biden-Harris Administration directed the U.S. Trade
Representative Katherine Tai to increase tariffs under Section 301 of
the Trade Act of 1974 on $18 billion of imports from China to protect
American workers and businesses – including by doubling the tariff rate
on solar cells and modules from 25% to 50%.  
   
**<u>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to
strengthen American solar manufacturing and protect businesses and
workers from China’s unfair trade actions:</u>**

-   **Removal of the bifacial module exclusion under Section 201.**
    Bifacial solar panels generally used in utility-scale solar projects
    are not currently subject to safeguard tariffs under Section 201 of
    the Trade Act of 1974. Since this exclusion was implemented by the
    previous Administration, imports of bifacial panels have surged, now
    making up nearly all U.S. solar panel imports and undercutting the
    effectiveness of the Section 201 safeguard. Today, the Biden-Harris
    Administration is announcing that it plans to imminently remove this
    exclusion, which will offer U.S. solar manufacturers increased
    Section 201 tariff protection from unfair imports. Importers with
    pre-existing contracts for bifacial solar modules to be delivered
    within 90 days of the removal of the exclusion will be able to
    certify those contracts to continue using the exclusion for that
    period.  
-   **Ending the solar bridge and cracking down on stockpiling.** In
    June 2022, President Biden initiated a temporary, 24-month bridge to
    facilitate certain imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and
    Vietnam duty-free to ensure robust deployment while the domestic
    solar manufacturing base ramped up. Since then, U.S. solar
    manufacturing and deployment have both grown dramatically. As the
    President has previously committed, the bridge will end as scheduled
    on June 6, 2024, and producers in Southeast Asia that have been
    found to be circumventing antidumping and countervailing duties on
    solar manufacturers from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) will
    be subject to those duties. Additionally, in implementing the solar
    bridge, the Department of Commerce requires that panels imported
    duty-free must be installed within 180 days to prevent stockpiling.
    Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has announced that it will
    vigorously enforce this provision, including by requiring importers
    to provide to CBP a certification of solar module utilization with
    detailed information about the modules being deployed.

-   **Monitoring import surges and oversupply.** Imports of solar
    modules from Southeast Asia, where PRC manufacturers have been found
    to be circumventing antidumping and countervailing duties, have
    surged over the last year. PRC companies have recently built new
    capacity in these countries, targeting the U.S. market. The
    Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce will closely
    monitor import patterns to ensure the U.S. market does not become
    oversaturated and will explore all available measures to take action
    against unfair practices.

<!-- -->

-   **Providing additional guidance on the domestic content bonus.** The
    Inflation Reduction Act contains a bonus tax credit available to
    developers of clean energy projects that meet certain statutory
    requirements for sourcing iron and steel products and manufactured
    products from domestic producers. Today, the Department of Treasury
    is issuing further guidance concerning the domestic content bonus to
    enable more clean energy developers and manufacturers in the U.S. to
    take advantage of the bonus. While the domestic content bonus is
    already driving partnerships between developers and manufacturers in
    the U.S., stakeholders have raised concerns about challenges in
    determining eligibility. Today’s Notice creates a new elective safe
    harbor that gives clean energy developers the option of relying on
    Department of Energy-provided default cost percentages to determine
    bonus eligibility. Treasury and IRS continue to consider stakeholder
    comments and plan to issue further domestic content guidance to
    address issues not in the scope of this guidance, including adding
    further sectors, including offshore wind, to the new elective safe
    harbor table and issuing proposed rules for projects using elective
    pay (sometimes referred to as direct pay). In particular, Treasury
    and IRS, with DOE and other agencies, continue to evaluate potential
    options to further the IRA’s goal of incentivizing U.S. solar
    manufacturing, including solar wafer production.

-   **Supporting technology development to onshore solar wafer and cell
    manufacturing.** The Department of Energy is announcing more than
    $70 million in research and development selections to seed new
    technologies across the solar supply chain. Funding from the
    President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will enable new entrants
    to the solar manufacturing market to establish their technologies
    and access more capital. The 18 selected projects will [address gaps
    in the domestic solar manufacturing supply
    chain](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/silicon-solar-manufacturing-and-dual-use-photovoltaics-incubator-funding-program),
    including equipment, ingots and wafers, and silicon and [thin-film
    solar cell
    manufacturing](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/advancing-us-thin-film-solar-photovoltaics-funding-program),
    and open new markets for solar technologies like
    integrated-photovoltaics and agrivoltaics.

<!-- -->

-   **Managing the tariff-rate quota for solar cells under Section 201
    to support expanded solar manufacturing.** Currently, there is a
    5-gigawatt tariff-rate quota for imported solar cells under
    Section 201. The Administration will closely monitor the level of
    imported solar cells used to manufacture panels in the U.S. and will
    work to raise the quota by 7.5-gigawatts if imports approach the
    current quota level, to ensure domestic module manufacturing
    continues to grow while manufacturers scale production throughout
    the supply chain.

**<u>These actions follow a series of Biden-Harris Administration
initiatives to support solar manufacturing and deployment.</u>**

-   **$7 billion in selections for Solar for All grants.** In April, the
    Environmental Protection Agency announced grantees for its Solar for
    All competition under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created by
    President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Solar for All grantees
    will serve all 50 states and the U.S. territories, as well as Tribal
    nations, to expand cost-cutting residential solar solutions to at
    least 900,000 low-income households and save families an average of
    $400 per year on their utility bills.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanded eligibility for Energy Communities bonus credit**. In
    March, the Department of Treasury and the IRS issued additional
    guidance for the bonus credit, created by the Inflation Reduction
    Act, for clean energy generation projects placed in service in
    communities that have historically been reliant on fossil fuel jobs.
    The additional guidance extends bonus eligibility to areas of the
    country where there are approximately 100 more planned utility-scale
    solar projects, helping to drive greater future clean energy
    investment into energy communities.

<!-- -->

-   **Support for solar component manufacturing.** In April, the
    Department of Energy released information provided by recipients of
    48C Advanced Energy Projects credits who voluntarily consented to
    have their project details shared publicly. Out of $4 billion in
    allocations, projects representing approximately $1.9 billion in
    allocations volunteered to have [information
    shared](https://www.energy.gov/mesc/applicant-self-disclosed-48c-projects),
    including Highland Materials, Inc., which received $255.6 million to
    produce solar-grade polysilicon in Tennessee’s coal country and
    SOLARCYCLE, Inc., which received $64 million to produce solar glass
    in Georgia. The second round of $6 billion in 48C funding is
    currently [open for
    applications](https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/qualifying-advanced-energy-project-credit-48c-program).

   
**Developing solar energy on America’s public lands**. In April, the
Department of the Interior [finalized
regulations](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-delivers-historic-milestones-new-actions-clean-energy)
that will ensure America’s public lands play a vital role in the clean
energy economy by lowering the cost of developing solar and wind
projects and improving permitting application processes for renewable
energy projects. The Department also announced that more than 10
gigawatts of clean energy are currently being generated on public lands
with the completion of two new solar projects, and that the
Administration has surpassed its target to permit at least 25 gigawatts
of clean energy by 2025 – enough clean energy to power more than 12
million homes across the country.
