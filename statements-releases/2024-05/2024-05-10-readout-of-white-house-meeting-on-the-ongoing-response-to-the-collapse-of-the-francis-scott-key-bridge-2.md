  \ the Francis Scott Key\_Bridge"

Today, senior officials from the White House, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, Federal
Highway Administration, and Office of the Assistant Secretary of the
Army for Civil Works met with Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Maryland
Secretary of Transportation Paul Wiedefeld to discuss progress and
continued collaboration in response to the collapse of the Francis Scott
Key Bridge in Baltimore.

The White House underscored President Biden’s commitment to stand with
Baltimore every step of the way in this recovery. White House officials
thanked participants for the collaboration and partnership between teams
at the federal and state level. The meeting focused on updates on
removing wreckage from the channel, supporting impacted workers and the
families of the victims, reopening the port to vessel traffic, and
rebuilding the bridge.

The group discussed progress towards fully reopening the federal
shipping channel by the end of May, including the next major milestone
of removing the cargo ship M/V DALI next week. Participants discussed
ongoing engagement with port stakeholders to ensure a safe and orderly
return of maritime traffic as one-way and then two-way traffic is
restored at the full 50-foot depth. The group also discussed efforts to
support impacted workers and businesses through state and federal
programs, and the group’s shared support for the families of workers who
lost their lives in the bridge collapse. Participants also highlighted
efforts at the state and federal level to ensure a rapid rebuild of the
bridge.  The White House will continue to work in lockstep with state
and federal partners to minimize the impacts of the devastating collapse
and to support affected communities.
