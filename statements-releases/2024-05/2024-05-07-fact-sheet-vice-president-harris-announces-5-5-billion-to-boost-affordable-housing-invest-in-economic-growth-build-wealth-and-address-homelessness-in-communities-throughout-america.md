title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces $5.5 Billion to Boost Affordable\
  \ Housing, Invest in Economic Growth, Build Wealth, and Address Homelessness in\
  \ Communities Throughout\_America"
---
 
*Announced after the first two stops of the Vice President’s nationwide
Economic Opportunity Tour, the new funding to 1,200 communities will
build and preserve homes, lower housing costs, support renters and
homeowners, aid people experiencing homelessness, create jobs, and
improve public facilities and community resilience.*

Today, Vice President Harris announced new funding to boost affordable
housing, invest in economic growth, build wealth, and address
homelessness across America. This funding is through the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  
  
President Biden and Vice President Harris are working to lower housing
costs and increase the housing supply to address the large shortage of
affordable homes they inherited from their predecessor, while investing
historic resources to prevent and end homelessness. In President Biden’s
State of the Union address, he called on Congress to support the
construction and rehabilitation of two million additional homes, lower
costs for renters, and help first time homebuyers and families seeking
to trade up or downsize.  
  
Yesterday, Vice President Harris was in Detroit, MI for the second stop
on her nationwide Economic Opportunity Tour. During
her [speech](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/06/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-during-the-nationwide-economic-opportunity-tour/),
the Vice President highlighted the Administration’s plan to cut housing
costs, boost supply, and expand access to affordable housing. She also
discussed the Administration’s work to address racial bias in home
appraisals.

Today, the Vice President announced a crucial infusion of funds to
address the country’s critical housing needs: $5.5 billion in grants to
1,200 communities through more than 2,400 grants to states, cities, DC,
Puerto Rico, and local organizations across the country. These grants
build on ongoing efforts by the Administration, the [White House Housing
Supply Action
Plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/) and
the [Blueprint for a Renters Bill of
Rights](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-House-Blueprint-for-a-Renters-Bill-of-Rights.pdf),
boost housing supply, lower housing costs, expand rental assistance,
enhance renter protections, and invest in stronger, more resilient
communities for all.       

“Homeownership is an essential part of the American Dream that
represents so much more than a roof over our heads. For people all
across our nation, a home represents financial security, the opportunity
to build wealth and equity, and a foundation for a better future for
themselves, their children, and future generations,” **said Vice
President Harris.** “That is why President Biden and I are expanding on
our historic investments in housing by announcing $5.5 billion that will
increase access to affordable housing, invest in economic growth, and
address homelessness in communities throughout America. This funding
will build more affordable homes and support renters and homeowners
while also lowering costs, building wealth, and creating jobs.”  
  
“A coordinated whole-of-community approach is crucial to build strong
and resilient communities, invest in decent housing, create healthy
environments, expand economic opportunities accessible to low-income
households, and support aspiring homebuyers and those experiencing
homelessness,” **said Acting HUD Secretary Adrianne Todman.** “The
funding made available today serves as building blocks to empower
communities to take ownership of community development investments and
put the needs of residents first.”  
  
These funds will be provided through the following HUD programs:  

-   **$1.3 billion to 668 grantees to build affordable housing** — The
    HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) is the primary Federal
    block grant that helps States and local governments to produce
    affordable rental and owner-occupied housing for low-income
    families. HOME funds a wide range of activities including building,
    buying, and/or rehabilitating affordable housing for rent or
    homeownership or providing direct rental assistance to low-income
    people. HOME projects leverage non-federal funds including, in many
    cases, tax credits for affordable rental housing. In 2023 the
    program helped create over 13,000 units of housing and more than
    13,000 households were assisted with tenant based rental assistance
    through the HOME program.  
-   **$214 million to every state to increase affordable housing supply
    –** The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) is an affordable housing production
    program that complements existing Federal, state and local efforts
    to increase and preserve the supply of decent, safe, and sanitary
    affordable housing for extremely low- and very low-income
    households, including families experiencing homelessness. HTF is a
    formula-based program for States and U.S. Territories. By law, each
    state is allocated a minimum of $3 million. In 2023, the program
    helped create more than 1,681 units of affordable rental housing for
    extremely low-income households.  
-   **$3.3 billion to 1,254 grantees to build stronger communities** —
    The Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) provide annual grants
    on a formula basis to States, cities, counties, and insular areas to
    develop stronger, more resilient communities by providing decent
    housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic
    opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income people. In
    2023 the program helped over 62,000 families through housing
    activities, 25,500 individuals through job creation or retention,
    52,000 people experiencing homelessness through improvements to
    homelessness facilities, over 5.4 million people through public
    services, and over 41.8 million people through through public
    improvements.
-   **$455 million to 130 grantees to connect people with HIV/AIDS to
    housing and support** — The Housing Opportunities for Persons With
    HIV/AIDS (HOPWA) program provides stable and permanent housing
    assistance and supportive services to low-income people living with
    Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Over 100,000 households receive
    HOPWA housing assistance and/or supportive services annually.  
-   **$290 million to 357 grantees to address homelessness** — Emergency
    Solutions Grants (ESG) provide funds for homeless shelters, assist
    in the operation of local shelters, and funds related social service
    and homeless prevention programs. ESG funds may be used for street
    outreach, emergency shelter, homelessness prevention, and rapid
    re-housing assistance. Annually, ESG connects over 350,000 people to
    emergency shelter as they transition to permanent housing.  
-   **$30 million to 23 States and the District of Columbia to support
    recovery from substance use disorder** — The Recovery Housing
    Program (RHP) allows States and the District of Columbia to provide
    stable, transitional housing for individuals in recovery from a
    substance-use disorder.  

The grants announced today by the Vice President will provide critical
funding for a wide range of activities to address communities’ most
pressing local needs, providing flexible resources to build homes,
support renters and homeowners, provide life-saving assistance to people
experiencing homelessness, create jobs, and improve public facilities,
community resilience, and local economies.  
  
For more information, see the following examples from previous years
about how these funds have enabled communities to provide innovative
housing solutions and expand affordable housing:

-   **Transforming a Historic Building into Affordable Homes in
    Cleveland, Ohio: **Through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee program,
    HUD granted a $15 million loan guarantee to the City of Cleveland,
    Ohio, to transition the downtown historic Huntington Building back
    into productive use, including affordable housing, commercial and
    retail space, and a museum.
-   **Supporting Affordable Homes for Seniors and People with
    Disabilities in East Greenwich, Rhode Island: **The Frenchtown Road
    project will create 63 units of affordable housing available to low-
    and moderate-income household, serving a community with a low stock
    of affordable housing currently available. The project will offer
    on-site supportive services for seniors and people with
    disabilities. Construction is underway with completion anticipated
    in early 2025.
-   **Building Affordable Homes for Homeless Seniors and Veterans in
    Vista, California: **The County of San Diego awarded over $4 million
    in HOME and HOME-American Rescue Plan funding to support the
    development of a 54-unit affordable housing complex – Santa Fe
    Village – in the City of Vista. The development will include 25
    units for homeless seniors with serious mental illnesses, and two
    units will be reserved for veteran households. This property will
    provide access to supportive services for these households,
    including on-site case management, and peer support activities.
-   **Funding Water & Wastewater Systems in Pennsylvania: **The
    Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development used
    their CDBG allocation in 2023 to award nearly $3.5 million in
    funding to ensure safe water and sewage systems in Mifflin,
    Somerset, and Sullivan counties. 

Today’s announcement follows the first two stops of the Vice President’s
nationwide [Economic Opportunity
Tour](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/vice-president-kamala-harris-launches-nationwide-economic-opportunity-tour/),
which is taking her back to several states across the country as she
highlights how the policies of the Biden-Harris Administration have
delivered for the American people. During each stop, the Vice President
is highlighting how the Biden-Harris Administration has delivered
historic investments that have supported communities and helped people
thrive. This includes improving access to housing while making it more
affordable. The tour kicked off last week with a [moderated
conversation](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/04/29/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-in-a-moderated-conversation-with-rashad-bilal-and-troy-millings-during-the-nationwide-economic-opportunity-tour/) in
Atlanta, GA.  
  
Today’s announcement builds on the Vice President’s career of working to
protect homeowners and address housing supply and affordability. As
Attorney General of California, she helped pass the California Homeowner
Bill of Rights to provide protections to homeowners facing foreclosure.
As U.S. Senator, she introduced several bills to increase the supply of
affordable housing and lower costs for renters. Now as Vice President,
she has led the charge on addressing racial bias in home appraisals by
announcing key actions of the PAVE Action Plan, including recent actions
that make it easier for more homeowners to appeal home appraisals that
may be undervalued because of racial bias.
