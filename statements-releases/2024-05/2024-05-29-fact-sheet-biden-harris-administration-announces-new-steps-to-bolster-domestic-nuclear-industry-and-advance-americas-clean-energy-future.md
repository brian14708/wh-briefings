title: "Fact Sheet: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Steps to Bolster\
  \ Domestic Nuclear Industry and Advance America\u2019s Clean Energy\_Future"
---
 
For decades, nuclear power has been the largest source of clean energy
in the United States, accounting for 19% of total energy produced last
year. The industry directly employs nearly 60,000 workers in good paying
jobs, maintains these jobs for decades, and supports hundreds of
thousands of other workers.  In the midst of transformational changes
taking place throughout the U.S. energy system, the Biden-Harris
Administration is continuing to build on President Biden’s unprecedented
goal of a carbon free electricity sector by 2035 while also ensuring
that consumers across the country have access to affordable, reliable
electric power, and creating good-paying clean energy jobs. Alongside
renewable power sources like wind and solar, a new generation of nuclear
reactors is now capturing the attention of a wide range of stakeholders
for nuclear energy’s ability to produce clean, reliable energy and meet
the needs of a fast-growing economy, driven by President Biden’s
Investing in America agenda and manufacturing boom. The Administration
recognizes that decarbonizing our power system, which accounts for a
quarter of all the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, represents a
pivotal challenge requiring all the expertise and ingenuity our nation
can deliver.  
  
**The Biden-Harris Administration is today hosting a White House Summit
on Domestic Nuclear Deployment, highlighting the collective progress
being made from across the public and private sectors**. Under President
Biden’s leadership, the Administration has taken a number of actions to
strengthen our nation’s energy and economic security by reducing – and
putting us on the path to eliminating – our reliance on Russian uranium
for civil nuclear power and building a new supply chain for nuclear
fuel, including: signing on to last year’s multi-country declaration at
COP28 to triple nuclear energy capacity globally by 2050; developing new
reactor designs; extending the service lives of existing nuclear
reactors; and growing the momentum behind new deployments. Recognizing
the importance of both the existing U.S. nuclear fleet and continued
build out of large nuclear power plants, the U.S. is also taking steps
to mitigate project risks associated with large nuclear builds and
position U.S. industry to support an aggressive deployment target.  
  
To help drive reactor deployment while ensuring ratepayers and project
stakeholders are better protected, **theAdministration is announcing
today the creation of a Nuclear Power Project Management and Delivery
working group that will draw on leading experts from across the nuclear
and megaproject construction industry to help identify opportunities to
proactively mitigate sources of cost and schedule overrun risk**.
Working group members will be made up of federal government entities,
including the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, the White
House Office of Clean Energy Innovation & Implementation, the White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Department of
Energy.  The working group will engage a range of stakeholders,
including project developers, engineering, procurement and construction
firms, utilities, investors, labor organizations, academics, and NGOs,
which will each offer individual views on how to help further the
Administration’s goal of delivering an efficient and cost-effective
deployment of clean, reliable nuclear energy and ensuring that learnings
translate to cost savings for future construction and deployment.  
  
The **United States Army is also announcing that it will soon release a
Request for Information to inform a deployment program for advanced
reactors to power multiple Army sites in the United States**. Small
modular nuclear reactors and microreactors can provide defense
installations resilient energy for several years amid the threat of
physical or cyberattacks, extreme weather, pandemic biothreats, and
other emerging challenges that can all disrupt commercial energy
networks.  Alongside the current defense programs through the Department
of the Air Force [microreactor pathfinder at Eielson
AFB](https://www.eielson.af.mil/microreactor/) and the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD) Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) [Project
Pele](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2998460/dod-to-build-project-pele-mobile-microreactor-and-perform-demonstration-at-idah/)
prototype transportable microreactor protype, the Army is taking a key
role in exploring the deployment of advanced  reactors that help meet
their energy needs. These efforts will help inform the regulatory and
supply chain pathways that will pave the path for additional deployments
of advanced nuclear technology to provide clean, reliable energy for
federal installations and other critical infrastructure.  
  
Additionally, the Department of Energy [**released today a new
primer**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/enhanced-safety-advanced-reactors)
**highlighting the expected enhanced safety of advanced nuclear
reactors** including passive core cooling capabilities and advanced fuel
designs. Idaho National Laboratory is also [**releasing a new**
**advanced nuclear reactor capital cost reduction pathway
tool**](https://fuelcycleoptions.inl.gov/Shared%20Documents/Nuclear-Reactor-Capital-Cost-Reduction-Pathway-Tool.pdf)
that will help developers and stakeholders to assess cost drivers for
new projects.  
  
The Administration notes the completion of units 3 and 4 of the Vogtle
nuclear power plant in Georgia, the first new reactors built in the
United States in over 30 years, and a result of the efforts and
collaboration between utilities, developers, and end users to finance
new nuclear projects, as well as the over 9,000 workers, many of whom
were union, and the residents of Georgia to help the project reach a
successful outcome. The Vogtle site is now the largest source of clean
power in America, with four operating nuclear reactors. DOE financing
and support made this project possible. The DOE Loan Programs Office
(LPO) has committed $12 billion in loan guarantees for the construction
as well as technical expertise, project monitoring, and issue mitigation
support that would have been otherwise unavailable in the private
sector. LPO’s low rates also means hundreds of millions of dollars in
annual cost savings for Georgians.  
  
The U.S. government will continue to take action to enable first movers
to deploy advanced and innovative technologies.  These announcements
build upon a wide range of actions the Biden-Harris Administration has
already taken, which include:  
  
**<u>Reviving and revitalizing existing nuclear, while preserving
jobs</u>**

-   The Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan would be the first U.S.
    nuclear plant to restart after shutting down.  It is supported by a
    $1.5 billion conditional loan commitment from the DOE Loan Programs
    Office to Holtec Palisades, LLC, to finance the restoration and
    resumption of service for an 800 MW nuclear generation station in
    Covert Township, Michigan. The project aims to bring back online the
    Palisades Nuclear Plant and upgrade it to produce clean, baseload
    power through at least 2050.
-   Diablo Canyon in California is leveraging DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit
    program to fund the plant’s life extension.
-   The Inflation Reduction Act created a production tax credit
    (Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 45U) for existing nuclear
    plants, giving them more economic security to keep operating.

**<u>Demonstrating and deploying new nuclear technologies</u>**

-   DOE’s [Advanced Reactor Demonstration
    Program](https://www.energy.gov/oced/advanced-reactor-demonstration-projects-0)
    (ARDP) provides significant funding for nuclear demonstration and
    risk reduction projects. Awardees include Gen IV reactor vendors and
    developers TerraPower, X-energy, Kairos Power, Westinghouse, BWX
    Technologies, and Southern Company.
-   The President signed a Congressional appropriations package
    providing $800 million to fund up to two Gen III+ SMR demonstration
    projects.  The implementation of this will be announced later this
    year. This package also appropriated $100 Million for Gen III+ SMR
    design, licensing, supplier development, and site preparation.
-   The Inflation Reduction Act enacted the Clean Electricity Production
    tax credit (IRC section 45Y) and Clean Electricity Investment tax
    credit (IRC section 48E) to support the deployment of all
    zero-greenhouse gas-emitting electricity generation, including from
    new nuclear electric generators.
-   DOE released a [coal-to-nuclear technical study and information
    guide](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-study-finds-replacing-coal-plants-nuclear-plants-could-bring-hundreds-more-local),
    highlighting the potential for more than 300 plant conversions and
    their ability to transition jobs and can be an economic boom for the
    communities they support
-   The Department of Defense (DOD) is funding [Project
    Pele](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2998460/dod-to-build-project-pele-mobile-microreactor-and-perform-demonstration-at-idah/)
    to develop a prototype microreactor (Gen IV) design for future use
    at defense installations.
-   The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) and U.S.
    Department of State announced the “EXIM SMR Financing Toolkit,” a
    suite of financial tools to support SMR deployments and help U.S.
    exporters compete in the global SMR market.
-   DOE, with support from our multidisciplinary national labs is
    working with, and providing resources for, industry partners to
    evaluate how international safeguards obligations and security can
    be integrated better early into the design process of new nuclear
    facilities from initial planning through deployment.

**<u>Streamlining licensing processes for building new reactors,
extending the life of existing reactors, and expanding capacity of
existing reactors</u>**  
  
In anticipation of the growing interest in reactor deployment, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) continues to make strides in
reforming its licensing and permitting processes to ensure that its
reviews and analyses can be performed efficiently without compromising
safety.

-   Demonstrating efficient licensing: NRC [issued a construction
    permit](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-approves-construction-hermes-reactor)
    to Kairos for the Hermes test reactor this past December; the first
    non-light water reactor (non-LWR) construction permit issued in the
    United States in 56 years. NRC completed its safety and
    environmental reviews of the Kairos Hermes test reactor construction
    permit application ahead of schedule and on-budget.
-   New technology-neutral licensing pathway: The NRC Commission [took
    important steps](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2406/ML24064A039.pdf) to
    improve the proposed draft rule for the new 10 CFR Part 53
    technology-neutral licensing pathway in response to stakeholder
    feedback and to make it more useful to applicants.
-   Reducing regulatory uncertainty: NRC issued [licensing
    guidance](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-endorses-new-guidance-advanced-reactor-licensing)
    for applicants seeking to use the existing Part 50 and 52 licensing
    pathways before the new optional Part 53 is completed. This guidance
    reduces the regulatory uncertainty for new reactor concepts that do
    not fit the mold of conventional reactor technologies.
-   Streamlining environmental reviews: NRC staff approved a proposed
    rule for Commission approval which would utilize an [advanced
    reactor generic environmental impact statement
    (GEIS)](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/NRC-2020-0101) to
    streamline environmental reviews for licensing new reactors. NRC
    staff also expects to soon issue a [GEIS for license
    renewal](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/sled.html)
    to streamline environmental reviews for extending the operating
    license for existing reactors.
-   Preparing for factory-built microreactors: NRC staff identified
    potential [regulatory
    solutions](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2320/ML23207A252.html) to
    enable licensing of microreactors that would be factory-built and
    then transported to a deployment site.
-   Leveraging cooperation with international partners: NRC recently
    signed a [memorandum of
    cooperation](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/who-were-working-with/international-cooperation/nrc-cnsc-moc.html)
    with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and the UK Office for
    Nuclear Regulation to increase collaboration on the technical
    reviews of advanced reactor and SMR technologies.
-   Modernizing safety and security reviews: NRC has initiated several
    process improvements for new reactor licensing such as the proposed
    rule for alternative [physical
    security](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/modernizing/rulemaking-and-guidance/physical-security.html)
    and new rule for [emergency
    preparedness](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/16/2023-25163/emergency-preparedness-for-small-modular-reactors-and-other-new-technologies)
    requirements for SMRs and non-LWRs that would provide regulatory
    stability, predictability, and clarity and minimize or eliminate
    uncertainty for applicants.
-   Increasing transparency and accountability: NRC launched its
    [licensing status
    dashboards](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/how-were-executing/project-status.html)
    to better enable stakeholders to track licensing review progress.

**<u>Advancing the supply chain and workforce</u>**

-   The Biden-Harris Administration is delivering on its promise to
    ensure a supply chain for reliable energy security and to reduce
    dependencies on Russian energy. On May 13, President Biden signed
    into law the “Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act” which imposes
    a ban on imported enriched uranium from Russia unless importers
    receive a waiver granted by the Secretary of Energy. It also unlocks
    up to $2.72 billion made available at the President’s request by the
    Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 to jumpstart new enrichment
    capacity in the United States for LEU and HALEU.
-   Centrus Energy Corporation produced the [nation’s first 100
    kilograms](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/centrus-produces-nations-first-amounts-haleu) of
    high-assay low-enriched uranium, a crucial material required by many
    advanced reactor designs. The production was the first of its kind
    in the United States in more than 70 years and completed a key
    milestone in DOE’s [HALEU Demonstration
    project](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/haleu-demonstration-key-first-step-fueling-success-us-advanced-reactors) in
    Piketon, Ohio. Centrus is expected to ramp up its production rate of
    HALEU material to 900 kilograms per year starting in 2024. The
    Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 also provided $700 million to help
    establish a reliable domestic supply of fuels for advanced reactors
    using HALEU.
-   X-Energy was allocated $148 million in tax credits under the
    Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit program (IRC section 48C)
    for an advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility, which will make
    TRISO particle fuel.
-   The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 made available $100
    million for nuclear workforce training programs at universities,
    2-year colleges, trade schools.
-   The Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Program Agency-Energy
    (ARPA-E) is also hosting several earlier stage [R&D
    programs](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-early-stage-rd-programs-transforming-nuclear-industry)
    for advanced nuclear, including $87 million of funding to 30
    projects with the aims of lower capital costs, lower O&M costs, and
    reducing spent fuel.

Taken together, these actions represent the largest sustained push to
accelerate civil nuclear deployment in the United States in nearly five
decades. President Biden will continue to take steps to reestablish U.S.
leadership in the industry, including continuing to keep existing
nuclear plants operational, supporting the demonstration and deployment
of advanced reactor technologies, making permitting processes more
efficient and effective, securing and expanding the nuclear fuel supply,
strengthening nuclear safety, security, and safeguards, and supporting
an ambitious strategy to ensure the nation’s nuclear leadership.
