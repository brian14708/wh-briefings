*Administration releases updated map showcasing 56,000 infrastructure
projects and unveils new Investing in America state-by-state fact
sheets*

When President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in
November 2021, he committed to delivering once-in-a-generation
investments to rebuild America’s infrastructure and competitiveness.
Today, his Administration is cutting ribbons and breaking ground on
projects across the country to rebuild our roads and bridges, deliver
clean and safe water, tackle legacy pollution, expand access to
high-speed internet, and build a clean energy economy for all Americans.
While “Infrastructure Week” became an empty punchline during the prior
Administration, President Biden is delivering an “Infrastructure Decade”
that will benefit communities for generations to come. As this year’s
Infrastructure Week kicks off, the Administration celebrates the
historic progress of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda,
which continues to unlock economic opportunity, create good-paying jobs,
boost domestic manufacturing, strengthen supply chains, and grow the
economy from the middle out and the bottom up.

To date, the Administration has announced nearly **$454 billion in
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, including over 56,000 specific
projects and awards,** across over 4,500 communities in all 50 states,
D.C., the territories, and for Tribes. To highlight the wide-ranging
impact of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the White House has
released [**an updated
map**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
showcasing the more than 56,000 projects and awards that are identified
or now underway.

Today, the Administration is also highlighting progress across President
Biden’s entire Investing in America agenda — which includes the
Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the American Rescue
Plan, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The President’s agenda has
driven over $866 billion dollars in private sector manufacturing and
clean energy investments in the United States, and the Administration is
releasing [**new state by state fact
sheets**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) that
spotlight investments and projects in all 50 states, the territories,
and Washington DC.

This Infrastructure Week, the Administration also continues to call on
Republicans in Congress to extend funding for the Affordable
Connectivity Program, a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law program that has
lowered internet bills to enable more than 23 million households—1 in 6
households across the country—to access affordable high-speed internet.
Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will see their
internet bills increase or lose internet access at the end of May.

**<u>HISTORIC PROGRESS ON INFRASTRUCTURE: BY THE NUMBERS</u>**

Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law alone, the Administration
has already:

-   Launched improvements on over 165,000 miles of roads and launched
    over 9,400 bridge repair projects – making our roadways safer and
    reconnecting communities across the country;
-   Provided funding to deploy nearly 3,000 low-and zero-emission
    American-made transit buses and funded over 5,000 clean school buses
    in 600 communities across the country, prioritizing disadvantaged
    areas;

<!-- -->

-   Delivered funding for over 450 port and waterway projects to
    strengthen supply chains, speed up the movement of goods, lower
    costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
-   Deployed investments in over 300 airport terminal projects to
    modernize and expand terminals—over 100 of which are under
    construction or complete;
-   Launched over 4,100 projects to help communities build resilience to
    threats such as the impacts of climate change and cyber-attacks;
-   Financed over 1,400 drinking water and wastewater projects across
    the country;
-   Deployed funding that will help replace up to 1.7 million toxic lead
    pipes;
-   Removed hazardous fuel material from nearly 15 million acres of land
    through the Infrastructure Law and other sources to protect
    communities from wildfires;
-   Funded nearly 500 projects for water recycling, storage,
    conservation, desalination, and other purposes to improve drought
    resilience across the West;
-   Provided funding to over 200 states, Tribes, and territories and
    launched over 60 projects to improve the resilience and reliability
    of America’s electric grid and deliver cheaper and cleaner
    electricity—representing the largest single investment in electric
    transmission and distribution infrastructure in the history of the
    United States;
-   Enabled over 23 million low-income households to access free or
    discounted high-speed internet service through the Affordable
    Connectivity Program;
-   Funded 12,000 miles of middle-mile high-speed internet
    infrastructure across 370 counties, promoting the security,
    resilience, and affordability of our nation’s regional networks;
-   Provided funding to more than 280 Tribal governments to connect over
    65,000 Tribal households with high-speed internet;
-   Implemented new rules to expose internet junk fees, enabling 300
    million Americans to shop for home and mobile internet plans that
    best meet their needs and budget;
-   Plugged nearly 8,000 orphaned oil and gas wells to address legacy
    pollution;
-   Allocated funding to 95 previously unfunded Superfund site projects,
    including the longstanding backlog of projects, to clean up
    contaminated sites and advance environmental justice; and
-   Provided funding to 180 programs that advance President Biden’s
    [Justice40
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
    which set a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal
    clean energy, climate, and other investments flow to disadvantaged
    communities.

To highlight this progress and to connect with communities across the
country, senior White House officials and members of the President’s
Cabinet have made over 500 trips to underscore how the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law is delivering for communities across the country.

**<u>ACCOMPLISHMENTS ACROSS KEY SECTORS</u>**

As we celebrate “Infrastructure Week,” the Biden-Harris Administration
is highlighting its progress implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law across key sectors:

-   **Roads & Bridges**: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over
    $300 billion in repairing and rebuilding America’s roads and bridges
    – the largest investment since President Eisenhower’s investment in
    the interstate highway system. This funding is already improving
    safety, strengthening supply chains, and reconnecting communities
    across the country. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has
    launched nearly 13,000 bridge repair projects and funded
    improvements on over 257,000 miles of roads. After signing the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021, President Biden visited the
    Blatnik Bridge in Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota,
    highlighting the kinds of aging infrastructure his Administration
    sought to rebuild. This January, the President returned to Wisconsin
    to show the effect of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law: over $1
    billion was awarded to rebuild the [**Blatnik
    Bridge**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-nearly-5-billion-for-major-transportation-projects-nationwide/)**,**
    a key corridor connecting the Twin Ports, to accommodate heavier
    trucks and bikers and pedestrians. To date, the Biden-Harris
    Administration has also announced over $3.5 billion to reconnect and
    rebuild disadvantaged communities that were divided by
    transportation infrastructure decades ago and have long been
    overlooked. These projects include [**“The Stitch” in Atlanta,
    Georgia**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/13/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-over-3-billion-to-reconnect-communities-that-have-been-left-behind-and-divided-by-transportation-infrastructure/),
    which received $158 million to create a 14-acre mixed-use
    development cap in the Downtown Connector. This investment is
    reconnecting working-class homes and businesses to downtown,
    increasing access to jobs, housing, education, and healthcare and
    creating public parks, plazas, and surface streets for walking and
    biking.  
      
-   **Rail:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $66 billion for
    rail, the largest investment in passenger rail since the inception
    of Amtrak and an unprecedented investment in rail safety. President
    Biden recently announced $16.4 billion for 25 passenger rail
    projects on the Northeast Corridor to repair aging infrastructure,
    reducing delays and improving reliability and speed. President Biden
    has also announced $8.2 billion in new funding for 10 major
    passenger rail projects across the country, including the
    [**Brightline West High-Speed Rail
    Project**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-billions-to-deliver-world-class-high-speed-rail-and-launch-new-passenger-rail-corridors-across-the-country/)
    that broke ground in April 2024. Connecting Las Vegas, Nevada, and
    Rancho Cucamonga, California, this project will result in a trip
    time of just over 2 hours, which is nearly twice as fast as driving.
    Brightline’s agreement with California and the Southern Nevada
    Building Trades will ensure that the Brightline West project is
    built using good-paying union labor.

<!-- -->

-   **Airports:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion
    to modernize and upgrade airports and air traffic facilities
    nationwide, improving passenger experience through expanding
    capacity, increasing accessibility, reducing delays, and enhancing
    safety. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has announced
    nearly $15 billion in airport funding through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. This includes nearly $3 billion through the
    Airport Terminals Program to over 300 airport terminal projects
    across 48 states, Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of the Northern
    Mariana Islands. Of these awards, over 100 projects are now underway
    or complete — like the **Missoula Montana Airport South Concourse
    project**, which is already complete and is increasing capacity,
    accessibility, and energy efficiency thanks to a $17 million
    investment, and the **Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport**,
    which received a $20 million grant and a visit from the Second
    Gentleman during the 2024 Investing in America Tour. Additionally,
    through the Airport Infrastructure Grants Program, the Biden-Harris
    Administration has announced over 1,000 grants for airport pavement
    projects. Of those, over 600 projects are already complete. 

<!-- -->

-   **Ports and Waterways:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests
    $17 billion to upgrade our nation’s ports and waterways. The
    Department of Transportation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have
    together funded over 450 port and waterway projects to strengthen
    supply chain reliability, speed up the movement of goods, reduce
    costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes major
    projects like the [**Louisiana International Terminal
    Project**](https://louisianainternationalterminal.com/#:~:text=To%20meet%20the%20industry%27s%20growing%20needs%2C%20the%20Port,providing%20goods%20to%20support%20Louisiana%27s%20homes%20and%20businesses.),
    which received $300 million in funding to construct a new container
    terminal on the Gulf Coast for the Port of New Orleans. The new
    terminal will be a new alternative for larger vessels compared to
    inland terminals that have height restrictions, increasing
    throughput of goods. In April, the Army Corps broke ground on phase
    2 of the [**Norfolk Harbor Deepening
    project**](https://www.nao.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/3756458/breaking-ground-us-army-corps-and-port-of-virginia-spearhead-major-atlantic-oce/),
    which received $142 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    to make the Port of Virginia the deepest port on the East Coast,
    allowing the port to handle the world’s largest container ships.

<!-- -->

-   **Transit and School Buses:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    invests nearly $90 billion in public transit – the largest
    investment in transit in our Nation’s history. To date, the
    Biden-Harris Administration has funded nearly 3,000 low- and zero-
    emission transit buses through the Department of Transportation and
    over 5,000 clean school buses through the Environmental Protection
    Agency. The Administration is also funding long-awaited capital
    projects through the Capital Investment Grant program – like the
    **Phoenix Northwest Extension Light Rail** project, which received
    $158 million to extend Phoenix’s light rail by 1.5 miles and connect
    it with new housing and retail space. This extension, estimated to
    serve 2 million passengers per year, was completed earlier this
    year.

<!-- -->

-   **Electric Vehicle Charging, EV Batteries & Critical Materials**:
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the first-ever dedicated
    federal investment in EV charging, with $7.5 billion in available
    funding. Thanks to this investment and the President’s vision for a
    national network of EV chargers, the number of publicly available
    charging ports on America’s roads has surpassed **182,000**, over a
    90% increase since President Biden took office. The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law also invests over $7 billion to support the
    domestic manufacturing of batteries and the extraction, refinement,
    and processing of the critical materials that power them. Of this
    funding, $3.5 billion has been announced to date, and already five
    manufacturing plants have broken ground. Late last year, the
    Department of Energy made an additional $3 billion in funding
    available. 

<!-- -->

-   **Clean Water:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $50
    billion government-wide for the largest upgrade to the nation’s
    water infrastructure in history. This funding places us on a path to
    meet the President’s commitment to replace every toxic lead pipe in
    America and works to close the wastewater gap for 2 million people
    who lack basic sanitation. These funds have already financed over
    1,400 drinking water and wastewater projects across the country,
    including over 800 projects that will deliver clean water for Tribal
    communities that lack basic water services. Within this total, the
    Environmental Protection Agency’s State Revolving Funds require that
    at least 49% of funding for clean water and lead pipe replacement go
    to disadvantaged communities as grants and forgivable loans,
    advancing the President’s Justice40 initiative. This month,
    President Biden visited Wilmington, North Carolina, to [**announce
    another $3 billion to replace lead
    pipes**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-3-billion-to-replace-toxic-lead-pipes-and-deliver-clean-drinking-water-to-communities-across-the-country/),
    part of a historic $15 billion in dedicated funding for lead pipe
    replacement. To date, the Administration has deployed funding that
    will help replace up to 1.7 million toxic lead pipes. That includes
    Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which has received $42 million to replace
    lead pipes, putting the city on track to replace every lead pipe
    by 2026. Major clean water projects under construction include the
    [**Lewis & Clark Rural Water System**](https://lcrws.org/), which is
    building over 300 miles of water pipeline to deliver clean water to
    over 350,000 people in rural Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa. The
    Department of the Interior has been able to accelerate completion of
    the project by a decade thanks to $142 million from the
    Infrastructure Law.
-   **High-Speed Internet:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests
    $65 billion to help ensure that everyone in America has access to
    affordable, reliable high-speed internet—regardless of their income,
    race, or zip code.  Over the last year, all 56 states and
    territories have developed their plans for how they will spend more
    than $40 billion in funding to connect every unserved location
    within their borders. That funding comes atop $1 billion for
    middle-mile infrastructure, which will build more than 12,000 miles
    of fiber across 370 counties, and $2.3 billion for rural high-speed
    internet, with 121 awards going to 356 states and territories across
    the country. For example, in Colorado, Montana, Missouri, Michigan,
    and Mississippi, construction is underway on projects that will
    connect rural communities to high-speed internet. These projects,
    funded with $59 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will
    connect 10,500 people, 1,600 farms, and 295 businesses directly to
    fiber networks. The Department of Commerce has also awarded 148
    Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP) grants, serving over
    280 Tribal Governments, which will connect more than 65,000 Tribal
    households, subsidizing thousands of devices, and funding digital
    inclusion activities for Tribal communities. Together, these
    investments mirror the federal government’s historic investment in
    rural electrification during the 1930s, when the U.S. connected
    nearly every home and farm in America to electricity and millions of
    families and our economy reaped the benefits. And, to ensure
    consumers know what they are paying for, the Administration
    implemented new rules to ensure internet providers are transparent
    about their pricing and network performance – by requiring internet
    service providers to have a “nutrition label” that describes their
    plan at the point of sale – enabling 300 million Americans to
    comparison shop for the home or mobile internet plan that best meets
    their needs and budget.

<!-- -->

-   **Modernizing the Grid and Deploying Clean Energy:** The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law includes more than $62 billion in funding at the
    Department of Energy to advance our clean energy future by investing
    in clean energy demonstration and deployment projects, developing
    new technologies, and modernizing our power grid. This includes an
    investment of over $20 billion to upgrade the nation’s grid—a
    critical component to achieve President Biden’s goal of delivering a
    100% carbon-pollution free power sector by 2035. To date, the
    Department of Energy has announced over $5.6 billion in funding
    for over 60 projects and provided funding to over 200 states,
    Tribes, and territories. In April 2024, the Department of Energy
    (DOE) announced up to $331 million through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law for capacity contract negotiations with the
    [**Southwest Intertie Project-North
    (SWIP-N)**](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/042324_GDO_TFP_Fact_Sheet_SWIPN.pdf)**.**
    SWIP-N is a new 285-mile transmission line from Idaho to Nevada that
    will bring over 2,000 megawatts of needed transmission capacity,
    enough to power 1.7 million homes. In January 2024, the Department
    of Energy finalized the terms of $1.1 billion in credit payments for
    the [**Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power
    Plant**](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/articles/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-award-11-billion-credits-pacific-gas-and)
    in California, helping keep this source of clean power operating
    while preserving over 1,000 good-paying clean energy jobs.

<!-- -->

-   **Superfund and Brownfields Cleanup**: The Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law delivers the largest-ever investment in tackling legacy
    pollution, including $5 billion to clean up Superfund and brownfield
    sites to restore the health and economic vitality of communities
    that have been exposed to legacy pollution for far too long. In
    February, the Biden-Harris Administration announced the final round
    of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding of [over $1
    billion](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-1-billion-start-new-cleanup-projects-and)
    to start new cleanup projects and continue work at 100 Superfund
    sites across the country. Examples include funding to clean up the
    US Finishing/Cone Mills Superfund site in Greenville, South
    Carolina, where a century of industrial operations have polluted the
    area’s groundwater. As part of the President’s Justice40 Initiative,
    82% of Superfund funding from the Infrastructure Law has been
    directed to disadvantaged communities. In addition, over 20
    brownfield sites have completed cleanup efforts and over 100 have
    been made ready for redevelopment through Infrastructure Law funding
    to date.

<!-- -->

-   **Orphaned Wells and Abandoned Mine Lands:** Orphaned oil and gas
    wells and abandoned coal mines left behind by industry continue to
    pollute millions of Americans’ air and water with methane and other
    pollutants, and pose physical safety risks to communities. Through a
    total investment of $16 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law, the Department of the Interior is helping fund cleanup efforts
    at these sites across the country. With this funding, nearly 8,000
    orphaned wells have been plugged so far, with tens of thousands more
    to be plugged using Infrastructure Law funding. States and Tribes
    are also making progress addressing Abandoned Mine Lands. For
    example, the Administration has funded the cleanup of the Truetown
    Discharge abandoned mine land site in Athens County, Ohio, which is
    the largest acid mine drainage in the state and discharges toxic
    waste into the watershed. This project will treat 1.4 million
    gallons of acid mine drainage daily and convert the waste into
    professional-grade paint for sale through a partnership with Ohio
    University, helping deliver clean water and support economic
    development for the community.  
      
-   **Resilience:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $50
    billion in an “all hazards” approach to protect our infrastructure
    and communities from physical, climate, and cybersecurity-related
    threats. To date, the Administration has funded **over 4,100
    projects to build resilience to these threats**, ranging from
    restoring critical waterways and forests to enhancing long-term
    drought resilience across the American West to reducing wildfire
    risk. Together, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation
    Reduction Act include $15.4 billion to support drought-prone
    communities to address the ongoing megadrought in the West. In fact,
    earlier this year a historic consensus-based agreement was finalized
    to conserve water resources in the critical Colorado River System
    through President Biden’s leadership. Already, President Biden’s
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has provided more than $3 billion for
    475 Western drought resilience projects. The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law has also made major investments this year in
    reducing wildfire risk ahead of another fire season, including [$400
    million](https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/newsroom/releases/usda-announces-500-million-confront-wildfire-crisis-part-investing)
    announced from the U.S. Forest Service in February to address 21
    designated priority landscapes, to safeguard communities from the
    ongoing wildfire crisis, which is exacerbated by climate change. For
    example, the Four Forest Restoration Initiative in Arizona has
    treated over 130,000 acres of at-risk forest land in FY 2023 alone
    to reduce wildfire risk.
