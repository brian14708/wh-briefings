title: "Readout of White\_House Convening on Advancing a Climate-Ready\_Workforce"
---
 
Today, the White House convened a bipartisan group of 20 governors’
offices and U.S. Climate Alliance leadership to discuss the rapid growth
of career pathways in climate and clean energy fields and how states and
territories – in partnership with the federal government – can expand
Americans’ access to the occupational skills-based training necessary to
access these good-paying jobs. In attendance were Ali Zaidi, Assistant
to the President and White House National Climate Advisor, and senior
administration officials from the Department of Energy, U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Department of Labor, Department of Transportation,
Department of the Interior, and AmeriCorps.  
  
During the convening, Administration officials highlighted how the
Biden-Harris Administration is taking unprecedented steps to expand
proven workforce development training models, such as Registered
Apprenticeship programs, to ensure that states can further develop their
climate resilience and clean energy workforces. Michigan, for instance,
is developing good-paying, high-skill clean energy careers while
ensuring Michigan residents have the skills needed to succeed, including
through the Michigan Electric Vehicle Jobs Academy and registered
apprenticeships. Colorado’s state-based Colorado Climate Corps program
is creating new service opportunities and advancing workforce
development while supporting the Governor’s climate mitigation,
adaptation, and conservation goals. Administration and state officials
discussed areas for future collaboration on workforce development, and
highlighted the important role states can play in creating good-paying
climate jobs.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is leading and delivering on the most
ambitious climate, clean energy, and environmental justice agenda in
history, including securing the largest ever climate investment – the
Inflation Reduction Act – and unleashing a clean energy manufacturing
boom that has attracted hundreds of billions in private sector
investment and created over 270,000 new clean energy jobs. And just last
month, President Biden announced [several new critical
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-marks-earth-day-2024-with-historic-climate-action/)
to stand up the American Climate Corps – a historic initiative that will
put more than 20,000 young Americans to work fighting the impacts of
climate change while training them for careers in the workforce of the
future.
