Jill and I send warm wishes to Orthodox Christian communities around the
world as they celebrate Easter.

The Resurrection of Jesus Christ reminds us of God’s abundant love for
us and the power of light over darkness. We join Orthodox Christians in
giving thanks for these and other blessings and rededicate ourselves to
caring for those most in need.

In this sacred season, we hold people who are suffering from war and
persecution especially close to our hearts. We will continue to pray and
work for peace and justice for all people. 

May the Lord bless and keep you this Easter Sunday and in the year
ahead.
