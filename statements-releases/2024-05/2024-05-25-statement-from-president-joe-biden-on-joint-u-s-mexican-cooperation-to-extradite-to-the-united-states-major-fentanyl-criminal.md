title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Joint U.S.-Mexican Cooperation to Extradite\
  \ to the United\_States Major Fentanyl\_Criminal"
---
 
Today, the Mexican
Government [extradited](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-extradition-nestor-isidro-perez-salas) Nestor
Isidro Perez Salaz, known as “El Nini,” to the United States to face
justice in our courts.    
   
El Nini played a prominent role in the notorious Sinaloa Cartel, one of
the deadliest drug trafficking enterprises in the world. The United
States has charged him for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking
and for murdering, torturing, and kidnapping numerous rivals, witnesses,
and others. This is a good day for justice.  
   
I thank Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador for his decision
to extradite this dangerous criminal. Our governments will continue to
work together to attack the fentanyl and synthetic drug epidemic that is
killing so many people in our homelands and globally, and to bring to
justice the criminals and organizations producing, smuggling, and
selling these lethal poisons in both of our countries.
