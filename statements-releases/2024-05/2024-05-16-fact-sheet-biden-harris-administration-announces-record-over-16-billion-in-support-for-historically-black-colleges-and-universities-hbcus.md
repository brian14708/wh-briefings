title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Record Over $16 Billion\
  \ in Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities\_(HBCUs)"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a new record in Federal
funding and investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) totaling **more than $16 billion** from Fiscal Years (FY) 2021
through current available data for FY 2024. This new reported total is
up from the [previously announced over $7
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/09/22/a-proclamation-on-national-historically-black-colleges-and-universities-week-2023/),
and captures significant additional actions already undertaken.  The
total of more than $16 billion includes over **$11.4 billion** between
FY2021 and FY2023 through Federal grants, contracting awards, and debt
relief for HBCUs; over **$4 billion** between FY2021 and FY2023 for
HBCU-enrolled students through federal financial aid and educational
benefits for veterans; and, so far in FY 2024, **over $900 million** has
been secured for Department of Education programs strengthening HBCUs as
institutions. President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to
ensuring whole-of-government investment efforts in HBCUs continue at
full momentum through the rest of FY 2024.  
   
These historic funding levels – the most by any administration –
demonstrate President Biden and Vice President Harris’s ongoing
commitment to HBCUs, which serve as an engine for upward economic
mobility in our country. The Administration is also focused on work to
ensure HBCUs have the resources to provide a high-quality postsecondary
education.  
  
For more than 180 years, HBCUs have been advancing intergenerational
economic mobility for Black families and communities, developing vital
academic research, and making our Nation more prosperous and equitable.
Despite representing [only
3%](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-record-championing-historically-black-colleges-and-universities-hbcus)
of colleges and universities, HBCUs play an outsized role to support the
economic mobility of African Americans, producing 40 percent of all
Black engineers, 50 percent of all Black teachers, 70 percent of all
Black doctors and dentists, 80 percent of all Black judges, and the
first woman and Black Vice President of the United States. Overall,
HBCUs greatly contribute to the economic success of America, providing
college access to [twice as
many](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/mckinsey-report-highlights-importance-of-supporting-hbcus-in-the-united-states/)
Pell Grant-eligible (low-income) students as non-HBCU institutions.
Additionally, [social mobility
research](https://uncf.org/news/hbcus-fuel-the-american-middle-class) by
the United Negro College Fund finds that HBCUs support nearly five times
more students than Ivy League and other top-ranked institutions in
facilitating movement from the bottom 40% in U.S. household income to
the top 60%.  
   
A [CEA
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/05/16/the-economics-of-hbcus/)
published today further underscores that HBCUs are engines for upward
mobility and additionally discusses new research showing that HBCU
enrollment has considerable positive effects on bachelor’s degree
completion and household income later in life. The report details how
these successes have occurred in the context of historic underfunding of
HBCUs. It also discusses a recent resurgence in applications to, and
enrollment in, HBCUs which highlight the high value that students have
placed on these institutions in recent years.

Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has committed to
[advancing racial equity](http://www.whitehouse.gov/equity), economic
opportunity, and educational excellence, including by reestablishing the
[White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and
Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and
Universities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/03/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-through-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/).
Between FY 2021 – FY 2023 the Biden-Harris Administration has taken
historic actions to support HBCUs:  
   
**Invested over $11.4 billion in HBCUs, which includes:**

-   **Nearly $4 billion** for HBCUs through the American Rescue Plan and
    other COVID relief legislation. These grants funded through the
    Department of Education and other agencies have helped HBCUs support
    students’ ability to meet basic needs; support campus operations,
    staffing, teaching, and educational programs; and keep campuses and
    the surrounding communities on the path to an equitable recovery;  
-   **$2.6 billion** from the Department of Education to build
    institutional capacity at HBCUs. These efforts support the growth
    and sustainability of HBCU degree programs; increase and enhance
    human, technological, and physical infrastructure for research;
    strengthen positioning to secure direct partnership opportunities;
    and create sustainable fund development;  
-   **Over $1.6 billion** to HBCUs through Federal grants, cooperative
    agreements, and other competitive funding opportunities that drive
    the advancement of academic and training programs, community-based
    initiatives, and research innovation across national priorities such
    as medicine and public health, climate science, agriculture,
    emerging technologies, and defense;  
     
-   **Almost $950 million** to support HBCUs in growing research
    capacity and related infrastructure to better compete for Federal
    research and development dollars;  
-   **Nearly $719 million** in grant funding to expand STEM academic
    capacity and educational programs; and in other high-wage,
    high-demand fields such as computer science, nursing, and allied
    health;  
-   **Over $150 million** in Federal contracting opportunities awarded
    to HBCUs, including for research and expansion of STEM education
    programs at the Department of Health and Human Services, Department
    of Transportation, Department of Energy, and U.S. Agency for
    International Development;  
-   **$1.6 billion** in capital finance debt relief for 45 public and
    private HBCUs. Discharging these debts has enabled these
    institutions to focus resources on supporting students, faculty, and
    staff while recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic; and  
-   **Over $2.4 million** in Project SERV funds to support HBCUs
    affected by more than a dozen bomb threats in 2022. These grants
    have helped restore safe learning environments and invest in student
    mental health and well-being for students.

**In addition to the over $11 billion provided to HBCUs, the
Biden-Harris Administration has provided over $4 billion to support the
success of HBCU-enrolled students through:    
                                                                                               **

-   **$2.8 billion** in need-based grants and other Federal programs,
    including Pell Grants, Federal Work-Study and Supplemental
    Educational Opportunity Grants, to assist HBCU students in affording
    a postsecondary education; and  
-   **Nearly $1.3 billion** to support Veterans attending HBCUs through
    the GI bill and other college, graduate school, and training
    programs delivered through the Department of Veterans Affairs.

**While more must be done to ensure equity for HBCUs and their students,
the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering landmark first-of-its-kind
