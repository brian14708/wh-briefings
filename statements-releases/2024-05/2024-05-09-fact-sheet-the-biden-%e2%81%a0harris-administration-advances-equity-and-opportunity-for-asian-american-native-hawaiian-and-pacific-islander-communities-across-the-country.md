title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Communities Across the\_\
  Country"
---
 
President Biden and Vice President Harris celebrate the diversity of
cultures, breadth of achievement, and remarkable contributions of Asian
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI)
communities, while also recognizing the systemic barriers to equity,
justice, and opportunity that still put the American dream out of reach
for far too many AA and NHPI people across the United States. For more
than three years, the Biden-Harris Administration has leveraged the full
force of the Federal Government to ensure the promise of America for all
AA and NHPI communities — including by issuing an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/28/executive-order-on-advancing-equity-justice-and-opportunity-for-asian-americans-native-hawaiians-and-pacific-islanders/)
establishing the [President’s Advisory
Commission](https://www.hhs.gov/about/whiaanhpi/commission/index.html)
and [White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
Pacific Islanders](https://www.hhs.gov/about/whiaanhpi/index.html)
(WHIAANHPI). In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden-Harris
Administration has delivered the most equitable economic recovery on
record with nearly 15 million jobs created, including historic AA and
NHPI small business growth. We are also working to ensure equal access
to a high-quality education, expand affordable healthcare for children
and families, combat hate, improve disaster recovery, preserve
indigenous heritage and lands, and protect civil rights by advancing
language access and data equity. The Biden-Harris Administration remains
committed to investing in the futures of all AA and NHPI communities.  
  
**Advancing Inclusion and Opportunity for AA and NHPI Communities**  
Since the President’s Day One [Executive
Order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/equity) (EO), the Biden-Harris
Administration has worked to advance racial equity and ensure the full
and fair participation of all people in American life. This includes
improving longstanding federal data collection and reporting practices
that historically have lacked appropriate disaggregation, which in turn
have too often contributed to painful and enduring stereotypes, obscured
disparities within AA and NHPI communities, and failed to measure,
reflect, and be responsive to the diversity of AA and NHPI experiences.

-   **Expanding and building capacity for disaggregated data.** In April
    2022, the White House released
    [recommendations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-recommendations-for-advancing-use-of-equitable-data/)
    for increasing the collection of data to measure equity and better
    represent the diversity of the American people, including AA and
    NHPI communities. In March 2024, the White House Office of
    Management and Budget revised the [Standards for Maintaining,
    Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and
    Ethnicity](https://spd15revision.gov/) for the first time in 27
    years, helping ensure that AA and NHPI individuals can more fully
    self-identify by specific ethnicity.
-   **Expanding language access and preserving linguistic identity**.
    The Biden-Harris Administration is [reducing barriers for people
    with limited English proficiency](https://www.lep.gov/) by
    strengthening federal language access services and ensuring
    information on government programs, services, and benefits are
    provided in multiple languages, including Asian languages. The
    President’s FY 2025 Budget builds on these efforts with funding to
    expand federal language access capacity.

**Combating Anti-Asian Hate, Improving Public Safety, and Protecting
Civil Rights**  
The Biden-Harris Administration is advancing and enforcing civil rights
to deliver the most just outcomes for underserved communities. Federal
agencies are taking steps to protect the civil and constitutional rights
of all persons and rooting out identity-based discrimination.

-   **Confronting the scourge of hate.** President Biden signed the
    [COVID-19 Hate Crimes
    Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/20/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-the-covid-19-hate-crimes-act/)
    into law in 2021 and [issued new
    guidance](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/file/1223831/dl?inline=)
    to raise awareness of hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic,
    including the rise in incidents targeting AA and NHPI communities.
    According to FBI data, hate crimes targeting Asian Americans fell by
    33 percent from 2021 to 2022. DOJ has also expanded its [United
    Against Hate
    Initiative](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/spotlight/united-against-hate),
    to all 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices across the country to improve the
    reporting of hate crimes and hate incidents. These efforts will
    support AA and NHPI communities that continue to face barriers and
    underreport hate incidents.
-   **Rooting out bias and discrimination.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration has mobilized over $1 billion in new investments to
    increase support for programs to bridge divides and [counter
    hate-fueled
    violence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-to-counter-hate-fueled-violence/),
    and established an interagency group to counter antisemitism,
    Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination. In
    November 2023, the White House announced plans to develop the
    [first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter
    Islamophobia](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/01/statement-from-white-house-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-president-bidens-establishment-of-first-ever-national-strategy-to-counter-islamophobia/),
    a whole-of-society effort to address all forms of hate,
    discrimination, and bias against Muslim, Sikh, South Asian, and Arab
    American communities.

**Growing Economic Opportunity for AA and NHPI Families and
Communities**  
Through [two historic equity Executive
Orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/equity/), the President’s landmark
[Investing in America agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/), and
the implementation of key legislation, the Biden-Harris Administration
is addressing longstanding economic inequities and delivering security,
mobility, and prosperity for AA and NHPI families and communities.

-   **Increasing federal contract awards to small disadvantaged
    businesses.** In 2021, President Biden set a bold goal to increase
    total federal contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses
    (SDBs) to 15% by 2025, including AA and NHPI-owned small businesses.
    In 2023, federal agencies awarded SDBs a record-breaking $76.2
    billion – or 12.1% of all contract dollars. This represents the
    third consecutive year of record-breaking awards to SDBs under
    President Biden, and puts the Administration on track to reach the
    President’s goal of increasing federal contracting dollars to SDBs
    by 50% by 2025. Last year, awards to Asian American-owned businesses
    totaled more than [$20
    billion](https://www.sba.gov/disaggregated-data/2023/), an increase
    of $2.7 billion over the [previous
    year](https://www.sba.gov/disaggregated-data/2022/). 
-   **Supporting AA and NHPI small business owners.** In FY23, the [U.S.
    Small Business
    Administration](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/11/21/sba-announces-biden-harris-administrations-progress-small-business-lending-end-year-capital-program#:~:text=AAPI%2Downed%20businesses%3A%20In%20FY23,loan%20dollars%20are%20up%2036%25)
    backed 7,500 loans to AAPI-owned businesses, which total to more
    than $6.4 billion. That means total loans are up 44% under the
    Biden-Harris Administration, and total loan dollars are up 36%.
-   **Improving engagement with AA and NHPI businesses and
    entrepreneurs.** In January 2023, WHIAANHPI – in collaboration with
    the Small Business Administration, the National Asian / Pacific
    Islander American Chamber of Commerce & Entrepreneurship, and
    federal, state, and local partners – launched a series of regional
    economic summits to connect AA and NHPI business owners,
    entrepreneurs, and community leaders directly with federal resources
    such as contracting and employment opportunities.
-   **Closing gender and racial wage gaps.** AA and NHPI women are
    overrepresented in the Nation’s front line and low-wage workforces.
    The Biden-Harris Administration is taking [new
    actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/12/fact-sheet-on-equal-pay-day-the-biden-harris-administration-announces-actions-to-continue-advancing-pay-equity-and-womens-economic-security/)
    to combat occupational segregation and advance women’s economic
    security, such as expanding access to good-paying jobs and
    apprenticeships, increasing access to [affordable care and support
    for
    caregivers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/07/fact-sheet-historic-biden-harris-administration-investments-in-child-care-recovery-lowered-costs-for-millions-of-families-helped-speed-the-return-to-work-of-hundreds-of-thousands-mothers-and-grew-t/#:~:text=The%20American%20Rescue%20Plan's%20(ARP,families%20who%20rely%20on%20them.),
    and advancing pay equity and pay transparency. The Department of
    Labor [announced new
    funding](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/wb/wb20240411) to
    protect underserved and marginalized women workers from gender-based
    violence and harassment and also finalized a new rule to restore and
    expand [overtime](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/overtime)
    protections to millions of workers, including AA and NHPI workers.
-   **Tackling AA and NHPI childhood poverty**. President Biden signed
    and implemented the American Rescue Plan (ARP) – legislation that
    has powered a historic and equitable recovery from the COVID-19
    pandemic, including record low AA and NHPI child poverty in 2021
    driven by the expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC). The
    President’s [FY 2025
    Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-for-fiscal-year-2025/)
    would restore the expanded CTC, lifting an estimated three million
    children out of poverty, including in AA and NHPI communities which
    experience disproportionately higher rates of child poverty.

**Advancing Educational Excellence for AA and NHPI Students and
Institutions**  
The Biden-Harris Administration has made great progress to ensure that a
high-quality education is an accessible and attainable promise of the
American Dream for all. From over $160 billion in historic student debt
relief for more than 4.6 million borrowers through various actions, to
securing the largest investment of $130 billion for public education,
President Biden is committed to educational equity, including for AA and
NHPI students.

-   **Strengthening capacity of AANAPISIs.** In September 2023,
    President Biden issued the first-ever [White House proclamation to
    recognize National Asian American and Native American Pacific
    Islander-Serving
    Institutions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/09/22/a-proclamation-on-asian-american-and-native-american-pacific-islander-serving-institutions-week-2023/)
    (AANAPISIs), which confer almost 50% of associate degrees and nearly
    30% of baccalaureate degrees upon all people who are AA and NHPIs in
    the United States. The Biden-Harris Administration delivered $5
    billion in ARP funds to support AANAPISIs.
-   **Advancing educational equity**. Under ARP, Title I schools
    received $130 billion in funding with Maintenance of Equity
    requirements to protect high poverty schools from reductions in
    State and local education funding. In 2021, 60% of Pacific Islander
    and 35% of Asian American public school students participated in
    Title I programs or public targeted assistance programs.
-   **Supporting low-income college students.** The President [secured
    the largest increase in Pell Grants in a
    decade](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/08/president-joe-biden-outlines-new-plans-to-deliver-student-debt-relief-to-over-30-million-americans-under-the-biden-harris-administration/#:~:text=The%20Administration%20secured%20the%20largest,%2C%20including%20low%2Dincome%20Americans.),
    and has expanded eligibility for the maximum Pell Grant to 1.7
    million more Americans, helping low-income students afford their
    dream of pursuing postsecondary education. According to the latest
    public data, nearly 30% of AA and NHPI students are federal
    financial aid recipients and receive an average award of over $5,000
    per student.

**Improving the Health and Well-Being of AA and NHPI Communities**  
The Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to advance health
equity to meet the needs of underserved communities, including AA and
NHPI communities.

-   **Expanding access to high-quality, affordable, and
    culturally-inclusive healthcare**. Over 45 million people are now
    covered through the Affordable Care Act’s Marketplaces and Medicaid
    expansion – 14 million more than when the President took office
    in 2021. In September 2023, the Department of Health and Human
    Services (HHS) also [announced $8 million in
    grants](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/25/hhs-invests-8-million-improve-health-care-access-training-new-physicians-care-individuals-disabilities-individuals-limited-english-proficiency.html#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Department%20of,in%20providing%20culturally%20and%20linguistically)
    to train medical professionals in providing culturally and
    linguistically appropriate care for individuals with limited English
    proficiency, including those from AA and NHPI communities.
-   **Protecting AA and NHPI communities from harmful pollution**. The
    Biden-Harris Administration has [invested billions of
    dollars](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/10/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-critical-action-to-protect-communities-from-pfas-pollution-in-drinking-water/)
    to rid the Nation’s drinking water, air, soil, and food supply of
    toxic PFAS, which are linked to cancer, organ damage, and
    developmental issues in children. A 2023
    [study](https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2023/mount-sinai-researchers-find-asian-americans-to-have-significantly-higher-exposure-to-toxic-forever-chemicals)
    found that AA and NHPI Americans have significantly higher exposure
    to PFAS than other ethnic or racial groups. In April 2024, the
    Environmental Protection Agency issued the [first-ever national
    drinking water standard for PFAS](https://www.epa.gov/pfas), which
    will protect 100 million people from exposure, prevent tens of
    thousands of serious illnesses, and save lives.
-   **Restoring access to federal benefits for certain Pacific Islanders
    residing in the U.S.** President Biden signed into law the
    Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, which restored eligibility
    for federal public benefits to [Compacts of Free Association (COFA)
    citizens](https://aapcho.org/congress-restores-federal-benefits-eligibility-for-cofa-citizens-in-the-u-s/)
    living in the United States.

**Honoring and Preserving Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander
Culture**  
The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to preserving the
traditions, cultures, languages, and lands Native Hawaiians and Pacific
Islanders have called home for centuries.

-   **Providing a whole-of-government response after the devasting Maui
    wildfires.** The Biden-Harris Administration has deployed [federal
    resources across multiple
    agencies](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20240206/fema-and-partners-rally-massive-effort-help-lahaina-rebound-and-wildfire)
    in response to the disastrous wildfires. Relief efforts include
    preserving cultural artifacts and deploying cultural advisors to
    assist with the ongoing recovery process.
-   **Ensuring equitable engagement with Native communities.** For the
    first time, the Department of Interior (DOI) now [requires formal
    consultation with Native
    Hawaiians](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-development-first-ever-consultation-policy-native);
    and in February 2024, DOI announced [new guidance on the use of the
    Hawaiian
    language](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-new-guidance-honor-and-elevate-hawaiian-language)
    in commemoration of Mahina ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi or Hawaiian Language
    Month. In December 2023, The White House Council on Native American
    Affairs completed a [*Best Practices Guide for Tribal and Native
    Hawaiian Sacred
    Sites*](https://www.bia.gov/events/sacred-sites-best-practices-guide);
    and DOI issued a final rule to provide a process for returning human
    remains and sacred or cultural objects to Tribal Nations and Native
    Hawaiian Organizations.
-   **Fostering Native language revitalization and the preservation of
    Indigenous knowledge.** In October 2023, the Department of Education
    [released more than $11 million to preserve Native
    languages](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-awards-more-11-million-preserve-native-languages-increase-native-teacher-retention-and-support-tribal-educational-agencies)
    and increase Native teacher retention.
-   **Fortifying cultural heritage and resilience.** In September 2023,
    the National Endowment for the Humanities announced the [Pacific
    Islands Cultural
    Initiative](https://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-pacific-islands-cultural-initiative),
    and committed $1.3 million in initial funding to fortify cultural
    heritage and resilience in American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, and the
    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Since 2021, the
    National Endowment for the Arts has also distributed nearly $6
    million in federal funding in Hawaii.
-   **Strengthening housing programs** **for Native Hawaiian families.**
    In April 2023, with the support of the Department of Housing and
    Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands
    (DHHL) launched a [tenant-based rental assistance
    program](https://www.hawaiiancouncil.org/kupuna/) for kupuna
    (elders). In February 2024, HUD [announced a final
    rule](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_027)
    to provide more affordable housing options to Native Hawaiians,
    allowing more families to reside on the Hawaiian home lands.

**Rebuilding the Immigration System and Supporting New Americans**  
Although Congress has failed to advance President Biden’s comprehensive
proposal to reform our immigration laws and provide more border
resources, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken numerous actions to
reverse the damage that was done to our immigration system and address
the unprecedented levels of global migration. 

-   **Restoring faith in the U.S. immigration system.** President Biden
    issued an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/02/executive-order-restoring-faith-in-our-legal-immigration-systems-and-strengthening-integration-and-inclusion-efforts-for-new-americans/)
    to restore faith in our Nation’s legal immigration system and
    re-establish the White House Task Force on New Americans to welcome
    and support new immigrants, including refugees, and catalyze State
    and local integration and inclusion efforts.
-   **Supporting individuals seeking protection and safety.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration has provided continued protection
    through [Temporary Protected Status
    (TPS)](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status),
    including to individuals from Nepal and Afghanistan; the President
    designated certain residents of Hong Kong for Deferred Enforced
    Departure.
-   **Supporting Dreamers**. In May 2024, HHS published a [final
    rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/05/03/hhs-finalizes-policies-increase-access-health-coverage-daca-recipients.html)
    to extend healthcare benefits to Deferred Action for Childhood
    Arrivals (DACA) recipients. The Administration continues to
    vigorously defend DACA against legal challenges.
-   **Protecting children from aging out of green card eligibility.** 
    The Biden-Harris Administration issued [new policy
    guidance](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-manual-updates/20230214-CSPA.pdf)
    to protect more children who entered the U.S. lawfully and are
    waiting with their parents in the immigrant visa backlogs from aging
    out of green card eligibility.
