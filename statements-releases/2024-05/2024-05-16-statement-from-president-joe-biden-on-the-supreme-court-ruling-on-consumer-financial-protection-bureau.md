title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Supreme Court Ruling on Consumer\
  \ Financial Protection\_Bureau"
---
 
Today’s Supreme Court ruling is an unmistakable win for American
consumers. Since President Obama and I created it in the wake of the
Great Recession, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has
worked to protect consumers from abusive practices by lenders,
servicers, and special interests, and has lowered costs for hardworking
families by going after junk fees. Under my Administration, the CFPB has
delivered: providing nearly $9 billion in consumer relief and working to
save consumers $20 billion per year going forward on credit card late
fees, overdraft fees, and other junk fees.

Every step of the way, while the CFPB and I have fought for the middle
class, Republicans in Congress and in states across the country have
stood with special interests who want to keep ripping families off. In
the face of years of attacks from extreme Republicans and special
interests, the Court made clear that the CFPB’s funding authority is
constitutional and that its strong record of consumer protection will
not be undone.
