title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Investing in America Agenda is Helping\
  \ American Families Across the Country Save\_Money"
---
 
Through President Biden’s historic Investing in America agenda, the
Biden-Harris Administration is cutting costs for hardworking American
families in every corner of the country. President Biden’s Inflation
Reduction Act, the largest-ever investment in clean energy and climate
action, is already helping lower both the upfront cost of installing
clean energy technologies and reducing housing costs by lowering monthly
energy bills and increasing efficiency after installation. Tax credits
that save families up to 30% off home energy technologies like heat
pumps, rooftop solar, and energy efficiency improvements like insulation
are currently available—and Americans were able to claim those enhanced
tax credits for the first time on Tax Day in April:

-   Families who install an efficient electric heat pump for heating and
    cooling
    can [receive](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/frequently-asked-questions-about-energy-efficient-home-improvements-and-residential-clean-energy-property-credits-energy-efficient-home-improvement-credit-qualifying-expenditures-and-credit-amount) a [tax
    credit](https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/making-our-homes-more-efficient-clean-energy-tax-credits-consumers) of
    up to $2,000 and save [an average of
    $500](https://www.energy.gov/articles/pump-your-savings-heat-pumps#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20size%20of,average%20over%20%24500%20per%20year%20.) per
    year on energy bills.
-   Families who make other energy efficiency improvements
    can [receive](https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/making-our-homes-more-efficient-clean-energy-tax-credits-consumers) [tax
    credits](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/frequently-asked-questions-about-energy-efficient-home-improvements-and-residential-clean-energy-property-credits-energy-efficient-home-improvement-credit-qualifying-expenditures-and-credit-amount) worth
    up to $500 for doors, $600 for windows, $150 for a [home energy
    audit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/home-energy-audits-may-qualify-for-an-energy-efficient-home-improvement-credit), and
    up to 30 percent off the cost of new insulation—a total of up to
    $1,200 per year in tax credits.
-   Families who install [rooftop solar, geothermal or battery
    storage](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics) at
    home can save up to 30 percent of the cost of the installation via
    a [tax
    credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/frequently-asked-questions-about-energy-efficient-home-improvements-and-residential-clean-energy-property-credits-residential-clean-energy-property-credit-qualifying-expenditures-and-credit-amount).
    For rooftop solar, that can save Americans an average of $7,500 off
    the cost of installation and
    nearly [$400](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/articles/inflation-reduction-act-2022-what-it-means-you#:~:text=Considering%20the%20upfront%20cost%20and%20average%20expected%20savings,lifetime%20of%20the%20system%2C%20or%20nearly%20%24400%20annually.) per
    year on their energy bills.

In addition, several states are expected to launch their home energy
rebate programs, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, this summer.
These rebate programs will help low- and middle-income families buy and
install cost-saving electric appliances and make energy efficiency
improvements to save money on their home energy bills. These rebates can
be paired with the existing tax credits to further lower costs for
Americans. Already, 14 states have submitted applications to the
Department of Energy (DOE) for their rebate programs, and DOE has
approved New York’s application. You can track your state’s progress
toward setting up its rebate
program [here](https://www.energy.gov/save/rebates).  
  
**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is convening federal partners,
nonprofits, consumer lending organizations, and philanthropies** [**for
the second
time**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/12/fact-sheet-lowering-home-energy-costs-through-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act/)**to
drive consumer education and outreach efforts on the Inflation Reduction
Act’s consumer home energy savings tax credits and rebates.** Today’s
convening specifically focuses on bridging gaps in financing to ensure
that more low- and middle-income families can afford to install
cost-saving clean energy at home.  
  
**The Biden-Harris Administration is making new federal resources about
Inflation Reduction Act home energy programs available for consumers,
local officials, and advocates.** In addition, nonprofit organizations
are announcing commitments to expand their outreach and financing
efforts.  
  
**A majority of Americans support the cost-savings programs advanced by
the Biden-Harris Administration**—according to a [July 2023
poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2023/08/04/july-13-23-2023-washington-post-university-maryland-climate-poll/),
65 percent of Americans support tax credits to install solar panels and
54 percent support tax credits to buy heat pumps. Yet Republicans in
Congress continue to fight to repeal these popular provisions, which
would increase costs for hardworking Americans, offshore jobs, and
worsen the climate crisis. President Biden will continue blocking
Congressional Republicans from repealing these critical programs, which
are cutting costs for American families and protecting the planet for
current and future generations.  
  
**Congressional Republicans have no plan to lower costs. In fact, their
plan raises cost for working families by:**

-   Increasing costs for health care, prescription drugs, and insulin by
    repealing the Inflation Reduction Act and Affordable Care Act and
    slashing Medicare.
-   Increasing utility bills and energy costs by repealing the Inflation
    Reduction Act.
-   Raising taxes for middle-class families by repealing the Inflation
    Reduction Act and the Affordable Care Act.
-   Raising housing costs by cutting rental assistance and programs to
    build new homes.

***<u>The Biden-Harris Administration Is Helping American Families
Access Clean Energy</u>***  
  
Since the last consumer-focused convening in February, the federal
government has made new resources available for Americans to learn more
about how to save money through the Inflation Reduction Act:

-   In April, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced
    selectees for $20 billion in awards from the Inflation Reduction Act
    through the [**Greenhouse Gas Reduction
    Fund**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/04/biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-20-billion-in-awards-to-expand-access-to-clean-energy-and-climate-solutions-and-lower-energy-costs-for-communities-across-the-nation/),
    which will stand up a national clean energy financing network. Many
    of those selectees are community lenders that will help bridge
    financing gaps for consumers so they can afford the full cost of
    installing clean energy technologies at home.  
-   The Department of Energy (DOE) has published a **[consumer bill of
    rights](https://www.energy.gov/scep/articles/home-energy-rebates-program-inflation-reduction-act-sections-50121-and-50122-consumer)**
    for states to protect consumers as they launch their home energy
    rebate programs.  
-   DOE has published a **[door
    hanger](https://www.energy.gov/scep/articles/door-hanger-new-tax-credits-can-save-you-money)**
    detailing the tax credits consumers can receive from the Inflation
    Reduction Act for installing heat pumps or rooftop solar, making
    energy efficiency improvements, or buying an electric vehicle.  
-   DOE’s Office of State and Community Energy Programs is using the
    [**Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD)
    tool**](https://www.energy.gov/scep/low-income-energy-affordability-data-lead-tool-and-community-energy-solutions)
    to help local governments, advocates, and funders identify
    low-income and high energy burden communities that can benefit most
    from the Inflation Reduction Act and other home energy programs.  
-   Last week, the Treasury Department published new **one-pagers for
    consumers** to learn about the Inflation Reduction Act’s [Energy
    Efficient Home Improvement
    Credit](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5967.pdf) and [Residential
    Clean Energy Credit](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5968.pdf),
    building off their existing resource hub, treasury.gov/IRA.  
-   EPA’s ENERGY STAR program is kicking off a multi-year **national
    consumer educational campaign** to generate excitement about the
    clean energy future to inspire audiences to learn more and take
    action leveraging incentives included in the Inflation Reduction
    Act. The campaign builds awareness with an inspirational
    [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEPfMvWcM04) and is
    supported with social media ads and display banners – all driving to
    energystar.gov/HomeSavings for zip-code level information about
    available incentives.

***<u>Expanding Consumer Outreach and Financing Efforts Across
America</u>***  
  
Today, several nonprofits, universities, and community organizations are
announcing new and expanded efforts to reach consumers across the
country on the Inflation Reduction Act’s consumer home energy programs:

-   **Civic Nation **will launch a national public education campaign to
    help consumers learn about and benefit from the Inflation Reduction
    Act’s consumer tax credits and rebates as they become available. The
    campaign will convene a diverse coalition of stakeholders and
    trusted messengers from across sectors, including national
    nonprofits, companies, media platforms, community-based
    organizations, elected leaders, faith-based groups and more. The
    campaign will mobilize this coalition of trusted messengers around
    major moments beginning this summer.  
-   **What Works+ **and **Invest in Our Future** are announcing that
    philanthropic organizations have supported clean energy work in
    nearly 500 places across the United States, and are more than
    halfway toward achieving a goal of supporting 1500 projects,
    including consumer-focused activities.  
-   **WorkMoney** launched a one-stop shop for cost savings that
    consumers can access online, as well as by phone and text message.
    WorkMoney is offering personalized, human support to connect
    individuals to new and/or underutilized government programs,
    including existing federal tax credits and upcoming state rebates.
    As part of this launch, WorkMoney is scaling its public
    communications effort across the country to educate the public and
    the organization’s 6+ million members about this service that will
    put money back in consumers’ pockets.  
-   The **Community Foundation Climate Collaborative (CFCC)’s** network
    of 50+ community foundations across the country has shared best
    practices about how to raise awareness about clean energy
    opportunities for the communities they serve. CFCC has hosted a
    series of learning sessions on federal funding topics including
    time-sensitive climate funding opportunities, Direct Pay, and
    federal application readiness. Through its five Regional Action
    Networks, CFCC has also held regional meetings to provide education
    on federal funding opportunities and promote technical assistance
    opportunities, and will continue to host upcoming workshops focused
    on how schools, local governments, community institutions and
    non-profit partners can take advantage of direct pay to implement
    clean energy projects faster and at lower cost.  
-   The **McKnight Foundation** is funding a number of technical
    assistance initiatives, including the Chisholm Legacy Project – to
    support Black-led cities across the Midwest to apply for federal
    funding and access Inflation Reduction Act incentives; CALSTART – to
    help municipalities across the Midwest leverage federal resources to
    adopt zero-emissions vehicle technologies; Clean Energy Resource
    Teams (CERTs) – who has deployed a network of over 900 “ambassadors”
    across Minnesota sharing IRA-related resources with their local
    communities; and a Minnesota Technical Assistance Collaboration – a
    statewide network of technical assistance providers to facilitate
    deep coordination in the field, share resources, and align
    strategies to prioritize and maximize their support of BIPOC
    communities, rural local governments, and low-wealth communities.  
-   **Rewiring America**, a nonprofit working to equitably electrify our
    homes, businesses, and communities, has developed free tools for
    homeowners and renters to access electrification incentives that
    help make important home and vehicle upgrades more affordable,
    including a calculator that features comprehensive federal, state,
    local, and utility information in eight states, with broad coverage
    across the country by the end of the year. In addition, Rewiring
    America is part of the Power Forward Communities coalition that was
    awarded $2 billion from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to help
    weatherize and decarbonize American homes. The coalition is
    committed to investing at least 75 percent of financial assistance
    made possible by this grant in low-income and disadvantaged
    communities — nearly twice the EPA’s Justice 40 mandate.  
-   **University of New Hampshire** is working with Greenhouse Gas
    Reduction Fund awardees to develop training and shared
    infrastructure that will help more borrowers quickly and
    cost-effectively access the financing they need to make home energy
    transitions.  
-   **MariSol Federal Credit Union**, based in Phoenix, Arizona, is
    educating its members and local home energy contractors about the
    Inflation Reduction Act’s consumer incentives, and helping members
    take advantage of the programs through its Smart E Energy Efficient
    Loan and Smart E Solar Loan products
