title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019\
  s Historic Investments in\_HBCUs"
---
 
As a proud graduate of Howard University, I know firsthand that our
HBCUs are centers of academic excellence. For generations, these anchors
of our communities have played a pivotal role in building and
contributing to America’s leadership at home and abroad. Today,
graduates from our Nation’s more than 100 HBCUs are in every room where
important decisions are made – leading in our schools, hospitals,
courtrooms, boardrooms, and at the highest levels of government. And as
we look forward, we know that our HBCUs will continue to prepare young
leaders to build a better, more just future for our country and the
world.   
   
That is why President Biden and I have delivered an unprecedented $16
billion to our Nation’s HBCUs. This historic investment is
transformative – from helping to fund cutting-edge research and making
long-overdue renovations, to providing mental health resources and
ensuring students have access to every opportunity to thrive. We have
also delivered the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade as we
work to make higher education more affordable. I have witnessed the
direct impact of these record investments while meeting with thousands
of HBCU students as Vice President, including during my Fight for Our
Freedoms college tour last fall.  
   
President Biden and I remain committed to using every lever available to
support HBCUs and the students and communities they serve. We know that
when we invest in the success of our HBCUs, we are investing in the
strength of our Nation – today and for generations to come.
