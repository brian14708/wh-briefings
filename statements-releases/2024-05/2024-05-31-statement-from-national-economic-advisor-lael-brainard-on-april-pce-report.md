title: "Statement from National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard on April PCE\_Report"
---
 
The cost of living is still too high for too many working families, but
today’s PCE report shows continued progress bringing down inflation.
Annual core inflation is at its lowest level since March 2021, and
overall inflation is down 60 percent from its peak. President Biden is
going to keep fighting to lower costs, while congressional Republicans
fight to cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.
