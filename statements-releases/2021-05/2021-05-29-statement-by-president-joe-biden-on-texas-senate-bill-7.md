title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Texas Senate Bill\_7"
---
 
Today, Texas legislators put forth a bill that joins Georgia and Florida
in advancing a state law that attacks the sacred right to vote. It’s
part of an assault on democracy that we’ve seen far too often this
year—and often disproportionately targeting Black and Brown Americans.

It’s wrong and un-American. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we should be
making it easier, not harder, for every eligible voter to vote.

I call again on Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. And I continue to call on all
Americans, of every party and persuasion, to stand up for our democracy
and protect the right to vote and the integrity of our elections.
