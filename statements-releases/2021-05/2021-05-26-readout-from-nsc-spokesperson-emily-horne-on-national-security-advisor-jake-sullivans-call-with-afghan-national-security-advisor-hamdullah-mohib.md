National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with Afghan National
Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib.  Mr. Sullivan emphasized that the
United States will remain deeply engaged with the Government of
Afghanistan and the Afghan people, as U.S. troops depart the country. 
He and Dr. Mohib reaffirmed the enduring strength of the bilateral
partnership and committed to continue to consult closely.  Mr. Sullivan
outlined U.S. plans to continue security assistance to Afghan National
Defense and Security Forces, as well as civilian assistance to help the
Afghan people.  The National Security Advisors agreed on the importance
of the two governments continuing to work closely together in support of
common objectives, including a negotiated political settlement that ends
the war in Afghanistan.  Mr. Sullivan underscored that the United States
will stand firmly with the Afghan people as they seek to achieve a
durable and inclusive peace.
