title: 'FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Launches a Call to Action to the Private
  Sector to Deepen Investment in the Northern Triangle'
---
 
***12 companies and organizations announce commitments to support
economic development in the Northern Triangle, as part of the Call to
Action launch***

In her role overseeing diplomatic efforts within El Salvador, Guatemala,
and Honduras (the “Northern Triangle”), and with Mexico, Vice President
Kamala Harris announced today a *Call to Action* for businesses and
social enterprises to make new, significant commitments to help send a
signal of hope to the people of the region and sustainably address the
root causes of migration by promoting economic opportunity. As part of
this *Call to Action* launch, 12 companies and organizations announced
commitments to support inclusive economic development in the Northern
Triangle, including: Accion, Bancolombia, Chobani, Davivienda, Duolingo,
the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Mastercard, Microsoft,
Nespresso, Pro Mujer, the Tent Partnership for Refugees, and the World
Economic Forum.

Our comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of migration will
involve significant commitments of U.S. government resources to support
the long-term development of the region—including efforts to foster
economic opportunity, strengthen governance, combat corruption, and
improve security. This approach will leverage commitments and resources
from the governments in the Northern Triangle, as well as partnerships
with multilateral development banks and international financial
institutions.

Supporting the long-term development of the region, and in the Western
Hemisphere more broadly, will require more than just the resources of
the U.S. government. For this reason, Vice President Harris is calling
on the private sector to draw on its unique resources and expertise to
make commitments to support inclusive economic growth in the Northern
Triangle. Together, we can work to overcome obstacles to investment,
promote economic opportunity, and support long-term development in the
region.  The Administration looks forward to increased collaboration
with private companies—U.S., foreign, and local in the Northern Triangle
and Latin America more broadly—to build upon this *Call to Action* in
the months and years to come. 

**U.S. Government Long-Term Commitments and *Call to Action* Focus
Areas**

This *Call to Action* is one component under the U.S. government’s
comprehensive, long-term strategy to address barriers to investment and
to promote economic opportunity in the Northern Triangle. Just as
government action alone will not be enough to achieve meaningful
outcomes, private sector commitments will be facilitated and supported
by strong U.S. government initiatives to address longstanding
impediments to investment-led growth. Under our broader strategy,
near-term private sector commitments will be mutually reinforced by
sustained U.S. government efforts to foster a business-enabling
environment, increased private sector investment, and sustainable
economic growth and opportunity. As part of the broader strategy,
this *Call to Action *aims to generate new commitments from businesses
and social enterprises in six focus areas with an emphasis on supporting
vulnerable populations, including women and youth, in the Northern
Triangle region. These focus areas include:

-   **Reform Agenda –** Commitments to support greater transparency,
    predictability, and stability in the business enabling environment
    by facilitating regional government efforts to adopt international
    best practices in licensing, permitting, procurement, regulation,
    and taxation.  
-   **Digital and Financial Inclusion –** Commitments to expand
    affordable internet access and participation in the digital economy;
    facilitate access to financial technologies and capital for small
    businesses, particularly women- and indigenous-owned businesses; and
    ensure that the most vulnerable and the most likely to migrate have
    access to basic public services and financial institutions.

<!-- -->

-   **Food Security and Climate-smart Agriculture** **–** Commitments to
    combat food shortages by increasing agricultural productivity and
    crop resilience.

<!-- -->

-   **Climate Adaptation and Clean Energy –** Commitments to support the
    region’s resilience to climate change through adaptation and
    mitigation efforts; support industries impacted by climate change;
    and transition to clean energy.

<!-- -->

-   **Education and Workforce Development** – Commitments to expand
    job-training programs; support greater access to technical and
    secondary education; and create higher paying formal sector jobs,
    especially for women and in rural areas.

<!-- -->

-   **Public Health Access** – Commitments to support regional
    governments in addressing the impact of COVID-19 on their
    populations; build robust and resilient health economies to confront
    future health challenges; support access to clean water and
    sanitation; and ensure inclusive access to healthcare.

operations. Chobani will use knowledge from its global incubator program

empowerment. In the U.S., the Chobani Incubator has helped support the

smallholder farmers and replicating the social and environmental impact
of Nespresso’s programs in more communities. The company aims to support

opportunities for women in Latin America by providing millions of

network to raise awareness of the root causes of migration and how
companies can help improve conditions in Central America, for example by
supporting education outcomes, creating jobs and entrepreneurship
opportunities in the region, as well as sourcing more products from the
