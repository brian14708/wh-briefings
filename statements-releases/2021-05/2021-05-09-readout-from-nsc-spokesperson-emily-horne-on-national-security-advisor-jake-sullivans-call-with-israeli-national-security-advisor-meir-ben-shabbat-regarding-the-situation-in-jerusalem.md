National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with
Israeli National Security Advisor Meir Ben-Shabbat to express the United
States’ serious concerns about the situation in Jerusalem, including
violent confrontations at the Haram al-Sharif / Temple Mount during the
last days of Ramadan.

Mr. Sullivan highlighted recent engagements by senior U.S. officials
with senior Israeli and Palestinian officials and key regional
stakeholders to press for steps to ensure calm, deescalate tensions, and
denounce violence. Mr. Sullivan also reiterated the United States’
serious concerns about the potential evictions of Palestinian families
from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. They agreed that the
launching of rocket attacks and incendiary balloons from Gaza towards
Israel is unacceptable and must be condemned.

Mr. Sullivan encouraged the Israeli government to pursue appropriate
measures to ensure calm during Jerusalem Day commemorations.

Mr. Sullivan expressed the administration’s commitment to Israel’s
security and to supporting peace and stability throughout the Middle
East, and assured Mr. Ben-Shabbat that the U.S. will remain fully
engaged in the days ahead to promote calm in Jerusalem.
