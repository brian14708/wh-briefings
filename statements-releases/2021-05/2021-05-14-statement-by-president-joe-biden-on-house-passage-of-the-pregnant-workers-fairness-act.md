  \ Fairness\_Act"

I applaud Chairman Nadler, Chairman Scott, and Ranking Member Katko for
their leadership in passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a long
overdue bipartisan effort to ensure equal protection in the workforce
for women who are pregnant.

Across our country, too many pregnant workers are forced to choose
between their health and a paycheck. They can be fired for taking too
many bathroom breaks, or forced to go on unpaid leave due solely to
being pregnant. These practices are unfair and often dangerous. My
Administration has made it a priority to support the health and economic
security of pregnant workers — particularly women of color, who
experience unconscionably high rates of maternal mortality. It is long
past time that all workplaces treat pregnant employees with dignity,
respect, and fairness.

Today’s bipartisan passage of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act in the
House of Representatives marks a significant step forward on that
front. I urge the Senate to act swiftly to pass this commonsense bill,
and stand up for the health and economic security of pregnant workers
and their families.
