title: A Letter on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Yemen
---
 
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 of
May 16, 2012, with respect to Yemen is to continue in effect beyond
May 16, 2021.  

The actions and policies of certain former members of the Government of
Yemen and others continue to threaten Yemen’s peace, security, and
stability.  These actions include obstructing the political process in
Yemen and the implementation of the agreement of November 23, 2011,
between the Government of Yemen and those in opposition to it, which
provided for a peaceful transition of power that meets the legitimate
demands and aspirations of the Yemeni people.  For this reason, I have
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to Yemen.

  
                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. 

  
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    May 11, 2021.
