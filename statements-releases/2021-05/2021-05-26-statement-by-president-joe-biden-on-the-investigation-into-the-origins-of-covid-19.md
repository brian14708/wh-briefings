title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Investigation into the Origins of\_\
  COVID-\u206019"
---
 
Back in early 2020, when COVID-19 emerged, I called for the CDC to get
access to China to learn about the virus so we could fight it more
effectively. The failure to get our inspectors on the ground in those
early months will always hamper any investigation into the origin of
COVID-19.  
   
Nevertheless, shortly after I became President, in March, I had my
National Security Advisor task the Intelligence Community to prepare a
report on their most up-to-date analysis of the origins of COVID-19,
including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal
or from a laboratory accident. I received that report earlier this
month, and asked for additional follow-up. As of today, the U.S.
Intelligence Community has “coalesced around two likely scenarios” but
has not reached a definitive conclusion on this question. Here is their
current position: “while two elements in the IC leans toward the former
scenario and one leans more toward the latter – each with low or
moderate confidence – the majority of elements do not believe there is
sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the
other.”  
   
I have now asked the Intelligence Community to redouble their efforts to
collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a
definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days. As part of
that report, I have asked for areas of further inquiry that may be
required, including specific questions for China. I have also asked that
this effort include work by our National Labs and other agencies of our
government to augment the Intelligence Community’s efforts. And I have
asked the Intelligence Community to keep Congress fully apprised of its
work.  
   
The United States will also keep working with like-minded partners
around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent,
evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all
relevant data and evidence.
