title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Rise of Anti-Semitic\_Attacks"

In the last weeks, our nation has seen a series of anti-Semitic attacks,
targeting and terrorizing American Jews.

We have seen a brick thrown through window of a Jewish-owned business in
Manhattan, a swastika carved into the door of a synagogue in Salt Lake
City, families threatened outside a restaurant in Los Angeles, and
museums in Florida and Alaska, dedicated to celebrating Jewish life and
culture and remembering the Holocaust, vandalized with anti-Jewish
messages.

These attacks are despicable, unconscionable, un-American, and they must
stop.

I will not allow our fellow Americans to be intimidated or attacked
because of who they are or the faith they practice.

We cannot allow the toxic combination of hatred, dangerous lies, and
conspiracy theories to put our fellow Americans at risk.

As Attorney General Garland announced yesterday, the Department of
Justice will be deploying all of the tools at its disposal to combat
hate crimes.

In recent days, we have seen that no community is immune. We must all
stand together to silence these terrible and terrifying echoes of the
worst chapters in world history, and pledge to give hate no safe harbor.

May is Jewish American Heritage Month, when we honor Jewish Americans
who have inextricably woven their experience and their accomplishments
into the fabric of our national identity; overcoming the pain of
history, and helping lead our struggle for a more fair, just, and
tolerant society.

Let us all take up that work and create a nation that stands for, and
stands up for, the dignity and safety of all of our people.
