---
 
Today, President Biden met with six DACA recipients who work in health
care, education, and agriculture to discuss their experiences on the
frontlines of the pandemic. President Biden reiterated his support for
Dreamers, TPS holders, farmworkers, and other essential immigrant
workers. The President and the Dreamers also discussed the continued
need for immigration reform and the White Houseâ€™s strong support for the
Dream and Promise Act and the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, two
bills that have already passed the House with bipartisan support and are
awaiting action in the Senate.
