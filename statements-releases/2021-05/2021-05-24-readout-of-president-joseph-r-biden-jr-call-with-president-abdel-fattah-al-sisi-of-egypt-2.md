President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Abdel Fattah
Al Sisi of Egypt. President Biden thanked Egypt for its successful
diplomacy and coordination with the United States to end the recent
hostilities in Israel and Gaza and ensure violence does not reoccur. The
two leaders consulted on the urgent need to deliver humanitarian
assistance to those in need in Gaza and to support rebuilding efforts in
a manner that benefits the people there and not Hamas. President Biden
said he has asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken to visit the region
for follow up on these urgent needs. Regarding the Grand Ethiopian
Renaissance Dam, President Biden acknowledged Egypt’s concerns about
access to Nile River waters and underscored the U.S. interest in
achieving a diplomatic resolution that meets the legitimate needs of
Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. The two leaders also discussed their
commitment to upholding Libyan plans for national elections in December
and the removal of all foreign military and irregular forces from Libya.
They also affirmed their support for the Iraqi government’s efforts to
strengthen Iraq’s full sovereignty and independence. President Biden
underscored the importance of a constructive dialogue on human rights in
Egypt. The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a strong and
productive U.S.-Egypt partnership.
