  \ with Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay\_Patrushev"
---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and the Secretary of the Russian
Security Council Nikolay Patrushev held consultations on United
States-Russia relations as part of regular Security Council
contacts. The meeting was a logical continuation of the recent
discussions held in Reykjavik between Secretary of State Blinken and
Foreign Minister Lavrov.

The meeting was an important step in the preparation for a planned
U.S.-Russia summit, the date and location of which will be announced
later.

The discussions were held in a constructive manner and, despite
outstanding differences, allowed for a better understanding of each
other’s positions.

A wide range of issues of mutual interest were discussed with a high
priority given to the topic of strategic stability. The sides expressed
confidence that mutually acceptable solutions could be found in a number
of areas.

The sides agreed that a normalization of U.S.-Russian relations would be
in the interest of both countries and contribute to global
predictability and stability.
