title: "Statement\_by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\_in Support of Washington State\u2019\
  s Overtime Bill for Farm\_Workers"
---
 
I congratulate the Washington State legislature and Governor Jay Inslee
for signing into law SB 5172, Washington’s Overtime Bill for
Agricultural Workers, which will help more than 100,000 farmworkers
secure the overtime pay they deserve.  Agricultural workers in
Washington and across the country have helped carry our nation through
this pandemic — working long hours, often at great personal risk, to
meet the needs of their communities and keep America healthy and
well-nourished.  These overtime protections will ensure that
agricultural workers in Washington are paid for all of the vital work
they do.  
  
For too long — and owing in large part to unconscionable race-based
exclusions put in place generations ago — farmworkers have been denied
some of the most fundamental rights that workers in almost every other
sector have long enjoyed, including the right to a forty-hour work week
and overtime pay.  I was proud to stand with farmworkers during the
Obama-Biden Administration, when California passed the nation’s first
farmworker overtime bill, and I am proud to stand with the farmworkers
of Washington State today.  It is long past time that we put all of
America’s farmworkers on an equal footing with the rest of our national
workforce when it comes to their basic rights — and I urge Congress to
pass HR 1177, the U.S. Citizenship Act, and the Farm Workforce
Modernization Act, so that we can extend those rights to farmworkers in
all fifty states.
