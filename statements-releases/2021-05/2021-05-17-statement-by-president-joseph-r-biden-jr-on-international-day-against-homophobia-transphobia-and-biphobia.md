title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on International Day Against Homophobia,\
  \ Transphobia and\_Biphobia"
---
 
Jill and I are proud to recognize the International Day Against
Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia — the anniversary of the day in
1990 when the World Health Organization took the long overdue step of
declassifying ‘homosexuality’ as a mental disorder. 

So much has changed for the LGBTQI+ community since that day — not only
in our laws, but in the hearts and minds of the American people. 
Courageous activists in America and around the world have championed
progress, and won.  Here at home, marriage equality and greater
protections against hate crimes are the law of the land.  Overseas,
foreign governments, civil societies, and international organizations
like the United Nations finally recognize that LGBTQI+ people are
deserving of the full measure of dignity and equality.

Despite this progress, both COVID-19 and rising authoritarianism around
the world continue to widen economic, social, and safety gaps for
LGBTQI+ people — and an epidemic of violence still rages, with a
particular impact on the transgender community, specifically transgender
women and girls of color.  Around the world, some 70 countries still
criminalize same-sex relationships.  And here at home, LGBTQI+ Americans
still lack basic protection in 25 states, and they continue to face
discrimination in housing, education, and public services.

My Administration will always stand with the LGBTQI+ community. 
Already, we have rolled back discriminatory polices targeting LGBTQI+
Americans, and we have made historic appointments of LGBTQI+ individuals
to the highest levels of our government.  We continue to implement my
executive orders to advance equality and equity.  And I continue to urge
Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would confirm critical civil
rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender
identity for all Americans.

Everyone is entitled to dignity and equality, no matter who they are,
whom they love, or how they identify — and we will continue to engage
with allies and partners to advance the human rights of LGBTQI+ people
here at home and in all corners of the world.
