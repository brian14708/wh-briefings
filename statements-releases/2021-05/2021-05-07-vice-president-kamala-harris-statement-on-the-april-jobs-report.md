title: Vice President Kamala Harris Statement on the April Jobs Report
---
 
Today’s jobs report is a reminder that even as we make progress, there’s
still a long climb ahead when it comes to ensuring good-paying jobs for
all Americans—especially women. The economy has created over 1.5 million
jobs during the past three months. But the country is still eight
million jobs short of where it was before the pandemic, and there are
still two million fewer women in the workforce today.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to address the mass
exodus of women from the workforce. The American Rescue Plan included
provisions designed to help women workers, including through assistance
for childcare, support for small businesses, and $1,400 checks. We are
beginning to see the impact of that relief—as well as our vaccination
effort—as more Americans go back to work.  
  
But more action is needed. Roughly five million women still can’t work
due to childcare issues. This reflects not just the ongoing acute
childcare crisis but longstanding structural barriers to families having
access to affordable childcare options. To that end, our American
Families Plan will lower the cost of childcare, making it possible for
more women to work. And our American Jobs Plan will help create millions
of good-paying jobs.  
  
When we lift up women, we lift up families and communities, and our
economy is stronger.
