Today, President Biden hosted Senators Capito, Barrasso, Blunt, Crapo,
Toomey, and Wicker for an in-depth meeting about the pressing need to
invest in American infrastructure, continuing the bipartisan
negotiations he’s been having on this leading priority for his
Administration.

These Senators are the Republican Ranking Members of the Senate
Committee on Environment and Public Works; the Senate Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources; the Senate Committee on Rules and
Administration; the Senate Committee on Finance; Senate Committee on
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; and the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the Chair of the Senate
Republican Policy Committee.

The President thanked each of them for their engagement and underlined
his commitment to historic funding for infrastructure that will deliver
for America’s middle class and help the country come back stronger from
the economic harm caused by the coronavirus crisis. He also stressed
that inaction was a red line for him and that he wanted to see real
progress toward a potential bipartisan deal by Memorial Day.

President Biden and the six Senators agreed to stay in touch and follow
up on their conversation next week. The President will be in touch with
Senator Capito about further talks. There will also be additional
communication at the staff level.

This follows yesterday’s productive meeting with the bipartisan
Leadership of both Chambers of Congress, during which infrastructure was
a major subject.
