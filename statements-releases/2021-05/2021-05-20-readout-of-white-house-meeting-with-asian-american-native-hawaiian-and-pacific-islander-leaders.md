title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and\
  \ Pacific Islander\_Leaders"

Today, White House officials including Susan Rice, Cedric Richmond,
Erika Moritsugu and Howard Ou hosted Asian American, Native Hawaiian,
and Pacific Islander (AA and NH/PI) leaders to discuss the Biden-Harris
Administration’s historic commitment to combat anti-Asian racism,
xenophobia, hate and violence. After a year of rising anti-Asian hate
incidents and crimes and the tragic shootings in Atlanta and
Indianapolis that targeted women of Asian descent and Sikh Americans,
the White House convened philanthropic and business leaders, including
the Asian American Foundation, to discuss the role they can play in
supporting AA and NH/PI advocacy, power, and representation. During the
meeting, the business and philanthropic participants announced a private
funding commitment of more than $1 billion to combat anti-AAPI hate, and
advance research and public education on AA and NH/PI communities. Their
announcement today is the largest philanthropic commitment in history
fully focused on supporting AA and NH/PI communities.   
  
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris also visited with
these leaders to emphasize their Administration’s commitment to AA and
NH/PI communities, and to acknowledge the importance of standing up
against hate crimes and advancing racial equity.
