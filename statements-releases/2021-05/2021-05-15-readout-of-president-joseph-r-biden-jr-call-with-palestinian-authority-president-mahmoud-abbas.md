President Biden spoke today with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud
Abbas to convey the U.S. commitment to strengthening the
U.S.-Palestinian partnership. They discussed the current tensions in
Jerusalem and the West Bank and expressed their shared desire for
Jerusalem to be a place of peaceful coexistence for people of all faiths
and backgrounds. President Biden updated President Abbas on U.S.
diplomatic engagement on the ongoing conflict and stressed the need for
Hamas to cease firing rockets into Israel. They expressed their shared
concern that innocent civilians, including children, have tragically
lost their lives amidst the ongoing violence. The President expressed
his support for steps to enable the Palestinian people to enjoy the
dignity, security, freedom, and economic opportunity that they deserve.
In that regard, he highlighted the recent U.S. decision to resume
assistance to the Palestinian people, including economic and
humanitarian assistance to benefit Palestinians in the West bank and
Gaza. The President also underscored his strong commitment to a
negotiated two-state solution as the best path to reach a just and
lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
