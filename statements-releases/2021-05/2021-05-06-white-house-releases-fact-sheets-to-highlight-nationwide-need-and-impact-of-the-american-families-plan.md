title: White House Releases Fact Sheets to Highlight Nationwide Need and Impact of
  the American Families Plan
---
 
Today, the White House released fact sheets that highlight the need for
and impact of the investments proposed by President Biden in the
American Families Plan in states and territories across the country. The
[American Families
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/)
is a once-in-a-generation investment in the foundations of middle-class
prosperity: education, health care, and child care.

The fact sheets highlight how many families would benefit from free
community college and universal pre-K, the high costs of child care, the
number of workers who lack access to paid family leave, and the
thousands of dollars families and workers would save in tax cuts and
credits.

Individual fact sheets for each of the 50 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories are linked below.  
  
These fact sheets are the latest in a series from the White House
highlighting the benefits of the American Families Plan for communities,
in addition to a series of fact sheets on the [American Jobs
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/12/white-house-releases-state-by-state-fact-sheets-to-highlight-nationwide-need-for-the-american-jobs-plan/).
Fact sheets on how the American Families Plan advances racial equity and
supports rural America have been released in recent weeks.**
