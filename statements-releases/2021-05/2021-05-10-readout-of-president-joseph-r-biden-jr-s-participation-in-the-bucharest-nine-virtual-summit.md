President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with NATO’s eastern flank
Allies in a virtual summit of the Bucharest Nine (B9) countries hosted
by Presidents Klaus Iohannis of Romania and Andrzej Duda of Poland.
President Biden underscored his commitment to rebuilding alliances and
strengthening Transatlantic relations. He conveyed his desire for closer
cooperation with our nine Allies in Central Europe and the Baltic and
Black Sea regions on the full range of challenges, including global
health security, climate change, energy security, and global economic
recovery. President Biden expressed his support for enhancing NATO’s
deterrence and defense posture, as well as the importance of Allies
increasing their resilience against harmful economic and political
actions by our strategic competitors. In addition, he welcomed the
opportunity to engage with these Allies – as well as with NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg, who was also in attendance – about Alliance
efforts to meet future threats, which will be discussed at the June 14
NATO Summit.  Finally, President Biden stressed the importance of
strengthening democratic governance and rule of law – at home, within
the Alliance, and around the world.
