title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen Psaki on the United States Response to Belarus\u2019\
  s Forced Diversion of Ryanair Flight and Continuing Attack on Fundamental Freedoms"
---
 
Belarus’s forced diversion of a commercial Ryanair flight under false
pretenses, traveling between two member states of the European Union,
and the subsequent removal and arrest of Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian
journalist, are a direct affront to international norms. These events
took place amid an escalating wave of repression by the Lukashenka
regime against the aspirations of the people of Belarus for democracy
and human rights. In response to the events of May 23 and the Lukashenka
regime’s continuing attack on fundamental freedoms, the United States is
taking the following actions:

-   The United States has joined the public condemnation of the events
    of May 23 at the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security
    and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the International Civil Aviation
    Organization (ICAO), the Group of Seven (G7), and the North Atlantic
    Treaty Organization (NATO). We will continue to advocate at these
    bodies for action against the Lukashenka regime for its affront to
    international norms and undermining of democracy and human rights.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of State has issued a Level 4 Do Not Travel warning
    to U.S. citizens urging them not to travel to Belarus. The Federal
    Aviation Administration has issued a Notice to Airmen warning U.S.
    passenger carriers to exercise extreme caution when considering
    flying in Belarusian airspace.

<!-- -->

-   On June 3, 2021, the United States will re-impose full blocking
    sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises previously
    granted relief under a series of General Licenses by the Treasury
    Department. As a result of this measure, U.S. persons will be
    prohibited from engaging in transactions with these entities, their
    property, or their interests in property.

<!-- -->

-   The United States, in coordination with the EU and other partners
    and Allies, is developing a list of targeted sanctions against key
    members of the Lukashenka regime associated with ongoing abuses of
    human rights and corruption, the falsification of the 2020 election,
    and the events of May 23.

<!-- -->

-   The Treasury Department will develop for the President’s review a
    new Executive Order that will provide the United States increased
    authorities to impose sanctions on elements of the Lukashenka
    regime, its support network, and those that support corruption, the
    abuse of human rights, and attacks on democracy.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Justice, including the FBI, is working closely on
    this matter with our European counterparts.

<!-- -->

-   The United States will suspend its discretionary application of the
    2019 U.S-Belarus Air Services Agreement.

We take these measures, together with our partners and Allies, to hold
the regime accountable for its actions and to demonstrate our commitment
to the aspirations of the people of Belarus. We call on Lukashenka to
allow a credible international investigation into the events of May 23,
immediately release all political prisoners, and enter into a
comprehensive and genuine political dialogue with the leaders of the
democratic opposition and civil society groups that leads to the conduct
of free and fair Presidential elections under OSCE auspices and
monitoring.
