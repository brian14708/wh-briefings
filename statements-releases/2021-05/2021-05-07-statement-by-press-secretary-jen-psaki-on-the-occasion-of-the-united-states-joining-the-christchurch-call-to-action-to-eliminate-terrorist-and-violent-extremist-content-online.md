Today the United States announced that it will join the Christchurch
Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content
Online, a global pledge by member governments and technology partners to
work together to address terrorist and violent extremist content online.

Countering the use of the internet by terrorists and violent extremists
to radicalize and recruit is a significant priority for the United
States. Joining the coalition of governments and companies that have
endorsed the Christchurch Call to Action reinforces the need for
collective action.

The United States applauds language in the Christchurch Call emphasizing
the importance of respecting human rights and the rule of law, including
the protection of freedom of expression. In joining the Christchurch
Call, the United States will not take steps that would violate the
freedoms of speech and association protected by the First Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, nor violate reasonable expectations of privacy. 

The United States looks forward to participating in the Christchurch
Call Second Anniversary virtual summit on May 14.
