title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Refugee\_Admissions"
---
 
Today, I am revising the United States’ annual refugee admissions cap to
62,500 for this fiscal year. This erases the historically low number set
by the previous administration of 15,000, which did not reflect
America’s values as a nation that welcomes and supports refugees. The
new admissions cap will also reinforce efforts that are already underway
to expand the United States’ capacity to admit refugees, so that we can
reach the goal of 125,000 refugee admissions that I intend to set for
the coming fiscal year.

It is important to take this action today to remove any lingering doubt
in the minds of refugees around the world who have suffered so much, and
who are anxiously waiting for their new lives to begin.

The United States Refugee Admissions Program embodies America’s
commitment to protect the most vulnerable, and to stand as a beacon of
liberty and refuge to the world. It’s a statement about who we are, and
who we want to be. So we are going to rebuild what has been broken and
push hard to complete the rigorous screening process for those refugees
already in the pipeline for admission.

The sad truth is that we will not achieve 62,500 admissions this year.
We are working quickly to undo the damage of the last four years. It
will take some time, but that work is already underway. We have reopened
the program to new refugees. And by changing the regional allocations
last month, we have already increased the number of refugees ready for
departure to the United States.

The budget that I have submitted to Congress also reflects my commitment
to the goal of 125,000 refugee admissions in the first fiscal year of my
presidency. That goal will still be hard to hit. We might not make it
the first year. But we are going to use every tool available to help
these fully-vetted refugees fleeing horrific conditions in their home
countries. This will reassert American leadership and American values
when it comes to refugee admissions.
