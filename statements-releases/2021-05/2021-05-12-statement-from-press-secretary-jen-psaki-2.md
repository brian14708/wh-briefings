Last night, Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall and National
Economic Council Director Brian Deese convened the inter-agency
principals leading the administration’s whole of government response to
the Colonial Pipeline incident. The group discussed the latest updates
on fuel supply in the affected region, and steps that agencies have
taken and are considering to further alleviate the supply shortages.   
  
The Department of Transportation announced last night that they are
allowing Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi,
New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia to use Interstate
highways in their State to transport overweight loads of gasoline and
other fuels, under existing disaster declarations. And, the
Environmental Protection Agency issued a second emergency fuel waiver
expanding on a waiver that EPA issued yesterday morning for the District
of Columbia and areas of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The second
waiver waives the requirements for low volatility conventional gasoline
and Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) for the District of Columbia and areas
of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and also includes Alabama,
Delaware, Georgia, Specific Counties of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  
  
DOT’s Maritime Administration concluded their assessment of what assets
are available in the Jones Act fleet to carry petroleum products within
the Gulf, and from the Gulf up the Eastern Seaboard. The Department of
Homeland Security stands ready to review any temporary Jones Act waiver
requests from companies that demonstrate there is not sufficient
capacity on Jones Act-qualified vessels to carry fuel to the affected
region.
