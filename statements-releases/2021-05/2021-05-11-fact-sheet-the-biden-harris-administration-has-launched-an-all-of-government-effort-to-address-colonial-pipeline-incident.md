  \ Effort to Address Colonial Pipeline\_Incident"

*Action Update: May 11, 2021, 6:00 PM EDT*

The recent cyberattack targeting the Colonial Pipeline has triggered a
comprehensive federal response focused on securing critical energy
supply chains. President Biden is receiving regular briefings on the
incident and has directed agencies across the Federal Government to
bring their resources to bear to help alleviate shortages where they are
occurring. The Administration is focused on avoiding potential energy
supply disruptions to impacted communities, the U.S. military, and other
facilities reliant on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined
petroleum products. The Administration is continually assessing the
pipeline shutdown’s impact on the U.S. fuel supply, as well as what
additional actions are available to mitigate the impact of the
pipeline’s shutdown.

Among other things, the Biden-Harris Administration has mobilized a
robust federal response:

-   **Established an interagency response group to monitor and address
    the situation as swiftly as possible and ensure a continuing flow of
    fuel to affected communities.** In response to the Colonial Pipeline
    cyberattack, the White House has convened an interagency response
    group consisting of the Department of Justice (including the FBI),
    the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) including the
    Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the
    Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), the
    Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of the Treasury,
    the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA), and the White House Office of Management
    and Budget. The group regularly meets to assess the attack’s impacts
    on fuel supply and U.S. energy markets, and assess policy options.
    As part of the working group, and at the White House’s request,
    DOE’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency
    Response and the U.S. Energy Information Administration have
    conducted thorough analysis of potential impacts of the shutdown and
    assessed various options for mitigating those effects, including
    moving supplies by trucks or marine vessels. DOE, the FBI, and other
    working group members are working directly with the pipeline
    operator to provide any assistance they need to safely restart
    operation.
-   **Issued a targeted, one-week waiver allowing multiple states to
    temporarily use noncompliant fuel in an effort to boost available
    supply.** EPA and DOE evaluated the implications of the ransomware
    attack and determined that extreme and unusual fuel supply
    circumstances exist. In response, EPA Administrator Michael Reagan
    temporarily waived the federal Reid vapor pressure requirements for
    fuel sold in Reformulated Gasoline areas of District of Columbia,
    Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The EPA stands ready to issue
    waivers for other affected states expeditiously whenever those
    requests are received. Granting a temporary waiver will help
    increase supply of gasoline in the affected areas until normal
    supply to the region can be restored.
-   **Issued an “Hours of Service” waiver to provide greater flexibility
    to drivers transporting fuel.** To ensure fuel continues to flow to
    impacted communities as quickly as possible, the Department of
    Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)
    issued a temporary hours of service exemption providing greater
    flexibility to motor carriers and drivers transporting gasoline,
    diesel, jet fuel and other refined petroleum products. The waiver
    only applies to those transporting fuel to Alabama, Arkansas,
    District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
    Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West
    Virginia, and Virginia. The decision came after the U.S. Department
    of Transportation evaluated the current situation and determined
    that circumstances dictate providing industry flexibility. As DOT’s
    top priority is safety, FMCSA is working closely with state and
    industry partners to monitor driver work hours and conditions for
    the duration of the exemption.
-   **Launched an emergency effort to determine rail operators’ capacity
    to help transport fuel from ports inland and identify potential
    actions to enable this effort.** The Federal Railroad Administration
    is actively canvassing rail operators across the country to assess
    whether they can temporarily assist in the transportation of fuel
    from coastal ports to inland communities.
-   **Supported state efforts to allow higher weight limits for tank
    trucks.** North Carolina and Georgia issued waivers to allow higher
    weight limits for tank trucks, and DOT is working with the full list
    of potentially effected States to encourage this work, share
    information and best practices, and try to harmonize and align their
    efforts.
-   **Initiated a survey of Jones Act-qualified vessels to begin the
    process of evaluating what assets are available in the Jones Act
    fleet to carry petroleum products within the Gulf, and from the Gulf
    up the Eastern Seaboard.** DOT’s Maritime Administration is
    determining whether there is sufficient capacity on Jones
    Act-qualified vessels to carry needed fuel and to determine if a
    waiver is warranted. Authority to receive requests for and to
    approve waivers to the Jones Act belongs to the Department of
    Homeland Security.
-   **Temporarily relaxed enforcement of pipeline operator qualification
    rules to allow for use of emergency personnel that maybe needed to
    assist in the partial manual return-to-service.** DOT’s Pipeline and
    Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) recently
    determined that the emergency response effort may require service by
    pipeline personnel that may not fully meet federal operator
    qualification (OQ) and employment drug testing requirements. In
    light of the response and recovery efforts, PHMSA issued a notice
    advising Colonial Pipeline that it does not intend to take any
    enforcement action relating to noncompliance with operator
    qualification requirements arising from the use of personnel for
    pipeline activities related to the attack. This enforcement stay
    applies only to those areas where Colonial is faced with limited
    resources as a result of the impacts of the attack.
-   **Prepared to issue orders to direct Colonial Pipeline to prioritize
    fuel for destinations to address critical supply shortages.** FERC
    is positioned to issue orders quickly, should a company shipping
    product on the pipeline request it, to direct the pipeline to
    temporarily provide preference or priority in the transportation of
    product to serve the areas with the greatest need.
-   **Conducted regular outreach to state and local officials, Members
    of Congress, and impacted companies and retailers.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration is in regular contact with state and
    local governments, Members of Congress, retailers and companies in
    impacted sectors to assess the impact of the shutdown, offer
    emergency assistance, and gather feedback on next steps.
-   **Provided guidance on securing critical infrastructure.** The FBI
    recently released a FLASH alert for critical infrastructure owners
    and operators with indicators of compromise and mitigation measures
    if infected. The FBI has identified the ransomware as the Darkside
    variant, a ransomware as a service variant, where criminal
    affiliates conduct attacks and then share the proceeds with the
    ransomware developers. This alert will help other critical
    infrastructure owners and operators respond swiftly if they are
    targeted in future attacks. CISA, in partnership with DOE, is also
    communicating with industry to provide guidance on securing critical
    infrastructure, sharing details about the ransomware attack, and
    discussing recommended measures to mitigate further incidents. And,
    the Administration is working to help private sector companies like
    Colonial enhance their cybersecurity through the Industrial Control
    Systems Cybersecurity initiative, a collaborative effort between
    DOE, CISA, and the electricity industry to strengthen cybersecurity
    standards.
