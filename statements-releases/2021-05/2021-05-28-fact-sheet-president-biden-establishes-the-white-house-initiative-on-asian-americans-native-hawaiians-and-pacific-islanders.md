title: 'FACT SHEET: President Biden Establishes the White House Initiative on Asian
  Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders'
---
 
Today, President Biden will sign an Executive Order establishing the
White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific
Islanders, and delivering on the President’s commitment to reinstate and
reinvigorate this historic Initiative.

Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI)
communities together constitute the fastest growing ethnic group in the
United States and make invaluable contributions to our society, our
economy, and our culture. Yet for far too long, systemic barriers to
equity, justice, and opportunity have put the American dream out of
reach for many AA and NHPI communities, and racism, nativism, and
xenophobia against AA and NHPI communities continues to threaten safety
and dignity of AA and NHPI families. The new Initiative is charged with
driving an ambitious, whole-of-government agenda to advance equity,
justice, and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities by:

-   Helping to coordinate a comprehensive Federal response to the rise
    in acts of anti-Asian bias and violence
-   Addressing the systemic lack of disaggregated data on AA and NHPI
    communities in Federal statistical systems
-   Expanding language access and language assistance programs for AA
    and NHPI individuals across federal programs
-   Strengthening economic security and opportunity for AA and NHPI
    communities by empowering AA and NHPI entrepreneurs, building new
    workforce training opportunities, and promoting workplaces that are
    free from harassment against AA and NHPI workers
-   Addressing the concentration of poverty experienced in many AA and
    NHPI communities
-   Addressing disparities in educational outcomes for AA and NHPI
    students of all ages, and addressing bullying, harassment, and
    discrimination in our Nation’s schools
-   Advancing climate and environmental justice for AA and NHPI
    communities who are particularly impacted by the climate crisis and
    are overburdened by environmental degradation
-   Promoting inclusion and belonging for all AA and NHPI communities by
    strengthening public awareness and education about AA and NHPI
    communities, cultures, and traditions
-   Empowering AA and NHPI communities to be civically engaged,
    including through electoral participation
-   Building a Federal workforce where AA and NHPI public servants are
    leaders at the most senior levels of our government
-   Ensuring that AA and NHPI communities are empowered and equitably
    served by Federal funding, grants, and contracts

The COVID-19 pandemic, and the xenophobic rhetoric used by certain
political leaders during this crisis, have led to a tragic spike in acts
of anti-Asian bias, violence, and xenophobia. At the same time, the
pandemic has disproportionately burdened many AA and NHPI communities,
and exposed the significant health inequities faced by many Native
Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in particular. To ensure that the
Federal government is mitigating COVID-19 related anti-Asian bias,
advancing health equity for all AA and NHPI communities, and ensuring AA
and NHPI communities can equitably recover from these crises, the
Initiative will be led out of the Department of Health and Human
Services.

Today, President Biden also announced that Krystal Ka’ai has been
selected to serve as Executive Director of the Initiative. Krystal has
served as the Executive Director of the Congressional Asian Pacific
American Caucus (CAPAC) since 2013, leading legislative, communications,
and outreach strategy for a bicameral caucus composed of more than 70
members in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate. She
worked to advanced key priorities impacting the AAPI community,
including health care, immigration, education, civil rights, economic
development, and more. She previously served in various roles with the
U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the State of Hawai‘i.

In addition, the Executive Order establishes a renewed Presidential
Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific
Islanders. The Commission will advise the President on ways the public,
private and non-profit sectors can work together to advance equity and
opportunity for every AA and NHPI community. The Commission is also
charged with advising the President on policies to address anti-Asian
xenophobia and violence, ways to build capacity in AA and NHPI
communities through federal grantmaking, and policies to address the
intersectional barriers that AA and NHPI women, LGBTQ+ people, and
people with disabilities face. The Commission will include AA and NHPI
civic leaders from across the country, and will reflect the rich
diversity of AA and NHPI communities throughout the United States.

These announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic
actions to combat bias, violence, and xenophobia against AA and NHPI
communities, including:

**Signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law.** On May 20, 2021,
President Biden signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, bipartisan
legislation that will make significant improvements to our Nation’s
response to hate crimes. The bill addresses two challenges: the lack of
resources and training for state and local law enforcement to accurately
identify and report hate crimes to the FBI, and the language and
cultural barriers that many communities of color face in reporting hate
crimes to law enforcement.

The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act will strengthen the Federal coordination
and response to hate crime incidents, especially those that victimize
Asian American communities, by appointing a designated official at the
Department of Justice whose sole job is to facilitate the expedited
review of hate crimes related to COVID-19. The Department of Justice
will also issue new guidance for state, city, and Tribal law enforcement
agencies on how to establish online reporting of hate crimes. The law
will provide resources to create specialized hate crimes units that will
also help states create hotlines for hate crimes at state and local
levels that will be accessible for people with limited English
proficiency. And it provides resources for training for state and local
law enforcement to identify, investigate, and report these heinous
crimes.

**Signing a Presidential Memorandum Condemning and Combating Racism,
Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders in the United States.** In his first week in office, President
Biden signed a Memorandum which established that it is the official
policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to stand up against racism,
xenophobia, nativism, and bias. The Memorandum directs all Federal
agencies to take steps to ensure their official actions mitigate
anti-Asian bias and xenophobia, especially in the Nation’s response to
the COVID-19 pandemic. The Memorandum also charged the Department of
Justice with partnering with AA and NHPI communities to respond to and
prevent hate crimes and violence.

**Advancing equity and racial justice for AA and** **NHPI**
**communities through the whole-of-government initiative.** On his first
day in office, President Biden signed a historic Executive Order
establishing a whole-of-government initiative to advance equity and
racial justice and root out systemic racism from federal policies,
programs, institutions and laws. Under this Executive Order, all Federal
agencies are charged with affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights,
racial justice, and equal opportunity for the American people, including
AA and NHPI communities.

**Appointing a White House Senior Liaison to Asian American, Native
Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities.** President Biden announced
the appointment of Erika L. Moritsugu to serve as Deputy Assistant to
the President and Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
Senior Liaison. Moritsugu serves as a vital voice to advance the
President and the Administration’s priorities.

**Creating a historically diverse Administration in which 15 percent of
all appointees identify as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.** The
Biden-Harris Administration reflects the diversity of the American
people, and 15 percent of the Administration’s appointees identify as
AAPI.

**Funding critical research to prevent and address bias and xenophobia
against Asian American communities.** The National Science Foundation
(NSF) is taking a comprehensive approach to investing in research to
understand, address, and end bias, discrimination and xenophobia,
including against AAPI communities. NSF is currently supporting more
than 100 grants across the country totaling more than $33 million
dollars of investment. This wide array of researchers is advancing
innovative studies to reveal new and more effective strategies for
reducing the frequency and severity of discrimination experienced by
historically underrepresented groups, and reduce targeting of, and
violence towards, historically underrepresented communities and
individuals, including Asian American communities.
