title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on the Colonial Pipeline\_Incident"
---
 
The President continues to be regularly briefed on the Colonial Pipeline
incident.

The Administration is continually assessing the impact of this ongoing
incident on fuel supply for the East Coast. We are monitoring supply
shortages in parts of the Southeast and are evaluating every action the
Administration can take to mitigate the impact as much as possible.

The President has directed agencies across the Federal Government to
bring their resources to bear to help alleviate shortages where they may
occur.
