title: Statement From Senior Advisor and Chief Spokesperson Symone Sanders on Vice
  President Kamala Harris Meeting With Private Sector Leaders
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris met with the leaders of a dozen
businesses and organizations to announce a *Call to Action* for the
private sector to deepen investments in Guatemala, El Salvador, and
Honduras. During the meeting, the Vice President and the group exchanged
innovative ideas and strategies to support families and small businesses
in the region, and lift barriers to investment.  Each of the 12
businesses and organizations have announced commitments to support
inclusive economic development in the Northern Triangle. Furthermore,
they committed to rallying additional private sector commitments.  
   
This represents progress. It is part of the Biden-Harris Administration
strategy to leverage private sector commitments to foster economic
growth and opportunity in the region — in addition to strengthening
governance, combating corruption, and improving security. As Vice
President Harris has said, our goal is to help people in Guatemala, El
Salvador, and Honduras find hope at home.
