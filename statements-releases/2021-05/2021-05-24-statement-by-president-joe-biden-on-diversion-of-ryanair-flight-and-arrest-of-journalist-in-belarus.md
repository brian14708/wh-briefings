title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Diversion of Ryanair Flight and Arrest\
  \ of Journalist in\_Belarus"
---
 
Belarus’s forced diversion of a commercial Ryanair flight, traveling
between two member states of the European Union, and subsequent removal
and arrest of Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian journalist traveling
abroad, are a direct affront to international norms. The United States
condemns in the strongest possible terms both the diversion of the plane
and the subsequent removal and arrest of Mr. Pratasevich. This
outrageous incident and the video Mr. Pratasevich appears to have made
under duress are shameful assaults on both political dissent and the
freedom of the press. The United States joins countries around the world
in calling for his release, as well as for the release of the hundreds
of political prisoners who are being unjustly detained by the Lukashenka
regime.

I join the many calls for an international investigation to ascertain
the complete facts of the case. I welcome the news that the European
Union has called for targeted economic sanctions and other measures, and
have asked my team to develop appropriate options to hold accountable
those responsible, in close coordination with the European Union, other
allies and partners, and international organizations.

For months, the Belarusian people have made their voices heard—demanding
democracy, respect for human rights, and the preservation of fundamental
freedoms. I applaud the courage and determination of Belarusians
fighting for basic rights, including journalists like Raman Pratasevich
and opposition leaders like Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya and her husband,
Syarhey Tsikhanouski. The United States will continue to stand with the
people of Belarus in their struggle.
