title: "Readout of Oval Office Meeting with Bipartisan Leaders of Both Chambers of\_\
  Congress"
---
 
Today, President Biden hosted the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional
Leadership for a productive meeting about how to further make government
work for American families during this moment of crisis.   
  
The President enjoyed hosting Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader
McConnell, and Leader McCarthy, and spent the nearly two hours working
with them to identify areas where they could collaborate, especially
with regard to infrastructure, on which the leaders agreed there was a
need for investment.  
  
The President reiterated that he ran to be a leader for all Americans —
regardless of who they voted for, that he believes there are many
crucial areas where his administration and both parties in Congress can
come together, and that in this unprecedented moment the American people
expect us to put the interests of families above our disagreements.  
  
He expressed appreciation for the important priorities on which the
parties had been able to work together so far, and that he wants to work
diligently to build on those.  
  
The President also emphasized that whatever differences exist between
the parties, the real competition is between the United States and the
rest of the world, and that other countries are not waiting for us to
equip our people to win in the 21st Century — and that there is nothing
we cannot do as a country when we do it together.
