title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Occasion of Orthodox Easter
---
 
Jill and I extend warm wishes to all our friends in the Orthodox
Christian community observing Easter.

On this occasion of joy and renewal, Orthodox Christians worldwide
rejoice in the miracle of the Resurrection and affirm commitments to
spiritual disciplines and service to those in need.

This is also a season of remembranceâ€”to honor the sacrifice Jesus Christ
made for the world and to stand in solidarity with all those in the
Orthodox community who have been persecuted for their faith and those
who remain under threat today. No one should be targeted for their
religious affiliation, beliefs, and practices. No one should be fearful
of celebrating their faith and traditions. The United States will
continue to work to protect freedom of religion, both at home and around
the world.

This Easter, as Orthodox Christians and so many other people of faith
have had to once again modify religious traditions to prevent the spread
of COVID-19, we can also look to the future with hope. Thanks to the
leadership of countless people, including so many people of faith, the
progress we are making in our battle against the virus will soon allow
for a return to our timeless and treasured traditions of Easter and
other holidays.

We wish a blessed Easter to all Orthodox Christians around the world
celebrating a risen Christ and the triumph of light over darkness.
