title: "Statement by President\_Biden on FDA\u2019s Expanded Emergency Use Authorization\
  \ of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-\u206019 Vaccine to Include\_Adolescents"
---
 
After a rigorous and thorough scientific review process, today the Food
and Drug Administration expanded the emergency use authorization for the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from individuals 16 years and older to
also include individuals 12 to 15 years old.

This is a promising development in our fight against the virus. If you
are a parent who wants to protect your child, or a teenager who is
interested in getting vaccinated, today’s decision is a step closer to
that goal.

Millions of 16- and 17-year-olds have been safely vaccinated, and as
more and more Americans get vaccinated, COVID-19 cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths continue to fall. The safe and effective
vaccines are curbing the spread of the virus, saving thousands of lives,
and allowing millions of Americans to start returning to a closer to
normal life.

In the coming days, we will hear more from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) on its recommendations. I look forward to
speaking more about what today’s news means for our vaccination program,
but the bottom line is: The light at the end of the tunnel is growing,
and today it got a little brighter.
