title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden and First Lady Jill\_Biden Thanking National\
  \ Guard Members at the End of Their Capitol\_Deployment"
---
 
We want to offer our deepest thanks and enduring gratitude to the women
and men of our National Guard for their service to keep the U.S. Capitol
Complex secure over the past nearly five months. Since the insurrection
on January 6, thousands of proud service members, from states and
territories all across our Union, have stood watch over the citadel of
our democracy. As they return now to their homes and families, we salute
each of them for their commitment to country. When duty calls, our
National Guard members put their lives on hold to stand as a shield and
a support when their country is in need. Weâ€™ve asked so much of our
Guard over the past year, not only defending our Capitol, but supporting
our fight against COVID-19, responding to storm damage and wildfires,
and deploying internationally to support peacekeeping missions. The
Biden family is a National Guard family, and we are forever grateful and
in awe of those who, like our son Beau, understand that duty and service
to others is what makes us who we are as Americans. To all the National
Guard members and their families who sacrifice so much for our country,
like all our service members: we owe you and we will always have your
backs.
