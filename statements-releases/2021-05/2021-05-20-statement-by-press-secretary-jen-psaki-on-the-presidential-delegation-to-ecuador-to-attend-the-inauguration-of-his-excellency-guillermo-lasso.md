U.S. Ambassador to Ecuador Michael J. Fitzpatrick, Special Assistant to
the President and Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan
Gonzalez, and Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere
Affairs at the Department of State Julie Chung. The citizens of our two
countries know that the Americas value democracy and individual liberty,
and that we have a responsibility to promote and defend these values. We
congratulate the Ecuadorian people for their model democratic process.
The United States looks forward to working with President-elect
