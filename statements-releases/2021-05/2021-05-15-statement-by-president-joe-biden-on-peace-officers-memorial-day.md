title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Peace Officers Memorial\_Day"
---
 
Each day, America’s law enforcement officers pin on a badge and go to
work — not knowing what the day will bring, and hoping to come home
safely. With courage and dedication, they serve on the front lines of
our communities, preserving public safety and responding to a wide range
of daily challenges. On Peace Officers Memorial Day, and every day, we
honor law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of
duty, and thank them and their families for their extraordinary
sacrifice and service.

Our country asks a great deal of our federal, state, Tribal, and local
law enforcement officers — and it is our responsibility to ensure that
those who protect and serve us have the training and support they need
to do their jobs safely. My Administration is committed to supporting
our law enforcement agencies and officers, and making sure they have the
resources, research tools, and funding they need to be safe, effective,
trusted sources of protection in their communities. Today and each day,
my thoughts and my sincere gratitude are with all those law enforcement
officers who put their lives on the line.
