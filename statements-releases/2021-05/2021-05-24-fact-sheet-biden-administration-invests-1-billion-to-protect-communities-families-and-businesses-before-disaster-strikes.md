*Funding Builds on Efforts to Enhance Climate Change Resilience as
President Biden Visits FEMA Ahead of Hurricane Season*

Today, President Biden will meet with members of his homeland security
and climate teams at the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)
National Response Coordination Center in Washington, D.C. to receive an
update on preparations for the 2021 hurricane season. In advance of the
President’s visit, the Administration is announcing it will direct $1
billion for communities, states, and Tribal governments into
pre-disaster mitigation resources to prepare for extreme weather events
and other disasters, and the Administration is announcing the
development of [next generation climate data systems at
NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/new-nasa-earth-systems-observatory-to-help-address-mitigate-climate-change)
to help understand and track how climate change is impacting
communities.  
  
In 2020, the United States experienced a record year for extreme
weather, including an unprecedented 30 named storms in the Atlantic
Basin. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is
anticipating another above-normal hurricane season this year.  
  
The costs of extreme weather events, in lives and economic damage, have
been staggering. Last year alone, communities across the United States
suffered through 22 separate weather and climate-related disasters with
loses exceeding $1 billion each, shattering previous records, at a
cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion. This year has already
wrought devastation, as unusual winter storms crossed Texas and the
south.  
  
On May 20<sup>th</sup>, NOAA released its [2021 Atlantic hurricane
season
outlook](https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-predicts-another-active-atlantic-hurricane-season).
Forecasters predict a 60% chance of an above-normal season, a 30% chance
of a near-normal season, and a 10% chance of a below-normal season.
Additionally, forecasters expect a likely range of 13 to 20 named
storms, of which six to 10 could became hurricanes.  
  
As climate change threatens to bring more extreme events like increased
floods, sea level rise, and intensifying droughts and wildfires, it is
our responsibility to better prepare and support communities, families,
and businesses before disaster – not just after. This includes investing
in climate research to improve our understanding of these extreme
weather events and our decision making on climate resilience,
adaptation, and mitigation. It also means ensuring that communities have
the resources they need to build resilience prior to these crises.  
  
President Biden has elevated the importance of climate resilience on the
global stage and prioritized resilience in his investment agenda,
including in the American Jobs Plan and the FY22 discretionary
request.  
  
**NEW STEPS TO ENHANCE CLIMATE RESILIENCE**  
  
Today, President Biden continued to act through a whole-of-government
approach in support of climate resilience goals. The Administration is
directing $1 billion in pre-disaster mitigation resources to
communities, and it is announcing next generation climate data systems
that will help us understand and track how climate change impacts
communities.

Today, the Administration is announcing it will:

-   **Provide $1 billion for communities through FEMA’s Pre-Disaster
    Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. **FEMA
    will provide $1 billion in 2021 for the Building Resilient
    Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a portion of which
    will be targeted to disadvantaged communities. BRIC supports states,
    local communities, tribes, and territories in undertaking
    pre-disaster hazard mitigation projects, reducing the risks they
    face from disasters and natural hazards. This level of funding level
    is double the amount provided last year. The program seeks to
    categorically shift the federal focus from reactive disaster
    spending and toward research-supported, proactive investment in
    community resilience so that when the next hurricane, flood, or
    wildfire comes, communities are better prepared.  
     
-   **Develop and launch a** [**new NASA mission concept for an Earth
    System
    Observatory.** ](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/new-nasa-earth-systems-observatory-to-help-address-mitigate-climate-change)As
    the number of extreme weather events increases due to climate
    change, the ability to forecast and monitor natural disasters is
    integral for the nation’s preparation, mitigation, and resilience.
    NASA’s Earth System Observatory will be a new architecture of
    advanced spaceborne Earth observation systems, providing the world
    with an unprecedented understanding of the critical interactions
    between Earth’s atmosphere, land, ocean, and ice processes. These
    processes determine how the changing climate will play out at
    regional and local levels, on near and long-term time scales.

**CONTINUE A WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE**  
  
Today’s action builds on the whole-of-government approach President
Biden is taking to climate resilience. Resilience is a key focus area of
the National Climate Task Force as they drive a number of actions to
strengthen the resilience of our infrastructure, forests, coastal areas,
oceans, range lands, and farm lands to drought, wildfire, heatwaves, and
other climate impacts.  
  
Examples of actions to date across the federal government include:

-   **Issuing an Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk**.
    Last week, President Biden issued an [Executive Order on
    Climate-Related Financial
    Risk](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/) that
    will help the American people better understand how climate change
    can impact their financial security. It will strengthen the U.S.
    financial system and it will inform concrete decisions that the
    federal government can take to mitigate the risks of climate change.
    With so much at stake, this Executive Order ensures that the right
    rules are in place to properly analyze and mitigate these risks.
    That includes disclosing these risks to the public, and empowering
    the American people to make informed financial decisions.  
     
-   **Developing agency climate adaptation and resilience plans**. The
    Administration has taken significant steps to revitalize Federal
    climate adaptation and resilience by initiating the development of
    Agency Climate Action Plans as required by [Executive Order
    14008](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/).
    The Plans, which are being developed by 36 agencies, broadened the
    scope of relevant climate adaptation and resilience experts to
    include acquisitions and finance professionals and focus on
    integrating climate information in the management of procurement,
    real property, public lands and water, and financial programs for
    climate informed decisions.  
     
-   **Setting a responsible flood risk standard for the federal
    government.** Through his Executive Order on Climate-Related
    Financial Risk, President Biden reinstated the Federal Flood Risk
    Management Standard to improve the resilience of American
    communities and federal assets against the impacts of flood damage,
    which is predicted to increase over time due to the effects of
    climate change. The Standard requires federal agencies to consider
    current and future flood risk when taxpayer dollars are used to
    build or rebuild in floodplains. Implementing guidelines offer a
    toolkit of flexible and practical options to implement these
    protections.  
     
-   **Investing in resilience through the American Jobs Plan and the
    FY22 budget.** Resilience and adaptation are critical priorities for
    President Biden and his administration. Americans around the country
    have been feeling the effect of climate change and underinvestment
    in resilience. Investments to make our infrastructure more resilient
    are a key piece of the [American Jobs
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/) and
    the President’s FY 2022 Discretionary Request. In addition to
    supporting the goal that every dollar spent on rebuilding our
    infrastructure during the Biden administration will be used to
    prevent, reduce and withstand the impacts of the climate crisis –
    the American Jobs Plan calls for $50 billion in dedicated resilience
    investments. The [President’s FY22 Discretionary
    Request](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FY2022-Discretionary-Request.pdf) also
    includes significant budget increases to enable incorporation of
    climate impacts into disaster planning and projects to ensure that
    the Nation is rebuilding smarter and safer for the future.  
     
-   **Integrating resilience into the White House Environmental Justice
    Advisory Council**. The [White House Environmental Justice Advisory
    Council](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council) (WHEJAC)
    was established by President Biden’s Executive Order on Tackling the
    Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad to fulfill his and Vice President
    Harris’s commitment to confronting longstanding environmental
    injustices and ensure that historically marginalized and polluted,
    overburdened communities have greater input on federal policies and
    decisions. The WHEJAC members are to provide advice and
    recommendations to the Environmental Justice Interagency Council and
    the Chair of CEQ on a whole-of-government approach to environmental
    justice, including, but not limited to, climate change mitigation,
    resilience, and disaster management.  
     
-   **Establishing an Interagency Working Group to better prepare and
    respond to drought. **The National Climate Task Force, as part of
    its whole-of-government consideration of climate
    issues, [established an Interagency Working Group to address
    worsening drought
    conditions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/21/readout-of-the-third-national-climate-task-force-meeting/) in
    the West and to support farmers, ranchers, Tribes, and communities
    impacted by ongoing water shortages. The Working Group is co-chaired
    by the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture and will build
    upon existing resources to help coordinate across the federal
    government, working in partnership with state, local, and Tribal
    governments to address the needs of communities suffering from
    drought-related impacts. DOI and USDA have already announced more
    than $25 million to assist farmers, ranchers and communities in the
    Klamath Basin to help them in the face of a severe drought.  
     
-   **Increasing investments in forest restoration to reduce the threat
    of catastrophic wildfire. **Climate change is increasing the
    severity and frequency of wildfire seasons, which are transforming
    our Nation’s forests at an unprecedented rate, and destroying homes
    and businesses. The Biden-Harris Administration’s discretionary
    budget request provides nearly $1.7 billion for high-priority
    hazardous fuels and forest resilience projects at a scope and scale
    to meet the challenge we face, an increase of $476 million over the
    2021 enacted level. This funding supports the Administration’s
    science-based approach to vegetation management at the Forest
    Service and DOI to protect watersheds, wildlife habitat, and the
    wildland-urban interface.  
     
-   **Launching a resilience focused task force at the Department of the
    Interior**. Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Deb Haaland
    announced a [new Climate Task
    Force](https://www.doi.gov/news/secretary-haaland-establishes-climate-task-force-strengthens-scientific-integrity) at
    DOI that will develop a strategy to reduce climate pollution;
    improve and increase adaptation and resilience to the impacts of
    climate change; address current and historic environmental
    injustice; protect public health; and conserve DOI managed lands.
    Its mission will include supporting the development and use of the
    best available science to evaluate the greenhouse gas emissions and
    associated climate change impacts of Federal land uses as well as
    opportunities to increase carbon sequestration; to predict the
    effects of climate change on public lands and land uses; and to
    assess and adopt measures to increase the resilience and adaptive
    capacity of public lands.   
     
-   **Launching a new approach to climate change adaptation and
    resilience at the Department of Homeland Security.** Homeland
    Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced the launch of
    the [DHS Climate Change Action
    Group](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/04/22/secretary-mayorkas-announces-new-dhs-commitments-address-climate-crisis-leaders),
    a coordinating body comprised of the Department’s senior leadership
    that will drive urgent action to address the climate crisis and will
    report directly to the Secretary. DHS also recently published a
    public Request for Information on how FEMA can ensure its programs
    advance equity and increase resilience for all – especially among
    those who are disproportionately at risk from the impacts of climate
    change.  
     
-   **Utilizing a Climate Assessment Tool to Analyze Climate
    Vulnerabilities at the Department of Defense**. Climate change has
    been identified by the Department of Defense (DoD) as a critical
    national security threat and threat multiplier. As a result, DoD has
    undertaken assessments of the impacts that the climate crisis has on
    American military instillations. The DoD [announced a
    plan](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2581027/dod-announces-installation-climate-exposure-assessments-plan-through-the-defens/#:~:text=In%20conjunction%20with%20President%20Biden's,the%20Defense%20Climate%20Assessment%20Tool.) to
    complete climate exposure assessments on all major U.S.
    installations within 12 months and all major installations outside
    the continental U.S. within 24 months using the Defense Climate
    Assessment Tool (DCAT). The DCAT helps identify the climate hazards
    to which DoD installations are most exposed, which is the first step
    in addressing the potential physical harm, security impacts, and
    degradation in readiness resulting from global climate change.  
     
-   **Tracking the indicators of climate change at the U.S.
    Environmental Protection Agency. **For the first time in four years,
    the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has updated
    and [relaunched its Climate Change
    Indicators](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-relaunches-climate-indicators-website-showing-how-climate-change-impacting-peoples).
    This comprehensive resource presents compelling and clear evidence
    of changes to our climate reflected in rising temperatures,
    increased ocean acidity, sea level rise, and changing river
    flooding, droughts, heat waves, and wildfires, among other
    indicators. The long-overdue update to this crucial scientific
    resource shows that climate change has become even more evident,
    stronger, and extreme, and underscores the urgency for action on the
    climate crisis.  
     
-   **Releasing new U.S. Climate Normals at the NOAA**. NOAA recently
    released the [U.S. Climate
    Normals](https://www.noaa.gov/news/new-us-climate-normals-are-here-what-do-they-tell-us-about-climate-change),
    a large suite of data products that provide information about
    typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the
    United States. Normals act both as a ruler to compare today’s
    weather and tomorrow’s forecast, and as a predictor of conditions in
    the near future. These data products assist agencies and State,
    local, Tribal, and territorial governments, communities, and
    businesses in preparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate
    change.  
     
-   **Investing in grid and community resilience at the Department of
    Energy**. The Department of Energy is investing in grid resilience
    and energy resilience, including microgrid strategies, through
    research under the [Grid Modernization
    Initiative](https://www.energy.gov/gmi/grid-modernization-initiative).
    In partnership with the National Laboratories, the Department is
    developing a set of comprehensive energy resilience metrics and
    modeling capabilities to mitigate climate impacts to our energy
    infrastructure. The Department is also investing in projects that
    improve community resilience by deploying energy storage and
    microgrid technologies. In addition, for communities across the
    West, the Department is working with the Western Area Power
    Administration and Bonneville Power Administration to aggressively
    forecast, model and mitigate the potential impacts of severe
    climate-change-related droughts and fires on electricity systems.  
     
-   **Building climate and resilience considerations into transportation
    discretionary grants at the U.S. Department of Transportation. **The
    U.S. Department of Transportation is incorporating climate and
    resilience criteria into over $2 billion in discretionary grant
    programs, including
    the [RAISE](https://www.transportation.gov/RAISEgrants), INFRA, and
    Port Infrastructure Development grant programs. This will promote
    transportation investments that are future-proofed against extreme
    weather events. In addition, the Federal Highway Administration
    (FHWA) has also issued new guidance for planning and design for
    highways in coastal areas.
