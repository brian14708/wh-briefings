National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke separately today with
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia and President Ilham Aliyev of
Azerbaijan. Mr. Sullivan conveyed the commitment of the United States to
peace, security, and prosperity in the South Caucasus. He expressed
concern over recent tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and
emphasized that military movements near un-demarcated borders
are irresponsible and provocative. He welcomed the ongoing communication
between the two sides and both leaders’ commitment to resolving this
issue peacefully.  In addition, he underscored the need for the two
countries to conduct formal discussions to demarcate their international
border. Finally, he conveyed the commitment of the United States to
achieving regional reconciliation through bilateral engagement and as a
Minsk Group Co-Chair.
