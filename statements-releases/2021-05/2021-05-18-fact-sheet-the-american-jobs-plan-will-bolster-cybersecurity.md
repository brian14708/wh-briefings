title: "FACT SHEET: The American Jobs Plan Will Bolster\_Cybersecurity"

Cybersecurity is one of the preeminent challenges of our time, which is
why President Biden has made strengthening U.S. cybersecurity
capabilities a top priority and has already taken action to advance it,
including with last week’s [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/).
The American Jobs Plan will build on that work and deliver resilient
infrastructure for the American people, including a renewed electric
grid. Cybersecurity is a core part of resilience and building
infrastructure of the future, and the American Jobs Plan will allocate
opportunities and resources to bolster cyber defenses. Specifically, the
American Jobs Plan will:

-   **Make $20 billion in Energy Infrastructure Investments for State,
    Local, and Tribal Governments Contingent on Cyber Modernization**:
    Governors, mayors, and legislators have embraced ambitious energy
    system modernization goals that have already driven significant
    private investment into grid upgrades, clean electricity, and U.S.
    cybersecurity. This $20 billion investment in DOE-administered
    energy system modernization block grants would support critical
    infrastructure – additional grid resilience, clean electricity, and
    cybersecurity efforts – and spur early action by state and local
    governments that creates a favorable environment for increased
    private investment, creating jobs, reducing pollution, and boosting
    security. 

Specifically, these modernization block grants will be tied to the use
of and compliance with 21st century energy, technology, and security
standards. Eligibility for these grants will also be contingent on
policies requiring installation of technology that detects and blocks
malicious cyber activity on information and operational technology
networks, consistent with privacy protections. States and local
governments will be able to use these investments to directly fund
standalone cyber infrastructure and networks that have tightly gated
access to the Internet, which would bolster the resilience of a clean
energy grid.

-   **Promote a secure network with the American Jobs Plan’s historic
    $100 billion broadband investment.** President Biden’s American Jobs
    Plan will bring affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband to every
    American. This historic investment will also promote network
    security. Grant recipients will be asked to source from “trusted
    vendors” and give preference to open, interoperable architecture
    where feasible, and implement cybersecurity consistent with
    approaches and priorities described in the Executive Order on
    Cybersecurity of May 12, 2021.  
-   **Create a new tax credit for transmission infrastructure that
    will** **help finance cyber technologies for the electric grid.**
    President Biden’s American Jobs Plan includes a targeted investment
    tax credit that incentivizes the buildout of at least 20 gigawatts
    of high-voltage capacity power lines and mobilizes tens of billions
    in private capital off the sidelines – right away. These tax credits
    will also encourage stronger cybersecurity capabilities.  
-   **Safeguard critical infrastructure and grid resilience.** The
    American Jobs Plan devotes $2 billion to support micro-grids and
    distributed energy infrastructure for grid resilience in areas with
    high risk of power outages, critical infrastructure, and front-line
    communities. These funds will also be used for transmission risk
    reduction, including planning grants, scale up grants, efforts for
    winterization and floods, and supply chain readiness (including
    equipment reserves). As cybersecurity is a core part of resilience,
    this funding will be contingent on meeting and maintaining
    compliance with modern sensor and reporting requirements, with a
    portion of the funding reserved for investments in standalone
    infrastructure and networks with tight cybersecurity controls,
    including tightly gated access to the Internet. And, similar to
    clean energy block grants and the tax credit for transmission
    infrastructure, these funds will require recipients to install
    cybersecurity capabilities that detect and block malicious cyber
    activity.   

In addition to the historic cybersecurity investments outlined in the
American Jobs Plan, President Biden has called on Congress to launch the
most ambitious effort ever to modernize and secure federal IT and
networks. The President secured more than $1 billion for this initiative
through the American Rescue Plan. The American Rescue Plan will:

-   **Expand and improve the technology modernization fund.** The
    President’s American Rescue Plan included $1 billion for the
    Technology Modernization Fund, which will be used to deploy
    immediate security upgrades, facilitate a shift to a secure cloud
    infrastructure, improve the foundational technology used across the
    federal government, and assist agencies in delivering services to
    the American people.   
-   **Improve security monitoring and incident response activities.**
    The American Rescue Plan provided $650M to the Cyber Security and
    Information Security Agency (CISA), which will be used to improve
    CISAs response capabilities, upgrade its ability to support security
    projects at agencies and departments, and deploy modern endpoint
    protections for the federal civilian networks.
