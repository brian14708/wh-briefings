title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on National Security Advisor Jake\
  \ Sullivan\u2019s Call with Democratic Opposition Leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya\
  \ of Belarus"
---
 
National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke today with democratic
opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya of Belarus. Mr. Sullivan
conveyed the United States’ strong support for the demands of the
Belarusian people for democracy, human rights, and fundamental
freedoms.  Mr. Sullivan praised the bravery and selfless sacrifice of
democratic leaders like Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, her husband, Syarhey,
and the hundreds of other Belarusian democracy activists, independent
journalists, and civil society leaders who languish in Belarusian jails
as political prisoners of the Lukashenka regime.  Mr. Sullivan strongly
condemned the brazen and dangerous grounding of a Ryanair flight between
two EU member states on May 23 and the subsequent removal and detention
of journalist Raman Pratasevich.  Mr. Sullivan cited the U.S. demand for
the immediate release of Mr. Pratasevich and all political prisoners in
Belarus, as well as the need for free and fair elections under OSCE
observation to resolve the current crisis.  Finally, Mr. Sullivan made
clear that the United States, in coordination with the EU and other
allies and partners, will hold the Lukashenka regime to account.
