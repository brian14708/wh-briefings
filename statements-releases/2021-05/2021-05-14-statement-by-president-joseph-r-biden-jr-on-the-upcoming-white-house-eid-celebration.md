  Celebration"

Jill and I are looking forward to the White House’s commemoration of Eid
this Sunday.  We were heartened to see Eid celebrations around the
world, but we know that this year, the situation in the Holy Land is
weighing heavily on Muslims everywhere, including our Muslim communities
here in the United States.   

Palestinians—including in Gaza—and Israelis equally deserve to live in
dignity, safety and security. No family should have to fear for their
safety within their own home or place of worship. We think most about
the children in these societies who face trauma from a conflict far
beyond their control.

My administration will continue to engage Palestinians, Israelis, and
other regional partners to work towards a sustainable calm.
