title: "President\_Biden Announces Third Slate of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
President Biden has announced his intent to nominate three new Court of
Appeals nominees and three new District Court nominees, who will bring
deep credentials and qualifications to the federal bench, as well as
career-long devotion to our Constitution and the rule of law. These
individuals embody President Biden’s commitment to ensure that his
judicial nominees represent not only the excellence but the diversity of
our nation with respect to both personal and professional backgrounds.  
  
Many of them are groundbreaking choices, including:

-   the second judge of Hispanic origin to serve on the United States
    Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and the second judge from
    Puerto Rico ever to sit on the First Circuit;
-   the second African American woman ever to serve on the United States
    Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, who would also be the only
    judge with experience as a federal defender serving on that circuit;
-   an immigrant who came to the United States as a small child and
    would be the only judge with experience as a federal defender
    serving on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit;
-   only the third active Native American federal judge currently
    serving in the entire United States, and the first Native American
    federal judge in Washington State history;
-   the first African American district court judge to sit in the Camden
    courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of
    New Jersey;
-   the second African American woman judge and the second Asian
    American judge to serve on the United States District Court for the
    District of Massachusetts

This is President Biden’s third slate of judicial nomination
announcements, and he has now put forward 20 names for federal judicial
vacancies.   
  
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move at a historically fast pace
with respect to judicial nominations. His first announcement of
candidates for the judiciary was made faster than that of any new
President in modern American history, and today’s announcement further
continues that trend.
