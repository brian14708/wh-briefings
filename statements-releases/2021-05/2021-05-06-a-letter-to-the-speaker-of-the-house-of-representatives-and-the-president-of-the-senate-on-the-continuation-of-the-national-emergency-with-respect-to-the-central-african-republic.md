  \ Central African\_Republic"

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the Central African
Republic declared in Executive Order 13667 of May 12, 2014, is to
continue in effect beyond May 12, 2021.  
  
The situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic, which
has been marked by a breakdown of law and order, intersectarian tension,
widespread violence and atrocities, and the pervasive, often forced
recruitment and use of child soldiers, threatens the peace, security, or
stability of the Central African Republic and the neighboring states,
and continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore, I
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13667 with respect to the Central
African Republic.  
  
                               

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
