    to facilitate training and exchange of professionals in the fields
    of science, technology and information communications
    technologies.  
-   Promote ASEAN centrality and advance new development cooperation
    between USAID and the Korea International Cooperation Agency in
    Southeast Asia to enhance public health cooperation; expand
    cooperation on connectivity, build digital capacity and
    cyber-security; strengthen the resilience of cities to address
    growing climate threats and vulnerability; and improve solid waste
    management and mitigate the impacts of ocean plastic pollution.  
-   Explore further opportunities to jointly contribute to advancing
    technical and vocational education and training and seek possible
    areas of cooperation in linking the youth leadership development
    programs of the U.S., such as the Young Southeast Asian Leaders
    Initiative, and the ROK’s ASEAN youth projects.  
-   Assist countries in the Indo-Pacific region to eradicate illegal,
    unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by providing IUU response
    capacity building and sharing information on IUU issues.

Increase the interconnectedness between our two countries through a
first of its kind baggage screening pilot program between the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security and the ROK Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure and Transport. The objective is to leverage transit time
to screen and adjudicate checked baggage prior to arrival in the U.S.,
which will maximize resources, limit person-to-person contact, and
result in a more efficient process for travelers. This pilot builds on
the deep trust between our governments and is intended to increase
security, while decreasing traveler-processing times at U.S. ports of
entry.
