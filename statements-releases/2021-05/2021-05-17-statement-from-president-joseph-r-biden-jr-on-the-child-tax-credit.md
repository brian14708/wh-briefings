The American Rescue Plan is delivering critical tax relief to middle
class and hard-pressed working families with children. With today’s
announcement, about 90% of families with children will get this new tax
relief automatically, starting in July. While the American Rescue Plan
provides for this vital tax relief to hard working families for this
year, Congress must pass the American Families Plan to ensure that
working families will be able to count on this relief for years to come.
For working families with children, this tax cut sends a clear message:
help is here.
