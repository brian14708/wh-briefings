Vice President Kamala Harris met virtually today with Mexican President
Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discuss ways to deepen cooperation
between the United States and Mexico to address the root causes
of flight from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, including promoting
economic development in southern Mexico and the Northern Triangle of
Central America.  They underscored the important partnership between our
two countries and recognized the need to work together to recover from
the COVID-19 pandemic, build climate resilience and expand economic
opportunity and security cooperation.   
  
The leaders agreed to work together to establish a strategic partnership
to address the root causes of migration from countries in the Northern
Triangle region.  Through this joint initiative, the United States and
Mexico will leverage their expertise and resources to tackle a range of
challenges, including lack of employment, limited market access, and
deforestation and regional instability caused by climate change.   
  
Vice President Harris noted the U.S. commitment to working with Mexico
to spur economic development in the Northern Triangle and southern
Mexico, to protect the rights of workers to organize or join a union and
expand opportunities for U.S. business collaboration.  To that end, the
United States has developed a package of measures that include trade and
business development missions to the region facilitated by the
Department of Commerce and the United States Trade & Development Agency
and investments through the U.S. International Development Finance
Corporation.  This package follows on previous investment in the region
and is emblematic of our partnership with Mexico, and is yet another
step of many to come in this arena.  
  
Finally, the governments discussed their desire to advance a bilateral
effort against migrant smuggling and human trafficking that will bring
together law enforcement from both nations to dismantle criminal
networks.  As part of this effort, the United States and Mexico will
share information and expertise to jointly secure our borders and
bolster the protection of human rights.  
  
The Vice President looks forward to visiting Mexico on June 8.
