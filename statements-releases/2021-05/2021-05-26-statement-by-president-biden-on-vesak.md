Jill and I extend our warmest wishes to Buddhists in the United States
and around the world as they celebrate Vesak, a day honoring the birth,
enlightenment, and passing of the Buddha. The ceremonial lighting of a
lamp, the symbol of this holiday that has been celebrated for over 2,500
years, reminds us of Buddhismâ€™s teachings of compassion, humility, and
selflessness that endure today. On this day, we also commemorate the
many contributions of Buddhists in America who enrich our communities
and our country as we all work together toward brighter days ahead.
