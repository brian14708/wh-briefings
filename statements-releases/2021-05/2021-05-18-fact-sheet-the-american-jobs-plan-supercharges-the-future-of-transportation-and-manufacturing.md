title: "FACT SHEET: The American Jobs Plan Supercharges the Future of Transportation\
  \ and\_Manufacturing"
---
 
Increasingly, the global market is shifting to electric vehicles (EVs) –
tapping into EVs’ potential to save families thousands of dollars, lower
carbon pollution, and make the air we breathe cleaner. Yet, despite
pioneering the technology, the United States is behind in the race to
manufacture these vehicles and the batteries that go in them.  
  
Today, the U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is
only one-third that of the Chinese EV market. And in 2020, China had
approximately 800,000 public charging points compared to just 100,000 in
the U.S. President Biden believes it is time for this to change and for
the U.S. to lead in EV manufacturing, infrastructure, deployment, and
innovation.

Through the investments in the American Jobs Plan, we can re-establish
U.S. leadership in electric vehicles and batteries. The American Jobs
Plan will position America to win the future of transportation and
manufacturing with once-in-a-generation investments that will strengthen
our ability to create good-paying, union jobs, dramatically expand
American manufacturing, make EVs more affordable for families, and ship
EVs and their parts around the world.

Now is the golden time for long-term, transformative investments. As the
economy heals, and interest rates remain low, President Biden believes
these investments will ensure we manufacture the next generation of
vehicles right here in America, lead the world in EV and battery
innovation, and create strong, sustained, and durable growth for decades
to come.

The American Jobs Plan will accelerate our domestic EV industry by
driving demand for advanced cars and trucks, reinvigorating our
automotive sector and battery manufacturing, deploying a national
network of chargers, and advancing our innovation capacity for the next
generation of technology.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">**Driving Demand**  
</span>The American Jobs Plan will create incentives to continue to
lower the cost of and support market demand for electric vehicles. These
incentives are a proven policy to support the growing market for EVs,
which then drives down the purchase price as the auto industry scales up
production and creates incentives for domestic production. The American
Jobs Plan will help support EV deployment with:

-   ***Consumer Incentives*:** Provide point-of-sale incentives that
    encourage EV deployment. These incentives will not go towards
    expensive luxury models and will also incentivize manufacturers who
    use good labor practices. Incentives provide critical encouragement
    for manufacturers to move to sell more EVs.
-   ***Tax credits for zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty
    vehicles*:** a new tax credit that will support the market for
    electric and fuel cell trucks and other heavy vehicles. Heavy-duty
    vehicles are major contributors to poor air quality and health
    problems, especially in environmental justice communities, and
    deployment of zero emission versions will clean up the air in
    communities that need it most.
-   ***Transit buses*:** $25 billion as a transformative investment in
    clean transit vehicles. These advanced vehicles will improve urban
    air quality and environmental justice.
-   ***School buses*:** $20 billion to convert 20% of the fleet of
    school buses to electric. This will improve the air that kids
    breathe and create jobs in clean bus manufacturing.
-   ***Federal fleet leadership*:** Funding for federal agencies,
    including the Postal Service, to lead on transitioning their vehicle
    fleets to electric and installing charging infrastructure. The
    federal government spends more than a half-a-trillion dollars buying
    goods and services each year. This purchasing power can be used to
    drive innovation and clean energy production, as well as to support
    high quality jobs.

**<u>Manufacturing and Supply Chains</u>**  
The American Jobs Plan recognizes that EVs are important to the future
of a strong American manufacturing base. Securing the domestic
production of EV parts, like batteries, also represents an opportunity
to shore up U.S competitiveness in a growing market, bolster our
domestic supply chain, and create good-paying jobs in the U.S. — union
jobs. The American Jobs Plan will:

-   ***Provide tax credits to clean vehicle manufacturing***: The plan
    proposes new funds to the 48C Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit,
    which has a successful track record in supporting advances in
    manufacturing. EV manufacturing is an eligible use for this credit.
    The proposal mirrors the Manchin-Stabenow bill by including a set
    aside for coal communities.
-   ***Incentivize the start-up of new battery production facilities***:
    The President’s plan proposes cost-sharing grants to support new
    high capacity battery facilities in the United States, recognizing
    that new businesses may not be able to access tax credits but can
    pitch in their fair share as they scale their operations.
-   ***Provide low cost credit for the production of advanced
    vehicles:*** The plan provides new capital to the Advanced Vehicle
    Technology Manufacturing Program to support companies who
    domestically produce clean energy vehicles, and it proposes that the
    program incentivize the production of medium and heavy-duty
    vehicles.
-   ***Fund retooling of dormant factories:*** Brownfield grants will
    support the upgrading and reopening of facilities that had
    previously shuttered, revitalizing communities and increasing
    domestic capacity to build advanced vehicles and parts.

**<u>Creating a National Network of Charging Infrastructure</u>**  
The American Jobs Plan will establish grant and incentive programs for
state and local governments and the private sector to build a national
network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030, while promoting strong labor,
training, and installation standards. It will establish:

-   ***Grants and incentives for public EV charging
    infrastructure*:** To build a national network of 500,000 charging
    stations, the plan will make a bold $15 billion investment that
    spurs the manufacturing and installment of chargers. Through state
    and local governments and the private sector, it will fund chargers
    in apartment buildings, in public parking, and throughout
    communities, and robust fast charging along our nation’s roadways.
    Charger installation and maintenance creates good-paying, union jobs
    right here in America that cannot be outsourced, and the American
    Jobs Plan also includes incentives to bring more charging equipment
    manufacturing to the United States.
-   ***Tax credits for other charging infrastructure:*** Because some
    infrastructure, such as fleet depot charging, residential charging,
    and workplace charging, may not be eligible for federal grants, the
    plan will extend and improve the 30C Alternative Fuel Infrastructure
    Tax Credit so everyone can have access to electric vehicle changing
    infrastructure.

**<u>Research and Innovation</u>**  
Public investments in research and development lay the foundation for
the future breakthroughs and innovations that over time yield new
businesses, new jobs, and more exports. The American Jobs Plan will
establish the U.S. as a leader in innovation and R&D. It will:

-   ***Scale up federally-funded research and development*:** The
    American Jobs Plan will invest $35 billion in transformative
    research and development for energy and climate related topics, of
    which $15 billion is specifically set aside for the Department of
    Energy, a leader in applied clean energy research, including
    advanced batteries. It will also invest $40 billion to upgrade
    research infrastructure such as laboratories and networks. The plan
    will increase funding in key areas to reestablish our leadership in
    innovation and create a pipeline of technologies that we can build
    here.
-   ***Make it in ALL of America:*** The President is calling on
    Congress to invest $20 billion in regional innovation hubs and a
    Community Revitalization fund – building the social infrastructure
    to support innovation and productivity across the country.
