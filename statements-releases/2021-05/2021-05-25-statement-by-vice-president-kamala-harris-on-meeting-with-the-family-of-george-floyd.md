title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Meeting with the Family of George\_\
  Floyd"

Today the President and I met with the family of Mr. George Floyd. Mr.
Floyd should be alive today. He should be with his family who continue
to show courage, grace, and resilience.

One year ago, a cellphone video revealed to the country what Black
Americans have known to be true for generations. The verdict finding
Derek Chauvin guilty of murder provided some measure of justice. But one
verdict does not address the persistent issue of police misconduct and
use of excessive force. It does not take away the Floyd family’s pain,
nor the pain of all those families who have grieved the untimely loss of
a loved one.

We need to do more.

After Mr. Floyd was murdered, Senator Cory Booker, Representative Karen
Bass, and I introduced the Justice in Policing Act to hold law
enforcement accountable and build trust between law enforcement and the
communities it serves. Congress must move swiftly and act with a sense
of urgency. Passing legislation will not bring back those lives lost,
but it will represent much needed progress.

We must address racial injustice wherever it exists. That is the work
ahead.
