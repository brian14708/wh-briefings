title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on National Security Advisor Jake\
  \ Sullivan\u2019s Meeting with Foreign Minister Simon Coveney of Ireland"
---
 
Today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Foreign Minister
Simon Coveney of Ireland to discuss our strong bilateral relations and
cooperation on a number of shared global challenges.  Mr. Sullivan and
Foreign Minister Coveney condemned the forced diversion of a flight
between two EU member states and the subsequent removal and arrest of
journalist Raman Pratasevich in Minsk by the Lukashenka regime, and they
agreed to remain in close touch on an appropriate response.  They also
discussed Ireland’s role in addressing challenges to peace and security
as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.  Mr. Sullivan and
Foreign Minister Coveney reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the
gains of the Good Friday Agreement for all communities in Northern
Ireland.
