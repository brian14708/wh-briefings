  Persons"

Yesterday, in commemoration of Second Chance Month, Domestic Policy
Advisor Susan Rice, White House Public Engagement Director Cedric
Richmond, and White House Counsel Dana Remus hosted a virtual discussion
with formerly incarcerated individuals leading criminal justice reform
efforts across the country.  
  
Too many people—disproportionately Black and brown people—are
incarcerated. Too many face an uphill struggle to secure a decent job,
stable housing, and basic opportunity when they return from prison.
Those who have been through the system have particular insight into its
shortcomings and the reforms that are needed.  
  
Ambassador Rice, Richmond, and Remus thanked the participants for their
leadership and solicited their policy recommendations to reduce
incarceration, end racial disparities, and facilitate successful
reentry. They discussed actions the Administration has already taken,
such as removing barriers to loan eligibility and promoting voting
rights for formerly incarcerated individuals, as well as Administration
efforts to improve public safety and reentry through the American Jobs
Plan and the American Families Plan. Participants expressed a desire to
stay in communication and collaborate to pursue urgently needed criminal
justice reform.  
  
Participants in yesterday’s meeting included:

-   Daryl Atkinson, Forward Justice
-   Susan Burton, A New Way of Life Reentry Project
-   Dawn Harrington, Free Hearts
-   Robyn Hasan, Women on the Rise
-   Norris Henderson, Voice of the Experienced
-   DeAnna Hoskins, JustLeadershipUSA
-   Andrea James, National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly
    Incarcerated Women and Girls
-   Desmond Meade, Florida Rights Restoration Coalition
