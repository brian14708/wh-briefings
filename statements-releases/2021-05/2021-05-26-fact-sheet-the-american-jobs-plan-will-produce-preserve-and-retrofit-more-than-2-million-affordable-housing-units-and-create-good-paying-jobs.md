  \ Than 2 Million Affordable Housing Units and Create Good-Paying\_Jobs"
---
 
Even after the COVID-19 pandemic, tens of millions of Americans will
struggle to access affordable, safe, energy efficient, and resilient
housing. Across the country, 11 million families pay more than half
their income on rent, 3 million families with children under six reside
in homes with lead paint, thousands of working families are displaced
every year as a result of extreme weather fueled by climate change, and
millions of families cannot afford to purchase their own homes. These
challenges are even more severe in low-income communities and
communities of color, many of which have been segregated, excluded, and
neglected for generations.

The Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a bold investment in
America’s housing infrastructure and make housing more affordable for
working and middle-class families. The American Jobs Plan pairs $213
billion in direct funding with more than $100 billion in new and
expanded tax credits with bipartisan support to build and modernize
housing across the country. Together with new incentives for zoning
reform, these investments will produce, preserve, and retrofit more than
two million affordable and sustainable places to live in more – and
higher opportunity – communities. This includes more than 500,000 new
and rehabilitated homes for low- and moderate-income homebuyers and
homeowners.  
  
Along the way, these investments would create and sustain hundreds of
thousands of good-paying jobs – the majority of which won’t require a
college degree – with a free and fair choice to join a union and bargain
collectively. As President Biden has said, we need a blue-collar
blueprint to rebuild our economy and ensure that all Americans have the
opportunity to share in its prosperity. These investments will ensure
local community members, including workers of color, can fill these
jobs, and they will provide employment and economic opportunities for
residents of assisted housing. Stable, affordable housing serves as the
foundation on which working families build their lives and invest in
their children’s future. The American Jobs Plan would:

-   **Create good, middle-class jobs for local community members.** The
    housing investments in the American Jobs Plan will create tens of
    thousands of good jobs, with a free and fair choice to join a union,
    for workers around the country as they build, upgrade, and retrofit
    homes in their communities. Employers will be required to pay
    workers prevailing wages; enter into project labor, community
    workforce, and local hire agreements; and use workers from
    registered apprenticeships and other labor or labor-management
    training programs. Employers receiving funding would also be
    required to remain neutral when their employees seek to organize a
    union and bargain collectively and may not require their employees
    to agree to mandatory individual arbitration. And, the American Jobs
    Plan includes $10 billion to provide federal enforcement agencies
    with the tools they need to ensure employers are providing workers
    with good jobs –  including jobs with fair and equal pay, safe and
    healthy workplaces, and workplaces free from racial, gender, and
    other forms of discrimination and harassment.  
-   **Expand access to federal subsidies that will enable the
    construction or rehabilitation of more than 1 million** **affordable
    rental housing units**. In addition to expanding LIHTC, President
    Biden’s American Jobs Plan would bolster funding for successful
    housing subsidy programs that pair with LIHTC to produce and
    preserve housing that is affordable for very- and extremely-low
    income renters. This includes a $35 billion investment in the HOME
    Investment Partnerships program, $45 billion for the Housing Trust
    Fund, and $12 billion for the Capital Magnet Fund. The President is
    also proposing authorizing $2 billion in new project-based rental
    assistance agreements for the first time in more than 20 years to
    help even more working families access affordable housing. Together,
    these investments will produce, preserve, and retrofit more than a
    million affordable, rental housing units in big cities and small
    towns across the country.   
-   **Build and rehabilitate more than 500,000 homes for low- and
    middle-income homebuyers and homeowners**. Across the country,
    millions of homes sit empty and in poor condition with values too
    low to support new construction or substantial renovation. To
    address this problem, the American Jobs Plan proposes creating a new
    federal tax credit, based on the innovative, bipartisan Neighborhood
    Homes Investment Act. The tax credit will make homeownership and
    wealth-building possible for low- and moderate-income families by
    encouraging the construction and rehabilitation of homes in and for
    underserved communities.   
-   **Expand and strengthen the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.**
    Financing the construction or rehabilitation of affordable rental
    housing for low-income households is challenging. The Low-Income
    Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) reduces financing barriers by offering
    federal income tax credits to private investors in exchange for
    equity investments in affordable rental housing.  As the federal
    government’s primary tool for financing affordable housing, LIHTC
    currently produces an estimated 100,000 units per year. President
    Biden’s plan will build on this success by proposing to invest an
    additional $55 billion in tax credits, enabling the creation of tens
    of thousands more units each year, including more units in high
    opportunity neighborhoods.  
-   **Expand access to federal subsidies that will enable the
    construction or rehabilitation of more than 1 million** **affordable
    rental housing units**. In addition to expanding LIHTC, President
    Biden’s American Jobs Plan would bolster funding for successful
    housing subsidy programs that pair with LIHTC to produce and
    preserve housing that is affordable for very- and extremely-low
    income renters. This includes a $35 billion investment in the HOME
    Investment Partnerships program, $45 billion for the Housing Trust
    Fund, and $12 billion for the Capital Magnet Fund. The President is
    also proposing authorizing $2 billion in new project-based rental
    assistance agreements for the first time in more than 20 years to
    help even more working families access affordable housing. Together,
    these investments will produce, preserve, and retrofit more than a
    million affordable, rental housing units in big cities and small
    towns across the country.   
-   **Address longstanding public housing capital needs.** Nearly two
    million people across the country live in public housing—families
    with children, older Americans, and people with disabilities. Like
    roads, schools, and power grids, public housing is critical
    infrastructure that directly impacts the health and viability of our
    communities. Yet nearly half of the nearly 1 million units of public
    housing are over 50 years old and many contain lead paint, mold, and
    other health hazards. The American Jobs Plan calls for a
    transformative investment of $40 billion to rehabilitate and
    preserve public housing, addressing residents’ critical health and
    safety concerns. This is not just a safety issue but a racial
    justice issue, as approximately three in four public housing
    residents are people of color.  
-   **Remove lead-based paint from homes.** Over three million homes
    with children under six years of age have lead-based paint hazards,
    including more than 1 million low-income households. The American
    Jobs Plan proposes a $3 billion investment to fund the inspection
    and removal of lead-based paint from 175,000 housing units.  
-   **Incentivize the removal of exclusionary zoning and harmful land
    use policies.** For decades, exclusionary zoning laws – like minimum
    lot sizes, mandatory parking requirements, and prohibitions on
    multifamily housing – have inflated housing and construction costs
    and locked families out of areas with more opportunities. President
    Biden’s plan seeks to help jurisdictions reduce barriers to
    producing affordable housing and expand housing choices for people
    with low or moderate incomes. The American Jobs Plan will create a
    $5 billion incentive program that awards flexible and attractive
    funding to jurisdictions that take concrete steps to reduce barriers
    to affordable housing production.  
-   **Support and sustain homeownership and renting opportunities in
    rural America.** Rural communities face unique housing needs that
    are not always fulfilled by traditional federal housing programs.
    The American Jobs Plan proposes investing $2 billion to build and
    rehabilitate housing across rural America. This includes additional
    Section 502 loans that would enable thousands of low-income
    individuals in federally declared disaster areas to use funds for
    new construction of single-family homes. The plan would also provide
    new resources through Section 504 to enable existing low-income
    rural homeowners to make energy efficiency improvements to their
    homes. And, this proposal would support the construction and
    rehabilitation of thousands of multifamily units, including units
    that would provide affordable, sustainable housing to farmworkers
    and their families.  
-   **Develop and operate affordable housing for older Americans.** More
    than half of renters over the age of 65 are cost-burdened, meaning
    they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses.
    The American Jobs Plan would invest $2 billion in HUD’s Section 202
    program, increasing the supply of affordable housing with supportive
    services for very low-income older Americans.  
-   **Meet tribal communities’ housing needs**. Tribal communities face
    outsized housing shortages and a dire need for infrastructure. The
    American Jobs Plan will invest $2 billion to expand the development
    and rehabilitation of affordable housing, build supportive
    infrastructure, and spur green, climate resilient community
    development in Indian Country.  
-   **Create more climate-resilient communities.** Every year, thousands
    of American families are displaced in the wake of extreme weather
    events fueled by climate change. The Biden-Harris Administration has
    proposed a more than $2 billion investment for a new Community
    Development Block Grant Program for resilience activities in
    communities vulnerable to climate change. HUD would target funding
    to low- and moderate-income areas with increased risk from climate
    related disasters..  
-   **Make housing more** **energy efficient and resilient for millions
    of families.** Millions of single-family and multifamily housing
    were built decades ago and are less energy efficient and resilient
    than modern technologies and practices allow. The American Jobs Plan
    would seek to address this problem through a historic investment in
    building upgrades. This includes an $17.5 billion investment in the
    Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance program and $500
    million in grants and low-interest loans to help renovate
    multifamily homes. The American Jobs Plan also proposes a new, $10
    billion consumer electrification rebate program modeled on the
    bipartisan HOPE for HOMES Act. And, the American Jobs Plan would
    extend and expand existing home efficiency tax credits for working
    families. These investments will make housing more energy and water
    efficient and more resilient to extreme weather events, creating
    jobs, improving public health, and saving families money along the
    way.  
-   **Build affordable housing and supportive infrastructure in small
    towns all across America.** Many of America’s small towns face
    shortages of affordable housing for households experiencing poverty
    and for lower-wage workers. The American Jobs Plan would devote $250
    million towards a new Main Street Revitalization Program that would
    provide grants to communities for renovating their downtown business
    districts and adding units of affordable housing while, retaining
    the area’s traditional and historic character.  
-   **Revitalize the physical assets that build community connectedness
    and spark innovation.** Across the country, too many low-income
    communities and communities of color have suffered from years of
    disinvestment. The American Jobs Plan proposes investing $10 billion
    to support community-led redevelopment projects that create
    innovative shared amenities, spark new economic activity, provide
    services, build community wealth, and strengthen social cohesion. 
    The proposed Community Revitalization Fund would support a wide
    range of transformational places to work and gather, including but
    not limited to: upgrading access to natural areas, restoring vacant
    buildings to provide low-cost space for services and community
    entrepreneurs, and removing toxic waste and building new parks,
    greenways, and community gardens.
