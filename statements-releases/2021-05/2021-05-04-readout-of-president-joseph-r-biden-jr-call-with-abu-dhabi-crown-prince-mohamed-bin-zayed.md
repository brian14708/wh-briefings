President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke today with Crown Prince Mohamed bin
Zayed Al Nahyan to reaffirm the longstanding partnership between the
United States and the United Arab Emirates. The President congratulated
the Crown Prince on the United Arab Emirates’ upcoming 50th anniversary
of independence, and reflected on the collaborative efforts the United
States and the United Arab Emirates have undertaken on issues ranging
from space to climate to defense and security. They discussed regional
and global challenges, including Afghanistan, the nuclear and regional
dimensions of the threat posed by Iran, as well as the common quest for
de-escalation and peace in the Middle East. In that regard, the
President underlined the strategic importance of the normalization of
relations between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. He expressed his
full support for strengthening and expanding these arrangements.
President Biden and the Crown Prince agreed on the priority of working
together to address conflicts, including the humanitarian crisis in the
Tigray region of Ethiopia.
