Today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met in Washington with
Stephen Lovegrove, National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of
the United Kingdom, to exchange views on a range of shared global
challenges as part of our ongoing bilateral consultations.  Mr. Sullivan
and Mr. Lovegrove agreed to continue coordinating on COVID-19, including
global access to vaccines. They discussed Afghanistan, Russia, and Iran,
as well as the situation in Gaza.  In addition, they discussed President
Biden’s June trip to the United Kingdom to attend the G7 Summit and meet
with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which will provide an
opportunity to reaffirm our strong alliance.
