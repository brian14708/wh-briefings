title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Supports Hard-hit Restaurants\
  \ and\_Bars"
---
 
Restaurants, bars, and other small businesses offering on-site food and
beverages are vital to our communities and economy. From big cities to
small towns, these restaurants and bars offer communities a place to
gather, celebrate, and share ideas. They also employed nearly 12 percent
of all workers prior to the pandemic. Despite their importance,
restaurants and bars have suffered severely during the pandemic.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration has made supporting small businesses –
including small restaurants and bars – a top priority.  
  
Established through the American Rescue Plan (ARP), the Biden-Harris
Administration recently launched the Restaurant Revitalization Fund
(RFF) – a $28.6 billion program to aid restaurants, bars, food trucks
and other food and drink establishments. In the first two days of the
program:

-   186,200 restaurants, bars, and other eligible businesses in all 50
    states, Washington, D.C., and five U.S. Territories applied for
    relief.  
-   97,600 applications came from restaurants, bars, and other eligible
    businesses owned and controlled by women (46,400), veterans (4,200),
    socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (30,800), or
    some combination of the three (16,200).  
-   61,700 applications came from businesses with under $500,000 in
    annual pre-pandemic revenue, representing some of the smallest
    restaurants and bars in America.

Under the RRF, restaurants and bars are eligible for grants equal to
their pandemic-related revenue loss, with a cap of $10 million per
business and $5 million per location. The funds are available for
certain eligible uses, like payroll and rent.  
  
While all small businesses are welcome to apply, under the law the SBA
will prioritize funding applications from small businesses owned and
controlled by women, veterans, and socially and economically
disadvantaged individuals for the first 21 days of the program.
Following the 21 days, all eligible applications will be funded on a
first-come, first-served basis.  
  
In addition to the 21-day priority period, the Biden-Harris
Administration is taking steps to ensure the equitable distribution of
relief by establishing $9.5 billion in set-asides for the smallest
restaurants and bars – including millions of dollars for restaurants,
bars, and food trucks with under $50,000 in revenue.  
  
In addition to the RRF, in its first 100 days, the Administration
approved $31 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, $438
million in COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), and more than
$29 million in Targeted EIDL Advance grants to restaurants and bars
around the country. The Administration’s national vaccination strategy
and direct relief for working families have also helped restaurants and
bars re-open, re-hire, and return to normal operations. While the
Administration remains focused on helping these restaurants and
businesses make ends meet, data suggests that the overall outlook for
the industry has improved in recent months:

-   The restaurant industry has added 450,000 jobs since January.  
-   The share of restaurant and bar owners planning to hire in the next
    six months has nearly doubled, from just 30 percent in January to
    more than 57 percent in mid-April.  
-   The share of restaurant and bar owners that have returned to normal
    operations has more than doubled since January and the share
    expecting to return to normal operations in the next six months has
    increased from just 17 percent to more than 26 percent.

Unfortunately, many restaurants and bars remain partially closed, with
reduced revenue and significant pandemic-related debt. In the weeks
ahead, the Administration will prioritize getting RRF relief to hard-hit
businesses so they can keep their doors open.  
  
**<u>American Restaurants and the COVID-19 Pandemic</u>**  
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the restaurant and bar industry was one
of the
[fastest-growing](https://equitablegrowth.org/more-resilient-small-u-s-restaurants-and-their-workers-can-exit-the-coronavirus-recession-and-sustain-an-equitable-economic-recovery/)
sectors of the U.S. economy. From 2009 to 2019, the
[number](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/ENUUS000205722?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true)
of restaurants, bars, and other food and beverage places grew by 19
percent, from 548,000 establishments to 654,000 establishments. Over the
same period,
[employment](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES7072200001?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true)
grew by 28 percent (or 2.7 million jobs), from 9.4 million to 12 million
employees. And, the industry’s [annual retail
sales](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MRTSSM722USS#0) grew by 70
percent, from $453 billion to $774 billion. In 2019, this industry
represented 2.3 percent of U.S. GDP.  
  
The restaurant industry has suffered disproportionately during the
pandemic. Nearly [half of all restaurant, bar, and other food and
drinking place
workers](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES7072200001?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true)
(6 million people) lost or left their jobs between February and April
2020. While employment rebounded as pandemic-related shutdowns and
restrictions eased, the industry was still down [2.3 million
jobs](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES7072200001?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true)
at the end of 2020. The industry added another 450,000 jobs between
January and March 2021, but remains down 1.8 million jobs compared to
February 2020. Consistent with the decline in employment, monthly retail
sales at restaurants, bars, and other food and drinking businesses [fell
by more than half](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MRTSSM722USS#0) in
the early months of the pandemic, from $66 billion in February 2020 to
$30 billion in April 2020. The industry ended the year with $623 billion
in retail sales, 19 percent lower than 2019. While the true number of
restaurants and bars permanently lost during the pandemic may not be
known for some time, research suggests that more than 400,000 small
businesses across industries have permanently closed and millions more
are struggling to make ends meet.  
  
**<u>The Biden-Harris Administration’s Recent Efforts to Support
Restaurants and Bars</u>**  
In just 100 days, the Small Business Administration (SBA) delivered more
than $31 billion in relief to restaurants and bars. Specifically, the
SBA has:

-   **Approved more than 337,000 forgivable loans worth $31 billion to
    small restaurants and bars through the Paycheck Protection
    Program.** PPP has served as a lifeline to millions of businesses
    that struggled to remain open during the pandemic. By implementing a
    series of program and policy changes to improve access for sole
    proprietors, open up the program business owners with delinquent
    student loan debt prior non-fraud felonies, and engage in focused
    outreach and education targeting the smallest businesses, the 2021
    round of PPP has also seen real improvements in equity of outcomes.
    Across industries, 95% of PPP loans have gone to businesses with
    less than 20 employees while the share of PPP funds going to rural
    businesses has increased by 20 percent from the 2020 program round.
    Additionally, the average loan size in 2021 is roughly $45,700, down
    by more than half from an average size of $101,000 in 2020.

<!-- -->

-   **Approved more than 4,000 long-term, low-interest loans worth $438
    million to small restaurants and bars through the COVID-19 EIDL
    program.** The COVID EIDL program has enabled millions of small
    businesses – including small restaurants and bars –to meet financial
    obligations and operating expenses in the wake of the pandemic. In
    2021, the Biden-Harris Administration took steps to increase the
    amount of support available through the COVID EIDL program by
    raising the loan limit to 24-months of economic injury with a
    maximum loan amount of $500,000. This summer, SBA will further
    increase the cap on COVID EIDL loans up to $2 million, which is the
    maximum allowed by statute. These changes will unlock billions of
    dollars in additional funding to restaurants and bars who previously
    received the maximum loan amount.  
-   **Approved $29 million in flexible Targeted EIDL Advance grants to
    more than 4,000 hard-hit small restaurants and bars in low-income
    communities.** The COVID-19 Targeted EIDL Advance program provides
    advance funds of up to $10,000 to small businesses – including small
    restaurants and bars – that are located in low-income communities,
    and have suffered revenue losses of more than 30 percent. President
    Biden’s American Rescue Plan included an additional $5 billion for
    the Supplemental Targeted EIDL Advance Program, which will offer
    grants to the smallest, hardest-hit businesses in America, including
    many including restaurants and bars.
