***These actions will: Protect Americans. Put us on a path to end the
Pandemic. Reduce Variants. Demonstrate Leadership.***

Today, the President reaffirmed his commitment to leading an
international and coordinated vaccination effort, announcing that the
U.S. will donate 80 million U.S. vaccines – the 60 million doses of
AstraZeneca vaccines previously announced and at least an additional 20
million doses of U.S. authorized vaccines by the end of June. The U.S.
will continue to donate from our excess supply as that supply is
delivered to us. Today’s announcement is the Administration’s next step
as we ramp up our efforts to respond to COVID-19 around the world. Going
forward over the coming weeks, the U.S. will use its leadership working
with our G7 partners, the EU, COVAX, and others to coordinate a
multilateral effort focused on ending the pandemic. Specifically, we
seek to garner concrete, deliverable commitments from other governments
and private sector partners to make available more vaccines, spur
production and manufacturing for vaccines and raw materials, get shots
into arms around the world, and provide health security assistance to
save lives, stop the spread of COVID-19, reduce the lifespan of this
pandemic, and recover economically.

**<u>In service of ending the pandemic everywhere</u>**

-   **The United States will work with COVAX and other partners to
    ensure these vaccines are delivered in a way that is equitable and**
    **follows the science and public health data.** The United States
    will not use its vaccines to secure favors from other countries.

<!-- -->

-   In the weeks ahead, working with the world’s democracies **the
    Biden-Harris Administration will coordinate a multilateral effort to
    end the pandemic**. We look forward to progress on this at the G7
    Summit in June.

<!-- -->

-   This is a unique moment in history, and it requires American
    leadership, science and ingenuity, perseverance, and the world’s
    democracies to step up to the plate.

**<u>Sharing U.S. surplus vaccine doses to save lives</u>**

-   COVID-19 is a global challenge that requires a global response. The
    United States and the world will never be safe when this pandemic is
    raging globally. New variants will continue arise – placing us all
    at risk.

<!-- -->

-   Because the United States has done so much in the U.S., we can
    continue to do more to help the world by taking a leading role in
    ending the pandemic globally and building a coordinated,
    multilateral effort around the world aimed at ending the pandemic.

<!-- -->

-   Our overarching aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to
    as many people as fast as possible.

<!-- -->

-   The United States will send **80 million** U.S. vaccines to help
    countries battling the pandemic by the end of June 2021. This
    equates to all of its manufactured 60 million AstraZeneca vaccine
    doses as soon as they are reviewed by the FDA, as well as at least
    another 20 million doses of vaccines that are authorized for use in
    the United States. We will continue to donate from our excess supply
    as that supply is delivered to us.

<!-- -->

-   **As President Biden said, just as, in World War II, America was the
    arsenal of democracy – in this battle against COVID-19 pandemic, our
    nation will be the arsenal of vaccines.**

**<u>This decision builds on existing U.S. leadership in the global
COVID response</u>**

-   **$11.5 billion in new funding to support countries’ COVID-19
    response.** The United States has expanded its support for countries
    in battling and recovering from COVID-19 globally with $11.5 billion
    from Congress in the American Rescue Plan.

<!-- -->

-   **The COVID-19 TRIPS Waiver.** Extraordinary times call for
    extraordinary measures. The United States supports waiving
    intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines due to the
    extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic.

<!-- -->

-   **Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) for COVID-19 Recovery.** The
    Department of Treasury is working with the management of the
    International Monetary Fund and other members toward a $650 billion
    general allocation of SDRs to IMF member countries to support the
    global recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, which would also increase
    demand for U.S. exports and support U.S. firms and the creation of
    U.S. jobs.

<!-- -->

-   **Global vaccine manufacturing and producing raw materials**. The
    United States is working with the private sector and all possible
    partners to expand global vaccine manufacturing and distribution, as
    well as production of vital raw materials. For example, the U.S.
    International Development Finance Corporation has launched a global
    vaccine initiative that is targeting investments in multiple regions
    of the world both to address short-term crisis response requirements
    as well as intermediate-term efforts to ensure better global
    preparedness for future health challenges. This includes, but is not
    limited to, the U.S. Quad Vaccine partnership to supply at least one
    billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022, including the
    Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

<!-- -->

-   **Emergency assistance for countries in need.** The United States
    recently sent six flights and up to $100 million of assistance to
    India and is supporting new assistance to South Asia and Latin
    America as countries experience surges.

<!-- -->

-   **Re-engaging with the World Health Organization (WHO).** On Day
    One, President Biden re-engaged with the WHO and committed to
    strengthening and reforming the organization.

<!-- -->

-   **Advancing global health security and the Global Health Security
    Agenda, including by** spearheading – with G-20 and other partners
    efforts to come to consensus in 2021 on establishing a sustainable
    global health security financing mechanism, triggers and independent
    oversight and accountability for leaders to act without hesitation
    when a biological threat emerges; regional surge capacity for
    vaccines, personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and
    therapeutics; and a globally fit-for-purpose biosurveillance system.
