title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Crisis in Ethiopia
---
 
I am deeply concerned by the escalating violence and the hardening of
regional and ethnic divisions in multiple parts of Ethiopia.
The large-scale human rights abuses taking place in Tigray, including
widespread sexual violence, are unacceptable and must end. Families of
every background and ethnic heritage deserve to live in peace and
security in their country. Political wounds cannot be healed through
force of arms. Belligerents in the Tigray region should declare and
adhere to a ceasefire, and Eritrean and Amhara forces should
withdraw. Earlier this week, the UN Office of Humanitarian Affairs
warned that Ethiopia could experience its first famine since the 1980s
because of this protracted conflict. All parties, in particular the
Ethiopian and Eritrean forces, must allow immediate, unimpeded
humanitarian access to the region in order to prevent widespread
famine. 

The United States urges Ethiopia’s leaders and institutions to promote
reconciliation, human rights, and respect for pluralism. Doing so will
preserve the unity and territorial integrity of the state, and ensure
the protection of the Ethiopian people and the delivery of urgently
needed assistance. The Government of Ethiopia and other stakeholders
across the political spectrum should commit to an inclusive dialogue.
Working together, the people of Ethiopia can build a shared vision for
the country’s political future and lay the foundation for sustainable
and equitable economic growth and prosperity.

The United States is committed to helping Ethiopia address these
challenges, building on the longstanding ties between our two nations
and working with the African Union, United Nations, and other
international partners. U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeff
Feltman is leading a renewed U.S. diplomatic effort to help peacefully
resolve the interlinked conflicts across the region, including a
resolution of the dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that
meets the needs of all parties. Special Envoy Feltman will return to the
region next week and keep me apprised of his progress. America’s
diplomacy will reflect our values: defending freedom, upholding
universal rights, respecting the rule of law, and treating every person
with dignity.
