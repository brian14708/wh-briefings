title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Delivers Funds to Support the\
  \ Health of Older\_Americans"
---
 
Today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration
for Community Living is releasing $1.4 billion in funding from the
American Rescue Plan for Older Americans Act programs, including
programs to support vaccine outreach and coordination, address social
isolation, provide family caregiver support, and offer nutrition
support. It will also fund justice programs to ensure the safety and
protection of older adults.  
  
The funding will be distributed as follows:

-   **$750 million for meals for older adults.** With this funding for
    Older Americans Act nutrition programs, states will be able to
    continue home-delivered meals as well as “drive-through” or
    “grab-and-go” meals for older adults who typically would participate
    in meal programs at community centers that have been closed due to
    the pandemic. It will also allow states to re-open meal program
    locations safely that might have closed during the pandemic.  
-   **$460 million for Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) through
    the Older Americans Act.** This funding provides help to those who
    need it for help with household chores and grocery shopping;
    transportation to essential services (such as grocery stores, banks,
    or doctors); and case management. The funding can also be used to
    vaccinate older Americans and address the effects of extended social
    isolation.
-   **$44 million for evidence-based health promotion and disease
    prevention.** This includes programs to address fall prevention,
    managing a chronic disease, and programs to detect and reduce
    depression among older Americans. 
-   **$145 million to help family caregivers support their loved ones.**
    This funding for the National Family Caregiver Support Program will
    assist family and informal caregivers to provide in-home supports,
    including counseling, respite care, training and more.
-   **$10 million to safeguard the health and welfare of residents in
    long-term care facilities**. These funds will support State
    Long-term Care Ombudsman programs to advocate on behalf of residents
    of long-term care facilities across the country. This money will
    allow ombudsman programs that are advocating for residents to safely
    go back into facilities after they had to discontinue that support
    during the pandemic, and continue to promote the health, safety,
    welfare, and rights of residents.

The announcement coincides with today’s presidential proclamation
honoring May 2021 as Older Americans Month. The [proclamation
recognizes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/03/a-proclamation-on-older-americans-month-2021/)
that older Americans and families have faced substantial challenges
during the last year, and their resilience and strength have made our
country stronger.  
  
Older adults deserve to age with dignity and have equitable access to
the long-term care system, regardless of race, sexual orientation or
gender identity, disability, or socioeconomic status. The Biden-Harris
Administration is committed to expanding access to health care,
nutrition services, caregiving, and opportunities to age in place for
all older Americans. In the first 100 days, the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken significant steps to address the health and
security of older adults. In addition to the funding announced today,
the Administration has:  
  
**Expanded Funding for Home and Community Based Services.** The American
Rescue Plan provides states with billions in additional Medicaid funding
to help support their home and community-based services programs. The
additional Medicaid funding will help expand access to home and
community-based services for older adults and ensure that caregivers are
fairly compensated for their work.  
  
**Increased Access to Affordable Housing for Seniors.** In January, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced $150 million
in available funding to create new deeply affordable housing for seniors
with extremely low incomes through the Section 202 Supportive Housing
for the Elderly program. The program supports the construction of new
rental homes, as well as their ongoing management and affordability
through long-term project-based rental assistance. This will expand
access to critically-needed affordable housing for our nation’s
seniors.  
  
**Provided COVID-19 Vaccinations and Testing for Elderly Residents of
HUD-Assisted Housing.** President Biden delivered on his promise to
expand the supply of COVID-19 vaccines and to make every person age 16
and older eligible for vaccines. However, too many Americans—especially
older Americans—continue to face barriers to accessing COVID-19
vaccines. On Friday, April 30, the Secretaries of HUD and HHS issued a
joint letter directing community health centers and HUD’s network of
housing agencies, housing owners, and programs to provide COVID-19
vaccinations and testing to HUD-assisted households, including elderly
residents in HUD’s senior and public housing. HUD and HHS regional and
field staff will facilitate these partnerships, including coordinating
on-site vaccine clinics in HUD-assisted housing serving the elderly.  
  
**Expanded Nutrition Assistance for Low-Income Seniors.** The Commodity
Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) provides nutritious,
domestically-sourced USDA foods to low-income persons 60 years or older.
The American Rescue Plan provided nearly $37 million to expand the reach
of CSFP by fulfilling all 2021 requests from states to serve more
seniors and adding the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes to the
program. This expansion, along with similar actions in other nutrition
programs including SNAP that serve this population, will help combat
food insecurity among seniors during the pandemic. In addition, USDA
Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is ensuring those who rely on CSFP
don’t unintentionally lose access to their benefits due to the financial
relief they receive through the American Rescue Plan. FNS is providing
guidance to states and Tribal nations to exclude stimulus funds and
child tax credits provided by the American Rescue Plan from income when
determining eligibility for CSFP.   
  
**Proposed Robust Investments in the Caregiving Economy.** Before the
COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and policymakers warned of an imminent
long-term care crisis. Prior to 2020, it was estimated that [more than
half](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BPC-Health-Financing-Long-Term-Services-and-Supports.pdf)
of people turning 65 would need long term services and supports (LTSS).
Older adults can receive these types of services in a variety of places:
in their homes, nursing homes, or assisted living facilities. The
American Jobs Plan proposes to invest an additional $400 billion to
expand access to these long-term services and supports for older
Americans. This investment will also support well-paying caregiving jobs
that include benefits and the ability to collectively bargain, building
state infrastructure to improve the quality of services and to support
workers. The funding will take significant steps to help older adults
get high-quality care in their homes and communities.
