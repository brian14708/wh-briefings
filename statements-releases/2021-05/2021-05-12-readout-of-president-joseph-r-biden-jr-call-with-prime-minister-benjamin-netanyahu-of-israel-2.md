President Biden spoke today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. He condemned the rocket attacks by Hamas and other terrorist
groups, including against Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He conveyed his
unwavering support for Israel’s security and for Israel’s legitimate
right to defend itself and its people, while protecting civilians. He
also conveyed the United States’ encouragement of a pathway toward
restoring a sustainable calm. He shared his conviction that Jerusalem, a
city of such importance to people of faith from around the world, must
be a place of peace. He updated the Prime Minister on the United States’
diplomatic engagement with regional countries, including Egypt, Jordan,
and Qatar, as well as with Palestinian officials.

The two leaders agreed to maintain the close consultation between their
teams, which has included consistent engagement by their respective
foreign ministers, defense ministers, chiefs of defense, and national
security advisors, and to stay in touch personally in the days ahead.
