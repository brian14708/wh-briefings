title: "Statement by Senior Advisor and Chief Spokesperson Symone Sanders on Vice\
  \ President Kamala Harris\u2019s Bipartisan Meeting on Broadband Infrastructure"
---
 
Today, Vice President Harris had a productive conversation with
Democratic and Republican members of Congress on the critical importance
of investing in our nation’s broadband infrastructure. These members
have each led on broadband issues for a long time. They represent rural
and urban areas and they spoke to the experience of Americans who
struggle to access or afford high-speed internet. It was a substantive
and informative meeting.  
   
The President and the Vice President have had several meetings at the
White House with bipartisan Congressional leaders to discuss addressing
the country’s infrastructure challenges. They will continue to engage
with members of Congress from both sides of the aisle. By connecting
every American to affordable and accessible high-speed Internet through
investments in the American Jobs Plan, we can connect people to economic
opportunity and keep our nation competitive.
