title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019\
  s Visit to the Middle\_East"
---
 
Following up on our quiet, intensive diplomacy to bring about a
ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, I have asked my Secretary of State,
Tony Blinken, to travel to the Middle East this week. During his trip,
Secretary Blinken will meet with Israeli leaders about our ironclad
commitment to Israel’s security. He will continue our Administration’s
efforts to rebuild ties to, and support for, the Palestinian people and
leaders, after years of neglect. And he will engage other key partners
in the region, including on the coordinated international effort to
ensure immediate assistance reaches Gaza in a way that benefits the
people there and not Hamas, and on reducing the risk of further conflict
in the coming months.
