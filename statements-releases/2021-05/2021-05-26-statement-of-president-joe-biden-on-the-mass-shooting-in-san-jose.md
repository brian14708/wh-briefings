title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Mass Shooting in San\_Jose"
---
 
Vice President Harris and I have been briefed on the horrific tragedy
that took place this morning in San Jose, where a lone gunman murdered
at least eight people and wounded several others at a county rail yard.

We are still awaiting many of the details of this latest mass shooting,
but there are some things we know for sure. There are at least eight
families who will never be whole again. There are children, parents, and
spouses who are waiting to hear whether someone they love is ever going
to come home. There are union brothers and sisters – good, honest,
hardworking people – who are mourning their own.   
  
I have the solemn duty of yet again of ordering the flag to be lowered
at half-staff, just weeks after doing so following the mass shootings at
spas in and around Atlanta; in a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado; at
a home in Rock Hill, South Carolina; and at a FedEx facility in
Indianapolis, Indiana.  
  
Enough.  
  
Once again, I urge Congress to take immediate action and heed the call
of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to
help end this epidemic of gun violence in America.  
  
Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We
can, and we must, do more.  
  
God bless all those whose lives were lost today, and all those who loved
them.
