  \ Continued Federal Government Efforts to Mitigate\_Impacts"

Tonight’s announcement means there’s an end in sight for the supply
disruptions that have affected States across the Southeast. As Colonial
Pipeline works to safely and fully resume operations over the next few
days, we will stay in close contact with the company and will continue
to offer any assistance needed—as we have done since the outset of this
shutdown on Friday.

As supplies return to normal, we will also continue our
whole-of-government effort to mitigate any challenges, including the
swift steps we’ve taken to boost gas supply in affected States through
actions by the EPA, the Department of Transportation, the Department of
Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, and other
agencies. Tonight, as part of that effort, the Secretary of Homeland
Security announced that he is issuing a temporary and targeted Jones Act
waiver to an individual company. This waiver will enable the transport
of additional gas and jet fuel between the Gulf Coast and East Coast
ports to ease supply constraints.

President Biden and the White House will monitor the situation closely
in the coming days, and continue to urge Americans to just purchase what
they need, and not hoard fuel, as supply is restored. The President and
his team also thank the Governors and State and local leaders throughout
the affected region who have moved quickly to address problems in their
communities, and will continue to partner closely with them to provide
any additional assistance as needed.

Earlier tonight, President Biden signed an executive order to chart a
new course to improve the nation’s cybersecurity. This incident
demonstrates that Federal agencies and the private sector must work
collaboratively to learn the lessons of this incident, strengthen
cybersecurity practices, and deploy technologies that increase
resilience against cyberattacks.
