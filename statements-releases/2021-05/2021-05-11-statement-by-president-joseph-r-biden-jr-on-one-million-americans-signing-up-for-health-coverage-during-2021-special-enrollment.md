title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on One Million Americans Signing\
  \ Up for Health Coverage During 2021 Special\_Enrollment"
---
 
Health care is a right, not a privilege — and ensuring that every single
American has access to the quality, affordable health care they need is
a national imperative. Since it became law more than a decade ago, the
Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans. The
pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed, and how critical it is
that we continue to improve upon it.  
  
On February 15, my Administration opened HealthCare.gov to provide all
Americans the opportunity to sign up for health insurance through a
special enrollment period. Less than three months later, I am pleased to
announce that one million Americans have signed up. That’s one million
more Americans who now have the peace of mind that comes from having
health insurance. One million more Americans who don’t have to lie awake
at night worrying about what happens if they or one of their family
members gets sick. Through this opportunity for special enrollment, we
have made enormous progress in expanding access to health insurance.   
  
There is plenty of time left to sign up, and I encourage everyone who
needs health insurance to go to HealthCare.gov by August 15. If you
already have coverage, you can help family members and friends who are
uninsured get themselves covered.  
  
Getting more Americans covered is an important part of the equation —
but we also need to lower health costs. My American Rescue Plan lowered
premiums for nine million Americans who buy their coverage through the
Affordable Care Act, saving families an average [of $50 per person per
month](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/12/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-reduces-health-care-costs-expands-access-insurance-coverage.html). Americans
are also seeing lower out of pocket costs. Since April 1, the median
deductible for Americans signing up for new coverage on HealthCare.gov
has dropped by nearly 90 percent, to just $50.  
  
The American Families Plan will build on this work to make health care
more affordable — including by making the American Rescue Plan’s premium
reductions permanent. Today’s milestone demonstrates that there is a
need and a demand for high quality, affordable health insurance across
this country. It is up to Congress to hear them, and act quickly to pass
the American Families Plan.
