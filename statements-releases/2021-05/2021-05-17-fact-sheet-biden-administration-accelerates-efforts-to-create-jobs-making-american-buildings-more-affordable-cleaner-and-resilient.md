*Energy, GSA, and EPA Announce New Programs to Electrify Buildings,
Invest $30M in America’s Workforce, and Save Consumers Money*

Today, the White House convened leaders from across the Administration
to announce new federal investments in building energy efficiency and
electrification, as well as new opportunities to modernize homes and
businesses which will create good-paying, union jobs.

National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, Council on Environmental Quality
(CEQ) Chair Brenda Mallory, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, General
Services Administration (GSA) Acting Administrator Katy Kale, and
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan met
today with building sector leaders, including developers and owners,
labor unions and trade organizations, public housing authorities, and
heat pump manufacturers. The meeting advances President Biden’s goal of
modernizing and upgrading the nation’s residential and commercial
buildings to be affordable, resilient, accessible, energy efficient, and
electrified.

In his first 100 days in office, President Biden took sweeping steps to
build a new American infrastructure and clean energy economy that will
create millions of new jobs. The President issued an Executive Order
announcing bold targets to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector
by 2035 and put the United States on an irreversible path to a net-zero
economy by 2050. And the Department of Energy rebooted the efficiency
standards program to save consumers money through energy efficient
appliances and equipment. The President recognizes the opportunity that
retrofitting and modernizing our nation’s existing buildings presents,
which is why his [American Jobs
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/)
American Jobs Plan promises to build, rehabilitate, and retrofit more
than two million homes across the country while also improving our
nation’s federal facilities. This effort will create new domestic
manufacturing opportunities for electric heating and cooling technology,
invest in research and development to spur smart building advances, and
forge collaborations that will enable buildings to be powered by clean
electricity.

Additionally, independent analysts at the Coalition for Green Capital
and Rewiring America [issued a report
today](https://www.rewiringamerica.org/rewiring-communities-report) that
shows how the Clean Energy Accelerator proposed in the American Jobs
Plan could be used to drive an electrification program to secure energy
bill savings of up to $750 per year for nearly 12 million American
households (75 percent of which are low- to moderate-income). At the
same time, the report found that the program, working through the
Accelerator, could create nearly 700,000 good-paying, local jobs in
every region in the country, while also driving down greenhouse gas
emissions from households by up to 40 million metric tons a year by
2030, which is the equivalent of taking more than eight million cars off
the road. The report also estimates that advancing the Clean Energy
Accelerator could catalyze tens of billions in private sector
co-investment through this program, and that 90% of investment delivered
through the proposal would directly benefit low-to moderate-income
households.  

The findings of this report underscore the importance of today’s
announcements from the White House addressing a series of concrete
actions to modernize and electrify our buildings, invest in America’s
workforce, and drive innovations of the future.

**<u>Investing in America’s Workforce and Creating Jobs</u>**

-   **Announcing $30M investment in the American workforce**.
    Constructing, retrofitting, and electrifying America’s buildings is
    only possible with a strong, skilled, diverse, and growing
    workforce. DOE announced it is expanding its support for
    organizations – including unions, trade associations, and
    educational institutions – that prepare people to join the
    workforces of the future, and support career pathways for a diverse,
    qualified, and well-paid workforce that can support the
    development/construction of high-performance buildings. Through
    technical assistance and funding awards, DOE will fund up to $30M of
    these efforts with workforce development and job-creation leaders.

**<u>Launching New Federal Performance Standards to Lead by
Example</u>**

-   **Announcing New Federal Building Performance Standards.** CEQ is
    launching an interagency Federal sustainability effort with GSA,
    DOE, and EPA to develop the first-ever building performance
    standards (BPS) for the federal government. The BPS will establish
    metrics, targets, and tracking methods to reach federal carbon
    emissions goals. The performance standards will identify progressive
    performance milestones as well as the resources that agencies need
    to meet them.

**<u>Establishing New Partnerships to Kickstart Demand for
High-Performance Buildings</u>**

The Biden Administration is dedicated to working with the private
sector, labor unions, building and home owners, and manufacturers in the
building industry to electrify and modernize new and existing buildings.
Additionally, the Administration will support city, state, and tribal
governments through expanded partnerships to develop new tools and
resources to make buildings more energy efficient, affordable, and
healthy. These partnerships will include:

-   **Launching the low-carbon buildings pilot.** Through the Department
    of Energy’s Better Buildings Initiative and in coordination with
    Housing and Urban Development, DOE is announcing the first 55
    commercial, industrial, and multifamily organizations to participate
    in the [Low-Carbon Buildings Pilot
    program](https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/challenge/special-initiatives/low-carbon-pilot),
    which will share lessons learned for real world pathways to low and
    no emission buildings.
-   **.** In partnership with the Advanced Water Heating Initiative, DOE
    is launching a new initiative to increase market adoption of
    high-efficiency, grid-connected Heat Pump Water Heaters in
    residential and commercial buildings – which are two to four times
    more efficient than conventional water heaters – in homes across the
    country.
-   **Committing to new and expanded EPA partnership programs.** EPA is
    launching new residential and commercial sector partnerships to
    accelerate efficiency and electrification retrofits with a focus on
    underserved residential households through the ENERGY STAR Home
    Upgrade program, accelerate building electrification through an
    advanced ENERGY STAR certification for new residential buildings,
    and recognize commercial buildings through a new zero-carbon
    commercial building certification. It will also launch a new
    Greenhouse Gas tool linked to its Portfolio Manager tool.

**<u>Accelerating Domestic Manufacturing, Innovation,</u>** **and
Affordability of New and Existing Buildings**

-   **Announcing a new national research initiative focused on
    innovating clean and efficient building heating and cooling
    systems.** Today, DOE will launch the [Initiative for Better Energy,
    Emissions, and
    Equity](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/energy-emissions-and-equity-e3-initiative)
    (*E3* Initiative), putting $10M toward accelerating the research and
    adoption of heat pump technologies. As part of the E3 Initiative,
    DOE will launch a Cold Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge to
    accelerate the development of high performing cold climate heat pump
    technologies. Another important component will be new research
    efforts partnering National Laboratories and manufacturers to
    accelerate the development of lower to no global warming potential
    refrigerants that can be quickly commercialized.  
-   **Releasing a national grid-interactive efficient buildings
    roadmap.** Today, DOE is releasing the [Grid-interactive Efficient
    Buildings (GEB)
    Roadmap](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/grid-interactive-efficient-buildings),
    with 14 recommendations to better integrate buildings with solar and
    wind power through smart operation of electricity demand and
    storage. Smart buildings allow consumers to have more choice over
    building operations and provide the ability to manage energy loads
    and reduce energy bills. Over the next two decades, national
    adoption of GEBs would create savings of $100–200 billion across the
    electric power system and could decrease emissions in the power
    sector by 6% per year.
-   **Releasing a blueprint to integrate GEB Technologies into Energy
    Savings Contracts.** GSA is releasing a blueprint to integrate
    grid-interactive technologies into federal building renovation and
    improvement projects, particularly using energy savings, and utility
    energy savings contracts. The blueprint puts practical guidance and
    tools into the hands of building operators to help them integrate
    GEB technologies into current and future performance contracts.
-   **Announcing new ENERGY STAR standards to advance heat pump
    technology and fast chargers for electric vehicles.** If all heat
    pumps, central air conditioners, and electric water heaters sold in
    the U.S. met the new ENERGY STAR standards, the energy cost savings
    would grow to $11 billion a year, and 255 billion pounds of annual
    greenhouse gas emissions would be avoided.  These new standards will
    increase American households’ and businesses’ access to affordable
    heating, cooling, water heating, and transportation options.
