National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Minister of
External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar of India to review the strong
partnership between the world’s largest democracies.  They welcomed
cooperation in recent weeks that resulted in deliveries of over $500
million in COVID-19 relief supplies from the U.S. federal and state
governments, U.S. companies, and from private citizens across America
for the people of India.  They discussed a range of regional and global
issues, and agreed the United States and India should continue working
closely together to address common challenges throughout the
Indo-Pacific region.  They agreed that people-to-people ties and shared
values are the foundation of the U.S.-India strategic partnership that
is helping to end the pandemic, supporting a free and open Indo-Pacific,
and providing global leadership on climate change.
