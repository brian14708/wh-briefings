*Administration Also Urges Congressional Action on De Minimis Reform*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new actions to enforce
our laws and protect American consumers, workers, and businesses by
addressing the significant increased abuse of the de minimis exemption,
in particular China-founded e-commerce platforms, and strengthening
efforts to target and block shipments that violate U.S. laws.  
   
Over the last ten years, the number of shipments entering the United
States claiming the de minimis exemption has increased significantly,
from approximately 140 million a year to over one billion a year. This
exponential increase in de minimis shipments makes it more challenging
to enforce U.S. trade laws, health and safety requirements, intellectual
property rights, consumer protection rules, and to block illicit
synthetic drugs such as fentanyl and synthetic drug raw materials and
machinery from entering the country.  
   
The majority of shipments entering the United States claiming the de
minimis exemption originate from several China-founded e-commerce
platforms, putting American consumers at risk, undercutting American
workers and businesses, and resulting in the importation of huge volumes
of low-value products such as textiles and apparel into the U.S. market
duty-free. A shipment is eligible for the de minimis exemption if the
aggregate fair retail value of the articles imported is $800 or less. De
minimis shipments enter the United States with less information than
other imports and are not subject to duties and taxes.     
   
The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly
difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments. Foreign
corporate giants who exploit the de minimis exemption do so for a
variety of reasons.  Some companies exploit the de minimis to conceal
shipments of illegal and dangerous products and avoid compliance with
U.S. health and safety and consumer protection laws. Other foreign
entities use it to circumvent U.S. trade enforcement actions intended to
level the playing field for American workers, retailers, and
manufacturers.  
   
With today’s announcement, the Administration is using executive
authority to stop the abuse of the de minimis exemption. The
Administration also calls on Congress to pass legislation this year to
reform the de minimis exemption comprehensively to further protect
American consumers, workers, and businesses.  
   
***Administration Action Intended to Reduce De Minimis Import
Volumes***  
New Rulemaking to Reduce De Minimis Volume and Strengthen Trade
Enforcement: The Administration intends to issue a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking that would exclude from the de minimis exemption all
shipments containing products covered by tariffs imposed under Sections
201 or 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or Section 232 of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962.   
 

-   Section 301 tariffs currently cover approximately 40% of U.S.
    imports, including 70% of textile and apparel imports from China.
    Some e-commerce platforms and other foreign sellers circumvent these
    tariffs by shipping items from China to the United States claiming
    the de minimis exemption. If finalized, these goods would no longer
    be eligible for the de minimis exemption.

<!-- -->

-   It would also ensure that de minimis exemption eligibility for
    products covered by trade enforcement actions is consistent across
    U.S. trade laws. Products covered by antidumping or countervailing
    duty orders are already excluded from de minimis exemption
    eligibility. 

***Administration Action to Protect U.S. Consumers, Workers, and
Businesses***  
New Rulemaking to Improve Accountability and Enforcement in De Minimis
Shipments: The Administration intends to issue a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking regarding the entry of low-value shipments that will propose
to strengthen information collection requirements to promote greater
visibility into de minimis shipments.  

-   This regulatory action will propose to require specific, additional
    data for de minimis shipments – including the 10-digit tariff
    classification number and the person claiming the de minimis
    exemption – which will improve targeting of de minimis shipments and
    facilitate expedited clearance of lawful de minimis shipments.

<!-- -->

-   The proposed regulatory changes will also clarify who is eligible
    for the administrative exemption, and requires filers to identify
    the person on whose behalf the exemption is being claimed.

<!-- -->

-   These new requirements would help U.S. Customs and Border Protection
    (CBP) protect consumers from goods that do not meet regulatory
    health and safety standards and protect U.S. businesses from unfair
    competition against imported goods that would otherwise be charged
    duties or restricted from entry. 

Final Rule to Prevent De Minimis Shipments from Circumventing Safety
Standards: Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) staff intend to
propose a final rule requiring importers of consumer products to file
Certificates of Compliance (CoC) electronically with CBP and CPSC at the
time of entry, including for de minimis shipments.  

-   This regulation would strengthen CBP’s and CPSC’s ability to target
    and block unsafe products from entering the U.S. market and would
    help prevent foreign companies from using the de minimis exemption
    to circumvent consumer protection testing and certification
    requirements.

***Comprehensive Legislative Reforms on De Minimis Needed to Protect
American Consumers, Workers, and Businesses***  
The Administration is pursuing significant regulatory action to address
the surge in de minimis imports that put American consumers, workers,
retailers, and manufacturers at risk.  But further comprehensive de
minimis reforms are needed, and these reforms require congressional
action.  The Administration stands ready to work with Congress to pass
comprehensive de minimis reform legislation by the end of the year.  Key
reforms Congress should advance include:  

-   Exclusion from de minimis eligibility of import-sensitive products. 
    Congress should act to exclude import-sensitive products, including
    textile and apparel products, from the de minimis exemption. 

<!-- -->

-   Exclusion from the de minimis exemption of shipments containing
    products that are covered by Section 301, Section 201, or Section
    232 trade enforcement actions.  The Administration intends to issue
    a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to exclude shipments containing
    products covered by Section 301, Section 201, or Section 232 trade
    remedies actions, but legislative action by Congress to make this
    statutory change would help to achieve this important reform more
    quickly. 

<!-- -->

-   Passage of previously proposed de minimis reforms in the Detect and
    Defeat Counter-Fentanyl Proposal.  These reforms would, among other
    actions, increase transparency and accountability under the de
    minimis program by requiring more data from shippers, including the
    product tariff classification number, and give border officials
    tools they need to more effectively track and target the millions of
    shipments coming in claiming the de minimis exemption.  The Detect
    and Defeat Counter-Fentanyl proposal incorporates many of the
    bipartisan ideas put forward by Members of Congress, and will
    increase CBP’s ability to detect and seize illicit drugs and the raw
    material used to make them, and hold drug traffickers accountable. 

***Administration Action to Protect American Textile and Apparel
Manufacturers***  
American textile and apparel producers play a critical role in the U.S.
defense industrial base and support hundreds of thousands of direct and
indirect jobs in the United States.  U.S. textile and apparel
manufacturers are facing unfair competition from several China-founded
e-commerce giants, as these companies take advantage of the de minimis
exemption to ship huge volumes of textile and apparel products to
American consumers. In addition to the de minimis reforms highlighted
above, the Administration is exploring other decisive actions to support
U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers and their workers.   

-   Executive Branch Action to Expand Procurement of Certain Textile and
    Apparel Products:  The Administration will explore ways to increase
    procurement of certain textile and apparel products across agencies,
    as a way of ensuring that U.S. taxpayer dollars are supporting U.S.
    taxpayer jobs in the textile and apparel sector.

<!-- -->

-   Strengthened Textile and Apparel Enforcement:The Administration
    continues to prioritize enforcement efforts against illicit textile
    and apparel imports through intensified targeting of small package
    shipments, joint trade special operations, increased customs audits
    and foreign verifications, and the expansion of the Uyghur Forced
    Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity List.
