  11"

Today is a day of solemn remembrance as we mourn the souls we lost in a
heinous terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. We stand in solidarity
with their families and loved ones. We also honor the extraordinary
heroism on display that fateful day by ordinary Americans helping their
fellow Americans. We will never forget.  
   
On September 11, 2001 terrorists sought to attack and destroy our way of
life—our democracy, our freedoms, and everything we hold dear as
Americans. In that endeavor they failed. In the days that followed, we
were all reminded that unity is possible in America. Together, we made
clear we will not bend or break in the face of terrorism. We rallied
around the victims and their families. We worked to overcome the hate
and discrimination that many of our fellow Americans experienced
following the attacks. And we fought for the country we love and the
ideals we cherish. All of this work continues today.  
   
Hundreds of thousands of Americans served in Afghanistan and elsewhere
to selflessly and bravely protect the American people and our homeland. 
They deployed to root out the evil of terrorism and to deny terrorists a
safe haven. I will always honor their service and sacrifice.  
   
In 2011, President Obama ordered an operation that killed Osama bin
Laden, and two years ago, President Biden ordered an operation that
killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden’s deputy. We remain vigilant against
any terrorist threat directed at the United States or the American
people and we continue to disrupt terrorist networks wherever we find
them.  
   
Today, I will travel to the hallowed ground of the World Trade Center,
the Pentagon, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania to honor the victims and
their families. As I do so, I will also reflect on the incredible
selflessness and courage of the American people. And as we commemorate
this day, we should all reflect on what binds us together as one: the
greatest privilege on Earth, the pride and privilege of being an
American.
