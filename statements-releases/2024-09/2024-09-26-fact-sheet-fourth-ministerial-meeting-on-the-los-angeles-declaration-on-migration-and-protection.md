title: "Fact sheet: Fourth Ministerial Meeting on the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration\
  \ and\_Protection"
---
 
On June 10, 2022, President Biden launched the Los Angeles Declaration
on Migration and Protection with leaders from across the Western
Hemisphere to tackle together the challenge of migration and forced
displacement. Under this framework, the United States has worked with
partner countries to collaboratively reduce irregular migration and
advance a safe, humane, and orderly approach to migration across the
hemisphere. **Over the last two years, the 22 endorsing countries have
achieved substantial progress across the Los Angeles Declaration’s three
core pillars**:  

1.  addressing root causes and supporting the integration of migrants to
    foster long-term stabilization;  
2.  expanding lawful pathways for migration and protection; and  
3.  strengthening humane enforcement.

On September 25, 2024, Secretary of State Antony Blinken hosted the
fourth Los Angeles Declaration Ministerial with White House Homeland
Security Advisor Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall, White House Coordinator for
the Los Angeles Declaration Marcela Escobari, and foreign ministers and
senior representatives from the other 21 endorsing countries.  
  
On behalf of the United States, Secretary Blinken announced **more than
$686 million** in new humanitarian, development, economic, and security
assistance to support partner countries to respond to urgent
humanitarian needs, strengthen humane enforcement efforts, expand lawful
pathways, and facilitate the regularization and integration of migrants
within the region. With this announcement, the United States has now
committed o**ver $1.2 billion under the Los Angeles Declaration
framework in 2024 alone**, reflecting the Biden-Harris Administration’s
unwavering commitment to collaboratively addressing this hemispheric
challenge.  
  
The United States also announced **expanded enforcement partnerships**
to deter irregular migration, including a [removal pilot program with
the Government of
Panama](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/01/statement-from-nsc-spokesperson-adrienne-watson-welcoming-the-agreement-with-panama-to-address-irregular-migration-jointly/)
and [new visa
restrictions](https://www.state.gov/visa-restrictions-on-executives-of-travel-companies-who-facilitate-irregular-migration-to-the-united-states/)
against travel agencies and tour operators that prey on vulnerable
migrants. These actions aim to hold accountable those who exploit
migrants for profit and to dissuade migrants from attempting dangerous
irregular journeys.  
  
Endorsing countries agreed to further institutionalize the Los Angeles
Declaration through the establishment of a Secretariat, which will be
managed by the Pan American Development Foundation and the Organization
of American States and will ensure that coordinated progress on
migration management is sustained into the future under this framework.
**The Government of Colombia formally announced that it will assume the
role of rotating Country Chair over the next year and will host the
fifth Los Angeles Declaration Ministerial in 2025.**  
  
The endorsing countries presented progress toward their commitments
under the Los Angeles Declaration and announced the following new
initiatives:  
  
**Strengthening Humane Enforcement**

-   On June 4, 2024, President Biden announced [executive
    action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/04/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-secure-the-border/)s
    to bar migrants who cross the U.S. Southern border unlawfully from
    receiving asylum during times when high levels of encounters exceed
    our ability to deliver timely consequences.  Since June 4,
    encounters between ports of entry have dropped by more than 50% and
    remain at their lowest level in years. Encounters in July and August
    2024 dropped to the lowest levels since September 2020.  
-   Panama is implementing a U.S.-funded **removal program** that has
    resulted in the removal of hundreds of foreign nationals who did not
    have a lawful basis to remain in Panama, after they were screened
    for protection needs.  
-   The United States continues to take steps to impose **visa
    restrictions** on executives of travel agencies and charter air and
    maritime transportation companies around the globe that are
    facilitating irregular migration to the United States. On September
    24, 2024, the State Department imposed additional [visa restrictions
    against multiple executives of travel agencies operating in Europe,
    Africa, and the Middle
    East](https://www.state.gov/actions-against-travel-agency-executives-who-knowingly-facilitate-irregular-migration/)
    that are knowingly facilitating illegal migration.  
-   Partner countries reaffirmed their commitment to stem
    extracontinental irregular migration through the strategic use of
    **entry and transit visas** and passenger vetting. In total, Los
    Angeles Declaration endorsing countries have taken over 300 new visa
    policy actions to restrict travel intended solely for irregular
    migration.  
-   The United States has mobilized resources to increase
    investigations, arrests, and prosecutions of human smuggling and
    trafficking networks, including in partnerships with other Los
    Angeles Declaration countries.  In August, for example, Guatemalan
    **law enforcement**—in an investigation supported by the Departments
    of Justice and Homeland Security— dismantled a human smuggling
    network based in Guatemala that was responsible for the deaths of 53
    migrants in a tractor-trailer in San Antonio, Texas in June 2022.  
-   Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States has
    **sanctioned** eight human smuggling networks, including over 30
    individuals and entities, to hold accountable those responsible for
    the exploitation of migrants.  On September 24, 2024, for example,
    the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
    Control (OFAC) [sanctioned five Colombian nationals and two
    Mexican-based
    businesses](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2605),
    including two individuals affiliated with the Clan del Golfo
    transnational criminal organization, who are responsible for the
    control of migrant flows through the Darien Gap. Colombian
    authorities are offering a reward of 50 million Colombian pesos for
    the capture of both wanted criminals.  
-   The United States has enhanced **biometric sharing capabilities**
    throughout the region, enabling law enforcement actions against
    criminal actors before they enter any of our countries. Guatemala,
    with support from the United States, announced a new biometric
    program at La Aurora International Airport to cross-reference
    travelers with U.S. security databases in near-real time in order to
    identify high-risk arriving passengers.

**Expanding Lawful Pathways for Migration and Protection**

-   The Biden-Harris Administration has **rebuilt the United States’
    refugee resettlement program** and led a historic expansion of
    lawful pathways to the United States and partner countries. The
    United States is now on track to welcome 100,000 refugees from
    around the world this fiscal year, the largest number in three
    decades.  
-   Under the U.S. Government’s **Safe Mobility Initiative**, over
    23,000 refugees from within the Western Hemisphere have been
    resettled safely and legally in the United States in Fiscal Year
    2024, a four-fold increase over FY 2023.  
-   The United States is incorporating **Labor Neighbors** as part of
    the Safe Mobility Initiative to refer migrants to more lawful
    pathways and help match labor demand to labor supply across the
    hemisphere.  
-   **Belize** announced it is establishing a seasonal migrant worker
    program focused on agriculture and construction.  
-   **Canada** seeks to support labor mobility through its Economic
    Mobility Pathways Pilot.  
-   **Ecuador** is launching a new labor mobility unit with U.S.
    support.  
-   As part of the Safe Mobility Initiative, the United States continues
    to provide migrants and displaced persons with information and
    resources though the **Safe Mobility Offices** in Guatemala, Costa
    Rica, Colombia, and Ecuador.  
-   **Costa Rica** and the United States announced that the Safe
    Mobility Offices in Costa Rica will be extended until December 2025.
    Costa Rica will also expand eligibility criteria to include
    nationals from eligible countries who were present in Costa Rica on
    or before September 15, 2024.  
-   **Canada** began receiving referrals from the Safe Mobility Offices
    in the hemisphere and expects arrivals to Canada starting in 2025.  
-   The **Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV)** parole
    processes have helped reduce irregular flows from these four
    countries, enabling migrants to apply from where they are for lawful
    entry to the United States.

**Addressing Root Causes and Supporting the Integration of Migrants to
Foster Long-term Stabilization**

-   A significant portion of the United States’ **$686 million in new
    funding** announced on September 25, 2024 will support regional
    efforts to respond to urgent **humanitarian needs**, like basic
    food, shelter, and health care for migrants and displaced persons,
    including nearly 8 million Venezuelans. U.S. funding also supports
    regional partners’ efforts **to absorb and integrate migrants**,
    promoting migrants’ financial inclusion and labor market insertion,
    and supporting host communities.   
-   **More than half of Los** **Angeles Declaration endorsing countries
    have implemented policies that provide regular status and help
    migrants integrate and rebuild their lives** in Latin America and
    the Caribbean, stemming further displacement and reducing migrant
    vulnerability. Their combined efforts have enabled 4.4 million
    Venezuelans to attain legal status to date. The following countries
    took new actions since May to provide regular status and help
    integrate more migrants:  
-   **Argentina** announced a special admission and regularization
    program that allows Venezuelans with expired identity documents
    (within the last 10 years) to seek residency in Argentina, and to
    verify identity or criminal record through a sworn statement in the
    absence of documents.  
-   **Canada** announced a new Francophone minority community student
    program that will give program participants access to settlement
    services while they are studying to help them integrate successfully
    into their communities.  
-   **Colombia** announced the signing of a regularization plan that
    could benefit an estimated 600,000 undocumented parents and legal
    guardians of children with valid Colombian Temporary Protective
    Status.  
-   **Ecuador** extended its regularization process until April 2025,
    allowing approximately 100,000 Venezuelan migrants to gain legal
    status. Separately, Ecuador committed to renew nearly 95,000
    two-year visas previously issued to regularized Venezuelans. As part
    of the U.S. funding announcement, the U.S. is helping Ecuador unlock
    additional World Bank lending to support Ecuador’s Social Safety Net
    project that contributes to stabilizing and integrating the 450,000
    Venezuelan migrants currently in the country.  
-   **Mexico** committed to opening a Multi-Purpose Processing Center in
    Chiapas to streamline the processing of migrants seeking refuge and
    to provide them integration support through access to financial,
    health, and education services.   
-   **Panama** announced the intent to begin a process that would allow
    migrants currently living in Panama irregularly to apply for legal
    status and obtain work authorizations.  
-   **Peru**, working closely with United Nations implementing agencies,
    announced plans to prioritize documenting migrant children and
    adolescents in the public education system. Through these efforts,
    Peru will provide protection and basic services to minors and their
    families.  
-   **Uruguay** approved two decrees to grant legal status to
    approximately 25,500 non-citizens living in Uruguay with pending
    asylum claims who likely would not qualify for asylum.
