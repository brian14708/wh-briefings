On September 13, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will host Prime Minister
Keir Starmer of the United Kingdom for a bilateral meeting at the White
House. This will be their second meeting at the White House since Prime
Minister Starmer’s election this summer.  The leaders will have an
in-depth discussion on a range of global issues of mutual interest,
including continuing robust support to Ukraine in its defense against
Russian aggression, securing a hostage release and ceasefire deal to end
the war in Gaza, protecting international shipping in the Red Sea from
Iranian-backed Houthi threats, and advancing a free and open
Indo-Pacific.  They will also discuss opportunities to strengthen
U.S.-UK cooperation to secure supply chains and increase climate
resilience. President Biden will underscore the importance of continuing
to strengthen the special relationship between the United States and the
United Kingdom.
