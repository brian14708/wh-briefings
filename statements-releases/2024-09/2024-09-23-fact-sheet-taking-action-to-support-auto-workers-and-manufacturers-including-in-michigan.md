title: "FACT SHEET: Taking Action to Support Auto Workers and Manufacturers, Including\
  \ in\_Michigan"
---
 
*In Detroit, the White House will convene the Michigan Workforce Hub to
announce new commitments to support the auto workforce and increase
capital access for auto suppliers*

The American auto industry has driven the U.S. manufacturing base for
generations, and the Biden-Harris Administration is ensuring that the
future of the auto industry is made in America by American union
workers. Today, National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard is traveling to
Detroit, Michigan to convene the [Michigan Workforce
Hub](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-workforce-hubs-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-good-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
and announce a suite of new actions to support automakers and auto
workers, with an emphasis on historic auto communities in Michigan. The
Michigan Workforce Hub is one of nine Investing in America Workforce
Hubs launched by the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure all Americans
can access the good jobs created by the Biden-Harris Investing in
America agenda.  
  
Today’s announcement builds on the actions that Vice President Harris
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/06/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-more-than-100-million-to-support-american-auto-workers-and-small-auto-suppliers/)
in May to support small- and medium-sized auto manufacturers with access
to capital to expand or retool manufacturing facilities, new workforce
training resources, and new technical assistance programs.  
  
“I believe in an economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a
chance to succeed. Investing in the ambitions and aspirations of our
people is the best way to grow the American economy and the middle
class,” **said Vice President Kamala Harris**. “Yet for far too long, we
have seen lack of investment in communities across America and profound
obstacles to economic opportunity—including in communities with historic
manufacturing expertise such as Detroit. Earlier this year, I was proud
to announce new support for small- and medium-sized auto suppliers in
Detroit. Today’s announcements build on those investments by making sure
our auto supply chains stay here in America, strengthening our economy
overall by investing in historically underserved communities, and
keeping more auto jobs in Detroit.”  
  
**$1 Billion in Financing for Small- And Medium-Sized Auto Suppliers**  
  
Auto suppliers support the majority of auto manufacturing jobs, and
small- and medium-sized suppliers employ more than 250,000 workers
across the country—serving as economic engines in Michigan, Ohio, and
other historic auto communities.  
  
Today, the Department of the Treasury is announcing a **$9.1 million
grant to launch the Michigan Auto Supplier Transition Program to help
small and underserved automotive manufacturers and aftermarket
suppliers** secure financing to scale and shift to supplying the
electric vehicle supply chain. Made possible by Treasury’s State Small
Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), the Michigan Auto Supplier
Transition Program will provide financial, legal, accounting, and other
support services to underserved and very small businesses, including
helping these firms access the over $230 million in additional lending
and equity investments made available to support Michigan businesses
through the American Rescue Plan’s SSBCI program. The Michigan Economic
Development Corporation will oversee the Auto Supplier Transition
program in coordination with the Michigan Department of Labor and
Economic Opportunity Community and Worker Economic Transition Office.  
   
Additionally, **Monroe Capital is announcing a commitment to raise up to
$1 billion for a new “Drive Forward” Fund to facilitate access to lower
cost capital for small- and medium-sized auto manufacturers to
refinance, grow, and diversify their businesses**. The Drive Forward
Fund builds on successful investment funds catalyzed by the Small
Business Administration’s Small Business Investment Company program,
which provides low-cost government-guaranteed leverage funding to lower
the cost of capital for portfolio companies. The Drive Forward Fund will
be advised by a council with experts from across the automotive industry
to ensure that capital is directed to small and medium-sized auto
suppliers with high-road labor practices and significant domestic
manufacturing content. A focus will be placed on manufacturers that are
well-positioned to lead in the future of the automotive industry and
need additional capital and support to grow their manufacturing
capacity, including companies making critical investments in the
transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) production to electric
vehicles (EV).  
  
These new announcements build on investments that the Biden-Harris
Administration has already made in auto manufacturers, including in
Michigan. For example, under the [Domestic Manufacturing Conversion
Grant
Program](https://www.energy.gov/mesc/domestic-manufacturing-conversion-grant-program),
the Department of Energy announced a $500 million award to General
Motors in Lansing and a $158 million award to ZF North America in
Marysville to support the conversion of these legacy ICE facilities to
EV production—retaining or creating over 1,000 combined jobs. Both of
these facilities are UAW unionized. The Department of Energy also
announced that the State of Michigan is eligible to receive over $18
million in funding to provide [grants to small- and medium-sized auto
suppliers](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-50-million-strengthen-americas-auto-communities-and)
converting their facilities to electric vehicle production. To protect
these investments from unfair trade practices abroad, the President has
taken strong and strategic action, including by [raising
tariffs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/)
to 100% on EVs and batteries from China.  
  
  
The Administration welcomes additional commitments and actions from
stakeholders across industry to support automakers and auto workers.  
  
***Michigan Workforce Hub Commitments***  
  
In 2023, First Lady Jill Biden
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strategies-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
the Investing in America Workforce Initiative in five initial locations
where the Biden-Harris Investing in America agenda is catalyzing
historic investments in industries of the future. In April, President
Biden
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-workforce-hubs-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-good-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
Michigan as one of four new Workforce Hubs, designed to prepare Michigan
workers for the good-paying and union jobs created by these historic
investments, with a focus on the auto sector. Since the start of the
Biden-Harris Administration, industry has announced [$28
billion](https://invest.gov/) in private investment in clean energy and
manufacturing in Michigan. The Hub is focused on four pillars: improving
alignment between training programs and industry needs, standardizing
training program guidelines for emerging occupations in the auto supply
chain, promoting career readiness with a focus on underserved
communities, and addressing structural barriers to employment.  
  
The Michigan Workforce Hub is coordinating across the Department of
Labor, the Department of Energy, the Michigan Department of Labor and
Economic Opportunity, community colleges, unions, employers,
philanthropy, nonprofits, and others to deliver on President Biden’s
announcement. Since the launch of the Hub, the **Department of Labor has
invested more than $5.4 million to modernize, expand, and diversify
registered apprenticeship** programs in Michigan across key industries,
including manufacturing, and connect workers to good-paying jobs, and
the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity has continued
to leverage **$25 million in American Rescue Plan funding to expand
apprenticeships in the state**. The Detroit Regional Partnership is also
continuing to implement its [$52.2 million
grant](https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/american-rescue-plan/build-back-better/finalists/detroit-regional-partnership-foundation)
from the American Rescue Plan to **invest in the Detroit area’s legacy
automotive industry and unite 135 local coalition members** around a
common vision for a collaborative and equitable regional economy; the
coalition is undertaking  
  
**To institutionalize the work of the Michigan Workforce Hub, the
Department of Energy is** [**announcing**](https://energy.gov/ramp)
**the selection of a full-time Michigan Fellow, hosted by the Michigan
AFL-CIO Workforce Development Institute**. This Fellow is part of an
inaugural cohort of ten fellows and host organizations funded by the
Community Workforce Readiness Accelerator for Major Projects (RAMP)
program—which is designed to address workforce gaps while ensuring that
historic clean energy investments lift all communities, especially those
historically left behind.  
  
Today, the Michigan Workforce Hub is announcing a suite of new federal,
state, philanthropic, nonprofit, and private sector commitments:
