title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Lower Prescription Drug\_Prices"
---
 
For too long, millions of Americans have faced the impossible choice of
paying for their prescription drugs or being able to afford other basic
needs. While Big Pharma made record profits, Americans footed the bill
for the industry’s price hikes. Not anymore. Thanks to my Inflation
Reduction Act, companies that increase the price of prescription drugs
faster than inflation now must provide a rebate to Medicare.

Today, our Administration is announcing that starting in October,
seniors and people with disabilities enrolled in Medicare will pay less
for 54 Part B prescription drugs. That means more money will go back
into the pockets of people with Medicare – including some of the 822,000
seniors and people with disabilities who use these drugs annually to
treat conditions like cancer, osteoporosis, and pneumonia, and some
seniors will save more than $3,800 per day. And last month, for the
first time ever, Medicare negotiated lower prices on the first 10
prescription drugs selected for negotiation – some of the most expensive
and commonly used medications. Starting in 2025, out-of-pocket costs for
prescription drugs will be capped at $2,000 for Medicare beneficiaries.

These lower costs are only possible because of the Inflation Reduction
Act, which passed with the leadership of Democrats in Congress, and with
Vice President Harris casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate –
without a single Republican voting for it. While Republicans in Congress
try to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act which would mean high drug
costs for seniors, Vice President Harris and I will keep fighting to
ensure all Americans can pay less for prescription drugs.
