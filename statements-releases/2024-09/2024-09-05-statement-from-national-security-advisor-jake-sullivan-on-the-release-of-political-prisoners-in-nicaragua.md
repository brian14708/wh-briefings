title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Release of Political\
  \ Prisoners in\_Nicaragua"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration today secured the release
of 135 unjustly detained political prisoners in Nicaragua, on
humanitarian grounds.  No one should be put in jail for peacefully
exercising their fundamental rights of free expression, association, and
practicing their religion.  The 135 Nicaraguan citizens released today
included 13 members of the Texas-based Mountain Gateway organization,
along with Catholic laypeople, students, and others who Daniel Ortega
and Rosario Murillo consider a threat to their authoritarian rule.    
   
The United States welcomes the leadership and generosity of the
Government of Guatemala for graciously agreeing to accept these
Nicaraguan citizens.  Once in Guatemala, these individuals will be
offered the opportunity to apply for lawful ways to rebuild their lives
in the United States or other countries through President Biden’s Safe
Mobility Office initiative.  President Biden and Vice
President are grateful to President Arévalo for his continued leadership
across the region in addressing humanitarian issues and championing
democratic freedom.   
   
The United States again calls on the Government of Nicaragua to
immediately cease the arbitrary arrest and detention of its citizens for
merely exercising their fundamental freedoms.
