*New Executive Order Directs Federal Agencies to Combat Emerging
Firearms Threats and*  
*Improve School-Based Active Shooter Drills*

Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris are announcing a new
Executive Order directing federal agencies to improve school-based
active shooter drills and combat the emerging threats of machinegun
conversion devices and unserialized, 3D-printed firearms, as well as
additional executive actions that advance the Biden-Harris
Administration’s agenda to reduce gun violence and save lives.

After the prior Administration oversaw the largest one-year increase in
murders ever recorded, President Biden and Vice President Harris took
action from the start of their Administration to reduce violent crime.
The President and the Vice President helped deliver over $15 billion in
funding through the American Rescue Plan for law enforcement, community
violence interventions, and other public safety strategies. By the
middle of 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration had already announced
more executive actions to reduce gun violence than any other
administration. Then, on June 25, 2022, President Biden signed into law
the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence
prevention law in nearly 30 years. On September 22, 2023, to help drive
further progress, President Biden established the first-ever White House
Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris.

Under the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, in
2023 the United States experienced the single largest homicide rate drop
in recent history. The reduction in homicide has accelerated this year.
Data submitted to the Department of Justice shows that the homicide rate
dropped another [17
percent](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/readout-justice-departments-violent-crime-reduction-steering-committee-meeting-0)
from January through June 2024, compared to the same time period in
2023. Data from the Gun Violence Archive indicates that the number of
mass shootings so far this year is 20 percent lower than it was at this
time last year.

Today, as we mark one year since the establishment of the Office,
President Biden and Vice President Harris are announcing additional
meaningful actions to reduce gun violence and save lives. This
announcement builds on the numerous additional life-saving actions the
Biden-Harris Administration has taken, as detailed in the Office’s [Year
One Progress
Report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Year-One-Report-Final.pdf).

**<u>President Biden is signing an Executive Order to accelerate
progress on two key priorities: combating emerging firearms threats and
improving school-based active shooter drills.</u>**

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Combatting Emerging Firearms
Threats:</span> In April 2021, one of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
first executive actions to reduce gun violence was to address the
emerging threat of firearms without serial numbers, often referred to as
“ghost guns.” To expand these efforts, ATF established an Emerging
Threats Center. This Center focuses ATF’s resources on identifying
developments in illicit firearm marketplaces, including the use of new
technologies to make and unlawfully distribute undetectable firearms and
devices that convert semi-automatic firearms into illegal machineguns.

Now, President Biden and Vice President Harris are taking additional
action on two emerging firearms threats: machinegun conversion devices
and unserialized, 3D-printed firearms.

-   *Machinegun conversion devices* enable semi-automatic firearms,
    including easily concealable handguns, to match or exceed the rate
    of fire of many military machineguns with a single engagement of the
    trigger—up to 20 bullets in one second. From 2017 through 2021, ATF
    recovered 5,454 of these devices, a 570 percent increase over the
    previous five-year period. Machinegun conversion devices are illegal
    to possess under federal law, but we continue to see these devices
    show up at crime scenes because they are small, cheap, and easy to
    install. Machinegun conversion devices are often illegally imported
    or illegally made on a 3D printer from computer code found online.
    The 3D-printing of a machinegun conversion device costs as little as
    40 cents and takes fewer than 30 minutes.
-   *Unserialized, 3D-printed firearms* can be used for illegal purposes
    such as gun trafficking, unlawful possession by people convicted of
    felonies or subject to domestic violence restraining orders, or
    unlawfully engaging in the business of manufacturing or selling
    firearms. These firearms can be 3D-printed from computer code
    downloaded from the Internet and produced without serial numbers
    that law enforcement use to trace firearms recovered in criminal
    investigations. Some 3D-printed firearms can be made to be
    undetectable by magnetometers used to secure airports, courthouses,
    and event spaces, even though these undetectable firearms are
    illegal to make, sell, or possess under federal law. As 3D-printing
    technology continues to develop rapidly, the safety threat posed by
    3D-printed firearms may suddenly increase.

In this Executive Order, President Biden is establishing an Emerging
Firearms Threats Task Force, consisting of leadership from key federal
departments and agencies. President Biden is directing the Task Force to
issue a report within 90 days that includes: an assessment of the threat
posed by machinegun conversion devices and unserialized, 3D-printed
firearms; an assessment of federal agencies’ operational and legal
capacities to detect, intercept, and seize machinegun conversion devices
and unserialized, 3D-printed firearms; and an interagency plan for
combatting these emerging threats. The report will include any
additional authorities or funding the federal agencies need from
Congress in order to complete this work.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Improving School-Based Active
Shooter Drills: </span>The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to
preventing gun violence in schools, including by keeping guns out of the
hands of potential school shooters and investing more resources in
school safety and violence prevention. The majority of schools are
currently using drills to prepare for an active shooter situation.
Despite the ubiquity of these drills, there is very limited research on
how to design and deploy these drills to maximize their effectiveness
and limit any collateral harms they might cause. Many parents, students,
and educators have expressed concerns about the trauma caused by some
approaches to these drills. Federal agencies need to help schools
improve drills so they can more effectively prepare for an active
shooter situation while also preventing or minimizing any trauma.

In the Executive Order, President Biden is directing the Secretary of
Education and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with
the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
the U.S. Surgeon General, to develop and publish, within 110 days,
information for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education
regarding school-based active shooter drills. The information will
include a summary of: existing research on active shooter drills and
resources for school districts and institutions of higher education on
how to create, implement, and evaluate evidence-informed active shooter
drills; how to conduct effective and age- and
developmentally-appropriate drills; how best to communicate with
students, families, and educators about these drills; how to prevent
students and educators from experiencing trauma or psychological
distress associated with these drills; and how best to serve people with
disabilities and those with language-related needs, including by
ensuring compliance with federal civil rights laws, when designing and
implementing school-based active shooter drills.

**In addition to the Executive Order, federal departments and agencies
are taking the following actions:**

*Promoting Safe Gun Storage and Red Flag Laws*

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Encouraging Safe Storage of
    Firearms:</span> Today, the Department of Education is providing
    schools, school boards, and policymakers with a new tool to promote
    safe gun storage in their communities. Following up on its [initial
    safe storage
    actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/25/white-house-announces-new-actions-to-promote-safe-storage-of-firearms/),
    the Department of Education is publishing an [interactive
    website](https://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov/safe-firearm-storage)
    that highlights examples of state, community, and school district
    actions across the nation that promote safe gun storage within
    school communities. The website includes a map with state safe
    storage laws, examples of how schools are communicating with parents
    about safe storage, and examples of local policies on safe storage
    education. This new resource builds on
    [guidance](https://www.pbis.org/resource/implementing-physical-safety-measures-effectively-at-schools)
    the Department published earlier this year to highlight physical
    safety measures schools can pursue to help keep students safe in the
    event of gun violence in schools.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Clarifying Medicaid
    Reimbursement for Counseling on Firearm Safety: </span>Health
    systems, hospitals, and healthcare workers are an essential
    component of a healthy gun violence prevention and intervention
    system. By the end of October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
    Services (CMS) will announce that states may choose to use Medicaid
    to pay a health care provider for counseling parents and caregivers
    on firearm safety and injury prevention. This announcement will
    build off the coverage that Medicaid provides for “anticipatory
    guidance,” which is health education and counseling to help parents
    and caregivers understand and improve the health and development of
    their children. For example, Bright Futures/American Academy of
    Pediatrics’ guidelines include firearm safety guidance, such as safe
    storage guidance, as recommended anticipatory guidance for
    pediatricians to provide to parents.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementing State Red Flag
    Laws: </span>The Department of Justice is announcing over $135
    million in formula awards to 48 states under the Byrne State Crisis
    Intervention Program (Byrne SCIP), which provides funding for the
    implementation of extreme risk protection order, or “red flag”,
    programs, state crisis intervention court proceedings, and related
    programs/initiatives. The implementation of state red flag laws is
    supported by the National Extreme Risk Protection Resource Center.

*Funding Community Violence Intervention*

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Funding Community Violence
    Interventions: </span>In furtherance of the Biden-Harris
    Administration’s strategy to invest in community violence
    interventions as a proven solution to prevent gun violence, the
    Department of Justice is announcing an additional $85 million in
    funding through the Community Violence Intervention and Prevention
    Initiative (CVIPI). This funding will help 30 agencies and
    organizations develop and expand their community violence
    intervention work, including hospital-based violence intervention,
    street outreach, and cognitive behavioral therapy. These strategies
    are essential complements to law enforcement and this investment is
    part of the $400 million in total funding that the Biden-Harris
    Administration has secured for CVIPI. CVIPI is only one part of how
    the Administration funds community violence interventions. This
    [fact
    sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CVI-Funding-Resources.pdf)
    lists the full range of federal resources available to address
    community violence.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Clarifying Medicaid
    Reimbursement for Violence Intervention:</span> CMS [previously
    clarified](https://www.medicaid.gov/state-resource-center/downloads/allstatecall-20210427.pdf)
    that states may authorize health care providers to be reimbursed by
    Medicaid for violence intervention programs. In October, CMS expects
    to proactively raise this clarification with states. CMS will also
    explore how best to convene state governments and healthcare
    providers on incorporating Medicaid benefits into violence
    prevention programs.

*Improving the Gun Background Check System*

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Facilitating Enhanced
    Background Checks for Individuals Under Age 21: </span>The
    Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) established enhanced
    background checks for individuals under age 21 trying to purchase a
    firearm. These enhanced checks have already stopped over 900
    transactions, keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous
    individuals. But a number of states across the country have privacy
    laws that prevent state officials from fully responding to enhanced
    background check inquiries. The Biden-Harris Administration’s [Safer
    States
    Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OGVP-Safer-States-Policy-Agenda.pdf)
    made fixing this issue a top priority for states, and Connecticut,
    Vermont, Nevada, Texas, and Kentucky have all recently made
    necessary changes. Today, the Department of Justice is issuing model
    legislation that additional states may use to inform their own
    legislation and allow a carve-out to share juvenile records solely
    for the purpose of enhanced background checks. In addition, the
    Justice Department is releasing information on whether state laws
    permit information-sharing with regard to juvenile records for the
    purposes of enhanced background checks.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Maximizing the Enhanced
    Background Check with Red Flag Laws: </span>Part of the enhanced
    background check requires requesting records from state and local
    law enforcement and mental health repositories about potential
    purchasers under 21.  In these and other circumstances, if a person
    shows clear signs of being in crisis and a danger to themselves or
    others, they may qualify for consideration under applicable red flag
    laws which would generally result in that person being ineligible to
    possess or receive firearms.  By October 22, the Extreme Risk
    Protection Order (ERPO) National Resource Center will provide
    training to state and local law enforcement on the ERPO process,
    including how it intersects with individuals under 21.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Improving the Federal Gun
    Background Check System: </span>BSCA’s enhanced background checks
    for gun purchasers under age 21 and the law’s narrowing of the
    “boyfriend loophole,” along with the expanding number of states with
    red flag laws, are placing new challenges on state and local
    agencies attempting to ascertain what records they need to send to
    the federal gun background check system. To address these
    challenges, there needs to be system-wide improvements and a new era
    of collaboration among various entities engaging with the federal
    gun background check system. By December 15, the Department of
    Justice’s Office of Justice Programs will have evaluated the
    existing grant programs that support improvements to the gun
    background check system and make any changes needed to support
    states looking to improve their records systems, which may include
    lengthening the duration of grants where appropriate. 

*Expanding Data on Gun Violence and Gun Trafficking*

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Publishing Additional Data
    on Ghost Gun Trends and Firearms Trafficking: </span>This winter,
    ATF will publish the fourth volume of its National Firearms Commerce
    and Trafficking Assessment. This volume will provide an update on
    ghost gun trends and trafficking investigations, as well as expanded
    information on machinegun conversion device recoveries.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Expanding Collection of Gun
    Violence Data: </span>There is a lack of reliable and timely data on
    gun deaths and gunshot injuries that show what is happening
    nationwide and in individual communities. This data is critical to
    focusing investment and enforcement efforts. Today, the FBI is
    announcing that it will collect additional detail in its data
    collection for gunshot injury wounds in the National Incident-Based
    Reporting System (NIBRS) by June 2025. The FBI will implement a new
    injury code to reflect a gunshot wound in the NIBRS victim segment.
    NIBRS will also enable law enforcement agencies to submit additional
    detail as to how firearms were used in specific crimes, and the
    nature of the crime at issue.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Improving Data on Gunshot
    Injuries: </span>The Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) is improving a data visualization tool to present
    gun death and injury data faster and at a more local level. Using
    data from vital statistics and emergency rooms at the local level
    can help inform prevention strategies and evaluate the effectiveness
    of programs.

*Supporting Survivors of Gun Violence*

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Addressing the Trauma
    Resulting from Gun Violence: </span>This fall, the federal Substance
    Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will take
    additional action to support individuals dealing with the trauma
    that results from gun violence. SAMHSA will release:
    -   Best practices for local offices of violence prevention to use
        in addressing trauma resulting from gun violence;A tip sheet for
        individuals affected by gun violence who may be seeking more
        information on the behavioral health impacts of gun violence and
        how to seek help;A report on lessons learned from the federal
        ReCAST grant program to uplift the voices of communities
        impacted by violence as well as share strategies other
        communities can implement to promote healing, recovery, and
        resiliency; and

    <!-- -->

    -   A toolkit for faith-based leaders, educators, and other leaders
        to help communities affected by the trauma resulting from gun
        violence.

*Destroying Crime Guns*

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensuring Appropriate
    Disposition of Firearms Seized by Law Enforcement: </span>Firearms
    or firearm parts that were presumed to be destroyed by law
    enforcement have begun showing up in crimes. Sometimes the guns
    recovered by law enforcement are sent to a third-party that only
    partially destroys them. By October 30, the Department of Justice
    will refresh and clarify best practices for federal law enforcement
    disposition of seized firearms, including when working in
    partnership with state and local law enforcement. The Department of
    Justice will also release a plan to offer new training and education
    for state and local partners on safe and appropriate firearm
    disposition.

*Preventing Firearm Suicide*

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Facilitating Voluntary
    Out-of-Home Storage to Prevent Firearm Suicide: </span>Voluntary
    out-of-home storage of firearms is an effective tactic to saves
    lives by creating time and space between a person in crisis and a
    firearm. A number of states, including
    [Colorado](https://coloradofirearmsafetycoalition.org/gun-storage-map/),
    [Louisiana](https://www.armoryproject.org/louisiana),
    [Maryland](https://mdpgv.org/safestoragemap/), [North
    Carolina](https://www.ncsafe.org/safestorage/), and
    [Wisconsin](https://www.betherewis.com/firearm-storage-online-map/),
    have developed gun storage maps to show different locations where a
    gun owner can voluntarily store their firearms. A [federally funded
    program](https://pausetoprotect.org/resources/#rsrc-for-customers)
    has developed model guidelines, contracts, and standard operating
    procedures for businesses interested in providing this option.
    Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs and SAMHSA are using their
    network of teams committed to preventing Veteran suicide—known as
    the Governor’s Challenge to Prevent Suicide Among Service Members,
    Veterans, and Families—to encourage states to convene federally
    licensed gun dealers around offering out-of-home storage to our
    Nation’s heroes and their families.

**Congress must act.** While the Biden-Harris Administration’s gun
violence prevention actions are saving lives, there is much more to do.
President Biden and Vice President Harris continue to call on Congress
to enact commonsense gun safety legislation—from a ban on assault
weapons and bump stocks to universal background checks to a repeal of
gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability—and to enact federal safe
storage and red flag laws and fully fund community violence intervention
programs and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
(ATF).
