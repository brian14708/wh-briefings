title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Disaster Declaration for the Confederated\
  \ Tribes and Bands of the Yakama\_Nation"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists for the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation and
ordered federal aid to supplement the Tribal Nation’s efforts in the
areas affected by wildfires from June 22 to July 8, 2024.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals for the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding also is available to the Confederated Tribes and Bands
of the Yakama Nation and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the wildfires.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama
Nation.

Ms. Tonia Pence of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
