title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Further Action to Strengthen\
  \ and Secure Critical Mineral Supply\_Chains"
---
 
*Department of Energy Battery Supply Chain Awards Build on Four Years of
Whole-of-Government Effort to Increase Domestic and Allied Supply of
Critical Minerals*

Critical minerals are essential building blocks of the modern economy
and our energy security, from clean energy technologies like
high-capacity batteries and wind turbines to semiconductors, advanced
defense systems, and consumer electronics. Over the past several
decades, China has cornered the market for processing and refining of
key critical minerals, leaving the U.S. and our allies and partners
vulnerable to supply chain shocks and undermining economic and national
security. As the world builds a clean energy economy, demand for
critical minerals is projected to grow exponentially.  
   
President Biden recognized this challenge and took immediate action. In
his first weeks in office, he signed [Executive Order
14017](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/),
America’s Supply Chains, which mandated a 100-day review of U.S.
critical mineral supply chains. Following the [report’s
recommendations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf),
the Biden-Harris Administration has mobilized historic resources to
strengthen domestic critical minerals supply chains, from mining to
manufacturing to recycling. These investments are strengthening U.S.
energy and national security; boosting American manufacturing; creating
good-paying and union jobs in mining, construction, and manufacturing;
and reducing reliance on unreliable supply chains.  
   
Since President Biden took office, companies have announced more than
[$120 billion in investments](https://invest.gov/) in battery and
critical mineral supply chains. Through the Biden-Harris
Administration’s Investing in America agenda, the Department of Energy,
the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, and the
Department of Commerce are supporting the domestic battery and critical
mineral supply chain through grants, loans, and allocated tax credits.
That investment has created new jobs: over 250,000 new American energy
jobs were
[added](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-report-shows-clean-energy-jobs-grew-more-twice-rate-overall-us-employment)
last year—with clean energy jobs growing twice as fast as the rest of
the sector.  
   
This investment has also dramatically expanded the U.S. critical
minerals industrial base and reduced reliance on foreign and unreliable
supply chains. In 2021, the U.S. had enough operating and announced
battery manufacturing capacity to power 500,000 electric vehicles—today,
announced battery gigafactories will power 10 million electric vehicles,
enough to meet domestic demand by 2030. In 2021, U.S. lithium producers
met just 5 percent of global demand. Thanks to investments in processing
and manufacturing, the US is not just keeping pace with the fivefold
increase in lithium demand but is on track to outpace it: the U.S. is
set to supply more than one-fifth of global demand outside of China by
2030.  
   
After years of ceding ground to China, we are now winning the
competition for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, protecting our industrial
base and creating good jobs, and strengthening our energy and national
security thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions to secure
critical mineral supply chains.

Today, the Department of Energy is announcing over [$3
billion](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-3-billion-support-americas-battery)
across 25 projects through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to extract,
process, and recycle critical minerals and materials and manufacture key
battery components, as well as support next-generation battery
manufacturing. Combined with the [first
round](https://www.energy.gov/mesc/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-battery-materials-processing-and-battery-manufacturing-recycling)
of battery material processing and manufacturing awards, funding from
this program will generate $16 billion in public and private sector
investment throughout the entire battery supply chain. Project details

    on imported EV and grid storage batteries from China, as well as
    certain critical minerals, to counter China’s unfair trade
    practices, which will defend U.S. manufacturers from being undercut
    by artificially cheap products.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">**Supporting Responsible
Domestic Mining** </span>

To meet the nation’s climate, infrastructure, and global competitiveness
goals, the U.S. must expand and accelerate responsible domestic
production of critical minerals in a manner that upholds strong
environmental, labor, safety, Tribal consultation, and community
engagement standards. By responsibly permitting, managing operations,
and remediating mines, the U.S. can set a global standard for
responsible mineral development and create good-paying jobs in
communities across the country:

-   The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office issued a $2.26 billion
    conditional commitment for lithium processing at the fully permitted

<span style="text-decoration: underline">**Establishing a
“Mine-to-Magnet” Supply Chain for Rare Earth Elements**</span>

Rare earth permanent magnets power everything from electric vehicle
motors and wind turbines to missile defense systems. Currently, large
portions of the supply chain, from mining to processing to magnet
manufacturing, are controlled by China. Through the Department of
Defense and the Department of Energy, the Biden-Harris Administration is
[taking
action](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/)
to secure domestic production throughout the magnet supply chain.

-   The Department of Defense has awarded $45 million to [MP
    Materials](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/)
    for rare earth oxide processing at Mountain Pass, the only operating
    U.S. rare earth element mine, and more than $288 million to [Lynas
    USA](https://www.businessdefense.gov/news/2023/DoD-Awards-Key-Contract-for-Domestic-Heavy-Rare-Earth-Separation-Capability.html)
    to establish commercial-scale rare earth oxide production.  
-   Down the supply chain, the Department of Defense has invested more
    than $94 million in [E-VAC
    Magnetics](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3529874/)
    to establish a commercial-scale magnet manufacturing facility in
    South Carolina, as well as metals and alloys. E-VAC also
