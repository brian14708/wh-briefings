I am deeply disturbed by the possible assassination attempt of former
President Trump today. As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I
condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this
incident does not lead to more violence.  
   
I am thankful that former President Trump is safe. I commend the U.S.
Secret Service and law enforcement partners for their vigilance. As
President Biden said, our Administration will ensure the Secret Service
has every resource, capability, and protective measure necessary to
carry out its critical mission.
