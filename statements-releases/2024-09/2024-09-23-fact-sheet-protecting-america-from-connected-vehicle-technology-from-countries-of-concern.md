title: "FACT SHEET: Protecting America from Connected Vehicle Technology from Countries\
  \ of\_Concern"
---
 
Chinese automakers are seeking to dominate connected vehicle
technologies in the United States and globally, posing new threats to
our national security, including through our supply chains. The
Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring that our automotive
supply chains are resilient and secure from foreign threats.  
   
Today, President Biden is announcing strong action to protect America
from the national security risks associated with connected vehicle
technologies from countries of concern. The Department of Commerce is
issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would, if finalized
as proposed, prohibit the sale or import of connected vehicles that
incorporate certain technology and the import of particular components
themselves from countries of concern, specifically the People’s Republic
of China (PRC) and Russia.  
   
The announcement is the next step in a process President Biden announced
in February, 2024. This NPRM incorporates public feedback submitted in
response to the Department’s advance notice of proposed rulemaking
(ANPRM) issued on March 1, 2024, which sought public comment on the
national security risks associated with certain technologies used in
connected vehicles.  
   
Connected vehicles provide many benefits — from promoting vehicle safety
to assisting drivers with navigation — but they also pose new and
growing threats. These technologies include computer systems that
control vehicle movement and collect sensitive driver and passenger data
as well as cameras and sensors that enable automated driving systems and
record detailed information about American infrastructure. Now more than
ever, vehicles are directly connected into our country’s digital
networks.  
   
As the Department of Commerce has found, vehicles’ increasing
connectivity creates opportunities to collect and exploit sensitive
information. Certain hardware and software in connected vehicles enable
the capture of information about geographic areas or critical
infrastructure, and present opportunities for malicious actors to
disrupt the operations of infrastructure or the vehicles themselves.
Commerce has determined that certain technologies used in connected
vehicles from the PRC and Russia present particularly acute threats.
These countries of concern could use critical technologies within our
supply chains for surveillance and sabotage to undermine national
security.  
   
The Department of Commerce’s proposed rule would prohibit the import or
sale of certain connected vehicle systems designed, developed,
manufactured, or supplied by entities with a sufficient nexus to the PRC
or Russia. Specifically, the rule covers “vehicle connectivity systems”
(VCS) — that is, systems and components connecting the vehicle to the
outside world, including via Bluetooth, cellular, satellite, and Wi-Fi
modules — and “automated driving systems” (ADS), which allow highly
autonomous vehicles to operate without a driver behind the wheel. The
rule includes restrictions on imports or sales of connected vehicles
using VCS and ADS software, as well as imports of VCS hardware
equipment. The Department of Commerce is also proposing procedures to
let certain parties, such as small producers of vehicles, receive
exemptions from the prohibitions on an exceptional basis, in order to
minimize unanticipated and unnecessary disruption to industry.  
   
The prohibitions on software would take effect for Model Year 2027, and
the prohibitions on hardware would take effect for Model Year 2030, or
January 1, 2029 for units without a model year. These restrictions will
help address national security risks posed by connected vehicle
technologies from countries of concern.  
   
As the Department of Commerce develops the final rule, the
Administration encourages interested stakeholders to share input with
the Department so that their views can be taken into consideration. The
Department will continue to consult closely with industry, U.S. allies
and partners, and other stakeholders throughout the regulatory process
to ensure any actions maximally protect U.S. national security, while
minimizing unintended consequences or disruptions.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on comprehensively addressing
the threats caused by foreign automobiles and supply chains. In May of
this year, President Biden directed an increase from 25% to 100% on the
tariff rate on Chinese electric vehicles under Section 301. The
Inflation Reduction Act tied eligibility for the $7,500 EV tax credit to
final assembly in North America and sourcing key battery minerals and
components from the United States or trade partners. These prior actions
underscore the Administration’s commitment to ensuring that the American
auto industry is leading in quality and innovation, and that U.S.
automakers have the opportunity to compete on a level playing field as
they develop the next generation of automobiles.
