title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable with African Immigrant Media\_Outlets"
---
 
Today, on the last day of National African Immigrant Heritage Month,
celebrated in the community throughout the month of September for the
past 16 years, the White House hosted a virtual roundtable discussion to
hear directly from members of targeted media organizations servicing
diasporans from all 54 countries of the African continent across 30
American states. 

Connected to the White House through the Cameroon American Council’s
African Immigrant Media Network, participants interfaced with
representatives of both the White House’s Press and Communications teams
to learn best practices on how to keep their audiences informed about
the Biden-Harris Administration. 

With one in five Black Americans who are either immigrants or children
of Black immigrants, participants discussed the ways in which their
experiences and challenges both mirror and uniquely diverge from the
broader story of Black in America, and detailed their ongoing advocacy
work to expand African language access and immigration relief programs
such as Special Humanitarian Parole for Cameroon and Temporary Protected
Status for various African countries. 

African Immigrant media leaders engaged in this roundtable also heard
about how the pipeline gets built for the diverse workforce that makes
up the Biden-Harris Administration, how the Press and Communications
teams work daily to package President Biden and Vice President Harris’
agenda, and the importance of representation in stakeholder outreach and
policy messaging. Additionally, representatives from the Biden Harris
Administration discussed the logistics that went into executing the
Kenyan State Visit and media coverage needs for President Biden’s
upcoming trip to Angola.
