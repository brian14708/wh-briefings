President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Keir
Starmer of the United Kingdom at the White House. The leaders had an
in-depth discussion on a range of foreign policy issues of mutual
interest.  They reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine as it
continues to defend against Russia’s aggression.  They expressed deep
concern about Iran and North Korea’s provision of lethal weapons to
Russia and the People’s Republic of China’s support to Russia’s defense
industrial base. They reiterated their ironclad commitment to Israel’s
security, the urgent need for a ceasefire deal that will free the
hostages and enable increased relief in Gaza, and the need for Israel to
do more to protect civilians and address the dire humanitarian situation
in Gaza. They also condemned Iran-backed Houthi attacks on commercial
shipping in the Red Sea. They discussed U.S.-UK cooperation on clean
energy and advanced technologies, on AUKUS, as well as opportunities to
deepen our strong U.S.-UK economic ties. President Biden underscored his
support for the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and its role in
maintaining peace and stability in Northern Ireland.
