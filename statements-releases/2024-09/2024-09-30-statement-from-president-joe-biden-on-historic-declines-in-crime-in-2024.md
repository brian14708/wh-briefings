title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Historic Declines in Crime in\_2024"
---
 
This year, the homicide and violent crime rates have continued their
rapid decline from their peaks during the last administration. According
to new preliminary data submitted to the FBI, in the first half of this
year, the homicide rate continued to fall at record speed, declining by
22.7%, while the violent crime rate fell by 10.3% to its lowest level
since 1969. These record decreases follow the historic declines in crime
in 2023, including the largest-ever decrease in the homicide rate.
Communities across our country are safer now than when I took office.

Under the previous administration, we saw the biggest increase in murder
rates on record. Vice President Harris and I moved swiftly to turn it
around. We passed the American Rescue Plan – despite every Republican in
Congress voting against it – which has helped deliver over $15 billion
in public safety funding that enabled over 1,000 state, city, and county
governments to avoid cuts to police budgets, invest in community
violence interventions, and keep communities safe. And we have taken
more action to get illegal guns off of our streets and out of dangerous
hands than any Administration, including by signing into law the most
significant gun violence prevention legislation in nearly 30 years which
has expanded background checks and cracked down on gun traffickers. Last
year, I established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris, to accelerate this work.

Even among these historic declines, we can and must do more. That’s why,
just this past week, Vice President Harris and I announced additional
actions to combat machinegun conversion devices, improve school-based
active shooter drills, and take other steps to reduce gun crime and save
lives. I’ll continue to urge Congress pass my plan to fund 100,000
additional police officers, invest in community violence intervention
programs, and make commonsense gun safety reforms, including banning
assault weapons.
