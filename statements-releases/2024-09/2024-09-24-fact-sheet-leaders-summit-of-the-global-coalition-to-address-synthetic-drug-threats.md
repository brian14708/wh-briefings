title: "FACT SHEET: Leaders\u2019 Summit of the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic\
  \ Drug\_Threats"
---
 
Today, President Biden hosted a Summit of the [Global Coalition to
Address Synthetic Drug Threats](https://www.globalcoalition.us/), which
the President directed Secretary of State Antony Blinken to launch in
June 2023, in order to mobilize international action to tackle the
synthetic drug crisis.  In just over a year, the Global Coalition has
grown to include 159 countries and 15 international organizations
working together to *disrupt* the supply chain for fentanyl and other
synthetic drugs; *detect* emerging drug threats; and *prevent and treat*
through effective public health interventions.  
   
With the Summit as a motivating force, 11 core Coalition countries
announced new initiatives that will advance the work of the Coalition,
including efforts to disrupt the supply chain of fentanyl and enhance
public health interventions.  These international commitments complement
intensive work being done domestically, including an increased focus on
coordinated disruption of drug trafficking networks and concerted
efforts to make the opioid overdose reversal medication, naloxone,
widely available over-the-counter.  
   
As a result of these efforts**, we are starting to see the largest drop
in overdose deaths in recorded history**.  When President Biden and Vice
President Harris came into office, the number of drug overdose deaths
was increasing by more than 30% year over year.  Now, the latest
provisional data released from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics show an
[unprecedented decline in overdose deaths of
10%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm) in the
12 months ending April 2024.   
   
These aren’t just numbers – these are lives.  
   
Background on the Global Coalition  
   
The **159 countries and 15 international organizations** that are now
part of the Coalition are working together on three key lines of
effort:  

1.  *Disrupt* the supply chain for fentanyl and other synthetic drugs;  
2.  *Detect* emerging drug threats; and  
3.  *Prevent and treat* through effective public health interventions. 

For the past year, three working groups and seven sub-working groups
have met monthly to create detailed plans of action.  These [working
groups have made tangible
progress,](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-67th-session-of-the-un-commission-on-narcotic-drugs-side-event/)
including implementing new efforts to increase seizures of synthetic
drugs and precursor chemicals at ports of entry, sharing best practices
with respect to the identification of emerging drug threats, and taking
actions to schedule an increasing number of synthetic drugs and
precursor chemicals, thus subjecting these drugs and chemicals to
increased controls.   
  
New Initiatives Being Announced  
  
At today’s Summit, 11 core countries announced new initiatives that will
move the work of each of the Coalition’s core lines of effort even
further:

1.  **Australia, Belgium, the Dominican Republic, India, Mexico, the
    Netherlands, and the United Kingdom** will lead new efforts to
    disrupt the supply of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.  These
    efforts include the development of regional coalitions to disrupt
    the transit routes for illicit drugs, precursor chemicals, and
    associated equipment, protect against the diversion of chemicals for
    illicit use, and improve the detection and disruption of production
    sites.  
2.  **Italy and Ghana** will lead new initiatives to detect emerging
    drug trends, to include Italy helping other Coalition countries to
    develop early warning systems to identify emerging drug patterns.  
3.  **Canada and the United Arab Emirates** will work to prevent and
    treat the overdose epidemic, including by expanding public health
    interventions and making life-saving medications widely available.

Core Coalition countries also signed a **Coalition Pledge** agreeing to
take additional actions to regulate all relevant drugs and precursor
chemicals, take needed steps to fill gaps in their own domestic
authorities, expand public-private partnerships to more effectively
combat the supply chain for illicit fentanyl, develop mechanisms to
monitor real-time data on trends in illicit drug use, and expand access
to treatment.  At the Summit, President Biden called on all other
Coalition countries to likewise sign this pledge.  
  
Domestic Actions to Fight Fentanyl and Other Synthetic Opioids  
  
Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has made disrupting the
supply of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs a core priority. 
As part of their [Unity
Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/08/fact-sheet-president-bidens-unity-agenda-for-the-nation/)
for the Nation, President Biden and Vice President Harris have made it a
priority to invest in public health and to tackle both the supply and
demand for drugs.  And those efforts have paid off:

1.  [Border officials have stopped more illicit
    fentanyl](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-drugs-dosage-value-and-weight)
    at ports of entry in the past two fiscal years than in the previous
    five fiscal years combined.  In the past 11 months, over 974 million
    potentially lethal doses of fentanyl were seized at U.S. ports of
    entry.  
2.  The Biden-Harris Administration deployed cutting-edge drug detection
    technology across our southwest border, adding dozens of new
    inspection systems, with dozens more coming online in the next few
    years.  
3.  The Biden-Harris Administration has made
    [naloxone](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2023/12/21/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-action-to-increase-naloxone-access-in-federal-facilities-across-the-nation/),
    a life-saving opioid overdose reversal medication, widely available
    over the counter, and has invested over $82 billion in treatment –
    40 percent more than the previous Administration.  
4.  In 2021, President Biden issued an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/15/executive-order-on-imposing-sanctions-on-foreign-persons-involved-in-the-global-illicit-drug-trade/)
    targeting foreign persons engaged in the global illicit drug trade,
    and the Administration has since sanctioned over 300 persons and
    entities under this authority, thereby cutting them off from the
    United States’ financial system.  
5.  The Biden-Harris Administration has prosecuted dozens of high-level
    Mexican cartel leaders, drug traffickers, and money launderers,
    including Chapitos leader [Nestor Isidro “El Nini” Perez
    Salas](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/25/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-joint-u-s-mexican-cooperation-to-extradite-to-the-united-states-major-fentanyl-criminal/),
    and [Cartel de Jalisco Nueva
    Generación](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2478)’s
    top chemical brokers—placing dangerous drug traffickers behind
    bars.  Just last week, the son of a fugitive Cartel de Jalisco Nueva
    Generación boss, [Ruben “El Menchito”
    Oseguera](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/notorious-mexican-cartel-leader-convicted-international-drug-trafficking-and-firearms),
    was convicted for his violent acts, including the deadly downing of
    a military helicopter in Mexico, in support of his father’s drug
    trafficking organization.

   
In July, President Biden issued a new [National Security
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/07/31/memorandum-on-prioritizing-the-strategic-disruption-of-the-supply-chain-for-illicit-fentanyl-and-synthetic-opioids-through-a-coordinated-whole-of-government-information-driven-effort/)
(NSM) calling on all relevant Federal departments and agencies to do
even more to stop the supply of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic
opioids in our country.  The NSM directs increased intelligence
collection, more intensive coordination and cooperation across
departments and agencies, and additional actions to disrupt the
production and distribution of illicit fentanyl.  And the Biden-Harris
Administration has called on Congress to pass the Administration’s
“[Detect and
Defeat](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/31/fact-sheet-biden-%e2%81%a0harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-counter-the-scourge-of-fentanyl-and-other-synthetic-drugs/)”
counter-fentanyl legislative proposal to increase penalties on those who
bring deadly drugs into our communities and to close loopholes that drug
traffickers exploit.  
   
As stated above, these measures are having an effect.  
   
**Provisional CDC data show a 10% drop in overdose deaths in the 12
months leading up to April 2024 – the largest drop in overdose deaths in
recorded history.**  
   
Other International Engagements  
   
Under the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, the
United States has engaged around the world – both as part of the
Coalition and in numerous bilateral and multilateral engagements – to
spur global action in the fight against synthetic opioids.  
   
In early 2023, President Biden, together with the President of Mexico
and the Prime Minister of Canada, directed the establishment a
[Trilateral Fentanyl
Committee](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/08/joint-statement-from-mexico-canada-and-the-united-states-reaffirming-our-shared-commitment-to-address-the-regional-challenge-of-synthetic-drugs-and-firearms-trafficking/),
and the Biden-Harris Administration engages regularly with both
countries to tackle the supply chain for fentanyl.  
   
In November 2023, President Biden negotiated the [resumption of
counternarcotics cooperation with the People’s Republic of China
(PRC)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-progress-on-fight-against-global-illicit-drug-trafficking/),
spurring the creation of a [U.S. – PRC Counternarcotics Working
Group](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/01/readout-of-the-u-s-prc-bilateral-counternarcotics-working-group-senior-official-meeting/)
that has led to [increased cooperation on law enforcement
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/18/statement-from-homeland-security-advisor-dr-liz-sherwood-randall-on-new-actions-to-combat-global-illicit-drug-manufacturing-and-trafficking/)
and ongoing efforts to shut down companies that fuel illicit fentanyl
and synthetic drug trafficking and cause deaths in the United States.
   
   
The United States and India have worked together to increase
counternarcotics cooperation, including by signing a [new Memorandum of
Understanding and
Framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/21/joint-fact-sheet-the-united-states-and-india-continue-to-expand-comprehensive-and-global-strategic-partnership/)
for ongoing work to disrupt the supply of fentanyl and other synthetic
drugs just this past week.   
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has worked extensively with law
enforcement partners across the globe to hold drug traffickers to
account.  These partnerships pay dividends – including by generating
support for extraditions that have enabled the United States to put
dozens of cartel leaders, drug traffickers, and money launderers behind
bars.
