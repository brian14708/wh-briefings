title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Report Showing Nearly 50 Million People\
  \ Have Had Health Insurance through Affordable Care Act\_Marketplace"
---
 
Today, a new report shows that nearly 50 million people have had
coverage in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace over the past
decade. That’s 1 in 7 Americans who have benefited from the peace of
mind that comes with knowing if an illness strikes or an accident
occurs, they can get the care they need. It’s a really big deal – and
yet Republicans in Congress remain committed to taking us backward by
repealing the Affordable Care Act.

The Affordable Care Act is more popular than ever, and Affordable Care
Act coverage is more affordable than ever. That’s because Vice President
Harris and I have worked tirelessly to protect and build on the ACA. We
lowered costs for ACA coverage by an average of $800 per year for
millions of Americans, invested in outreach and in-person assistance to
help people get the coverage that is right for them, and eliminated red
tape. As a result, more Americans have signed up for health care
coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace than ever before.

We are not stopping now. The Vice President and I will keep fighting to
make health care more affordable for all Americans, and we will always
stand up to attempts by Republicans in Congress to roll back access to
health care. Congressional Republicans have voted more than 50 times
to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would take health care away
from tens of millions of Americans, threaten coverage for more than 100
million with pre-existing conditions, increase health care and
prescription costs for families, and so much more. We know Republican
officials will stop at nothing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,
ripping health coverage away from Americans in every part of our
country. While they try to take us backward, we’ll keep fighting for the
future.
