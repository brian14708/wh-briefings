title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on Record Declines in\_Crime"
---
 
Every American in every community should have the freedom to live safe
from violence, harm, and fear. Yet before President Biden and I took
office, too many families were experiencing crime as our nation
witnessed the highest increase in murders in recent history. That is why
we immediately got to work to get our counties, cities, and local police
departments the resources they need.  
   
As a former District Attorney who prosecuted homicide cases, I was proud
to walk into the U.S. Senate and cast the tie-breaking vote on the
largest ever federal investment in fighting and preventing crime. Our
American Rescue Plan – that every single Republican in Congress voted
against – helped deliver over $15 billion to cities and states to fund
public safety and violence prevention strategies, hiring and keeping
police officers on the beat while investing in community violence
intervention and taking other critical steps to keep our families safe.
As someone who got illegal firearms off the streets as Attorney General
of California, I also worked alongside President Biden to enact the most
significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years – expanding
background checks, investing in mental health supports in our schools,
and helping states implement red flag laws.   
   
Today’s new data submitted to the FBI confirms that our dedicated
efforts and collaborative partnerships with law enforcement are working;
Americans are safer now than when we took office. Last year, we saw the
largest ever one-year decrease in the homicide rate, which now stands 16
percent below its 2020 level. Violent crime is at a near 50-year low.
Our progress is continuing this year and builds on substantial decreases
during the previous years of our administration.  
   
While we have made great progress, we are not stopping now. I am
committed to continuing our work to support local law enforcement,
invest in proven crime prevention and community violence intervention,
and address gun violence with commonsense gun safety laws. As a former
courtroom prosecutor who took on perpetrators of all kinds, I will
always work with anyone, anywhere, anytime to keep our children,
families, and communities safe.
