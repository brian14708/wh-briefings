title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Anniversary of September\_11"
---
 
Today, our nation comes together to renew our sacred vow: Never
Forget.  
  
Never forget each of the 2,977 precious lives stolen from us when
terrorists attacked our nation. Never forget their families who still
bear the grief from that searing September morning. Never forget the
heroic citizens and survivors who rushed to help their fellow Americans.
And never forget that when faced with evil—and an enemy that sought to
tear us apart—we endured.  
  
In the crucible of September 11 and the days that followed, we showed
what Americans are made of. Firefighters and police officers running
into the inferno of jet fuel and debris at Ground Zero. Civilians and
service members at the Pentagon rushing into the fiery breach to rescue
their colleagues. The heroes of Flight 93, who confronted terror with
absolute courage and undoubtedly saved more American lives. Neighbors
who showed up for neighbors to grieve and to rebuild. And hundreds of
thousands of women and men whose hands went up—ready to serve our
country.  
  
On this day 23 years ago, terrorists believed they could break our will
and bring us to our knees. They were wrong. They will always be wrong.
In the darkest of hours, we found light. And in the face of fear, we
came together—to defend our country, and to help one another. That is
why terrorists targeted us in the first place: our freedom, our
democracy, our unity.  
  
They failed. But we must remain vigilant. Today, our longest war is
finally over. But our commitment to preventing another attack on our
people never will be. We will continue to disrupt terrorist networks
wherever we find them. And we will continue to deliver justice to
terrorists who plot against America—just as we did with Osama bin Laden
in 2011 and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 2022.  
  
And above all, we will continue to remember: we are the United States of
America. We endure. We overcome. And there is nothing beyond our
capacity when we do it together. May God bless our fallen and their
families. May God protect our troops and first responders. And may God
bless the United States of America.
