title: "FACT SHEET: UPDATE: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Continued Response\
  \ Efforts to Hurricane\_Helene"
---
 
Under President Biden and Vice President Harris’s leadership, the
Administration is continuing to provide robust and well-coordinated
Federal support for the ongoing response and recovery efforts to
Hurricane Helene’s impacts. The President and Vice President are closely
monitoring these efforts and receive regular updates from their teams.  
   
At the President’s direction, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell visited
Florida over the weekend to assess damage alongside local and state
officials. She continued surveying damage today in parts of Georgia
before she moves into North Carolina on Monday.  
  
Earlier this evening, Administrator Criswell and Homeland Security
Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall briefed President Biden on the ongoing
impacts of Hurricane Helene in multiple states, including Florida,
Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, and
Virginia. Administrator Criswell also updated the President on Federal
actions to support response and recovery.    
  
The President directed Administrator Criswell to determine what more can
be done to accelerate support to those who are having the most difficult
time accessing assistance in isolated communities. He also advised the
FEMA Administrator that as soon as it will not disrupt emergency
response operations, he intends to travel this week to impacted
communities.  
  
Additionally, the Federal government is closely monitoring an additional
weather disturbance in the Caribbean Sea that has the potential to form
into another storm in the coming week. Residents throughout the Gulf
Coast should remain alert, listen to local officials, and make
additional preparations as needed.  
   
Additional Federal response actions include:  
   
**Approving Major Disaster Declarations**  
   
Yesterday, President Biden approved Major Disaster declarations for the
states of Florida and North Carolina, allowing survivors to immediately
access funds and resources to jumpstart their recovery. People in 17
counties in Florida and 25 counties in North Carolina, including the
Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, can now apply for assistance with
FEMA. People can apply in three ways: online by visiting
disasterassistance.gov, calling 1-800-621-3362 or on the FEMA App.  
   
FEMA assistance in Florida and North Carolina may include upfront funds
to help with essential items like food, water, baby formula, and other
emergency supplies. Funds may also be available to repair storm-related
damage to homes and personal property, as well as assistance to find a
temporary place to stay.  
   
Emergency declarations were also approved for Florida, North Carolina
Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama. Under an
emergency declaration, FEMA provides direct Federal support to states
for life saving activities and other emergency protective measures, such
as evacuation, sheltering, and search and rescue.  
   
**Supporting On-The-Ground Response Efforts**  
   
As of today, more than 3,300 personnel from across the Federal workforce
are deployed and supporting Hurricane Helene response efforts across the
impacted states. This includes the most experienced incident management
teams to help identity Federal resources to address unmet needs, as well
as Urban Search and Rescue personnel using high water rescue equipment
for rescue missions across the region.   
   
At least 50,000 personnel from 31 states and the District of Columbia
and Canada are responding to power outages and working around the clock
throughout parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina
to restore power to those communities that can receive power. The U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers is moving generators and additional power
generation assets into the hardest hit areas of South and North Carolina
as flood waters recede and debris removal allows. As of this afternoon,
approximately 2.3 million customers are without power, down from the
region-wide peak of 4.6 million on September 27.  
   
**Additional Interagency Support Efforts**  
   
Together with state and local partners, the Federal government is
actively supporting Hurricane Helene response efforts and is
coordinating requests for Federal assistance.

-   FEMA distribution centers are fully stocked and ready to provide
    commodities and equipment to any impacted state, as required.  
-   FEMA is trucking dozens of trailers containing food and water in
    North Carolina to support the State as they start to set up
    care-sites for survivors.  
-   FEMA is also working with the Federal Communications Commission and
    private sector telecommunications partners to deploy emergency
    mobile communications assets while they work to restore network
    services, particularly in remote areas.  
-   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a Public
    Health Emergency for Florida and Georgia, giving health care
    providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency
    health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. About 200
    medical responders are in Florida, Alabama, and North Carolina,
    along with medical equipment and supplies, to help ensure the
    delivery of health care services following the landfall of Hurricane
    Helene.  
-   Twenty-four federal Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces are deployed
    across the affected regions. Roughly 1,302 Urban Search and Rescue
    personnel are assisting in the impacted areas. Together with local
    and state responders, teams have rescued and supported over 1,400 of
    people across the impacted area.  
-   The U.S. Coast Guard has thousands of personnel working on response
    efforts and are conducting post-storm assessments to support the
    rapid reopening of impacted ports.  
-   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deployed teams for temporary
    emergency power, debris removal, and infrastructure assessment,
    including for dams throughout the region.  
-   The Environmental Protection Agency has personnel on the ground who
    are offering technical assistance and guidance on water systems,
    debris management, and maintaining critical public health and
    environmental protections in place as storm impacts are assessed.  
-   The U.S. Small Business Administration deployed more than 50
    personnel to support survivors and small businesses as they recover
    from the hurricane.  
-   The U.S. Department of Energy has responders deployed across the
    region and are closely monitoring power, fuel, and supply chain
    interruptions.  
-   The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency has
    deployed personnel to the impacted region to extend much-needed
    emergency credit to farmers and agriculture producers who lost crops
    and livestock.
