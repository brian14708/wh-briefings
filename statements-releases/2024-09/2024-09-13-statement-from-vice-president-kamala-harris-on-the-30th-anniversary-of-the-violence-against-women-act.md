title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the 30th Anniversary of the\
  \ Violence Against Women\_Act"
---
 
Thirty years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act was signed,
becoming the first comprehensive federal law to focus on preventing and
addressing violence against women and to provide justice and support for
survivors. Written and championed by President Biden when he served in
the Senate, this landmark legislation has transformed the way government
upholds its duty to protect the women and girls of our nation. We would
not be where we are today without his work and the tireless efforts of
advocates, allies, and the brave survivors who have shared their stories
and determination to ensure others do not have to experience what they
did or face it alone.  
   
As someone who has spent my entire career fighting for the health,
safety, and wellbeing of women and girls, I have seen the impact of the
Violence Against Women Act up close. As a courtroom prosecutor, I
specialized in crimes against women and children. As District Attorney
of San Francisco, I made it a priority to prosecute more sexual assault
and domestic violence cases and secure higher conviction rates. My
office also provided survivors with access to mental health counseling
and job training to help get them back on their feet and regain control
over their own lives.  
   
As Attorney General of California, I led efforts to provide resources
and support for victims of crimes while overseeing the second largest
Department of Justice in our Nation. I also tackled a long-standing
backlog of untested rape kits – a backlog that was an obstacle to
justice for survivors and ensuring that perpetrators could not continue
to victimize their communities. Additionally, I prosecuted the first
case in the country against an operator of a cyber exploitation website.
Then, as a United States Senator, I led legislation to make these acts a
federal crime and also supported a wide range of legislation that
expanded protections for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault,
stalking, dating violence, and trafficking.  
   
President Biden and I have continued to prioritize this urgent work in
the White House. We fought to successfully reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act, strengthening the law to expand protections for
LGBTQI+ survivors, survivors living on Tribal lands and in Alaska Native
villages, and women and girls across our nation. I also joined the
President in launching a federal task force to tackle online harassment
and image-based abuse. And as the person overseeing the first-ever White
House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, I am proud to say that we
finally addressed the boyfriend loophole to keep guns out of the hands
of domestic abusers.  
   
As we reflect on the lifechanging progress we have made over the last 30
years, we recommit to the critical work ahead. Together, alongside
survivors, advocates, and allies, President Biden and I will continue to
do everything in our power to ensure that every woman throughout America
has the freedom to live safe from violence and hate.
