title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of James Earl\_Jones"
---
 
One of the last times I was with James Earl Jones was at Ford’s Theatre
ten years ago in Washington.

He was being honored with the Lincoln Medal for his exemplary character
and accomplishments on film and stage. I admired him for something else
as well, something we both had in common—overcoming a childhood stutter
to find our voice for something bigger than ourselves.

His legendary voice boomed wherever it was heard, an instrument and
imprint that reverberated in the hearts of audiences worldwide.

And we’ve all heard it.

Through iconic characters, film, stage, commercials, radio, and more,
his voice carried a sense of grace and dignity that commanded respect
and demanded to be heard. His roles made us stop, stayed with us, and
inspired us to reflect on everything from race and power, good and evil,
to our place in the world.

For his remarkable talent, James has received numerous honors, including
two Emmy awards, a Grammy award, an honorary Oscar, and two Tony
awards—making him one of few Americans to earn an EGOT.

He was a proud Army veteran, and I will always remember him as someone
who served this country, influenced generations, and became one of the
greatest actors of our time.

Jill and I send our love and condolences to his son Flynn, his brother
Matthew, and everyone he inspired and who he will continue to inspire as
his voice echoes for the ages.

May God bless James Earl Jones.
