Today, leaders from the National Security Council and the White House
Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy convened a
roundtable with Federal agencies, global and domestic public health
partners, advocacy organizations, and community leaders to discuss the
escalating “clade I” mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) and multiple other countries that have never before had mpox
cases.  
   
The global mpox response and domestic preparedness efforts are top
priorities for the Biden-Harris Administration. Principal Deputy
National Security Advisor Jon Finer and Homeland Security Advisor Dr.
Liz Sherwood-Randall provided remarks during the event. Representatives
from the Department of Health and Human Services, the State Department,
U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Treasury Department
also joined the convening.   
   
“By building on the lessons learned from the mpox outbreak response in
2022, the U.S. will continue to lead the way, globally and domestically,
to be more prepared to respond to any biological threat,” said Dr. Liz
Sherwood-Randall. “We must also continue to partner with trusted
community organizations, academic researchers, and civil society actors
across the international community to promote the dissemination of
information, support the early detection of cases, and ensure the rapid
deployment of countermeasures. Doing so will keep Americans safer and
more secure here at home.”  
   
“Our actions today and in the coming weeks have the potential to change
the course of the global clade I mpox response at home and abroad” said
Jon Finer. “It is more critical than ever for the United States to be a
global leader in preventing and responding to health emergencies. When
the United States invests in building stronger partnerships around the
world, and when we support stronger, more effective multilateral and
regional institutions, not only are Americans safer, but the world is
safer.”  
   
The convening affirmed the United States leadership role in the global
mpox response and identified efforts to bolster domestic preparedness
and improve U.S. readiness for a clade I mpox case. While there are no
known clade I cases in the United States at this time, federal and state
leaders are working to ensure that the U.S. can rapidly detect, contain,
and manage clade I cases should they occur. Clade IIb mpox, which caused
the 2022 global outbreak, continues to circulate at low levels in the
United States and in many countries around the world.
