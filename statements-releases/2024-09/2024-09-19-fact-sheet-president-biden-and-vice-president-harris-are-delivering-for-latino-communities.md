title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden and Vice President Harris Are Delivering for\
  \ Latino\_Communities"
---
 
Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to ensure
every community—including Latino communities—can access a quality
education, obtain a good-paying job, own a home, start a business, and
afford high-quality health care. This National Hispanic Heritage Month,
President Biden and Vice President Harris celebrate and honor the rich
contributions of Latinos and remain committed to ensuring every family
has a shot at the American Dream.

**Growing Economic Prosperity for Latino Communities**  
**  
**The Biden-Harris Administration’s [Investing in America
agenda](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/) has created five million
jobs for Latino workers—achieving a historically low Latino unemployment
rate, reported at 5.5% through August 2024, down from 8.6% when the
President and Vice President took office. The Biden-Harris
Administration has delivered record economic results for Latinos,
including:

-   Hispanic business ownership is up 40%–growing at the fastest rate in
    30 years.
-   [Doubled the number of Small Business Administration-backed
    loans](https://www.sba.gov/article/2024/08/14/small-dollar-lending-lending-underserved-entrepreneurs-continues-rise-record-19-million-new-business)
    to Latino-owned businesses in FY 2023 compared to FY 2020.
-   Cut mortgage interest premiums for Federal Housing Administration
    loans, saving over 185,000 Latino homeowners more than $1,000 per
    year.
-   Achieved the largest increase in homeownership rates for Hispanic
    homeowners versus the previous year and took historic action to root
    out home appraisal bias, which contributes to the wealth gap by
    unfairly undervaluing homes owned by Latinos and in majority-Latino
    neighborhoods
-   Awarded nearly $11 billion in Federal contracts to Latino-owned
    small businesses in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, an increase of nearly $1
    billion since FY 2020.
-   Increased funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant
    program—the major Federal child care grant program—by almost 50% to
    serve half a million more children, and issued a rule to cap
    out-of-pocket child care costs in that program at 7% of income,
    [saving about 100,000 low-income families over $200 a month on
    average](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/02/29/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-rule-reduce-costs-more-than-100000-families-receiving-child-care-subsidies.html).
-   [Expanded the Child Tax Credit (CTC) under the American Rescue
    Plan](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-american-families-and-workers/child-tax-credit#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20the%20Child%20Tax%20Credit,qualifying%20children%20under%20age%2018.),
    which helped cut Latino child poverty nearly in half to a record low
    of 8.4% in 2021—lifting 1.2 million Latino children out of poverty
    that year and bringing the gap between Latino and white child
    poverty rates to a historic low.  President Biden and Vice President
    Harris continue to call on Congress to restore the full expanded CTC
    expanded benefit so that millions of children can be lifted out of
    poverty. The Biden-Harris Administration also modernized SNAP
    benefits for the first time since 1975, lifting about 700,000 Latino
    families, including 360,000 Latino children, out of poverty each
    month.
-   Took action to establish the [first-ever Federal heat safety
    standard in workplaces combatting extreme
    weather](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-workers-and-communities-from-extreme-weather/#:~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Labor's%20Occupational,excessive%20heat%20in%20the%20workplace.)
    to protect 36 million farmworkers, construction workers,
    manufacturing workers, and others.
-   Invested more than $140 billion to drive an economic turnaround in
    Puerto Rico—creating more than 100,000 jobs and lowering the
    unemployment rate to 5.8%, near its lowest level ever. The American
    Rescue Plan also permanently made Puerto Rican families eligible for
    the same Child Tax Credit as other Americans, making nearly 90% of
    Puerto Rican families newly eligible for the credit.

**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity for Latino Students**

President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that every student in
this country deserves access to a high-quality education and a fair shot
at the American Dream. This Administration has taken action to expand
educational opportunities and improve college affordability for all
students, including:

-   Invested a record over $15 billion in [Hispanic-Serving Institutions
    (HSIs)](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/09/06/a-proclamation-on-national-hispanic-serving-institutions-week-2024/)—
    the largest investment in U.S. history.
-   [Signed an Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/07/17/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-through-hispanic-serving-institutions/)
    establishing a President’s Advisory Board and White House Initiative
    on HSIs to coordinate Federal resources and bolster collaboration
    between institutions.
-   Secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant award—the largest
    increase in the past decade, helping the over 50% of Latino college
    students who rely on Pell Grants.
-   Approved the cancellation of almost $170 billion in student loan
    debt for nearly 5 million borrowers—including for Latino borrowers,
    who are disproportionately burdened by student debt.
-   [Proposed a rule to expand TRIO college access programs to
    Dreamers](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-releases-proposed-regulations-increase-college-access-and-quality-and-strengthen-oversight-distance-education)
    and others, which would allow an estimated 50,000 more students each
    year to access Federal college preparation services and programs,
    such as counseling and tutoring, and thousands more to attend
    college.
-   Announced nearly $15 million in new grants under the [Augustus F.
    Hawkins Centers of Excellence
    Program](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/afhce/index.html) (Hawkins) to
    advance teacher diversity and prepare the next generation of
    educators at Minority Serving Institutions, Historically Black
    Colleges and Universities and Tribal Colleges Universities—who can
    provide culturally and linguistically responsive teaching in our
    country’s underserved schools. This new round of grants—[which
    includes awards to 15
    HSIs](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/afhce/awards.html)—brings the
    total investment in Hawkins to $38 million under the Biden-Harris
    Administration, which is the first Administration to secure funding
    for the program.

**Improving Health Outcomes for Latino Communities**  
  
From beating Big Pharma and lowering prescription drug costs to
expanding health care coverage, President Biden and Vice President
Harris have taken action to make high-quality health care more
affordable.

-   Starting in 2025, all out-of-pocket drug costs will be capped at
    $2,000 per year and the cost of insulin is now capped at $35 for
    Medicare Part D enrollees, which includes five million Latinos.
-   In August 2024, the President and Vice President [announced new,
    negotiated
    prices](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-lower-prices-for-first-ten-drugs-selected-for-medicare-price-negotiation-to-lower-costs-for-millions-of-americans/)
    for the first ten prescription drugs selected for Medicare price
    negotiation—expected to save Medicare enrollees $1.5 billion in
    out-of-pocket costs in the first year of the program alone.
-   Latino enrollment in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace
    coverage has doubled under the Biden-Harris Administration, which
    also [extended ACA healthcare benefits to
    Dreamers](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/07/what-they-are-saying-advocates-leaders-applaud-administrations-new-action-to-expand-affordable-quality-health-care-coverage-to-daca-recipients/)
    starting on November 1, 2024.
-   Launched a new grant program to train doctors and physician
    assistants on [providing culturally and linguistically appropriate
    care for individuals with limited English
    proficiency](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/08/breaking-language-barriers-hhs-issues-division-specific-language-access-plans-from-across-department.html#:~:text=That's%20why%20we%20recently%20launched,Service%20Corps%20Loan%20Repayment%20Program),
    including those who speak Spanish, to improve health outcomes and
    reduce health disparities.
-   Added Spanish text and chat services to the National 988 Suicide &
    Crisis Lifeline so that individuals can now connect directly to
    Spanish-speaking crisis counselors.

**Reducing Gun Violence and Saving Lives**

President Biden and Vice President Harris have taken historic action to
reduce gun violence and keep our communities safe:

-   After the heroic advocacy of families from Buffalo and Uvalde and so
    many other communities across the country, President Biden signed
    the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law—the most significant
    gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years.
-   Established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
    Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris, which has accelerated
    work to reduce gun violence and engaged with Latino
    communities—including survivors of mass shootings in Uvalde and El
    Paso and survivors of community violence disproportionately
    affecting Black and Latino communities.
-   Secured $400 million for the first-ever federal grant program solely
    dedicated to community violence interventions.

**Addressing America’s Broken Immigration System**

On Day One, President Biden introduced a comprehensive immigration
reform bill and has repeatedly called on Congressional Republicans to
pass the SENATE bipartisan border security bill – the toughest and
fairest set of border reforms in decades. Throughout this
Administration, the President and Vice President have taken action to
improve our country’s immigration system.

-   [Took
    action](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/18/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-keep-families-together/)
    to speed up work visas, to help people who graduated from U.S.
    colleges and universities—including Dreamers—land jobs in
    high-demand high-skilled professions.
-   [Took
    action](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/06/17/fact-sheet-dhs-announces-new-process-promote-unity-and-stability-families)
    that would allow 500,000 spouses of American citizens who have been
    in the country for 10 years or more to apply for lawful permanent
    residence while staying in the United States. The Biden-Harris
    Administration is fighting efforts by Republican officials to block
    this work in court, so that families—including Latino families—can
    stay together.
-   Directed the Department of Homeland Security to [take all
    appropriate
    actions](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/08/24/dhs-issues-regulation-preserve-and-fortify-daca)
    to “preserve and fortify” Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
    (DACA), and continue to defend the DACA rule in court.
-   Streamlined, expanded, and instituted new reunification programs so
    that families can stay together while they complete the immigration
    process.
-   Took executive action to secure the border when Congressional
    Republicans twice blocked the Senate bipartisan border security
    deal.

**  
Advancing an Unprecedented Whole-of-Government Equity Agenda to Expand
Opportunity**

President Biden and Vice President Harris promised to leverage the power
of the Federal Government to deliver for all communities and build an
Administration that looks like America.

-   Assembled the most diverse administration in U.S. history, including
    four Latino Cabinet members—Department of Homeland Security
    Secretary Mayorkas, Department of Health and Human Services
    Secretary Becerra, Department of Education Secretary Cardona, and
    U.S. Small Business Administration Administrator Guzman.
-   [Signed two Executive Orders](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/equity/)
    directing the Federal Government to address system inequality and
    barriers to equal opportunity faced by underserved communities.
-   Updated [Federal race and ethnicity data collection
    standards](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/03/28/omb-publishes-revisions-to-statistical-policy-directive-no-15-standards-for-maintaining-collecting-and-presenting-federal-data-on-race-and-ethnicity/)
    for the first time in almost 30 years, which is expected to improve
    Latino community data representation in the U.S. Census and Federal
    programs.
