title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Accomplishments at the United\_\
  Nations"
---
 
Since his first day in office, President Biden has been committed to
restoring American leadership at the United Nations. Our world today
faces many challenges that no one country can or should confront alone.
But when the United States shows up and leads at the UN, we can rally
global action to tackle problems that affect us all. That is why the
Biden-Harris Administration has worked tirelessly at the UN to advance
American values, safeguard human rights for all, and address conflict
and instability. Alongside our allies and partners from around the
world, we have worked with UN agencies to tackle the climate crisis,
shape our digital future, and fight poverty and disease.

At a time of increasing geopolitical challenges and growing global
needs, strong and effective American leadership at the UN is more
critical than ever. The Biden-Harris Administration has worked to
strengthen American leverage at the United Nations, uphold the UN
Charter, and keep human rights at the core of the organization. Without
robust American engagement, our competitor nations would gain leverage
to advance their interests and values at our expense.

The Biden-Harris Administration has also been committed to reforming and
adapting the UN to the needs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. For
example, President Biden announced a new U.S. openness to expanding the
membership of the UN Security Council, including permanent seats for
Africa and Latin America. The UN is not a perfect organization, but
given the scale of today’s challenges, the world needs global
institutions that are more inclusive and effective.

Over nearly four years, the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership at
the UN has delivered results for the American people. At the UN, we
have:

**Responded to Threats to International Peace and Security**

-   After Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we worked at the
    UN to build support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and hold Russia to
    account. We rallied 141 countries in the UN General Assembly to
    condemn Russia’s violations of international law. We used UN
    Security Council debates to shine a spotlight on Russia’s illegal
    war and atrocities. We pressed the UN General Assembly to kick
    Russia off the UN Human Rights Council. We isolated Russia by
    denying it senior UN appointments and preventing its election to UN
    bodies.
-   Responding to the security situation in Haiti, we partnered with
    Ecuador to obtain UN Security Council authorization of a new
    Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission.
-   Working with African partners, we secured a UN Security Council
    decision to create in December 2023 a new mechanism to largely fund
    future African Union-led Peace Support Operations from the
    UN-assessed budget.
-   Following the horrific October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel,
    we defended at the UN Security Council Israel’s right to defend
    itself and demanded the release of hostages. Also in the Security
    Council, we called for increased humanitarian assistance to Gaza and
    established a new UN mechanism to improve aid coordination. In July
    2024, we secured Security Council endorsement of President Biden’s
    plan for a ceasefire and hostage release deal.
-   As the Sudan conflict worsened, we mobilized action in the UN
    Security Council, including the adoption of a resolution in June
    2024 demanding an end to the siege of El Fasher.
-   Responding to concerns that Russia intended to deploy nuclear
    weapons in space, we and Japan proposed a UN Security Council
    resolution calling on countries not to develop such weapons.
-   In 2022, we partnered with Ireland at the UN Security Council to
    reform, expand and strengthen humanitarian exemptions for UN
    sanctions.
-   Working with the United Kingdom, we secured adoption of the
    first-ever UN Security Council resolution condemning the February
    2021 military coup in Burma.

**Protected and Upheld Universal Human Rights**

-   We rejoined the UN Human Rights Council in 2021, enabling the United
    States to once again lead multilateral efforts to hold accountable
    human rights violators worldwide.
-   We issued a standing invitation to all UN thematic human rights
    monitors to visit the United States and assess our human rights
    record at home. In contrast to authoritarian governments, this
    invitation showed that a confident democracy is willing to have its
    record scrutinized and receive advice on strengthening rights
    protections for its citizens.
-   We pressed for the release of a landmark report from the Office of
    the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on human rights violations
    against Uighurs in China.
-   We worked in the UN Human Rights Council to establish a new Special
    Rapporteur on Human Rights in Russia to examine Moscow’s crackdown
    on dissent at home and a Commission of Inquiry on violations and
    abuses in Russia’s war against Ukraine.
-   We restored American leadership at the UN in defending the human
    rights of LGBTQI+ individuals around the world. This included
    participating in high-level meetings of the Core Group of countries
    advocating for LGBTQI+ rights, including a September 23 meeting
    where the First Lady represented the United States. We also secured
    the renewal of the mandate of the UN’s Independent Expert on Sexual
    Orientation and Gender Identity and urged the UN to release its
    first-ever organization-wide strategy on LGBTQI+ rights,
    co-sponsoring the first-ever Human Rights Council resolution on the
    rights of intersex persons, and convening the second-ever informal
    UN Security Council meeting on the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals.
-   We spotlighted egregious human rights violations by North Korea,
    including by organizing the first briefing of the UN Security
    Council on North Korea human rights since 2017.
-   We helped establish mechanisms through the UN Human Rights Council
    to investigate human rights violations and abuses in Ethiopia,
    Sudan, and Nicaragua.
-   We worked at the UN to advance the global fight against
    antisemitism, including to ensure 36 countries and four multilateral
    organizations joined the U.S.-led Global Guidelines for Countering
    Antisemitism. In 2023, we convened a UN meeting on antisemitism with
    Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and, in 2022, a roundtable at UNESCO.  
-   We advanced the UN’s work to promote racial equality, including by
    championing the inaugural session of the Permanent Forum on People
    of African Descent. We co-sponsored a UN General Assembly resolution
    designating July 25 as International Day of Women and Girls of
    African Descent.
-   We engaged seriously with the human rights treaty body process,
    including through periodic reports about our domestic human rights
    record to the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the
    Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
-   Reaffirming support for the UN Declaration of the Rights of
    Indigenous Peoples, we pressed for enhanced participation of
    Indigenous Peoples throughout the UN system. In 2022, Ambassador
    (ret.) Keith Harper, the first-ever Senate confirmed U.S. ambassador
    from a federally-recognized tribe, was elected to the UN’s Permanent
    Forum on Indigenous issues.  
-   We supported efforts in the UN General Assembly to advance
    discussion of a proposed convention on the prevention and punishment
    of crimes against humanity.  
-   After assuming the presidency of the UN Convention against
    Corruption (UNCAC), we hosted the UNCAC conference in Atlanta,
    Georgia in 2023, with approximately 2,600 delegates, including an
    unprecedented 1,000 from civil society.

**Advanced Gender Equity and Equality**

-   We restored American leadership in pressing at the UN for the rights
    of women and girls, advancing their inclusion in societies, and
    supporting strong language in UN resolutions and at the Commission
    on the Status of Women on sexual and reproductive rights.
-   The January 2021 Presidential Memorandum on Protecting Women’s
    Health at Home and Abroad restored life-saving funding to the UN
    Population Fund (UNFPA).
-   We announced that the United States will contribute for the first
    time to the UNICEF–UNFPA Global Program to End Child Marriage.
-   Following the Iranian regime’s killing of Mahsa Amini and crackdown
    on protestors, we helped establish a new UN Fact-Finding Mission to
    investigate human rights abuses. We spearheaded efforts to remove
    Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women.
-   In 2024, we reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the 1994 International
    Conference on Population and Development Program of Action.
-   We launched the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online
    Harassment and Abuse, which included actions at the UN to address
    online safety for women and girls.

**Shaped Our Digital Future, Promoted Labor Rights, and Tackled
Synthetic Drugs**

-   We sponsored the first-ever UN General Assembly resolution outlining
    principles for the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI).
    This landmark resolution helped define a global consensus on safe,
    secure and trustworthy AI systems for advancing sustainable
    development.
-   We hosted events at the UN on misuses of new technologies, such as
    countries using commercial spyware to surveil dissidents and
    journalists.
-   We worked at the International Labor Organization (ILO) to empower
    workers worldwide and joined the ILO’s Equal Pay International
    Coalition to share best practices to close the gender wage gap.
-   At the first Summit for Democracy in 2021, we announced the
    Multilateral Partnership for Organizing, Worker Empowerment and
    Rights (M-POWER), an initiative working with governments, trade
    unions, labor support, civil society organizations, and philanthropy
    to uphold and promote workers’ trade union rights around the world.
-   In coordination with the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), we
    launched and hosted at the UN high-level meetings of the Global
    Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats and secured adoption of
    a UN General Assembly resolution to enhance international action to
    fight such drugs.

**Strengthened Global Health Cooperation, Advanced Sustainable
Development, and Bolstered Climate Action**

-   We redoubled efforts to support implementation of the UN’s
    Sustainable Development Goals, launching a U.S. Strategy on Global
    Development to accelerate progress and mobilizing $150 billion of
    U.S. funding and billions more from the private sector,
    philanthropic, and other donor resources.
-   In 2021, we reversed the previous administration’s decision to
    withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), enabling the
    United States to shape the WHO’s work on global health and reform.
    With the WHO, we led the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic by
    launching the COVID-19 Global Action Plan and donating nearly 700
    million vaccine doses to 117 countries.
-   We hosted the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria’s
    7th Replenishment in 2022, resulting in more than 75 governments,
    foundations, and corporations delivering pledges totaling a record
    $15.67 billion.
-   We worked at the UN to advance universal health coverage, continue
    the fight against tuberculosis and mpox, and combat global
    antimicrobial resistance (AMR), including to push countries for
    commitments on AMR that are bold, aspirational, and implementable.
-   We focused attention at the UN on addressing global food insecurity,
    repeatedly using the U.S. presidency of the UN Security Council to
    focus on the nexus between food security and conflict. We hosted at
    the UN ministerial-level meetings to generate new commitments to
    expand agricultural capacity and respond to famine with over 100
    partner countries.
-   U.S. Representative to the UN Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield and
    Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland co-led the U.S. delegation to
    the 2023 UN Water Conference, where they announced more than $49
    billion towards water security both at home and abroad.
-   In 2024, Secretary Haaland co-led the U.S. delegation to the Fourth
    International Conference on Small Island Developing States
    (SIDS4), where we announced new efforts to enhance our partnerships
    with SIDS.
-   After rejoining the Paris Agreement, we galvanized efforts at the UN
    to combat climate change, raising global climate ambition through
    countries’ enhanced national contributions, accelerated action to
    reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, forward-leaning
    decisions at annual UN Climate Change Conferences, and major
    initiatives for ocean-climate action catalyzed by the annual Our
    Ocean Conference.
-   Former Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and Senior
    Advisor for International Climate Policy John Podesta have helped
    lead an all-out effort, including critical agreements at the UN
    Climate Change Conference COPs 26 and 28 to partner with countries
    to accelerate climate efforts worldwide and reduce global emissions
    sufficiently to limit warming to 1.5° Celsius. 
-   We advanced efforts within the International Civil Aviation
    Organization, the International Maritime Organization, and other
    multilateral organizations to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from
    the aviation, shipping, and other sectors.

**Strengthened American Presence at the United Nations**

-   After a five-year absence, we rejoined the UN Education, Scientific,
    and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This allowed us to partner with
    UNESCO to combat the scourge of antisemitism, support global
    Holocaust education, promote journalist safety, safeguard Ukrainian
    cultural heritage, bolster ethical uses of AI, and advance science
    education for girls in Africa.
-   We led robust campaigns resulting in the election of U.S. citizens
    to key UN positions, including Doreen Bogdan-Martin as
    Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU), Amy Pope as Director-General of the International
    Organization for Migration (IOM), and Sarah Cleveland as Judge on
    the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
-   We supported the appointments of highly qualified Americans to lead
    UN agencies, such as Ambassador Cathy Russell as Executive Director
    of UNICEF, Ambassador Cindy McCain as Executive Director of the
    World Food Program, and Ian Saunders as Secretary-General of the
    World Customs Organization.
-   Co-chairing the UN Accessibility Steering Committee, we worked to
    make UN headquarters in New York more accessible for all delegates,
    including construction of a 24/7 entrance for wheelchair users and
    the installation of a lift so everyone can address the General
    Assembly from behind the official rostrum.
