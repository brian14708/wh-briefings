title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on Senate Republicans\u2019 Vote to Once\
  \ Again Block Nationwide Protections for\_IVF"

Every woman in every state must have reproductive freedom. Yet,
Republicans in Congress have once again made clear that they will not
protect access to the fertility treatments many couples need to fulfill
their dream of having a child.  
   
Congressional Republicans’ repeated refusal to protect access to IVF is
not an isolated incident. Extremist so-called leaders have launched a
full-on attack against reproductive freedom across our country. In the
more than two years since *Roe v. Wade *was overturned, they have
proposed and passed abortion bans that criminalize doctors and make no
exception for rape or incest. They have also blocked legislation to
protect the right to contraception and proposed four national abortion
bans.  
   
Their opposition to a woman’s freedom to make decisions about her own
body is extreme, dangerous, and wrong. Our administration will always
fight to protect reproductive freedoms, which must include access to
IVF. We stand with the majority of Americans – Republicans and Democrats
alike – who support protecting access to fertility treatments. And we
continue to call on Congress to finally pass a bill that restores
reproductive freedom.
