title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Commemorates the 30th Anniversary\
  \ of the Violence Against Women Act and Strengthens Commitment to Ending Gender-Based\_\
  Violence"
---
 
*For too long, we have ignored the right of women to be free from the
fear of attack based on their gender. For too long, we have kept silent
about the obvious.” – Joseph R. Biden, Jr. speaking at a Hearing of the
U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, June 20, 1990*  

Today, President Biden will deliver remarks at the White House to
commemorate the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Violence Against
Women Act (VAWA), landmark bipartisan legislation that he wrote and
championed as a U.S. Senator and has worked across the aisle to
strengthen ever since. He will reflect on the significant progress we
have made in reducing violence and supporting survivors as well as the
work ahead to realize VAWA’s promise of a nation where every woman and
girl can live free from fear, free from violence, and free from abuse.  
  
Working to end gender-based violence has been a cornerstone of President
Biden’s and Vice President Harris’ careers. VAWA was the first
comprehensive federal law to focus on preventing and addressing violence
against women and to provide justice and support for survivors. The law
transformed the nation’s response to gender-based violence by
recognizing that domestic violence and sexual assault are not a private
matter but rather a violation of fundamental rights and dignity. Between
1993 and 2022, annual domestic violence rates dropped by 67% and the
rate of rapes and sexual assaults declined by 56%.  
  
In the three decades since the original VAWA was signed into law,
President Biden has worked with survivors, advocates, experts, and
Members of Congress of both parties to reauthorize and strengthen the
law four times. As President, he signed into law the VAWA
Reauthorization Act of 2022—critical legislation that expands access to
safety and support for survivors, increases prevention efforts, and
establishes new federal protections against online harassment and abuse.
The President and Vice President also secured the highest-ever funding
levels to implement VAWA, and the Biden-Harris Administration has acted
quickly to implement the law’s new programs and protections.  
  
To mark the 30th anniversary of VAWA, the Biden-Harris Administration is
announcing the following new actions:

-   **Providing new funds to address gender-based violence and support
    survivors.** The Department of Justice—the lead agency in VAWA
    implementation—will announce more than $690 million in FY 2024 grant
    funding to support survivors of gender-based violence. This includes
    more than $40 million to implement new grant programs established by
    the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022, including trauma-informed
    training for law enforcement, pilot programs for serving protection
    orders electronically, strategies to address technology-facilitated
    gender-based violence, and victim-centered and trauma-informed
    restorative practices programs that address gender-based violence.
    By September 30, the Department of Justice will have announced
    funding awards for more than 40 grant programs and initiatives to
    help states, Tribes, territories, law enforcement, victim advocates,
    and community-based organizations address gender-based violence.  
-   **Meeting the housing needs of survivors of domestic violence,
    sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.** Gender-based
    violence is a leading cause of homelessness for families with
    children. Today, five federal agencies—the Departments of
    Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, the Treasury,
    and Veterans Affairs—are issuing a [new interagency
    statement](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/InteragencyVAWAHousingStmnt092024.pdf)
    to affirm VAWA’s housing protections for survivors of domestic
    violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking as well as
    other individuals, such as those who assist survivors. The new
    statement underscores survivors’ housing rights under VAWA,
    identifies potential housing scenarios that highlight the need for
    VAWA’s housing protections, and reaffirms the agencies’ commitment
    to enforcing VAWA’s expanded housing protections in a manner
    consistent with each agencies’ authorities. The Department of
    Housing and Urban Development is also announcing the establishment
    of the Office on Gender-Based Violence, as directed by the VAWA
    Reauthorization Act of 2022, which is located in the Office of the
    Secretary and coordinates and implements policies and programs to
    address the safe housing and economic stability needs of
    survivors.  
-   **Addressing online harassment and abuse.** The Department of
    Justice will announce a funding award for the new National Resource
    Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals as authorized by the VAWA
    Reauthorization Act of 2022. This new Resource Center will help law
    enforcement, prosecutors, and victim services organizations prevent,
    enforce, and prosecute cybercrimes against individuals, including
    cyberstalking, the non-consensual distribution of intimate images,
    and other forms of technology-facilitated abuse. The Department of
    Justice will also announce approximately $5.5 million in new grant
    funds to support local law enforcement in prosecuting cybercrimes
    against individuals and a $250,000 award to provide training and
    technical assistance to schools and other youth-serving
    organizations to improve youth online safety and support young
    survivors of technology-facilitated abuse.  
-   **Engaging the private sector to combat image-based sexual
    abuse.** Image-based sexual abuse—including real images distributed
    without consent and synthetic content generated by artificial
    intelligence (AI)—has skyrocketed in recent years,
    disproportionately targeting women, children, and LGBTQI+ people and
    emerging as one of the fastest growing harmful uses of AI to date.
    Today, following the [Vice President’s
    leadership](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/11/01/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-london-united-kingdom/)
    in underscoring the urgent need to address deepfake image-based
    sexual abuse and the [White House Call to Action to Combat
    Image-Based Sexual
    Abuse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/05/23/a-call-to-action-to-combat-image-based-sexual-abuse/),
    the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a [set of voluntary
    commitments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/09/12/white-house-announces-new-private-sector-voluntary-commitments-to-combat-image-based-sexual-abuse/)
    from AI model developers and data providers to curb the creation of
    image-based sexual abuse and proactively reduce the risk of new
    images from being generated without someone’s consent as well as
    ensure that known, verified instances of image-based sexual abuse
    are excluded from their products and systems. These actions
    complement new efforts from the private sector to support voluntary
    principles to combat image-based sexual abuse through a working
    group with advocates, survivors, and researchers.  
-   **Supporting states in using federal funds to keep guns out of the
    hands of domestic abusers.** Guns and domestic violence are a lethal
    combination: access to a gun makes it five times more likely that a
    woman will die at the hands of her abuser. State laws that require
    people under domestic violence-related restraining orders to turn in
    their firearms are associated with a 14 to 16 percent lower intimate
    partner firearm homicide rate. To help keep guns out of the hands of
    domestic abusers, the Department of Justice is expanding technical
    assistance and federal funding opportunities for state and local law
    enforcement programs that remove firearms from domestic abusers
    convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence or subject to a
    protective order. The Department’s new resources—which will include
    training, toolkits, and best practices from the Domestic Violence
    Homicide Prevention Firearms Technical Assistance Project—follow a
    recent [Resource Guide to Address the Intersection of Domestic
    Violence and
    Firearms](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/media/1356546/dl?inline) that
    encourages states to use federal funds for law enforcement,
    prosecutors, and courts to address this critical intersection. North
    Carolina, for example, is pursuing opportunities to use federal
    funding to address firearms and domestic violence by creating
    training materials for judges, district attorneys and survivors.  
-   **Strengthening enforcement of new provisions to narrow the
    “boyfriend loophole.”** President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer
    Communities Act, which narrowed the “boyfriend loophole” by
    prohibiting persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes in dating
    relationships from purchasing or possessing firearms for at least
    five years. To further implement and enforce this protection, the
    Department of Justice will work with states to educate them about
    the scope of this provision and to help ensure that the records of
    prohibited abusers are available to the National Instant Criminal
    Background Check System. These efforts will inform the work of both
    law enforcement as well as state records repositories and court
    systems.  
-   **Disrupting the cycle of abuse by supporting youth exposed to
    domestic violence.**The Office of Family Violence Prevention and
    Services within the Department of Health and Human Services will
    announce $19 million in new funds to support state and local
    coalitions, Tribal communities, and community-based programs in
    disrupting the cycle of domestic violence. These funds will be used
    to meet the needs of children exposed to family violence, domestic
    violence, or dating violence as well as to provide services to their
    non-abusing parents—with the goal of preventing future violence and
    supporting children and families.

The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to preventing and
ending gender-based violence wherever it occurs. Because, as then-Vice
President Biden made clear on the 20th anniversary of VAWA, [even one
case of gender-based violence is too
many](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/1is2many). The Administration
will continue to take steps to realize VAWA’s fundamental promise of a
nation where every survivor of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating
violence, or stalking can access the safety, justice, and healing they
need and live free from fear, free from violence, and free from abuse.

**Implementing the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022**  
VAWA remains just as important today as it was when the law was first
passed in 1994, and the Biden-Harris Administration is continuing to
implement the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022’s expanded protections
and services, including for survivors from underserved and marginalized
communities, as well as investments in prevention, and new protections
against online harassment and abuse.

-   **Protecting and supporting survivors of gender-based violence.**
    The Department of Justice awarded more than $630 million in VAWA
    grants and cooperative agreements in FY 2023 and more than $690
    million in grants in FY 2024 to serve survivors and bolster
    coordinated community responses aimed at responding to and ending
    domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.
    This includes enhanced access to resources for underserved
    communities, including for LGBTQI+ survivors; funding for
    survivor-centered, community-based restorative practice services;
    and increased support for culturally specific services and services
    in rural communities.  
-   **Expanding access to justice and strengthening gender-based
    violence protections for Tribal communities.** The Department of
    Justice awarded $68 million in FY 2023 VAWA grants and more than $85
    million in FY 2024 VAWA grants to support Native communities to
    provide services and promote justice for survivors. In making these
    awards, the Department took new measures to increase access to the
    Tribal Governments Grant Program. The Department has also supported
    Tribal implementation of new provisions that recognized expanded
    special Tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators of
    sexual violence, child violence, stalking, assaults on Tribal law
    enforcement officers, and sex trafficking on Tribal lands, in
    addition to domestic and dating violence. These efforts have
    included launching a new Special Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction
    Reimbursement Program. The Department also launched a pilot program
    to support Alaska Native Tribes that want to exercise special Tribal
    criminal jurisdiction over non-Indian offenders for certain crimes,
    including crimes of sexual and domestic violence.  
-   **Supporting the housing needs of survivors.** The Department of
    Housing and Urban Development, which awarded $10 million in VAWA
    technical assistance funding in 2023, is working closely with its
    VAWA technical assistance providers and program offices to provide
    robust training and technical assistance to Department’s housing
    grantees, owners, and managers. The Department also published a
    [first-of-its-kind
    report](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Housing-Needs-of-Survivors-of-Human-Trafficking-Study.pdf)
    on the housing needs of survivors of human trafficking, as required
    by the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022 and is releasing a [new fact
    sheet](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/FactSheet2HUD.pdf)
    that applies the report’s findings to help assist youth trafficking
    survivors and youth at risk of trafficking with housing needs.  
-   **Promoting and strengthening prevention services and responses to
    stop violence before it occurs.**The Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention provided more than $49 million in FY 2024 to more than
    110 state health departments and state, territorial, and Tribal
    sexual assault coalitions for the [Rape Prevention and Education
    Program](https://www.cdc.gov/sexual-violence/programs/index.html)
    throughout the United States. Additionally, the Department of
    Justice will award more than $20 million in FY 2024 to support
    colleges and universities in preventing and responding to sexual
    assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. These
    funds help support comprehensive prevention education for students
    and expanded training for school-based personnel and campus health
    centers. Separately, the Department of Education—in collaboration
    with the Departments of Justice and Health and Human
    Services—launched a Task Force on Sexual Violence in Education that
    has issued new reports on data regarding sexual violence at
    educational institutions, held listening sessions, and [solicited
    public
    input](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/24/2024-01323/request-for-information-on-sexual-violence-at-educational-institutions)
    on ways to continue the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to
    improve sexual violence prevention and response on campuses.  
-   **Supporting survivors of online harassment and abuse.** To support
    survivors of image-based abuse, the Department of Justice funded the
    first-ever national helpline to provide 24/7 support and specialized
    services for victims of the non-consensual distribution of intimate
    images. Operated by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, the Image
    Abuse Helpline and Online Safety Center is significantly expanding
    support to survivors of online harassment and abuse, meeting the
    rising need for services to address the non-consensual creation and
    distribution of intimate images. The Department of Justice also
    funded a new project in FY 2023 to address the traumatic impact of
    image-based sexual abuse through a combination of direct services,
    capacity building, training, and education to help combat
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence. In addition to the new
    actions being announced today to address technology-facilitated
    gender-based violence, the Department of Justice has taken steps to
    raise awareness of the new provision in the VAWA Reauthorization Act
    of 2022 that created a federal civil cause of action to address the
    non-consensual distribution of intimate images through [resources
    distributed](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/media/1347791/dl?inline) to
    United States Attorneys’ Offices and national legal and service
    organizations.  
-   **Strengthening protections for domestic violence survivors at risk
    of experiencing gun violence.** To implement the National Instant
    Criminal Background Check System Denial Notification Act—which was
    included in the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022—the Federal Bureau
    of Investigation is actively reporting denied transactions of
    attempted firearm transfers to appropriate state, local, and Tribal
    law enforcement within 24 hours. These reports are helping law
    enforcement investigate and prosecute cases against individuals
    legally prohibited from receiving firearms who try to do so,
    including domestic abusers.  
-   **Improving trauma-informed and victim-centered investigations and
    expanding pathways to justice for survivors.** The Department of
    Justice implemented a new grant program authorized in the VAWA
    Reauthorization Act of 2022 to support [demonstration
    projects](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/media/1344841/dl?inline) and
    [initiatives](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/media/1339836/dl?inline)
    to train law enforcement officers on trauma-informed and
    victim-centered investigations of gender-based violence. The
    Department released a new [Framework for Prosecutors to Strengthen
    our National Response to Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence
    Involving Adult
    Victims](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/prosecutor-guide), setting out
    principles that will lead to better outcomes for survivors, safer
    communities, and greater accountability for perpetrators of domestic
    violence and sexual assault, and implemented new funding to support
    effective policing and prosecution of these crimes. Furthermore, the
    Department has taken several steps to expand pathways to justice for
    survivors by implementing a new program, authorized in the VAWA
    Reauthorization Act of 2022, to support, enhance, and expand
    restorative practice programs that prevent or address domestic
    violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and build
    evidence for victim-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally
    responsive restorative practices addressing these harms.

**Addressing Gender-Based Violence Beyond VAWA**  
Building on the foundation of VAWA, the Biden-Harris Administration has
taken numerous additional actions to address gender-based violence
wherever it occurs—at home, at work, in the military, in schools, in
communities, and online.

-   **Addressing gun violence by domestic abusers.** In addition to
    signing the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in
    nearly 30 years and narrowing the “boyfriend loophole,” President
    Biden established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
    Prevention, which is overseen by Vice President Harris, to lead the
    Administration’s efforts to end our nation’s gun violence epidemic.
    The Department of Justice has invested $250 million in
    community-based violence intervention programs and provided $750
    million for states to implement crisis interventions, such as red
    flag laws. And the Department successfully
    [defended](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-courts-decision-united-states-v-rahimi)
    at the Supreme Court the constitutionality of a federal law that
    helps keep guns out of the hands of individuals subject to domestic
    violence protective orders.  
-   **Implementing historic military justice reforms and supporting
    survivors.** One of President Biden’s earliest acts in office was to
    call for the establishment of the Independent Review Commission on
    Sexual Assault in the Military to strengthen the military justice
    response to sexual violence. Since then, we have advanced historic
    and bipartisan legislative reforms to better protect survivors and
    fundamentally change how the military investigates and prosecutes
    sexual assault, domestic violence, child abuse, and related
    offenses—transferring prosecutorial decisions from commanders to
    independent military prosecutors and establishing the Offices of
    Special Trial Counsel. Building on these reforms, in July 2024, the
    Department of Defense implemented additional Independent Review
    Commission recommendations to improve the Department’s response to
    sexual assault by removing barriers for those seeking help and by
    professionalizing the survivor response workforce. The Department of
    Defense has also made record investments in sexual assault
    prevention and survivor support, more than doubling annual funding
    from $500 million to more than $1 billion in 2024 for these
    lifesaving services, with more than 1,000 integrated primary
    prevention personnel in place as of June 2024. This work is making a
    difference: for the first time in nearly a decade, rates of sexual
    assault and harassment within the active-duty force are down.  
-   **Investing in communities to support survivors and save lives.**
    The President’s American Rescue Plan invested nearly $1 billion in
    supplemental funding for domestic violence and sexual assault
    services and supports through the Family Violence Prevention and
    Services Act Program. The President also signed into law the VOCA
    Fix Act, which has provided more than $1.4 billion for the Crime
    Victims Fund to support local programs and services for survivors.
    Since the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) became law in 1984, we have
    invested more than $38 billion dollars in local programs that
    provide mental health, housing, legal assistance, victim advocacy,
    crisis intervention, and other services to help victims of
    gender-based violence and other crimes.  
-   **Keeping students safe and addressing campus sexual assault.** The
    Department of Education restored and strengthened vital Title IX
    nondiscrimination protections for students and employees. The
    Department’s rule provides protection from sex-based harassment,
    including sexual violence; promotes accountability and fundamental
    fairness through a transparent and reliable process; and provides
    clarity to ensure that students, employees, and families understand
    their rights and that institutions know their responsibilities. The
    new rule also clarifies that schools have a responsibility to
    address sex discrimination and harassment that occurs under its
    programs and activities whether the conduct takes place online, in
    person, or both, and strengthens definitions for sex-based
    harassment under Title IX to address the growth in
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including AI-generated
    abuse.  
-   **Strengthening protections for survivors of sexual assault and
    harassment in the workplace.** President Biden signed into law new
    protections to support survivors and address sexual assault and
    sexual harassment in the workplace through the Ending Forced
    Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act and the
    Speak Out Act. The Office of Personnel Management issued guidance on
    the use of “safe leave” to support federal employees’ access to paid
    time off and leave without pay for purposes related to seeking
    safety and recovering from domestic violence, dating violence,
    sexual assault, and related forms of abuse. The Department of Labor
    is publishing a [package of new
    resources](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/GBVH) on “safe
    leave” policies and [awarded new
    grants](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/wb/wb20240911) under
    the Fostering Access, Rights and Equity Grant program, which assists
    underserved and marginalized low-income women workers who have been
    impacted by gender-based violence and harassment. Separately, the
    Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued new resources to help
    federal agencies and employers prevent and remedy harassment,
    including sexual harassment, and create respectful workplaces.  
-   **Supporting survivors in accessing housing, homeless assistance,
    and community services.** In February 2024, the Department of
    Housing and Urban Development awarded $57 million in Domestic
    Violence Bonus projects serving survivors of domestic violence,
    dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and human trafficking. In
    July, the Department announced the availability of at least another
    $52 million in Domestic Violence Bonus projects, which will be
    issued in early 2025. The Department also directed Homeless
    Continuum of Care recipients to offer services to people
    experiencing trauma or a lack of safety related to gender-based
    violence, consistent with the new definition of “homeless” for
    survivors included in the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022. And
    Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) grantees used nearly $13
    million of CDBG funds and another $8.3 million of CDBG-CV funds in
    FY 2023 to support services for survivors of domestic violence,
    dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. CDBG funds supported
    crisis intervention, crisis hotline, counseling, emergency shelter
    and housing assistance, legal assistance, and other community
    services for adults and children as well as survivors.  
-   **Developing the first-ever U.S. National Plan to End Gender-Based
    Violence.** The White House issued the first-ever [U.S. National
    Plan to End Gender-Based
    Violence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/National-Plan-to-End-GBV.pdf),
    a comprehensive, government-wide plan to prevent and address sexual
    violence, intimate partner violence, stalking, and other forms of
    gender-based violence. The National Plan provides a framework for
    guiding federal action across each of seven strategic pillars—from
    prevention to economic security and housing stability to online
    safety.  
-   **Preventing and responding to online harassment and abuse in the
    U.S. and globally.** To strengthen support for survivors of online
    harassment and abuse, the President established and the Vice
    President launched the [White House Task Force to Address Online
    Harassment and
    Abuse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White-House-Task-Force-to-Address-Online-Harassment-and-Abuse_FINAL.pdf),
    which has coordinated comprehensive actions from more than a dozen
    federal agencies and supported a record investment of more than $36
    million in dedicated funding to address technology-facilitated
    gender-based violence in the U.S. and globally. The President’s
    Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and
    Use of Artificial Intelligence includes a focus on deepfake
    image-based abuse and directs federal agencies to take key actions
    to address this growing online harm. Additionally, the Department of
    Justice is accelerating its enforcement efforts against the misuse
    of generative AI to produce child sexual abuse material. The
    Department will aggressively hold accountable those who exploit AI
    to create obscene, abusive, and increasingly photorealistic images
    of children and is prosecuting AI-enabled criminal conduct to the
    fullest extent of the law and will seek increased sentences wherever
    warranted. Globally, the Biden-Harris Administration launched the
    15-country [Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online
    Harassment and
    Abuse](https://www.state.gov/2023-roadmap-for-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/),
    which has advanced international policies to address online safety,
    and spurred new programs to prevent and respond to
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence and counter its
    chilling effects on women leaders and democratic participation.  
-   **Helping protect survivor privacy and economic security.**
    President Biden signed several new laws to help survivors protect
    and maintain their privacy and enhance their access to funds and
    tools like a phone line. The Safe Connections Act allows a survivor
    of domestic abuse to separate a mobile phone line from an account
    shared with an abuser. Additionally, the Federal Communications
    Commission has solicited comment on whether its rules implementing
    the Safe Connections Act should be updated to stop abusers from
    using connectivity tools in vehicles to harass and intimidate their
    partners and has called on auto manufacturers and wireless service
    providers to help ensure that smart car services are not being used
    to stalk, harass, or intimidate survivors of gender-based violence.
    Other laws signed by President Biden include the Joint Consolidation
    Loan Separation Act, which allows survivors of domestic violence and
    others who have faced economic abuse to sever joint student loan
    debt, and the SECURE 2.0 Act, which allows survivors of domestic
    abuse to elect to receive penalty-free distributions from an
    employer-sponsored retirement plan.  
-   **Addressing gender-based violence in Native communities.** In
    addition to the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions to implement
    the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022, President Biden issued an
    Executive Order directing federal agencies to address the crisis of
    missing or murdered Indigenous peoples, which significantly impacts
    women, girls, LGBTQI+ people, and Two-Spirit Native Americans.
    Pursuant to the Not Invisible Act, the Departments of Justice and
    the Interior established the [Not Invisible Act
    Commission](https://www.justice.gov/tribal/not-invisible-act) in
    2022, a cross-jurisdictional advisory committee composed of law
    enforcement, Tribal leaders, federal partners, service providers,
    family members of missing or murdered individuals, and survivors.
    The Commission provided
    [recommendations](https://www.justice.gov/otj/media/1322566/dl?inline)
    to improve the federal government’s efforts to address violent crime
    and the high rates of people reported missing in Native communities,
    which the Departments
    [responded](https://www.justice.gov/tribal/media/1341181/dl?inline)
    to earlier this year. Additionally, the United States relaunched the
    [North American Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against
    Indigenous Women and
    Girls](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2022/07/27/report-on-the-fourth-convening-of-the-trilateral-working-group-on-violence-against-indigenous-women-and-girls/),
    in collaboration with the governments of Canada and Mexico, and with
    the participation of Indigenous women leaders from all three
    countries.  
-   **Improving access to sexual assault forensic examinations.** Over
    the past three years, the Department of Justice has dedicated more
    than $124 million to the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative,
    which provides funding to support the inventory, tracking, and
    testing of previously unsubmitted sexual assault kits; the
    collection and testing of DNA from arrestees and offenders; and
    resources to address the cold case sexual assault investigations and
    prosecutions that result from evidence and Combined DNA Index System
    hits produced by tested sexual assault kits; among other services.
    The Department has also provided nearly $18 million to increase
    access to trained sexual assault medical forensic examiners, improve
    access to wrap-around care for survivors, and establish regional
    Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) training programs and a Center
    of Excellence in Forensic Nursing model to prepare current and
    future SANEs. With $10 million in FY 2024 funding, the Department
    will implement a new program to further address nationwide gaps in
    the availability and quality of post-sexual assault medical forensic
    care by establishing new SANE/Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner
    programs, strengthening existing ones, and providing technical
    assistance to support these programs.  
-   **Combatting human trafficking and strengthening protections for
    noncitizen trafficking victims.** The Biden-Harris Administration
    released an updated National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking
    laying out an integrated federal response to human trafficking as
    well as a National Human Trafficking Prevention Framework. Since
    then, the Department of Justice has disseminated more than $190
    million in funding to combat human trafficking and support survivors
    and released updated guidelines for its employees who work with
    victims and witnesses of crime to provide enhanced protections for
    survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and human
    trafficking and for other vulnerable victims.

Separately, the Department of Homeland Security
[adopted](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/24_0521_mgmt_gender-based-violence.pdf)
a victim-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally sensitive approach to
protecting survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and
human trafficking as well as other vulnerable victims. The Department of
Homeland Security also finalized a rule to strengthen the integrity of
the T nonimmigrant visa process, which enables certain noncitizen
victims of human trafficking to remain in the U.S. for an initial period
of up to four years, and ensure eligible victims of human trafficking
can access protections and stabilizing benefits in a timely manner.
Additionally, the Department established a process to conduct bona fide
determinations and provide employment authorization and deferred action
to noncitizen victims of crime, including domestic violence, sexual
assault, and stalking, with pending petitions for U nonimmigrant status
for those who met certain standards.

-   **Investing in preventing and ending gender-based violence
    globally.** Over the last two fiscal years, the United States
    maintained the highest-ever level of investment—$250 million—to
    address gender-based violence globally. This work is guided by the
    [U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence
    Globally](https://www.state.gov/2022-u-s-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gender-based-violence-globally/),
    which addresses 21st century challenges, including the rise of
    gender-based violence during the COVID-19 pandemic;
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence; and safety risks
    related to climate migration and displacement. Under this strategy,
    we secured the first-ever U.S.
    [commitment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/11/fact-sheet-white-house-celebrates-international-day-of-the-girl-and-announces-new-actions-to-support-youth-in-the-u-s-and-abroad/)
    to the United Nations Global Programme to End Child Marriage and
    continued our long-standing commitment to the United Nations Joint
    Programme on the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation.  
-   **Advancing justice and accountability for conflict-related sexual
    violence.** The Biden-Harris Administration has condemned sexual
    violence whenever and wherever it occurs, including in South Sudan,
    Iraq, Haiti, Ukraine, and the attacks committed by Hamas in Israel
    on October 7 – and in Gaza against hostages. In 2022, President
    Biden issued an historic Presidential Memorandum on Promoting
    Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, committing to
    fully exercising U.S. authorities—including sanctions, visa
    restrictions, and security assistance vetting—to impose consequences
    on perpetrators of this human rights abuse. The Biden-Harris
    Administration has since issued two sets of sanctions against
    perpetrators of conflict-related sexual violence around the globe,
    launched the [Dignity in Documentation
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/17/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administrations-actions-to-address-conflict-related-sexual-violence/#:~:text=Preventing%20and%20responding%20to%20conflict,Biden%20and%20Vice%20President%20Harris.)
    to provide support for efforts to investigate and document
    conflict-related sexual violence, and will support justice for
    survivors by promoting accountability for crimes punishable under
    international law. Vice President Harris condemned conflict-related
    sexual violence and convened survivors at the White House in 2024.
