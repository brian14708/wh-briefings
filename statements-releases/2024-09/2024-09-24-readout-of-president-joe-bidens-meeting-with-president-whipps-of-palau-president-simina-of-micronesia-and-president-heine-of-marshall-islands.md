President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with President Surangel Whipps, Jr.
of Palau, President Wesley Simina of Micronesia, and President Hilda
Heine of Marshall Islands today in New York at the United Nations to
celebrate the renewal of the Compacts of Free Association and
Compact-related agreements, which will reinforce the uniquely close
relationships between the United States and the Freely Associated States
for another 20 years. The President underscored his commitment to
providing health care support to veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces in
the Freely Associated States, which serve at higher per capita rates
than most U.S. states. The President thanked the leaders of the Freely
Associated States for their continued support of the United States’
growing engagement with the Pacific Islands. The leaders reaffirmed the
need to cooperate on issues of mutual importance to all four countries,
including the impacts of climate change and sea level rise.
