President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to Germany and Angola, from
October 10 to 15. In Germany, President Biden will meet with German
leaders to further strengthen the close bond the United States and
Germany share as Allies and friends and coordinate on shared priorities.
The President will reinforce the U.S. and German commitment to democracy
and countering antisemitism and hatred, strengthen the enduring
people-to-people ties between our countries, and advance cooperation on
economics, trade, and technology.  He will also express his appreciation
to Germany for supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression,
hosting U.S. service members, and contributing to the security of the
United States, Germany, and the entire NATO Alliance. On October 13-15,
President Biden will travel to Luanda, Angola, where he will meet with
President João Lourenço of Angola to discuss increased collaboration on
shared priorities, including bolstering our economic partnerships that
keep our companies competitive and protect workers; celebrating a
signature project of the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
Investment (PGI), which advances our joint vision for Africa’s first
trans-continental open-access rail network that starts in Lobito and
ultimately will connect the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean;
strengthening democracy and civic engagement; intensifying action on
climate security and the clean energy transition; and enhancing peace
and security. The President’s visit to Luanda celebrates the evolution
of the U.S.-Angola relationship, underscores the United States’
continued commitment to African partners, and demonstrates how
collaborating to solve shared challenges delivers for the people of the
United States and across the African continent.
