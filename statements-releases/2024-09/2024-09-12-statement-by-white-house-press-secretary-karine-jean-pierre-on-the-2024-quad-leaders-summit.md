  \ Leaders\_Summit"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will host the fourth in-person Quad
Leaders Summit in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday, September 21. The
President looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of
Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister
Kishida Fumio of Japan.

This will be President Biden’s first time hosting foreign leaders in
Wilmington as president—a reflection of his deep personal relationships
with each of the Quad Leaders, and the importance of the Quad to all of
our countries.

The Biden-Harris Administration has made elevating and
institutionalizing the Quad a top priority, from the first-ever Quad
Leaders Summit at the White House in 2021, to annual Summits since then.
In recent years, Quad Foreign Ministers have met eight times, and Quad
governments continue to meet and coordinate at all levels.

The Quad Leaders Summit will focus on bolstering the strategic
convergence among our countries, advancing our shared vision of a free
and open Indo-Pacific region, and delivering concrete benefits for
partners in the Indo-Pacific in key areas. These include health
security, natural disaster response, maritime security, high-quality
infrastructure, critical and emerging technology, climate and clean
energy, and cybersecurity.

The next Quad Summit will be hosted by India.
