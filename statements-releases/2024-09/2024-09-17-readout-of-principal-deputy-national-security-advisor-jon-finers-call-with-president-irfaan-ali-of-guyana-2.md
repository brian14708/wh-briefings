Strategic Dialogue that was held in July, and additional concrete steps
to contribute to Guyana’s economy, development and territorial
integrity.  They also shared their concerns regarding the violations of
democratic practices in Venezuela following the July 28 presidential

Security Support mission in Haiti.
