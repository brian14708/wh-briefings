title: "Readout of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s Meeting with Historically\
  \ Black College and University Presidents on Partnerships to Advance National\_\
  Security"
---
 
On Thursday, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan welcomed 20 leaders
of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for a round
table discussion.  The discussion focused on two areas: increasing
pathways for HBCU students into national security fields, and
identifying areas through which federal agencies can support HBCUs in
managing their unique security challenges.  This discussion followed up
on a round table Mr. Sullivan hosted with HBCU presidents in February
2023.  
   
During the conversation, Mr. Sullivan shared the progress that national
security and foreign policy Departments and Agencies have made
implementing benchmarks directed by President Biden in his [White House
Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy and National
Security Workforce, Institutions, and
Partnerships](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/memorandum-revitalizing-americas-foreign-policy-and-national-security-workforce-institutions-and-partnerships/). 
Mr. Sullivan reported the addition of more than 4,000 paid internships
across agencies including the State Department, the Department of
Defense (DOD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the
Intelligence Community (IC).  He also described the expansion of Centers
of Academic Excellence on HBCU campuses for training and research on the
challenges of the future.  Mr. Sullivan affirmed that the Administration
is eager to continue making progress on addressing obstacles to HBCU
student recruitment and hiring.  HBCU presidents shared their desire to
expand partnerships with Federal agencies to support groundbreaking
research and improve programs to meet national security needs.    
   
HBCU presidents also spoke about security challenges facing their
institutions, most notably the challenges and concerns associated with
both domestic violent extremism and racially and ethnically motivated
violent extremism.  They expressed gratitude for the support that local
and regional federal law enforcement liaisons have provided to HBCUs’
threat prevention partnership and coordination efforts.  Mr. Sullivan
discussed with HBCU leaders existing and new U.S. Government resources
available to all college campuses, including HBCUs, to help to bolster
their preparedness and resilience against both physical and
cyber-attacks, as well as training, toolkits, and grant funding
available for security hardening.  Some of these resource include
the DHS [Prevention Resource Finder](https://www.dhs.gov/prevention),
the U.S. Department of Education’s [Free to Learn: Leading Inclusive
Learning Environments in Higher Education Resource
Guide](https://sites.ed.gov/cfbnp/files/2024/07/USDE_Campus-Toolkit_FINAL.pdf),
an [HBCU Bomb Threat Resource
Guide](https://sites.ed.gov/whhbcu/files/2022/03/3.16.22-HBCU-Bomb-Threat-Resource-Guide-Final.pdf), and
CISA’s [K-12 School Security Guide Companion for School-Based Law
Enforcement and School Resource
Officers](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/k-12-school-security-guide-companion-school-based-law-enforcement-and-school-resource-officers).   
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has consistently demonstrated its
commitment to supporting the vital mission of HBCUs, having invested a
record over $16 billion dollars in HBCUs, including nearly $4 billion in
emergency support and recovery funding through the American Rescue
Plan.
