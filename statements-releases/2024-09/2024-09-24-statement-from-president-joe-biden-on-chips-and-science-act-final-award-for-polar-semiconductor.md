title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on CHIPS and Science Act Final Award for\
  \ Polar Semiconductor"
---
 
Semiconductors – those tiny chips smaller than the tip of your finger –
power everything from smartphones to cars to satellites and weapons
systems.  I signed the CHIPS and Science Act to revitalize American
leadership in semiconductors, strengthen our supply chains, protect our
national security, and advance American competitiveness. And over the
last three and a half years, we have done just that, catalyzing over
$400 billion in private sector investments in semiconductors and
electronics that are creating over 115,000 construction and
manufacturing jobs. This year alone, the United States is on pace to see
more investment in electronics manufacturing construction than it did
over the last 24 years combined.

Today’s announcement that the Department of Commerce has finalized the
first commercial CHIPS Incentives award with Polar Semiconductor marks
the next phase of the implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act, and
demonstrates how we continue to deliver on the Investing in American
agenda. Polar’s new facility will also be completed under a Project
Labor Agreement to support its construction workforce, creating
good-quality union jobs in Bloomington, Minnesota. Today’s announcement
is just one of the many ways our Investing in America agenda is
reshoring U.S. manufacturing, investing in workers and communities
across the country, and advancing America’s leadership in the
technologies of tomorrow.
