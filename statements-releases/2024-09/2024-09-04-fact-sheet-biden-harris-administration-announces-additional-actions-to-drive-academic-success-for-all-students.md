title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Additional Actions\
  \ to Drive Academic Success for all\_Students"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration believes that public education is the
bedrock of our democracy and the foundation of opportunity in our
country—and that every young person should have the chance to learn,
grow, and pursue their dreams. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris
Administration has focused on improving academic achievement, increasing
student attendance and engagement, and building communities where all
students feel they belong and can thrive. That’s why the Biden-Harris
Administration made the single-largest investment in K-12 education in
history—and it is delivering results, including [student achievement
gains](https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20WP%20301-0624.pdf). A
Harvard and Stanford
[study](https://educationrecoveryscorecard.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/June2024ERS-Report.pdf)[,
for
example](https://educationrecoveryscorecard.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/June2024ERS-Report.pdf),
for example, examined outcomes in districts that received large amounts
of federal COVID-19 relief funding, which ranged from approximately
$4,000 to more than $13,000 per student, and found that these
investments will [pay

itself in [increased](https://doi.org/10.3386/w30701) earnings for
students who benefit, with particularly large impacts for students in
schools with high rates of poverty. These investments not only improve
academic achievement, but other student outcomes. Another [economic
study](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/1/157/2461148) shows
that a 10% increase in per student spending each year for all 12 years
of public school leads to about 7% higher wages in adulthood, with more
pronounced effects for students from low-income backgrounds.  
   
As students across the country head back to school, the Biden-Harris
Administration is working to make sure America’s schools have the
resources and supports they need to continue their important progress.
Working together, at the federal, state, and local level, we must all
double-down on strengthening reading and math skills; increasing student
attendance and engagement; providing afterschool and expanded learning
programs; and increasing access to intensive tutoring. We must also
provide teachers and school leaders with evidence-based preparation,
development, coaching, and resources to support student academic success
and literacy and math and their overall well-being, which is
foundational to that success.  
   
**<u>As part of our ongoing commitment to support student success, today
we are announcing the following Administration actions</u>:**

-   **Awarding** [**$149 million to support states in implementing
    evidence-based reading
    interventions**](https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-discretionary-grants-support-services/well-rounded-education-programs/striving-readers-comprehensive-literacy-srcl-formula-grants-84-371a-for-state-literacy-teams/)**,
    including efforts to ensure every child is reading fluently by third
    grade.** The U.S. Department of Education’s Comprehensive Literacy
    State Development grant program supports states in creating
    comprehensive literacy programs and providing professional
    development to advance literacy skills, including pre-literacy
    skills, reading, and writing, for children and youth, focusing on
    underserved students, including students from low-income
    backgrounds, English learners, and children with disabilities. For
    example, Ohio will partner with state colleges and universities to
    better prepare educators to deliver evidence-based literacy
    instruction, and Montana will use funds to expand reading
    instructional skills for educators in rural communities.  
-   **Awarding** [**$30 million to support comprehensive assessment
    systems that inform teaching and support
    learning**](https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/school-support-and-accountability/competitive-grants-for-state-assessments/)**.**
    The U.S. Department of Education’s Competitive Grants for State
    Assessments program supports high-quality state assessment systems
    that measure student achievement and progress using multiple
    measures and gives insight into student learning, helping to inform
    instruction and support student achievement. For example, Nebraska
    will use funds to support English Learners by making assessment data
    more usable and actionable for educators as they design
    instruction.  
-   **Issuing new** [**school improvement
    guidance**](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2024/09/School-Improvement-Guidance-public-comment.pdf)
    **focused on evidence-based practices to support students and
    educators and accelerate academic achievement.** To further support
    states and districts in their efforts to increase student success,
    the U.S. Department of Education is issuing school improvement
    guidance to support effective implementation of the Elementary and
    Secondary Education Act. The guidance provides examples of
    evidence-based approaches to support teaching and learning and drive
    student achievement. This includes addressing chronic absenteeism
    (for example, through early warning systems and improved family
    engagement, like home visits and effective parent communication such
    as texting), and providing high-quality tutoring (in small groups,
    2-3 times per week by a well-prepared tutor, during the school day,
    and aligned with classroom instruction), and afterschool, expanded,
    and summer learning programs. This draft guidance is open for public
    comment until October 4, 2024. The Department will consider this
    community input and issue updated guidance by the end of the year.  
-   **Releasing a new** [**resource for
    educators**](https://members.nces.ed.gov/blogs/ncee/post/evidence-based-strategies-for-improving-student-literacy-and-teaching-mathematics-in-grades-pk-9)
    **on evidence-based strategies for increasing student literacy and
    math achievement.** The Institute of Education Sciences is releasing
    a resource for educators on instructional strategies for increasing
    student success in literacy and math. Each resource includes
    concrete practices that can be used by teachers from early grades to
    high school, and provides links to additional resources that can
    support learning at home.   
-   **To support states, districts, schools, and families in addressing
    chronic absenteeism and increase student engagement, the
    Administration is:**  
-   **Calling on Governors and state education leaders to create
    statewide student data systems that provide chronic
    absenteeism-related data for all schools that are actionable, help
    target interventions, and drive improvement.** The Administration
    encourages all state leaders to ensure that every school district in
    their state has the real-time data they need to identify and reduce
    chronic absenteeism and improve student success. States including
    Alabama, Connecticut, Indiana, and Rhode Island have developed
    innovative statewide student information systems to help increase
    student attendance. At a minimum, state systems are encouraged to
    provide:
    -   to the public, up-to-date rates of chronic absenteeism and
        whether rates are declining or increasing;
    -   to educators, real-time, school-level data that enables them to
        identify the root causes of chronic absenteeism, select the
        appropriate interventions, target resources, and measure
        effectiveness; and
    -   to parents and families, real-time information on their child’s
        attendance.  
-   **Calling on industry vendors that provide student information
    systems to improve the availability and utility of student
    attendance data.** This includes making attendance data available to
    states and districts at no additional cost; not charging districts
    to access, securely export, or display their own data; and adopting
    industry aligned data standards or practices for student attendance
    data that allows for interoperability between the modules that
    states and districts use, between vendors, and between districts
    that may use different data systems.  
-   **To support these efforts, this year, the Department of Education
    will issue a resource for state leaders highlighting different state
    approaches to creating and implementing data systems to address
    chronic absenteeism along with recommendations for states and local
    leaders.** The guide will also include information on how federal
    funding can be used to support these efforts.   
-   **Founding the** ***Student*** ***Attendance and Engagement
    Solutions Network***, part of the [National Partnership for Student
    Success](https://www.partnershipstudentsuccess.org/) (NPSS), a
    partnership among the U.S. Department of Education, AmeriCorps, and
    the Johns Hopkins University [Everyone Graduates
    Center](https://new.every1graduates.org/meeting-the-chronic-absenteeism-challenge-what-do-we-know/).
    The Network supports school districts and states in their efforts to
    reduce chronic absenteeism, increase student engagement, and enhance
    prevention strategies for the 2024-25 academic year and beyond. To
    date, almost 200 school districts across 43 states and eight state
    education agencies, in total representing more than 11,000 schools
    and 7.2 million students, have joined the network to learn from each
    other about how to improve attendance and engagement. The Network is
    open for districts and states to join. More information on the
    network and how to join can be found
    [here](https://www.partnershipstudentsuccess.org/attendance-solutions-network/).  
-   **Releasing a** [**joint
    resource**](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/DOTandEDJointResourceTransportationSept2024.pdf)
    **by the U.S. Departments of Education and Transportation
    highlighting ways to provide safe, reliable transit options to get
    young people to and from school and support everyday student
    attendance.** Many students miss school because of transportation
    issues, especially in vulnerable communities. To address this issue,
    transit agencies, school districts, and local and state government
    leaders can work together to improve transit options for families,
    including through offering free or reduced transit fares, expanding
    safe routes to school, and creating a “walking or bike bus”. This
    resource includes strategies to support students and families in
    getting to and from school at low or no cost, and federal funding
    available to support these efforts through the Departments of
    Education and Transportation.  
-   **Releasing, this month, a joint resource for parents by the U.S.
    Departments of Education and Agriculture on how healthy school meals
    support regular attendance.** This resource provides information
    that schools can use in engaging parents and caregivers on how
    school meals bolster everyday student attendance and support healthy
    growth and development and how to access programs.  
-   **Launching the “Attendance Champions Challenge” to hear directly
    from young people on creative solutions to address chronic
    absenteeism.** The Challenge, hosted on challenge.gov, will
    encourage state and local leaders to directly engage young people
    (ages 13-19) in sharing barriers to regular school attendance and
    proposing viable, creative solutions to support their attendance and
    engagement. The Challenge is open until November 29th and more
    information can be found at [this
    website](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=attendance-champions).  
-   **Providing parents with**
    [**resources**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/When-to-Keep-Your-Child-Home-from-School.aspx)
    **on navigating** [**whether to send kids to
    school**](https://www.cdc.gov/orr/school-preparedness/infection-prevention/when-sick.html)
    **when they are experiencing health symptoms.** The Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention and [external
    organizations](https://www.attendanceworks.org/resources/health-handouts-for-families/)
    are releasing resources on how to support consistent school
    attendance, while also [preventing
    spread](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/keepitthatway.html) of illness.

In addition to these actions by the Administration, a number of
organizations have taken action to tackle absenteeism, as previewed
during the [White House Every Day Counts
Summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-and-resources-for-increasing-student-attendance-and-engagement-as-part-of-the-white-house-every-day-counts-summit/).
These actions include a [messaging
toolkit](https://www.adcouncil.org/learn-with-us/ad-council-research-institute/chronic-student-absenteeism)
for states, districts, and educators based on new research around
effectively communicating with parents to increase student attendance,
developed by **the Ad Council Research Institute (ACRI)**, with support
from **Overdeck Family Foundation**, available on September
10<sup>th</sup>. Information on additional actions by organizations is
available
[here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-and-resources-for-increasing-student-attendance-and-engagement-as-part-of-the-white-house-every-day-counts-summit/).  
  
**These resources build on the previous Administration actions to
promote academic achievement and student success, including:**

-   **Securing $130 billion for the largest-ever investment in public
    education through state and district funding in the American Rescue
    Plan (ARP).** ARP has been used to help schools safely reopen, and
    address the academic, mental health, and other needs of students.
    ARP funding has put more teachers in our classrooms and more support
    staff in our schools; expanded high-dosage tutoring; led to record
    expansion of summer and after-school programs; improved HVAC
    systems; and increased access to a wide range of student supports.
    The most recent data shows that states and districts have allocated
    more than $70 billion to activities that address students’ academic,
    social, and emotional needs, including tutoring, afterschool, and
    summer learning, and research is showing that these
    [investments](https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20WP%20301-0624.pdf)
    are [working](https://educationrecoveryscorecard.org/).   
-   **Enabling states to continue investing pandemic relief funds into
    academic achievement efforts in the 2024-25 school year and focus
    remaining resources on improving outcomes. **The Department issued
    a [letter](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2024/01/ARP-Liquidation-Extension-Letter-1.9.24-final-for-signature-v3.pdf), [Frequently
    Asked
    Questions](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2024/01/Updated-Technical-FAQs-for-Liquidation-Extensions-1.9.24-v-2-for-posting.pdf),
    and
    a [template](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Foese.ed.gov%2Ffiles%2F2024%2F01%2FARP-ESSER-EANS-Liquidation-Extension-Request-1.10.24-v3.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) to
    support States and provide a critical pathway to continue to use ARP
    dollars in the 2024-2025 school year, including on evidence-based
    academic and other student supports.   
-   **Fully enforcing the ARP maintenance of equity provisions to ensure
    that States maintain their own levels of education spending,
    especially for communities with high rates of poverty.** Under the
    Department’s robust implementation of these fiscal equity
    provisions, 48 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia
    safeguarded funding in communities with high rates of poverty and
    drove almost $800 million to under-resourced schools.
