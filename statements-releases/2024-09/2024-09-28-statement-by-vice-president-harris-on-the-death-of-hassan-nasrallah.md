title: "Statement by Vice President Harris on the Death of Hassan\_Nasrallah"
---
 
Hassan Nasrallah was a terrorist with American blood on his hands.
Across decades, his leadership of Hezbollah destabilized the Middle East
and led to the killing of countless innocent people in Lebanon, Israel,
Syria, and around the world. Today, Hezbollah’s victims have a measure
of justice.  
  
I have an unwavering commitment to the security of Israel. I will always
support Israel’s right to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed
terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis.   
  
President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East
escalate into a broader regional war. We have been working on a
diplomatic solution along the Israel-Lebanon border so that people can
safely return home on both sides of that border. Diplomacy remains the
best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in
the region.
