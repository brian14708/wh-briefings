---
 
Today’s report shows inflation has come back down to 2.2%, similar to
pre-pandemic levels, at a time when interest rates have fallen—lowering
the cost of buying a home or car, or operating a small business. This
follows yesterday’s news that on my watch the economy has grown more
than 10% and incomes are up nearly $4,000, after accounting for
inflation. The economy, incomes, savings, and consumer spending are all
stronger than previously estimated.  
   
We have more work to do to lower costs and create opportunities for
Americans. The Vice President and I want to build millions of new homes,
continue to lower the price of prescription drugs and health care, and
cut taxes for families, small businesses, and industries of the future.
Congressional Republicans would take the opposite approach—raising costs
for middle-class families by nearly $4,000 per year while giving more
tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations. That’s not how you grow
the economy, or the middle class.
