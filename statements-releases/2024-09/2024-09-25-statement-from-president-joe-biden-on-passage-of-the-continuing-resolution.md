title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Passage of the Continuing\_Resolution"
---
 
Tonight, bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress passed a
continuing resolution to keep the government open through mid-December.
I want to thank both houses of Congress—especially Senators Murray and
Collins and Representatives Cole and DeLauro—for this bipartisan
agreement and for avoiding a costly government shutdown. The passage of
this bill gives Congress more time to pass full-year funding bills by
the end of this year. My Administration will work with Congress to
ensure these bills deliver for America’s national defense, veterans,
seniors, children, and working families, and address urgent needs for
the American people, including communities recovering from disasters.
And while the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has the resources it
currently needs to continue its successful efforts to ensure that the
wealthy and large corporations pay the taxes they owe, my Administration
will oppose any cuts or restrictions that would increase the deficit by
limiting the IRS’s ability to crack down on wealthy tax cheats.
