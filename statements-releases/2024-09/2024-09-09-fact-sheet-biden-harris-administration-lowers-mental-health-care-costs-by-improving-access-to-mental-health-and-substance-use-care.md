title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Lowers Mental Health Care Costs\
  \ by Improving Access to Mental Health and Substance Use\_Care"

*President Biden and Vice President Harris announce historic final rule
that will ensure mental health care coverage for 175 million Americans
is on par with their physical health care coverag*e

President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that health care is a
right, not a privilege, and that mental health care is health care –
period. But for millions of Americans, care for mental health and
substance use conditions is still hard to find and hard to afford.
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking a step toward changing
that, by placing new requirements on health plans that will improve and
strengthen access to mental health care for 175 million Americans with
private health insurance.  
   
*Statement from the President:* “Mental health care is health care. But
for far too many Americans, critical care and treatments are out of
reach. Today, my Administration is taking action to address our nation’s
mental health crisis by ensuring mental health coverage will be covered
at the same level as other health care for Americans. There is no reason
that breaking your arm should be treated differently than having a
mental health condition. The steps my Administration is taking today
will dramatically expand access to mental health care in America.”  
   
*Statement from the Vice President:* “President Biden and I are
committed to ensuring that every person in our country has the mental
health care they need to thrive. That is why we made the largest
investment in youth mental health in history and are transforming how
mental health is understood, perceived, and treated for all Americans.
Today, we are building on this lifesaving and lifechanging work by
announcing the finalization of a historic rule that will expand mental
health care across our nation so more of our loved ones, neighbors,
coworkers, and classmates receive the care they deserve. As someone who
has spent my entire career fighting to improve the health and well-being
of all Americans, I will never stop working to ensure that health care
is a right – not just a privilege for those who can afford it.”  
   
For over 15 years, robust access to mental health care has been a
bipartisan priority. Thanks to the 2008 enactment of the [Mental Health
Parity and Addiction Equity
Act](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Other-Insurance-Protections/mhpaea_factsheet)
(MHPAEA), which was further strengthened in 2020 on a bipartisan basis,
health plans that cover mental health and substance use care benefits
must do so at the same level as physical health care benefits. But
despite this landmark law, too many Americans still struggle to find and
afford the care they need. [In
2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9938503/), less than
half of all adults with mental illness received treatment.  For
children, the numbers are even worse: nearly 70 percent of our kids who
seek care for mental health or substance use cannot get it. That’s in
part because insurers too often make it difficult to access mental
health treatment, causing millions of consumers to have [high
out-of-pocket
costs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8128060/) because
they go out-of-network, or defer care altogether. [One
study](https://dpjh8al9zd3a4.cloudfront.net/publication/behavioral-health-parity-pervasive-disparities-access-network-care-continue/fulltext.pdf)
shows that insured people are nearly four times as likely go
out-of-network and pay higher fees for mental health care than for
physical health care. And the problem is getting worse: in recent years,
the gap between usage of out-of-network care for mental health and
substance use disorder benefits versus physical health benefits
[increased 85
percent](https://assets.milliman.com/ektron/Addiction_and_mental_health_vs_physical_health_Widening_disparities_in_network_use_and_provider_reimbursement.pdf).   
   
Today’s final rule strengthens consumer protections by reinforcing
MHPAEA’s fundamental purpose that all Americans should have the same
access to mental health and substance use benefits as they do physical
health benefits. And it will help lower families’ health care costs by
making it easier to access mental health and substance use care and
getting rid of barriers that keep people from getting the care they
need, when they need it, for a price they can afford.  Specifically, the
final rule will:  

-   **Require health plans to make changes when they are providing
    inadequate access to mental health and substance use care.** In
    2020, Congress made changes to MHPAEA that require health plans to
    conduct meaningful comparative analyses to make sure that they are
    not making it harder for individuals to access mental health and
    substance use benefits than it is to access medical benefits. 
    Today’s new requirements make it clear that health plans need to
    evaluate their provider networks, how much they pay out-of-network
    providers, and how often they require – and deny – prior
    authorizations. The outcomes of these evaluations will show plans
    where they are failing to meet the law’s requirements, and where
    they will need to make changes to come into compliance, like adding
    more mental health and substance use professionals to their networks
    or reducing red tape for providers to deliver care.  
-   **Make it clear what health plans can and cannot do.** Health plans
    cannot use more restrictive prior authorization, or other medical
    management techniques, or narrower networks to make it harder for
    people to access mental health and substance use disorder benefits
    than their medical benefits. Health plans also have to use similar
    factors in setting out-of-network payment rates for mental health
    and substance use disorder providers as they do for medical
    providers.  
-   **Close existing loopholes.** When MHPAEA was first enacted, it did
    not require non-federal governmental health plans, like those
    offered to state and local government employees, to comply with its
    requirements. Today’s final rule closes that loophole, and now
    requires more than 200 additional health plans to comply with
    MHPAEA, providing critical protections to 120,000 consumers. 

Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration, these new requirements will
help more people get the mental health and substance use care they need
while also making sure that mental health and substance use care
professionals are paid fairly, likely incentivizing more people to join
the mental health workforce.  In addition to today’s final rule, the
Department of Health and Human Services is also releasing new tools for
states to ensure compliance with MHPAEA’s critical protections for the
millions of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in private Medicaid health
plans.
