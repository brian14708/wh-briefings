It is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures
safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes. The
exchange of fire since October 7th, and in particular over the past two
weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians. We
therefore have worked together in recent days on a joint call for a
temporary ceasefire to give diplomacy a chance to succeed and avoid
further escalations across the border. The statement we have negotiated
is now endorsed by the United States, Australia, Canada, European Union,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, the
United Kingdom, and Qatar. We call for broad endorsement and for the
immediate support of the Governments of Israel and Lebanon.
