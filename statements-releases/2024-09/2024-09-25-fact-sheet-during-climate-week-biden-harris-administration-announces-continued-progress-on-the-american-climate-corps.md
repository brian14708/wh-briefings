*American Climate Corps Has Already Put 15,000 Young Americans to Work
as Part of Its Inaugural Cohort*

*Environmental Protection Agency and AmeriCorps Announce a New
Environmental Justice Climate Corps; the Department of Housing and Urban
Development Joins the Interagency American Climate Corps Initiative*

Since taking office, President Biden has delivered on the most ambitious
climate, clean energy, conservation, and environmental justice agenda in
history – signing into law the largest investment in climate action
ever, protecting more than 42 million acres of public lands and waters,
creating good-paying clean energy jobs, and establishing the [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
which sets the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits from certain
federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are
marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.

As part of his historic commitment to tackle the climate crisis,
President Biden
[launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-american-climate-corps-to-train-young-people-in-clean-energy-conservation-and-climate-resilience-skills-create-good-paying-jobs-and-tackle-the-clima/#:~:text=The%20American%20Climate%20Corps%20will%20mobilize%20a%20new%2C%20diverse%20generation,advancing%20environmental%20justice%2C%20all%20while)
the [American Climate Corps](http://www.climatecorps.gov/) (ACC) to
mobilize the next generation of clean energy, conservation, and climate
resilience workers, with a goal to put 20,000 young people to work in
the clean energy and climate resilience economy in the initiative’s
first year. **Today, in celebration of Climate Week, the White House is
announcing that more than 15,000 young Americans have been put to work
in high-quality, good-paying clean energy and climate resilience
workforce training and service opportunities through the American
Climate Corps –** putting the program on track to reach President
Biden’s goal of 20,000 members in the program’s first year ahead of
schedule.

Across the country, American Climate Corps members are working on
projects to tackle the climate crisis, including restoring coastal
ecosystems, strengthening urban and rural agriculture, investing in
clean energy and energy efficiency, improving disaster and wildfire
preparedness, and more. The American Climate Corps is giving a diverse
new generation of young people the tools to fight the impacts of climate
change today and the skills to join the clean energy and
climate-resilience workforce of tomorrow.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is making several additional
announcements:

-   **The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and AmeriCorps are
    Announcing a New Environmental Justice Climate Corps,** which will
    put more than 250 American Climate Corps members to work over the
    next three years providing technical assistance to community-based
    organizations in environmental justice communities – helping them
    access resources to carry out locally driven projects that reduce
    pollution, increase community climate resilience, improve public
    health and safety, and build community capacity to address
    environmental and climate justice challenges. Environmental Justice
    Climate Corps members will be paid a living allowance and reimbursed
    for selected living expenses. In total, this allowance is equivalent
    to receiving more than $25 per hour throughout their year of
    service. They will also obtain the
    [benefits](https://americorps.gov/members-volunteers/your-benefits)
    of AmeriCorps VISTA service—including the Segal AmeriCorps Education
    Award, which is valued at $7,395 in FY24, and streamlined pathways
    into certain federal jobs—and gain mentorship and professional
    development opportunities. Applications for the Environmental
    Justice Climate Corps will open in early 2025, with a goal for its
    first cohort to start later that year.The partnership with EPA is
    AmeriCorps’ largest environmental partnership in the agency’s
    history and will build on the success of three other partnerships
    announced under the American Climate Corps: AmeriCorps NCCC [Forest
    Corps](https://americorps.gov/serve/americorps/americorps-nccc/forest-corps),
    [Working Lands Climate
    Corps](https://corpsnetwork.org/programs-initiatives/working-lands-climate-corps/)
    and [Energy Communities
    AmeriCorps](https://americorps.gov/newsroom/press-release/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-americorps-project-spur-economic),
    which together will support more than 500 new ACC positions over the
    coming years.

-   **The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is Joining
    the ACC Interagency Initiative.** Joining the seven initial
    signatories of the December 2023 [ACC Memorandum of
    Understanding](http://www.americorps.gov/accmou), today HUD will
    become the eighth federal agency member of the ACC Interagency
    Initiative. This step brings the ACC to the communities HUD serves,
    building upon the Department’s commitment to using low- and
    zero-carbon energy and supporting communities to increase their
    resilience, advance environmental justice, and create good jobs for
    residents.

-   **The American Climate Corps is Fostering Federal-State Partnerships
    by** establishing a partnership with state service commissions,
    which support national service in states across the country, to grow
    the number of state climate corps and strengthen existing state
    climate corps programs. Together, the American Climate Corps,
    state-level climate corps programs, and state national service
    leadership are committed to strengthening state climate corps,
    supporting impactful program implementation, and leveraging state
    and local partnerships to scale climate corps efforts across the
    country. To date, 14 states have launched their own state-based
    climate corps programs, including New Jersey who just today
    announced the creation of the New Jersey Climate Corps.

-   **American Climate Corps Will Host a Virtual Job Fair.** The
    American Climate Corps is working to ensure that its members have a
    pathway to good-paying jobs following their terms of service, which
    is why later this year, ACC will host a virtual job fair for current
    and past members to learn about high-quality career opportunities in
    the clean energy and climate resilience economy. The virtual job
    fair will bring together the private sector, labor unions, and the
    public sector, including Federal agencies, to showcase career
    pathways available to ACC members.

Today’s announcements build on a year of successful program
implementation, including:

-   **Launch of the American Climate Corps Tour.** This fall, to
    showcase ACC members’ important work across the nation, the American
    Climate Corps and senior Biden-Harris Administration officials is
    embarking on a [national
    tour](https://www.acc.gov/posts/2024-09-12-fall-tour/) and visiting
    ten locations to highlight ACC members’ impact in communities across
    the country.The tour is making stops at a range of ACC project sites
    and featuring remarks by representatives of the Biden-Harris
    Administration and other Federal, state, and local elected
    officials. Visits include ACC member swearing-in ceremonies, service
    projects, and roundtables with ACC members.

<!-- -->

-   **Creation of the American Climate Corps Storytellers Project.**
    Inspired by the [Works Progress Administration’s Federal Art
    Project](https://www.britannica.com/topic/WPA-Federal-Art-Project),
    the ACC launched the Storytellers Project, engaging artists and
    storytellers to capture the impact of President Biden’s American
    Climate Corps.The ACC Storytellers Project solicited applications
    from artists across the country. Ten accomplished storytellers were
    selected to document the impact of the American Climate Corps in
    communities across the country through photographs, videos, and
    other visual art mediums.
