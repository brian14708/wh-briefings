title: "FACT SHEET: Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation\_Ministerial"
---
 
Today, the members of the **Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation**, – or
the Atlantic Partnership – came together and reaffirmed their commitment
to a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Atlantic region and a healthy,
sustainable, and resilient Atlantic Ocean that is a resource for future
generations.  
   
Since its launch, the Atlantic Partnership has grown to **forty-two
members,** representing more than 75 percent of the Atlantic coastline.
Countries from Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and the
Caribbean come together to address shared challenges, promote common
solutions, and advance collective principles. In addition to the 32
original founding members, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Cameroon,
Guinea-Bissau, Panama, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Suriname,
and Trinidad and Tobago have joined the Atlantic Partnership over the
past year.  
  
Members have endorsed a **Declaration on Atlantic Cooperation**
promising engagement on the basis of international law, existing
national and international legal frameworks, mutual collaboration, and
respect for differences in capacity and political perspective, and
acknowledging the special role and primary interest of Atlantic states
in the Atlantic.   
   
At today’s ministerial, the Partnership’s members reaffirmed their
commitment to work together to uphold the guiding principles for
Atlantic cooperation as outlined in the Declaration. These include:

-   A commitment to uphold international law, including the UN Charter,
    to promote an open Atlantic in which Atlantic states are free from
    interference, coercion, or aggressive action;
-   A commitment to uphold the principles of sovereign equality,
    territorial integrity, and political independence of states;
-   Recognition of the special interest and primary role that Atlantic
    states have in the Atlantic.

The Atlantic Partnership has focused on three lines of effort:
**1)Sustainable Blue Economy, 2) Science Capacity Building and
Exchange,** and **3) Ocean-based Food Security**.  
  
**<u>Sustainable Blue Economy</u>**  
  
The blue economy is the sustainable use of Atlantic Ocean resources for
economic growth. The increase in the use of the ocean space, resources,
and services, and their impact on marine biodiversity and ocean
ecosystems, can put the ocean’s benefits at risk. The Declaration and
its accompanying Plan of Action established the objective of advancing
sustainable blue economic development as an overarching Atlantic
Partnership goal. The United States is contributing to the Sustainable
Blue Economy line of effort with the following programs and initiatives:
  

-   **Marine Spatial Planning Technical Assistance** – The Atlantic
    Partnership has established a working group on Marine Spatial
    Planning (MSP), which is co-chaired by Spain, Morocco, and Angola.
    MSP is a process that helps coordinate multiple ocean-related
    industries to use marine resources sustainably. MSP can provide an
    integrated, ecosystem-based framework to allow for sustainable use
    of the marine and coastal environment, maintain biodiversity, and
    ensure alignment of government policies, community needs, and
    economic drivers. The United States is sponsoring MSP capacity
    building via directed technical assistance, local case studies, and
    global best practices.           
-   **Blue Economy/Blue Tech Solutions Public Diplomacy**:  The United
    States is sponsoring a series of Atlantic Partnership Blue
    Economy/Blue Tech Solutions events.  The events will bring the
    private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and technical
    government offices together with U.S. counterparts to develop and
    deploy solutions to environment- and ocean-related challenges with
    the United States as a model.        
-   **Partnering Across the Atlantic on the Blue Economy** – The United
    States is sponsoring technical assistance and capacity building to
    strengthen Atlantic Partnership members’ efforts to grow the blue
    economy. The Atlantic Partnership is strengthening the blue economy
    via support for work on aquaculture, sustainable fisheries, coastal
    planning, coastal resilience, science-based decision making,
    technology and data management, and early career development for
    scientists.       
-   **Support for Ghost Gear Reduction in the Atlantic** – Ghost gear is
    abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear that can wreak havoc on
    marine ecosystems. The United States is working with the Global
    Ghost Gear Initiative and technical experts and local partners in
    West Africa and Central America to identify factors contributing to
    ghost gear in the Atlantic Ocean and potential solutions. In April
    2024, The United States and Canada convened Atlantic Partnership
    members to focus on the problem of abandoned, lost or discarded
    fishing gear (ALDFG) or “ghost gear,” a form of marine plastic
    debris.  Canada, Costa Rica, and Ghana shared response experiences,
    best practices, and challenges, creating a new network of
    pan-Atlantic practitioners addressing the issue.      
-   **Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation Marine and Blue Economy
    “4TheAtlantic” Incubator** – To bolster cooperation among Atlantic
    Cooperation countries in the Gulf of Guinea to address emerging
    oceanic environmental issues, the United States is funding a
    three-day capacity building program designed to help entrepreneurs
    across Atlantic Partnership members to tackle emerging oceanic
    environmental issues such as food security, rising sea levels,
    deteriorating marine life, increased oceanic and surface
    temperatures, unregulated fishing, and marine pollution.   
-   **Ocean-related or “Blue” Technology** – In August 2024, the
    Atlantic Partnership convened technology leaders to introduce new
    and innovative technology solutions to improve the blue economy,
    enhance environmental stewardship, and address challenges posed by
    climate change. These included technologies for ocean mapping,
    hydrography, GIS, ocean observation, robotics and telepresence, and
    vessel monitoring.  
-   **Innovative Financing**: In April 2024, the United States convened
    members and external partners to focus on innovative financing
    solutions for marine conservation. Co-hosted by Pew and the Nature
    Conservancy, the event highlighted opportunities and processes
    associated with debt-for-nature programming and the Belize and
    Gabon’s experiences of with innovative finance to protect their
    marine areas.    

**<u>Science Capacity Building and Exchange</u>**    
    
The Atlantic Ocean is at the heart of the Atlantic Partnership.  Under
the leadership of Brazil, Portugal, and the United States, the
Partnership has created a platform to advance Atlantic Ocean observation
and understanding. The Platform creates a mechanism to bring in
world-class science, connect with ongoing scientific endeavors,
strengthen member participation, and deliver benefits to members. The
United States is contributing to the Science Capacity Building and
Exchange line of effort with the following programs and initiatives:   

-   **Building Ocean Observation and Modeling Capacity** – The United
    States is sponsoring a targeted effort to support diverse,
    equitable, and inclusive all-Atlantic research collaborations with
    facilitated trainings and workshops that respond to Atlantic
    Partnership members’ needs, including building the technical
    capacity and increasing global access to Atlantic Ocean research
    data through increased access to and training on ocean observing
    equipment for under-resourced countries and communities, and will
    collaborate with All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance
    (AAORIA) Partners.   
-   **Atlantic Partnership/AAORIA Ocean Observation and Modeling
    Workshop** – The United States hosted a joint Atlantic
    Partnership/AAORIA workshop on ocean observation and modeling
    capacities in Washington, DC. Collaboration with AAORIA brings
    access to the broader Atlantic Ocean science community, strengthens
    the potential for internal interagency coordination in member
    governments, and further demonstrates the power of the Atlantic
    community.     

**<u>Ocean-Based Food Security</u>**    
  
Food security and food system resilience affect all countries, and some
of the coastal Atlantic states face acute pressures. Over half the
world’s population depends on ocean-derived foods as a vital food
source, underscoring the immense importance of ocean-based food
security. In addition to conflict and political challenges, Atlantic
States face increasing pressures from changing precipitation patterns,
shifting fisheries stocks, and warming oceans, all of which affect food
and nutrition security in real terms.   
  
The United States is contributing to the Food Security of effort with
the following initiative:   

-   **Ocean-based Food Security Solutions Exchange**: The Atlantic
    Partnership “solutions exchange” will focus on sustainable
    aquaculture as a food security solution, highlighting global food
    security as its signature issue for its December 2024 UN Security
    Council Presidency General Debate. Working with the Environmental
    Defense Fund, the United States will bring together government
    officials, private sector leaders, NGO and academic experts,
    philanthropies, and multilateral groups to focus on the nexus
    between food security and the Atlantic Ocean. This exchange will
    highlight the critical importance of the issue of food security,
    particularly the potential for the Atlantic Ocean to support
    sustainable responses.   

**<u>Public Private Partnerships</u>**  
The United States is partnering with the Schmidt Ocean Institute and
with additional philanthropies, academics, private sector, and NGOs to
bring their significant resources and expertise to augment government
efforts, with a particular focus on ocean research and observations and
harness opportunities for early career scientists. 

-   **Partnership with Schmidt Ocean Institute:**  The United States is
    partnering with Schmidt Ocean Institute to leverage its planned work
    in Atlantic Ocean scientific observation, research, and capacity
    building, through the 2025-2029 R/V *Falkor (too)* Atlantic
    Expeditions.  
-   **Cabo Verde Partnership Opportunity Delegation:**  The United
    States will bring a delegation of interested U.S.-based research,
    private sector, and conservation organizations to explore
    opportunities to collaborate with Cabo Verde at the nexus of science
    exchange and sustainable economic development.

States has implemented and continues to advance programs across the
Atlantic on a range of shared challenges:

-   **The End Plastic Pollution International Collaborative (EPPIC)** –
    The United States initiated EPPIC, a new international
    public-private partnership to incentivize investment and solutions
    to end plastic pollution, starting upstream. EPPIC engages partners
    beyond national level governments to take on ambitious commitments
    that reduce demand for plastic and maximize circularity.  
-   **Save Our Seas Initiative** – The United States addresses ocean
    plastic pollution in the northern coast of Dominican Republic
    through its global and bilateral programs. The global Clean Cities,
    Blue Ocean program focuses on supporting an improved solid waste
    management system and remediating opened dump sites in Samana
    Province and preventing waste, including plastic waste entering the
    Samana Bay. The Dominican Republic Solid Waste Reduction Program
    works to reduce waste in municipalities on Puerto Plata, Monte
    Cristi, and Dojabon provinces leading to cleaner oceans, enabling
    communities and economies to thrive and build resilience to climate
    and economic shocks.    
-   **Coastal Resilience, Carbon, and Conservation Finance** – The
    United States [Climate Finance for Development
    Accelerator](https://www.climatelinks.org/projects/cfda) launched
    the Coastal Resilience, Carbon, and Conservation Finance (C3F)
    program to encourage the flow of private capital into coastal
    resilience and blue carbon projects. These projects generate
    biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation, and adaptation
    outcomes while safeguarding local communities’ benefits.  The United
    States is partnering with the Ocean Risk and Resilience Alliance to
    identify and engage stakeholders in Senegal, Guatemala, Dominican
    Republic, Guyana, Suriname, and other countries to build capacity to
    develop bankable, climate-positive projects and address information
    asymmetries between communities and investors – leading to
    investments that safeguard local resources and livelihoods.  
-   **Blue Carbon Inventory Project** – Through the Blue Carbon
    Inventory Project, the United States will continue to provide
    partner countries with technical assistance on the integration of
    coastal wetlands in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and
    maximizing the value of these ecosystems in terms of coastal
    resilience and blue economies. Through an integrated series of
    workshops, engagements and directed bilateral collaboration, the
    Blue Carbon Inventory Project has already collaborated to varying
    degrees with Costa Rica, Ghana, and Senegal and hopes to engage with
    other members of the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation in the
    years to come.  
-   **Atlantic Ocean Marine Microbiome Working Group** – Marine microbes
    play pivotal roles in the environment and climate, the food value
    chain, biodiscovery, and a host of cross-cutting challenges,
    including the need to demonstrate the socio-economic value of marine
    microbiomes and environmental DNA (eDNA). The United States
    co-chairs and provides in-kind contributions to the Atlantic Ocean
    Marine Microbiome Working Group, which focuses on building a network
    of marine microbiome researchers and disseminating knowledge about
    the important role microbiomes play in the functioning of the
    ocean.  
-   **Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) Pole to Pole of the
    Americas** – The United States continues to provide support for MBON
    Pole to Pole, a knowledge sharing network dedicated to the
    collection, use, and sharing of marine biodiversity data in a
    coordinated, standardized manner, leveraging existing infrastructure
    and standards.  
-   **U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030
    (PACC 2030)** – The United States has provided over $100 million in
    new resources to increase access to climate finance, accelerate the
    transition to renewable energy, and build resilience to climate
    change and natural disasters under PACC 2030. PACC 2030 has
    established a network of Caribbean-based scientific experts to

    new opportunities for clean energy infrastructure, and enhanced
    resilient food production systems to feed the region.   
-   **Caribbean Sustainable Ecosystems Activity** – The United States
    Caribbean Sustainable Ecosystems Activity aims to reduce threats to
    coastal-marine biodiversity in the Caribbean while building coastal
    communities’ resilience to climate change. The Sustainable
    Ecosystems Activity harmonizes regional conservation approaches and
    engages the tourism sector to advocate and conserve marine protected
    areas  
-   **Caribbean Biodiversity Program** – Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)
    can help support biodiversity and climate resilience in the face of
    climate change. The Caribbean Biodiversity Program facilitates
    international and regional peer-to-peer exchange between MPAs in
    areas of enforcement, protected area financing, communication,
    outreach, public education, coral reef monitoring, and
    socio-economic monitoring.  
-   ***Sargassum*** **Inundation Embassy Science Fellow** – *Sargassum*
    inundation events occur when rafts of this algae are carried to
    shore by winds and currents. These events are a type of harmful
    algal bloom that can adversely impact coastal ecosystems, tourism,
    and public health. The United States embedded an environmental
    engineer at the University of the West Indies to focus on
    collaborative research to better detect and address *Sargassum*
    influxes in the Caribbean and to support developing a plan for
    identification and response strategies for *Sargassum* inundation
    events in the Eastern Caribbean.   
-   **National Marine Litter Action Plans** – The United States assisted

    to build relationships among regional institutions to share
    approaches and learning to improve conservation of mangroves,
    shellfish, seagrass, and coral reefs.  
-   **Support for fisheries management efforts of the International
    Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)** – The
    United States provides extensive support for ICCAT, which oversees
    the conservation and management of Atlantic tunas, swordfish, marlin
    and sharks, and adopts measures to minimize bycatch of sea turtles,
    seabirds, and other protected species associated with these
    fisheries. This responsibility is shared among ICCAT’s 53 members,
    including a number of members of the Atlantic Partnership.   
-   **Support for the Atlantic Centre Course on “Illegal, Unreported,
    and Unregulated Fishing in the Atlantic”** – The United States
    partners with the Atlantic Centre, a “Multilateral Centre of
    Excellence,” to promote defense capacity-building for the Atlantic,
    including the recent course on “Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated
    Fishing in the Atlantic,” held in the Azores.   
-   **Joint Presentation of the Five-Day Illegal, Unreported, and
    Unregulated Fishing Seminar** – The United States has deployed an
    exportable, internationally-focused seminar to assist partner
    nations (including Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone) to
    develop and strengthen their fisheries enforcement regimes to help
    prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing products from
    entering the global seafood market.
