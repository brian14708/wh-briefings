title: "FACT SHEET: New Report Shows 4.2 Million Entrepreneurs Get Health Insurance\
  \ Through the ACA\_Marketplaces"

*Congressional Republican efforts to repeal the ACA would have a
devastating impact on small businesses across the country*

President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that health care is a
right, not a privilege, and their administration has driven the
uninsured rate to the lowest point in history. New data released today
by the Treasury Department illustrates just how critical those steps
have been to America’s small businesses – and how devastating it would
be if Congressional Republicans succeed in their efforts to repeal the
ACA, roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and
increase American’s health care costs by failing to extend the ACA
premium tax credits that President Biden and Vice President Harris
passed, that are lowering health care costs by hundreds of dollars per
year for millions of Americans. The fact is that millions of small
business owners would lose health insurance if the ACA is repealed.  
   
*Statement from the President:* “Every time someone starts a new small
business, it’s an act of hope and confidence in our economy. Thanks to
my and Vice President Harris’s work to protect and build on the
Affordable Care Act, more Americans have the freedom to start small
businesses and chase their dreams – without having to worry about how
they receive health insurance for their family. As a result, more
Americans – and more small business owners – have signed up for health
care coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace than ever
before. That’s 618,590 small business owners in Florida, 450,010 in
California, 423,790 in Texas, and 168,070 in Georgia who have benefited
from this quality, affordable health coverage. Congressional Republicans
have a different vision and have voted more than 50 times to repeal the
Affordable Care Act. Their agenda would strip millions of small business
owners of their health coverage, gut protections for pre-existing
conditions, and threaten the small business boom seen under my
Administration. Vice President Harris and I won’t let it happen on our
watch.”  
   
*Statement for the Vice President:* “Small business owners and
entrepreneurs are the engine of America’s economy. We are ensuring small
businesses have access to affordable health care so they can focus on
starting and growing businesses, not on whether they can afford health
coverage. I’m proud that over 4 million small business owners and
self-employed workers have coverage through the ACA, up from 3.3 million
in 2022. I will always support small businesses and invest in
entrepreneurs by strengthening and expanding the ACA, and by rejecting
Republican efforts to repeal it.”  
   
The Treasury Department’s report shows that 4.2 million small business
owners and self-employed workers have coverage through the ACA
Marketplaces, up from 3.3 million in 2022 and 1.4 million in 2014.  In
fact, entrepreneurs are about three times as likely as other Americans
to have health insurance in the Marketplace, with nearly 1 in 5 getting
coverage there. The vast majority of these entrepreneurs – 82% in 2022 –
claim the ACA premium tax credit to reduce their cost of coverage by an
average of about $700 each year. The ACA was designed to finally provide
a reliable source of health insurance for people who don’t get coverage
through their jobs – after decades of facing high health care prices or
outright coverage denials based on pre-existing conditions – and this
report makes clear that system is working to support American
entrepreneurship.  
   
Ensuring American small business owners can access affordable health
insurance is yet another example of the many ways that the Biden-Harris
Administration has supported a small business boom.  Since President
Biden took office, Americans have filed more than 19 million new
business applications, the most on record. This small business boom has
been powered by landmark investments in infrastructure, clean energy,
and domestic manufacturing made through the Biden-Harris Investing in
America agenda, expanding access to capital and enabling all-time high
levels of federal contracting with small businesses  
   
**<u>But Congressional Republicans continue their efforts to strip this
progress away.  They have voted more than 50 times to repeal the ACA.
They continue advance proposals that would strip coverage away, and
undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions.</u>**
Millions of America’s small businesses owners and self-employed workers
would find their health insurance disrupted if those plans succeed. And
their plan to end the expansion of the ACA premium tax credits would
raise taxes and heath care costs for millions of small business owners,
including middle-class small business owners. Unlike Congressional
Republicans, President Biden and Vice President Harris have committed to
never raising taxes on households making less than $400,000, and are
fighting to extend the premium tax credit enhancements.

Marketplace coverage in each state in 2022: **
