title: "Statement from National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard on GDP\_Growth"
---
 
We learned this morning that the economy has grown by 3.2% per year
during Biden-Harris Administration—even stronger than previously
estimated—and better than the first three years of the previous
administration. This strong economic growth and unemployment that is the
lowest of any administration in 50 years is coming at a time when
inflation has come back down and interest rates are declining. While we
have more to do to lower costs for families, this progress is thanks to
the President’s work to support families and small businesses—a stark
contrast with Congressional Republicans’ failed approach of tax cuts for
the wealthy and higher costs for middle class families.
