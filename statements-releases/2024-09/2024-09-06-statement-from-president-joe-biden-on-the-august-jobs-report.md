title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the August Jobs\_Report"
---
 
Today’s report showed unemployment fell to 4.2% and another 142,000 jobs
were created last month. Thanks to our work to rescue the economy,
nearly 16 million new jobs have been created, wages and incomes are
rising faster than prices, businesses are investing in America, and
millions of entrepreneurs are opening small businesses—acts of hope and
confidence in our economy. With inflation back down close to normal
levels, it is important to focus on sustaining the historic gains we
have made for American workers.

The Vice President and I are fighting to expand opportunity and grow the
middle class. We will keep working to support American workers and
businesses, and to lower housing and health care costs for hardworking
Americans. The last thing we should do is turn back to the failed
trickle-down economics pushed by Congressional Republicans, like cutting
taxes for the wealthy and large corporations, raising taxes on middle
class families by nearly $4,000 per year, or cutting Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.
