title: "FACT SHEET: UPDATE: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Continued Response\
  \ to Hurricane\_Helene"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration continues to lead a robust Federal
response to help impacted communities in the wake of Hurricane Helene.
The Administration is working around the clock and mobilizing every
resource available to support life-saving response efforts in North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida.  
   
The President and Vice President continue to receive regular briefings
from their teams, including today, and Administration officials remain
in constant communication with state and local officials to ensure they
have the support and resources they need. President Biden has spoken
with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp,
South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, and Asheville Mayor Esther
Manheimer, along with other state and local officials in the impacted
areas to offer further assistance as needed. This afternoon, the
President was briefed by Governor Cooper and FEMA Administrator Deanne
Criswell from the field following surveys of Helene’s impacts across the
State. Vice President Harris also received an in-person briefing at FEMA
today and has been in touch with Governor Cooper, Governor Kemp,
Greenville Mayor Knox White, and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson.  
   
President Biden directed Administrator Criswell to determine what more
can be done to accelerate delivering support to those who are having the
most difficult time accessing assistance in isolated communities. At the
President’s direction, Administrator Criswell has been on the ground to
survey damage and determine any unmet needs, and at the President’s
direction she will remain on the ground in Asheville, North Carolina,
until the situation has stabilized.  
   
On Wednesday, President Biden will travel to North Carolina. He will
also travel to Georgia and Florida as soon as possible.  
   
Additionally, the Federal government is closely monitoring an additional
weather disturbance in the Caribbean Sea that has the potential to form
into another storm in the coming week. Residents throughout the Gulf
Coast should remain alert, listen to local officials, and make
additional preparations as needed.  
   
Additional Administration actions to support ongoing response and
recovery efforts include:  
   
**Supporting On-The-Ground Response Efforts**  
   
As of today, more than 3,500 personnel from across the federal workforce
are deployed and supporting Hurricane Helene response efforts across the
impacted states. This includes the most experienced incident management
teams to help identity Federal resources to address unmet needs, as well
as Urban Search and Rescue personnel using high water rescue equipment
for rescue missions across the region.  
   
Search and rescue efforts by state, local and Federal partners are
ongoing, and hundreds of additional personnel are arriving in the region
in the coming days. Over 1,250 Urban Search and Rescue personnel are
deployed across Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.
Together with local and state responders, teams have rescued or
supported more than 1,900 people, including nearly 900 in North
Carolina.  
   
The Department of Defense has 30 high-water trucks ready to assist
rescuers and 18 helicopters with lift capabilities that can transport
supplies, equipment and assist with search and rescue operations.  
   
**Approving Major Disaster Declarations**  
   
President Biden approved a Major Disaster declaration for South Carolina
yesterday, allowing survivors to immediately access funds and resources
to jumpstart their recovery. This is in addition to approving
declarations for Florida and North Carolina earlier in the weekend.  
   
FEMA assistance in Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina may
include a one-time $750 payment to help with essential items like food,
water, baby formula and other emergency supplies. After registering for
disaster assistance, individuals may also qualify to receive
disaster-related financial assistance to repair storm-related damage to
homes and replace personal property, as well as assistance to find a
temporary place to stay.  
   
Homeowners and renters with damage to their home or personal property
from previous disasters, whether they received FEMA funds or not, are
still eligible to apply for and receive assistance for Hurricane
Helene.  
   
People in 17 counties in Florida, 25 counties in North Carolina and the
Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, as well as 13 counties in South
Carolina can now apply for assistance with FEMA. People can apply in
four ways: online by visiting disasterassistance.gov, calling
1-800-621-3362, on the FEMA App, or via disaster recovery centers.  
   
Emergency declarations were also approved for Florida, North Carolina
Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama. Under an
emergency declaration, FEMA provides direct Federal support to states
for life saving activities and other emergency protective measures, such
as evacuation, sheltering, and search and rescue.  
   
**Restoring Power to Impacted Communities**  
   
At least 50,000 personnel from 34 states and the District of Columbia
and Canada are responding to power outages and working around the clock
throughout parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina
to restore power to those communities that can receive power. The U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers is moving generators and additional power
restoration assets into the hardest hit areas of South and North
Carolina as flood waters recede and debris removal allows. As power is
being restored throughout parts of Florida and Georgia, power crews are
being moved into other states to assist with their restoration efforts.
Mobile Emergency Operations Vehicles are in place to support responder
communication and assist impacted communities. We are working with
private sector partners to augment and restore cellular services in
several states.  
   
In North Carolina, 40 Starlink satellite systems are available to help
with responder communications, and an additional 140 satellites are
being shipped to assist with communications infrastructure restoration.
One Starlink will be deployed per county Emergency Operations Center to
assist with communications.  
   
Power outage numbers are improving as restoration teams gain access to
communities and debris is removed. As of this morning, approximately 2.1
million customers are without power, down more than 54% from the
region-wide peak of 4.6 million on September 27.  
   
**Additional Interagency Support Efforts**  
   
Together with state and local partners, the Federal government is
actively supporting Hurricane Helene response efforts and is
coordinating requests for Federal assistance.

-   FEMA distribution centers are fully stocked and ready to provide
    commodities and equipment to any impacted state, as required.
-   FEMA is sending additional generators, 150 ambulances, trailers full
    of meals and water and 215 additional Search and Rescue personnel to
    North Carolina.
-   Thus far, FEMA has shipped over 1.9 million meals, more than 1
    million liters of water, 30 generators and over 95,000 tarps to
    impacted states.
-   FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance teams are deploying to Florida and
    North Carolina to help survivors register for disaster assistance,
    answer questions and help people jumpstart their recovery.
-   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a Public
    Health Emergency for Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, giving
    health care providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting
    emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
    Medical responders are in affected states along with medical
    equipment and supplies, to help protect the delivery of health care
    services following the landfall of Hurricane Helene.
-   The U.S. Coast Guard crews have saved 19 lives and five pets in the
    response so far, with rescues continuing in North Carolina. They
    have thousands of personnel working on response efforts and are
    providing surface and air rescue assets to support search and rescue
    missions. Personnel continue addressing transportation concerns by
    ensuring ports and waterways are reopened safely.
-   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deployed teams for temporary
    emergency power, debris removal and infrastructure assessment of
    water/wastewater treatment facilities and road/bridges.
-   The Environmental Protection Agency has personnel on the ground who
    are working closely with federal, state, local, and Tribal partners
    to prepare for and safely remove hazardous materials and debris, and
    maintain critical public health and environmental protections in
    place as storm impacts are assessed.
-   The Department of the Interior’s U.S. Geological Survey activated
    its Landslide Team to help with assessments in the impacted areas.
-   The U.S. Small Business Administration deployed more than 50
    personnel to support people and small businesses as they recover
    from the hurricane.
-   The U.S. Department of Energy has responders deployed to the
    Emergency Operations Centers in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina
    and is closely monitoring impacts and working to advance restoration
    efforts, including power, fuel and supply chain interruptions.
-   The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has offices in virtually
    every county with personnel who stand ready to provide technical
    assistance, disaster programs, and emergency credit to farmers and
    agriculture producers who lost crops and livestock. USDA has
    deployed 132 emergency support staff to assist FEMA at their
    Regional Response Coordination Center in Atlanta and their National
    Response Coordination Center in Washington. USDA has also approved
    Florida’s request for waivers for food assistance programs to
    Florida and is standing by to render additional flexibilities and
    assistance as requested by the states. In addition, USDA is working
    to locate those with housing impacts related to Hurricane Helene and
    connect them with housing assistance and is prepared to assist with
    infrastructure assistance.
