title: "Statement from Office of Gun Violence Prevention Director Stef Feldman on\
  \ Shooting in\_Birmingham"
---
 
Last night, several people were killed and many more wounded in downtown
Birmingham, Alabama. And once again, our entire nation is watching in
horror as another community is devasted by the national epidemic of gun
violence. President Biden and Vice President Harris join Americans
across the nation in praying for the families affected by this senseless
violence. At the direction of the President, the White House is
coordinating with Federal, state, and local officials as investigations
are underway.  

Americans should not have to live like this. And we can’t let it become
normal. This year alone there have been more than 400 mass shootings
which have traumatized Americans and torn communities apart. As
President Biden often says: Enough is enough.  
  
One year ago today, President Biden took the historic step of
establishing the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris, to reduce gun violence
ravaging communities across the country. The office builds on historic
action taken by the President and Vice President to save lives,
including signing into law the most significant legislation to combat
gun violence in 30 years. President Biden and Vice President Harris have
also made historic investments in community violence interventions and
taken action to stop the illegal flow of guns into our communities. But
we know it is not enough. That’s why President Biden and Vice President
Harris will continue to call on Congress to act, including by banning
assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and requiring background
checks for all gun sales. Americans deserve nothing less.
