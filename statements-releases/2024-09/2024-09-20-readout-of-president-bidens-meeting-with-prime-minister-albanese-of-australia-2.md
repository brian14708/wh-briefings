President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of
Australia today in Wilmington, Delaware. The President thanked the Prime
Minister for his partnership and highlighted the progress made in
strengthening bilateral ties since the Prime Minister’s Official Visit
to Washington, D.C., last October.   
   
The leaders underscored that the U.S.-Australia Alliance remains the
core of the bilateral relationship, and welcomed the depth of
cooperation across its three pillars: defense and security, economic,
and climate and clean energy. The leaders noted the recent
Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) Joint Leaders Statement
reaffirming their shared commitment to advance this historic trilateral
partnership and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and
stable.   
   
The leaders reflected on the strength of the economic relationship and
discussed progress over the past two years to modernize the Alliance in
the face of new challenges, including addressing climate change and the
clean energy transition. They also reaffirmed their commitment to expand
cooperation to build more diverse and resilient critical minerals supply
chains and accelerate the transition to clean energy in accordance with
the “Compact” they signed in Hiroshima, Japan, in May 2023.  
   
The two leaders also discussed their support for maintaining peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait, their continued assistance to Ukraine as
it defends itself against Russia’s brutal aggression, and their support
for a sustainable ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid to the people
of Gaza. The leaders discussed their respective diplomacy with the
People’s Republic of China (PRC) and their shared concerns about the
PRC’s coercive and destabilizing activities, including in the South
China Sea. The President welcomed Australia’s contributions to the Quad,
its growing partnership with Japan, and its active engagement in the
Pacific region, where the United States intends to provide $1.5 million
to support the World Bank’s efforts to strengthen correspondent banking
relationships in Pacific Island countries.     
   
The leaders committed to continue deepening the bilateral partnership to
advance their shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.
