title: "Readout of 2024 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI)\
  \ Investor\_Forum"

On September 25, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan hosted a
Partnership on Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) Investor Forum
on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly. He was joined by Deputy
Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo, Senior Advisor to the President
for Energy and Investment Amos Hochstein, and World Bank President Ajay
Banga, along with ten private sector leaders representing asset
managers, debt and equity providers, and infrastructure operators.
Collectively, the group represented institutions with trillions of
dollars of assets under management and a diversity of financing options
to power the most efficient development of sustainable infrastructure in
key sectors across the globe.  
   
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan opened the discussion by
reaffirming PGI’s importance to America’s national and economic security
objectives; highlighting projects in the Indo-Pacific, South America,
and Africa that PGI has made possible; and thanking private sector
leaders for their partnership in catalyzing $60 billion for
infrastructure investments in low- and middle income countries since
PGI’s launch.  
   
The group then discussed a range of opportunities to continue
public-private collaboration, including:

-   Focusing efforts on a subset of specific countries and sectors where
    public tools and private capital can drive outsized impact,
    particularly in climate and digital infrastructure investments
    (e.g., subsea cables, data centers);
-   Continuing to simplify and streamline access to public capital and
    the use of bilateral and multilateral risk mitigation tools, such as
    through the recently launched World Bank Group’s Streamlined
    Guarantee Platform and by scaling up FX risk mitigation tools;
-   Empowering the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation
    (DFC) to more effectively deploy public capital in infrastructure
    investments;
-   Scaling project development initiatives that are being piloted in
    the Indo-Pacific; and
-   Continuing to improve the integration of U.S. small and medium-sized
    exporters into PGI infrastructure investments and projects.

As announced by President Biden at the 2023 G7 Summit in Hiroshima, the
PGI Investor Forum aims to further strengthen partnership with the
private sector in order to realize U.S. PGI’s collective goal of
mobilizing $200 billion by 2027 for sustainable, global infrastructure
investments.
