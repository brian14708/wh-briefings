title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Thomas\_Bell"
---
 
Scranton, Pennsylvania is a place that climbs into your heart and never
leaves. It’s home. It’s that special place etched in your heart.  
  
I was born there. Even after my family moved to Claymont, Delaware as my
dad found work, we’d return to our old Green Ridge neighborhood in
Scranton and spend time with our friends, Charlie Roth, Larry Orr, and
Tommy Bell.  
  
Tommy and I lived three blocks apart. We sat next to each other during
grade school at St. Paul’s. From swinging on branches to running by the
river, Tommy was the friend with the special heart, who would always
lighten your heart. Over the next 70 years, he was the best friend at
weddings, funerals, campaign rallies, and so many memories. You could
always count on Tommy, and I hope he knew he could always count of me.  
  
Tommy became an insurance agent. He served in the National Guard. He and
his of wife of 51 years, Ellen, raised their four children in Scranton.
They became my family.  
  
In building their great American life, Tommy took genuine pride in the
success of his family, community, and our nation. He returned love with
boundless loyalty. He was a man of honor, decency, and grace. A man of
utmost character.  
  
Tommy embodied a simple truth about our nation. There is nothing
ordinary about being an American. We are extraordinary. Tommy was
extraordinary.  
  
It’s as if William Butler Yeats had Tommy in mind when he wrote, “*Think
where man’s glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such
friends*.”  
  
Tommy Bell was such a friend. I will miss him dearly. Jill and I and our
entire family send our prayers to Ellen, their children and
grandchildren, and the entire Bell family.  
  
May God bless Tommy Bell, a great American, and a good man.
