I have been briefed by my team regarding what federal law enforcement is
investigating as a possible assassination attempt of former President
Trump today. A suspect is in custody, and I commend the work of the
Secret Service and their law enforcement partners for their vigilance
and their efforts to keep the former President and those around him
safe. I am relieved that the former President is unharmed. There is an
active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more
details about what happened. As I have said many times, there is no
place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country,
and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service
has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to
ensure the former Presidentâ€™s continued safety.
