title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on U.S. Support for\_Ukraine"
---
 
I am proud to welcome President Zelenskyy back to the White
House today. For nearly three years, the United States has rallied the
world to stand with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom
from Russian aggression, and it has been a top priority of my
Administration to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to
prevail. In that time, Ukraine has won the battle of Kyiv, reclaimed
more than half the territory that Russia seized at the start of the war,
and safeguarded its sovereignty and independence. But there is more work
to do. That is why, today, I am announcing a surge in security
assistance for Ukraine and a series of additional actions to help
Ukraine win this war. 

Today, I am announcing that: 

-   I have directed the Department of Defense to allocate all of its
    remaining security assistance funding that has been appropriated for
    Ukraine by the end of my term in office. As part of this effort, the
    Department of Defense will allocate the remaining Ukraine Security
    Assistance Initiative funds by the end of this year. I also have
    authorized $5.5 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority to ensure
    this authority does not expire, so that my Administration can fully
    utilize the funding appropriated by Congress to support
    the drawdown of U.S. equipment for Ukraine and then replenish U.S.
    stockpiles.
-   The Department of Defense is announcing $2.4 billion in security
    assistance through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which
    will provide Ukraine with additional air defense, Unmanned Aerial
    Systems, and air-to-ground munitions, as well as strengthen
    Ukraine’s defense industrial base and support its maintenance and
    sustainment requirements.
-   To enhance Ukraine’s long-range strike capabilities, I have decided
    to provide Ukraine with the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) long-range
    munition.
-   To further strengthen Ukraine’s air defenses, I have directed the
    Department of Defense to refurbish and provide Ukraine with an
    additional Patriot air defense battery and to provide Ukraine with
    additional Patriot missiles. This builds on my decision earlier this
    year to divert U.S. air defense exports to Ukraine, which will
    provide Ukraine with hundreds of additional Patriot and AMRAAM
    missiles over the next year and will help Ukraine defend its cities
    and its people. 
-   To build the capacity of Ukraine’s air force, I have directed the
    Department of Defense to expand training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots,
    including by supporting the training of an additional 18 pilots next
    year.
-   To counter Russian sanctions evasion and money laundering, the
    Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, and the U.S.
    Secret Service have taken action today to disrupt
    a global cryptocurrency network, in coordination with international
    partners. The United States will continue to raise the costs on
    Russia for its war in Ukraine and to deprive the Russian defense
    industrial base of resources.
-   I will convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact
    Group in Germany next month to coordinate the efforts of the more
    than 50 countries supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian
    aggression.

Through these actions, my message is clear: The United States will
provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win this war.
