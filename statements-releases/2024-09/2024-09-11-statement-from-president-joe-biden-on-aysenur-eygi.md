title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Aysenur\_Eygi"
---
 
I am outraged and deeply saddened by the death of Aysenur Eygi. Aysenur
was a recent U.S. college graduate. She was also an activist
whose idealism led her to travel to the West Bank to peacefully protest
the expansion of settlements. The shooting that led to her death is
totally unacceptable. 

Israel has acknowledged its responsibility for Aysenur’s death, and a
preliminary investigation has indicated that it was the result of a
tragic error resulting from an unnecessary escalation. The U.S.
government has had full access to Israel’s preliminary investigation,
and expects continued access as the investigation continues, so that we
can have confidence in the result. We will continue to stay in close
contact with Israeli and Palestinian authorities regarding the
circumstances that led to Aysenur’sdeath. 

There must be full accountability. And Israel must do more to ensure
that incidents like this never happen again. 

The violence in the West Bank has been going on for too long. Violent
extremist Israeli settlers are uprooting Palestinians from their homes. 
Palestinian terrorists are sending car bombs to kill civilians.  I will
continue to support policies that hold all extremists – Israelis and
Palestinians alike – accountable for stoking violence and serving as
obstacles to peace.
