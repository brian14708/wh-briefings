title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on Hurricane\_Helene"
---
 
My heart goes out to everyone impacted by the devastation unleashed by
Hurricane Helene. Doug and I are thinking of those who tragically lost
their lives and we are keeping all those who loved them in our prayers
during the difficult days ahead.  
  
President Biden and I remain committed to ensuring that no community or
state has to respond to this disaster alone. Federal personnel are on
the ground to support families that have been impacted so that critical
resources like food, water, and generators are available. We have also
approved emergency declarations for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee – making resources and funding
available to maximize our coordinated response efforts at the local,
state, and federal levels.  
   
As we continue to respond and as communities recover, our administration
will remain in constant contact with state and local officials. I have
been briefed by FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and will continue to
receive regular updates.
