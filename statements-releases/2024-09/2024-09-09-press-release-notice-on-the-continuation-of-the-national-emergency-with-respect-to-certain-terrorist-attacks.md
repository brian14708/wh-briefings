title: "Press Release: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect\
  \ to Certain Terrorist\_Attacks"
---
 
Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50
U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency
previously declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, with
respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the
continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United
States.  
Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency declared
on September 14, 2001, and the powers and authorities adopted to deal
with that emergency must continue in effect beyond September 14, 2024. 
Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national
emergency that was declared on September 14, 2001, with respect to the
terrorist threat.   
This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
September 9, 2024.
