title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Record Declines in\_Crime"
---
 
When Vice President Harris and I took office, our nation had just seen
the highest increase in murders ever recorded under the previous
Administration. Immediately, we got to work – passing the American
Rescue Plan that led to the largest ever federal investment in public
safety. Today, new data submitted to the FBI confirms again that
Americans are safer than when we took office. In 2023, according to the
data, our nation saw the largest ever one-year decrease in the homicide
rate, which is now 16% below its level in 2020. Violent crime also
declined again and is at a near 50-year low. In 2024, this progress is
continuing, with notable decreases in crime.

None of this happened by accident. Vice President Harris and I invested
in public safety and took action to stop the illegal flow of guns into
our communities. Our American Rescue Plan – which every Republican in
Congress voted against – helped deliver over $15 billion in public
safety funding that enabled over 1,000 state, city, and county
governments to avoid cuts to police budgets, invest in community
violence interventions, and take other essential steps to keep
communities safe. I took more executive action on guns than any other
President and signed the most significant gun violence legislation in
nearly 30 years, which is keeping guns out of dangerous hands by
expanding background checks and cracking down on gun traffickers. I
established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
Prevention, which is overseen by Vice President Harris, and is making
incredible progress in just its first year.

We’re not stopping now. The only way to continue this progress is by
investing in what works. That’s why I will continue to urge Congress to
fund 100,000 additional police officers and a strong ATF, invest in
community violence intervention programs, and make commonsense gun
safety reforms, including a ban on assault weapons.
