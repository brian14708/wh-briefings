  \ Insurance Coverage\_Reports"

Today’s reports show we are making real progress growing the middle
class, with incomes up more than $3,000 last year and up since Vice
President Harris and I took office, accounting for inflation. In
addition, health insurance coverage reached record highs under our
Administration thanks to our work to build on the Affordable Care Act
and lower health care costs.

Let’s be clear: we must do more to lower poverty by restoring the
expanded Child Tax Credit that cut child poverty nearly in half in 2021
and passing our plan to build millions of homes and make rent more
affordable—policies Congressional Republicans have repeatedly
blocked. While Congressional Republicans try to drag us backward by
imposing a sales tax of nearly $4,000 per year on middle class families
while cutting taxes for billionaires, the Vice President and I will keep
fighting to lower poverty and build up the middle class by lowering
taxes on families.
