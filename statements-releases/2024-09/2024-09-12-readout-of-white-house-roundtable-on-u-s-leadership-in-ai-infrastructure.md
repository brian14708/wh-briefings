title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable on U.S. Leadership in AI Infrastructure"
---
 
Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive
strategy for responsible innovation, the White House convened leaders
from hyperscalers, artificial intelligence (AI) companies, datacenter
operators, and utility companies to discuss steps to ensure the United
States continues to lead the world in AI. Participants considered
strategies to meet clean energy, permitting, and workforce requirements
for developing large-scale AI datacenters and power infrastructure
needed for advanced AI operations in the United States.  
   
At the roundtable, White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, White House
Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed, National Economic Advisor Lael
Brainard, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, National Climate
Advisor Ali Zaidi, Senior Advisor to the President for International
Climate Policy John Podesta, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm,
Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and industry leaders committed to
partnering closely to maintain American leadership in AI that will
achieve shared national security, economic, and environmental goals.
Developing and operating leading AI in the United States is vital for
protecting national security and ensuring that AI systems are safe,
secure, and trustworthy. Participants also discussed ways to create good
paying jobs for workers, including roles for pipefitters and electrical
workers, and keep energy costs low for consumers. The United States is
the global leader in AI, and we are taking action to ensure future AI
infrastructure creates jobs for American workers, and is built in the
United States and powered by clean energy.  
   
To accelerate public-private collaboration in advancing U.S. leadership
in AI, the Administration is announcing several new actions following
today’s convening:  
 

-   **The White House is launching a new Task Force on AI Datacenter
    Infrastructure to coordinate policy across government.** Led by the
    National Economic Council, National Security Council, and the White
    House Deputy Chief of Staff’s office, the interagency Task Force
    will provide streamlined coordination on policies to advance
    datacenter development operations in line with economic, national
    security, and environmental goals. The Task Force will work with AI
    infrastructure leaders to identify opportunities and work with
    agencies to ensure adequate resourcing, designate agency single
    points of contact, and properly prioritize AI datacenter development
    to reflect the importance of these projects to American national
    security and economic interests. Finally, the Task Force will build
    on recent work to identify existing authorities and areas where
    legislative action is needed to modify or strengthen federal
    authorities to support AI datacenter development.  
-   **The Administration will scale up technical assistance to Federal,
    state, and local authorities handling datacenter permitting.** The
    Permitting Council will work with AI datacenter developers to set
    comprehensive timelines for Federal agency action and will allocate
    funds to agencies that accelerate evaluations for FAST-41 covered
    clean energy projects that support datacenters.  
-   **The Department of Energy (DOE) is creating an AI datacenter
    engagement team** to leverage programs to support AI data center
    development. DOE has curated a suite of
    [resources](https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/clean-energy-resources-meet-data-center-electricity-demand)
    – including loans, grants, tax credits, and technical assistance –
    that can help datacenter owners and operators secure clean, reliable
    energy solutions. DOE is also planning a series of convenings with
    datacenter developers, clean energy solutions providers, grid
    operators, and other stakeholders to drive development of innovative
    solutions.  
-   **The Department of Energy will continue to share resources on
    repurposing closed coal sites with datacenter developers.** Retired
    and retiring coal sites provide a unique
    [opportunity](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/coal-redevelopment) for
    redevelopment of [energy infrastructure that can power new data
    centers](https://eta-publications.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/repurposing_coal_assets_121123_final.pdf).
    Existing land and facilities at the power plant site can be
    repurposed, such as electricity infrastructure for connections to
    the grid. Combining site features [with financial
    incentives](https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/new-report-redevelopment-and-reinvestment-opportunities-fossil-energy-communities?__hstc=249664665.1261eb8eb6dab7abfd9cd5a0dd5ea8ac.1687921215003.1726078031256.1726083934215.99&__hssc=249664665.1.1726083934215&__hsfp=2620334963)
    available from Federal or state and local authorities can make
    attractive opportunities for project developers.  
-   **The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) will identify Nationwide
    Permits that can help expedite the construction of eligible AI
    datacenters** and share that information with AI datacenter
    developers to expedite critical projects.  
-   **Industry leaders at today’s convening committed to enhance
    cooperation with policy makers and explore further solutions,**
    through ongoing dialogue and collaboration.  
-   **Hyperscalers at today’s convening reaffirmed their commitments to
    achieving net zero carbon emissions and to procuring clean energy to
    power their operations**.

   
Each of these steps advances significant work already undertaken by the
Biden-Harris Administration to ensure the United States leads the way in
responsible AI innovation and development, including through President
Biden’s landmark [2023 Executive Order on
AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/).
These actions will enable datacenters catalyzing the industries of the
future to be built here in the United States by American workers.
