title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Russian Attack on Poltava,\_Ukraine"
---
 
Earlier today, Russian missiles struck a military training facility and
a hospital in Ukraine—killing more than 50 people and injuring dozens
more. I condemn this deplorable attack in the strongest possible terms.

This assault is a tragic reminder of Putin’s ongoing and outrageous
attempts to break the will of a free people. But for two and a half
years, the people of Ukraine have stood unbowed. And the United States
will continue stand with them—including providing the air defense
systems and capabilities they need to protect their country. 

Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this war. The people of
Ukraine will prevail. And on this tragic day, and every day, the United
States stands with them.
