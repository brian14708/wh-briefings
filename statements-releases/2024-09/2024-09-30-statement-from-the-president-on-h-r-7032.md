title: "Statement from the President on H.R.\_7032"
---
 
Today, I have signed into law H.R. 7032, the “Congressional Budget
Office Data Sharing Act” (the “Act”).  The Act amends the current
provision authorizing the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) to secure information from the Executive Branch to provide that
agencies shall furnish necessary information to the Director “(with or
without written agreement) provided that the Director maintains the
level of confidentiality required by law of the department, agency,
establishment, or regulatory agency or commission from which it is
obtained.”  I understand that this amendment to the statutory framework
governing the provision of information to the CBO does not alter the
established and constitutionally grounded accommodation process between
the Congress and the Executive Branch, whereby the Executive Branch
seeks to comply with laws that require the disclosure of information to
agents of the Congress in a manner that both satisfies congressional
needs and is also consistent with the need to safeguard classified,
potentially privileged, and other sensitive information implicating
Executive Branch interests.  Moreover, this amendment does not alter
agencies’ ability to negotiate written agreements with the CBO governing
disclosures of information as part of that accommodation process.  It is
on this understanding, which I believe that the Congress shares,
that I have signed this bill into law.
