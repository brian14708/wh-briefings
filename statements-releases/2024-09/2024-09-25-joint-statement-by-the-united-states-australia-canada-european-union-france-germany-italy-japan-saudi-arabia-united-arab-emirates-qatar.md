The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023 is
intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional
escalation. This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of
Israel nor of the people of Lebanon.  

It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on
both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety.

Diplomacy however cannot succeed amid an escalation of this conflict.  

Thus we call for an immediate 21 day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel
border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a
diplomatic settlement consistent with UNSCR 1701, and the implementation
of UNSCR 2735 regarding a ceasefire in Gaza

We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon,
to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately consistent with UNSCR
1701 during this period, and to give a real chance to a diplomatic
settlement.  

We are then prepared to fully support all diplomatic efforts to conclude
an agreement between Lebanon and Israel within this period, building on
efforts over the last months, that ends this crisis altogether.
