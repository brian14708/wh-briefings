title: "Fact Sheet: Quad Countries Launch Cancer Moonshot Initiative to Reduce the\
  \ Burden of Cancer in the\_Indo-Pacific"
---
 
  
Today, the United States, Australia, India, and Japan are launching a
groundbreaking effort to help end cancer as we know it in the
Indo-Pacific, starting with cervical cancer, a largely preventable
disease that continues to be a major health crisis in the region, and
laying the groundwork to address other forms of cancer as well. This
initiative is part of a broader set of announcements made at the [Quad
Leaders
Summit.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/21/the-wilmington-declaration-joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-australia-india-japan-and-the-united-states/)  
  
The Quad Cancer Moonshot will serve to strengthen the overall cancer
care ecosystem in the Indo-Pacific by improving health infrastructure,
expanding research collaborations, building data systems, and providing
greater support for cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and care.  
   
Cervical cancer, while preventable through vaccination and usually
treatable if detected early, remains the third leading cause of cancer
deaths among women in the Indo-Pacific region. Fewer than one in 10
women in the Indo-Pacific have completed their human papillomavirus
(HPV) vaccination series, and fewer than 10% have undergone recent
screening. Many countries in the region face challenges related to
healthcare access, limited resources, and disparities in vaccination
rates. Through this initiative, Quad countries will work to address
these gaps by promoting HPV vaccination, increasing access to
screenings, and expanding treatment options and care in underserved
areas.  
  
  
Altogether, our scientific experts assess that the Quad Cancer Moonshot
will save hundreds of thousands of lives over the coming decades.  
   
These steps build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s steadfast
commitment to ending cancer as we know it. More than two years ago,
President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden reignited the [Cancer
Moonshot](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cancermoonshot/#about-us-2) with
the goals of reducing the cancer death rate in the United States by at
least half—preventing more than 4 million cancer deaths—by 2047, and
improving the experience of people who are touched by cancer.  
  
Cancer is a global challenge that requires collective action and
cooperation beyond any single nation’s effort. By working together, the
Quad aims to implement innovative strategies to prevent, detect, treat
and alleviate the impact of cancer on patients and their families.  Quad
partners also intend to work, within respective national contexts, to
collaborate in advancing research and development in the area of cancer
and to increase private sector and non-governmental sector activities in
support of reducing the burden of cervical cancer in the region. Today
Quad countries are pleased to announce the following ambitious
commitments from our governments and non-government contributors:  
   
   
**QUAD COUNTRIES**  

-   Quad countries intend to continue their strong commitments to Gavi
    including with HPV vaccines in the Indo-Pacific, with the United
    States making an early pledge of at least $1.58 billion over five
    years.

    future vaccine distribution. CDC will also contribute to broader
    cancer control efforts by supporting cancer control plan development
    to strengthen the overall cancer care ecosystem in the region.
-   **CDC intends to provide technical assistance and disseminate best
    practices informed by pilot cervical cancer screening studies in the
    U.S. Pacific territories and freely associated states, as well as
    continuing to support CDC-funded national cancer control programs in
    U.S. Pacific Island Jurisdictions (PIJs).** These efforts will
    involve sharing evidence-based strategies to improve early detection
    of cervical cancer. In addition, CDC intends to disseminate an
    implementation guide that can assist PIJ efforts to improve their
    screening capacity and encourage partnerships to promote cervical
    cancer screening, including guidance on how to build medical and
    laboratory capacity to conduct primary HPV testing and follow-up
    tests, and improve data systems to monitor screening to enhance
    cancer prevention and care infrastructure.
-   **The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) will

    cervical cancer across the Indo-Pacific and beyond.
-   **The State Department, through Global Health Security and Diplomacy
    (GHSD)-President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), will
    share best practices on the rapid scale-up of cervical cancer
    screening and treatment efforts among people living with HIV,
    including commodity procurement and health system strengthening in
    low-and-middle-income countries.** This collaboration will enhance
    the integration of cervical cancer screening into existing HIV
    treatment programs, increasing access to life-saving interventions.
    It will also focus on improving supply chains for essential medical
    supplies needed for screening and treatment.

**Australia**

-   **Through Australian Government and philanthropic contributions,
    total funding commitments to the Elimination Partnership in the
    Indo-Pacific for Cervical Cancer (EPICC)** consortium will expand to
    **AUD $29.6 million**. EPICC is a new program that builds on decades
    of research and clinician leadership to advance the elimination of
    cervical cancer across the Indo-Pacific by improving HPV-related
    policies, planning and readiness in any country in the region. EPICC
    is piloting HPV programs for future scale-up in Timor-Leste and
    Solomon Islands, expanding sub-national vaccination programs to
    support country readiness in Malaysia, Fiji and Papua New Guinea,
    and supporting the establishment of national sustained HPV
    elimination programs in Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Nauru. EPICC works
    across six priority areas to eliminate cervical cancer, including
    strengthening primary prevention through HPV vaccination support,
    secondary prevention of cervical cancer through HPV screening and
    treatment for pre-cancer, laboratory strengthening for cervical
    cancer screening and diagnosis, digital health work to generate data
    for decision making and strengthened models of care, supporting
    cervical cancer management (across both treatment and palliative
    care), and policy and modelling support across all pillars of the
    cervical cancer elimination pathway.
-   **With a total Australian Government commitment of AUD 16.5 million
    \[$11 million\], the expanded EPICC project will extend its reach to
    more women in the Indo-Pacific.** It will also support partner
    organizations in the region working on cervical cancer elimination
    to participate in the next Global Forum on Cervical Cancer
    Elimination, which will have a strong Indo-Pacific focus.
-   **Through their charity Minderoo Foundation, Dr. Andrew Forrest AO
    and Nicola Forrest AO are expanding a lifesaving contribution to
    EPICC with a further AUD13.1 million \[$8.81 million\]**. This
    additional funding will see EPICC expanded to up to 11 countries in
    the region and brings Minderoo’s total commitment to AUD21.7
    million. The expanded program will see 140,000 women in the Pacific
    region screened over the next 4 years, as well as the establishment
    of national elimination programs and the empowerment of governments
    to sustain the program for future generations of women and girls.
