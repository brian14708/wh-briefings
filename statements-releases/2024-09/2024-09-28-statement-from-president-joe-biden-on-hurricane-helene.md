title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Hurricane\_Helene"
---
 
I am deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation caused by
Hurricane Helene across the Southeast. As the storm continues to track
north, Vice President Harris and I remain focused on life-saving and
life-sustaining response and recovery efforts. I am being regularly
briefed by my team on the ongoing response efforts, and my
Administration is in constant contact with state and local officials to
ensure communities have the support and resources they need. At my
direction, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell is traveling throughout
the Southeast to assess the damage alongside other state and local
officials.

The road to recovery will be long, but know that my Administration will
be with you every step of the way. We’re not going to walk away. We’re
not going to give up. As we turn toward recovery efforts, we will make
certain that no resource is spared to ensure that families, businesses,
schools, hospitals, and entire communities can quickly begin their road
to rebuilding. Jill and I are praying for those who lost loved ones from
Hurricane Helene, and for those whose homes, businesses, and communities
were impacted by this terrible storm.
