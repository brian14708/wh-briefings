title: "Readout of White\_House, Department of Agriculture, and Environmental Protection\
  \ Agency Roundtable on Financing Climate Smart\_Agriculture"
---
 
Today, the White House, Department of Agriculture, and Environmental
Protection Agency convened a roundtable with key stakeholders from the
farm credit and finance community to discuss how the Biden-Harris
Administration can leverage its historic investments in climate smart
agriculture to reduce emissions and store carbon at scale, while opening
up new revenue streams for producers.

America’s farmers, ranchers, and foresters play critical role in our
fight against climate change through the implementation of climate smart
agriculture practices. The Administration has sought to accelerate the
expansion of climate smart agricultural practices through the *Investing
in America* agenda by investing in innovative and science-based
financial assistance, local technical support, and understanding the
business case for climate smart agriculture and forestry.

Participants discussed opportunities to reduce barriers to adoption of
climate smart agricultural practices, as these tools must work for
operations of all sizes and ensure equity in delivery. Administration
officials and participants agreed that to address the climate crisis and
build stronger rural economies, solutions should continue to be locally
led, science based, and encourage innovation. The discussion also
highlighted the role of efforts to improve outreach and education as
well as financial and environmental measurement, verification, and
reporting. Administration officials sought feedback on implementation of
investments, efforts to scale up climate smart agriculture, and
opportunities for stacking and aligning incentives.

The discussion emphasized the impact of historic investments from
President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and the importance of improved
financing of agricultural practices, technologies, and systems that are
part of the climate solution. Participants highlighted the need for
aligned and patient capital to support the adoption of climate smart
agricultural practices; and, discussed approaches to standardization and
scaling of finance solutions. Administration officials closed the
roundtable by underscoring the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment
to investing in farmers, ranchers, and forester and advancing climate
smart solutions through a whole of society approach to tackling the
climate crisis.
