title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Aysenur\_Eygi"
---
 
The killing of Aysenur Eygi is a horrific tragedy that never should have
happened. Doug and I are keeping her family and loved ones in our
prayers. Aysenur was peacefully protesting in the West Bank—standing up
against the expansion of settlements—when her young life was senselessly
cut short. No one should be killed for participating in a peaceful
protest. The shooting that led to her death is unacceptable and raises
legitimate questions about the conduct of IDF personnel in the West
Bank.  Israel must do more to ensure that incidents like this never
happen again.  
   
Israel’s preliminary investigation indicated it was the result of a
tragic error for which the IDF is responsible. We will continue to press
the government of Israel for answers and for continued access to the
findings of the investigation so we can have confidence in the results.
There must be full accountability.  
   
The United States will continue to hold accountable anyone in the West
Bank – Israelis and Palestinians – who stokes violence and undermines
peace and stability.
