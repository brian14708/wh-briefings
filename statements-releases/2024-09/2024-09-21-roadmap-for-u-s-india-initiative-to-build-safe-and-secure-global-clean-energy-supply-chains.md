title: "Roadmap For U.S.-India Initiative to Build Safe and Secure Global Clean Energy\
  \ Supply\_Chains"
---
 
The United States and India share an enduring commitment to deepen our
collaboration on issues of shared national and economic security. As an
important aspect of our economic growth agendas, we are committed to
working together to capture the benefits of the clean energy transition,
including the creation of high-quality jobs for our populations,
acceleration of clean energy deployment globally, and achievement of
global climate goals.  
  
In support of these objectives, the **United States and India intend to
elevate and expand bilateral technical, financial, and policy support to
expand complementary U.S. and Indian manufacturing capacity for clean
energy technologies and components** and lay the groundwork for enhanced
cooperation in third countries, with a focus on partnerships in Africa.
This effort will build on existing clean energy cooperation between the
United States and India, including clean energy initiatives launched
during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the United States in 2023, the
Strategic Clean Energy Partnership led by the U.S. Department of Energy
and Government of India ministries, technical assistance provided by
U.S. laboratories, and novel financial platforms such as the Payment
Security Mechanism established to support the rapid deployment of
electric buses in India. A U.S. and Indian partnership to establish a
shared, resilient, and cutting-edge techno-industrial base centered on
innovative clean energy manufacturing techniques sets a strong example
for the world and positions our countries to lead clean economic
development in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. 

To launch this partnership, the United States and India are working to
unlock **USD$1 billion** in new multilateral finance through the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) for
projects that include catalyzing India’s domestic clean energy supply
chain buildout. The funding could support supply-side manufacturing
capacity expansion for key technology verticals, focusing on **solar,
wind, battery, energy grid systems,** and **high-efficiency air
conditioner and ceiling fan supply chains.** Over time, we seek to
mobilize additional financing into priority clean energy manufacturing
sectors that harness public and private financial tools and pioneer
innovative financial vehicles to meet the rapid demand for flexible
climate finance solutions.

The United States and India intend to work with relevant government
agencies, civil society, U.S. and Indian private sectors,
philanthropies, and multilateral development banks to identify a package
of pilot projects across the clean energy value chain that meet our
eligibility criteria and meaningfully contribute to supply chain
expansion and diversification in identified sectors.  The U.S. and
Indian governments also pledge to work with industry leaders on the
following lines of effort to launch and eventually scale this new
partnership: 

-   **Identifying near-term investment opportunities to expand
    manufacturing capacity for specific clean energy supply chain
    segments,** with initial focuses on the following clean energy
    components:  

<!-- -->

-   Solar wafers and wafer manufacturing equipment & next generation
    solar cells
-   Wind turbine nacelle components
-   Power transmission line components including conductors, cabling,
    transformers, and next generation technologies
-   Energy storage components including batteries
-   Battery packs for 2- and 3-wheel electric vehicles (EVs) and
    zero-emission e-bus and truck components
-   High-efficiency air conditioners and ceiling fan components

<!-- -->

-   **Collaborating with the private sector to scope eligible
    opportunities in the above supply chain segments and support an
    initial package of pilot projects, ideally including one project
    focused on clean energy deployment to Africa.**  Additional
    investments plans and sources of funding can be developed over time.
    This effort would build on private sector partnerships facilitated
    by U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) across the solar,
    wind, battery, and critical minerals sectors to pursue opportunities
    to finance the manufacture of clean energy components. Such
    investments may be in scope for India’s Green Transition Fund –
    which will support renewable energy, storage, and e-mobility
    investments in India and strengthen demand for localized
    manufacturing – as well as for Indian private equity fund manager
    Eversource Capital’s new DFC-supported $900 million fund to invest
    in clean technologies such as renewable energy, efficient cooling,
    and electric transportation.

<!-- -->

-   **Building trilateral relationships with African partners that have
    stated political commitments to clean energy deployment, focusing on
    solar and battery storage opportunities.** India and the United
    States can work multilaterally with African partners to pursue
    high-potential solar and EV deployment opportunities, understand the
    conditions required for project success, detail the partnerships and
    financial model for project success, and implement the project. The
    United States intends to collaborate with Indian companies to
    explore investment opportunities and facilitate public-private
    matchmaking expand partnerships with local African manufacturers.
    DFC and the U.S. Agency for International Development are anchoring
    this effort by collaborating with India-based International Solar
    Alliance to deploy solar and EV charging networks near health
    facilities.

<!-- -->

-   **Collaborating with each other and industry to consult on policies
    that will strengthen demand certainty for locally manufactured clean
    technologies.  **The U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and
    Inflation Reduction Act were historic laws designed to invest in the
    large-scale deployment of clean energy technologies while also
    reinvigorating the manufacturing capacity of the United States to
    appropriately onshore clean energy supply chains. Likewise, India’s
    Production Linked Incentive Schemes have invested over $4.5 billion
    to catalyze nascent clean energy manufacturing. However, additional
    policies are vital to expand and protect these investments in the
    face of global market dynamics and thin profit margins. Both
    countries acknowledge the importance of sharing insights on how to
    design policy frameworks to reduce demand uncertainties and ensure
    sufficient input materials, technological expertise, finance, and
    other manufacturing enablers are available and secure.

This roadmap is intended to serve as a short-term mechanism for driving
initial cooperation on projects, to help inform a long-term roadmap
including working together to establish a cadence of meetings and
milestones this partnership. This roadmap is not intended to give rise
to rights or obligations under domestic or international law.
