William “Bill” Lucy was a giant and a patriot who spent his life
fighting for freedom, justice, and fairness.  
   
As a leader of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees (AFSCME), he dedicated his life to improving conditions for
working families and advancing the cause of civil rights, human rights,
and labor rights. In 1968, alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Lucy
helped lead the Memphis sanitation workers strike, where AFSCME members
marched under the iconic declaration “I Am A Man,” a term he coined.
Lucy believed in the universal values of freedom, dignity, and
solidarity, forming the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists and working
to end apartheid in South Africa.  
   
Generations of working people and their families continue to benefit
from his work and legacy. Doug and my thoughts are with Bill’s family
and loved ones.
