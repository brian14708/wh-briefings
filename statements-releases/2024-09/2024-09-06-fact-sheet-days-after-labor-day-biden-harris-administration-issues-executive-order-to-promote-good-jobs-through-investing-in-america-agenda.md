title: "FACT SHEET: Days After Labor Day, Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Issues\
  \ Executive Order to Promote Good Jobs Through Investing in America\_Agenda"
---
 
*“Wall Street did not build America; the middle class built America, and
unions built the middle class.” – President Biden on Labor Day, 2024*

Today, President Biden will travel to Michigan to sign a landmark
Executive Order on Investing in America and Investing in American
Workers (“Good Jobs EO”), which will help ensure that the Biden-Harris
Investing in America agenda continues to promote good, high-quality jobs
with paths to the middle class. The Good Jobs EO promotes strong labor
standards such as family-sustaining wages, workplace safety, and the
free and fair opportunity to join a union, and encourages agencies to
implement these standards through their Investing in America programs.
President Biden will sign the Good Jobs EO during a visit to UA Local
190’s Job Training Center, where he will meet with union workers and
apprentices who have benefitted from the President’s agenda. The event
is part of a broader tour to profile the workers and communities across
America who are reaping the rewards of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
Investing in America agenda.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration is the most pro-union administration in
American history. The President and Vice President’s Investing in
America agenda—including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction
Act—have already created hundreds of thousands of jobs, and the
President and Vice President have been clear that their Administration
will use every tool at their disposal to ensure these jobs are
good-paying jobs with the free and fair chance to join a union.  
   
The President’s Good Jobs EO calls on agencies to adopt a series of
high-road labor standards that have long been recognized to lead to both
better jobs and on-time, high-quality delivery of federally funded
projects. With this Executive Order, the Biden-Harris Administration is
the first in history to specify a clear list of labor standards that all
Federal agencies should look to prioritize.  
   
By mobilizing once-in-a-generation public- and private-sector
investments, the Biden-Harris Investing in America agenda is
transforming our economy—onshoring manufacturing, modernizing our
nation’s infrastructure, and building a clean energy economy. The United
States has created nearly 16 million jobs since President Biden and Vice
President Harris took office, with the lowest average unemployment rate
of any administration in 50 years. Already, their Investing in America
agenda has catalyzed over $900 billion in private-sector investment in
clean energy and manufacturing. Last year, clean energy jobs grew at
[double the
rate](https://www.energy.gov/policy/us-energy-employment-jobs-report-useer)
of job growth in the rest of the economy and clean energy unionization
rates reached the highest level in history. The Good Jobs EO builds on
that momentum and will ensure that these investments continue to improve
opportunities for millions of Americans.  
   
**The Good Jobs EO calls on agencies to adopt the following labor
standards:**  

-   **Promoting worker voice**, through Project Labor Agreements (PLAs),
    Community Benefits Agreements, voluntary union recognition, and
    neutrality with respect to union organizing. These instruments,
    which agencies are encouraged to prioritize where appropriate and
    consistent with law, mark the strongest package of priorities that
    any Administration has taken to help promote the free and fair
    choice to join a union through federally funded and federally
    supported projects.
-   **Providing tools to promote high-wage jobs**, through prevailing
    wage standards and other equitable compensation practices, such as
    prioritizing equal pay and pay transparency. This Administration is
    taking ground-breaking steps to raise wages by directing agencies to
    consider incentivizing specific high-wage standards for
    manufacturing grants—going beyond long-standing Davis-Bacon
    requirements that only apply to construction jobs.
-   **Promoting worker economic security**, by directing agencies to
    consider prioritizing projects that supply the benefits that workers
    need—including child and dependent care to health insurance, paid
    leave, and retirement benefits.
-   **Supporting workforce development** through registered
    apprenticeships, pre-apprenticeships, labor-management partnerships,
    and partnerships with training organizations including community
    colleges, public workforce boards, and the American Climate Corps.
-   **Leveling the playing field**, by encouraging grantees to develop
    equitable workforce plans and offering project supports that promote
    fair hiring and management practices as the projects develop.
-   **Supporting workplace safety** by encouraging agencies to
    prioritize reporting structures that help ensure compliance with all
    workplace health and safety laws.

To oversee agencies in their implementation of these labor standards,
the Good Jobs EO creates a new Investing in Good Jobs Task Force (Task
Force) in the Executive Office of the President. The Task Force will
coordinate policy development that drives the creation of high-quality
jobs and ensures project delivery. The Task Force will be co-chaired by
the Secretary of Labor and the Director of the National Economic Council
and include Seniors Advisors to the President and members of the
President’s Cabinet.  
  
**In addition, the Good Jobs EO outlines strategies for agencies to
enact these standards across their grant programs**, consistent with
applicable law:

-   **Incentivize these strong labor standards** to the greatest extent
    possible by including application evaluation criteria related to
    strong labor standards. This includes, consistent with relevant
    statutes, prioritizing applicants who employ Project Labor
    Agreements and Community Benefit Agreements in funding
    opportunities.
-   **Issue guidance or best practices** to promote and implement these
    priorities.
-   **Collect data on job quality** to further encourage best practices
    and increase accountability. This includes embedding checkboxes on
    high-road labor standards into grant applications—a proven strategy
    that has yielded 22 PLA commitments and 34 new registered
    apprenticeship programs during a pilot study at the Department of
    Transportation.
-   **Conduct pre-award negotiations** for key programs and projects as
    appropriate, and include ensuing commitments in grant agreements.
-   **Develop staff expertise** to ensure every agency has in-house
    knowledge of strong labor standards and how their investments can
    promote and support good jobs.

**Today’s actions build on many previous Biden-Harris Administration
actions to support good jobs, including union jobs, such as:**

-   Launched the first-ever [White House Task Force on Worker Organizing
    and
    Empowerment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/17/the-white-house-task-force-on-worker-organizing-and-empowermentupdate-on-implementation-of-approved-actions/),
    chaired by Vice President Harris, which resulted in over 70 actions
    to promote worker organizing and collective bargaining for federal
    employees and workers employed by public- and private-sector
    employers.
-   Created the [Made in America
    office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/made-in-america/),
    to ensure that American-made construction materials are used on
    infrastructure projects.
-   Published a [final
    rule](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2413) from the
    Department of Treasury implementing prevailing wage and
    apprenticeship bonus credits for clean energy projects funded by the
    President’s Inflation Reduction Act to ensure clean energy workers
    are paid good wages and that these projects create equitable
    pipelines to these good jobs.
-   Implemented a [new
    rule](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/12/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-action-to-support-economic-and-efficient-construction-projects-while-creating-good-paying-and-union-jobs/)
    to require Project Labor Agreements on nearly all major federal
    construction projects of over $35 million, so federal construction
    projects will be delivered on time and on budget with good wages and
    well-trained workers.
-   Signed the [Butch Lewis
    Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-historic-american-rescue-plan-pension-relief-for-millions-of-union-workers-and-retirees/)

-   Published the [first
    update](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20230808) to
    Davis-Bacon prevailing wages in nearly 40 years, which will increase
    pay for one million construction workers over time.
-   Proposed a [new
    rule](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20240702) from
    the Department of Labor that would protect 36 million indoor and
    outdoor workers from extreme heat on the job.
-   Signed a Registered Apprenticeship [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/03/06/executive-order-on-scaling-and-expanding-the-use-of-registered-apprenticeships-in-industries-and-the-federal-government-and-promoting-labor-management-forums/)
    to bolster apprenticeships in the federal workforce. Since then,
    federal agencies including the Departments Agriculture, Defense,
    Education Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development,
    Interior, Labor, Transportation, and Treasury, and the Architect of
    the Capitol and U.S. Agency for Global Media have identified
    potential opportunities for developing new and scaling existing
    registered apprenticeships to create pathways to good jobs,
    including in mission-critical occupations.
-   Through the CHIPS Act, provided $200 million in dedicated CHIPS
    funding for training and workforce development to ensure local
    communities have access to the jobs of the future in upcoming
    projects and introduced a
    [requirement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/08/icymi-experts-agree-chips-manufacturing-and-national-security-bolstered-by-childcare/)
    that companies receiving grants under the CHIPS Act over $150
    million create a plan to ensure access to quality, affordable child
    care for their employees.
-   Invested nearly $730 million in Registered Apprenticeships, leading
    to more than 1 million registered apprentices receiving
    earn-as-you-learn training for in-demand jobs.
-   Vocally supported unions, including becoming the first sitting
    President to [walk a picket
    line](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/09/26/remarks-by-president-biden-at-united-auto-workers-picket-line/).
-   The NLRB [expanded
    remedies](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-rules-remedies-must-compensate-employees-for-all-direct-or)

    now include all direct and foreseeable pecuniary harm, such as
    financial loss from credit card debt, medical bills, or missed rent
    payments.
-   The NLRB overhauled the process for union representation elections
    by [requiring an employer to
    bargain](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-issues-decision-announcing-new-framework-for-union-representation)
    if it commits an unfair labor practice during the election process,
    and by [reducing unnecessary
    delays](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/national-labor-relations-board-issues-final-rule-to-restore-fair-and)
    before workers can vote.
