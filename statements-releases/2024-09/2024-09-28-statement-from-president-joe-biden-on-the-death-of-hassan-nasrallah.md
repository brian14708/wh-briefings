title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Death of Hassan\_Nasrallah"
---
 
Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were
responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign
of terror.  His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice
for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and
Lebanese civilians.

The strike that killed Nasrallah took place in the broader context of
the conflict that began with Hamas’s massacre on October 7, 2023. 
Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with
Hamas and open what he called a “northern front” against Israel.

The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against
Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist
groups.  Just yesterday, I directed my Secretary of Defense to further
enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East
region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional
war.

Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza
and Lebanon through diplomatic means.  In Gaza, we have been pursuing a
deal backed by the UN Security Council for a ceasefire and the release
of hostages.  In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would
return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon.  It
is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be
removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater
stability.
