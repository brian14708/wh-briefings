title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining\
  \ Response Efforts to Hurricane\_Helene"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration took significant proactive measures to
support state and local preparation and response measures in advance of
Hurricane Helene making landfall. As the storm continues to track north,
President Biden and Vice President Harris remain focused on life-saving
and life-sustaining response efforts throughout the Southeast. The
President and Vice President are closely monitoring these efforts and
are receiving regular briefings, including today, from senior
Administration officials, including Homeland Security Advisor Liz
Sherwood-Randall and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
Administrator Deanne Criswell.

Administration officials have been in contact with state and local
officials before and during the storm and will continue to coordinate
together during recovery efforts. At the President’s direction, FEMA
Administrator Criswell is traveling to Florida this afternoon to assess
the damage alongside other state and local officials. Administrator
Criswell will also travel to Georgia and North Carolina in the coming
days.

President Biden and Vice President Harris are praying for those who lost
loved ones and for everyone impacted by this storm. Although the storm
has weakened, the situation remains extremely dangerous, and the
Administration continues to urge residents to heed the warnings of local
officials and evacuate immediately if told to do so, as flooding and
other hazards may still affect the region.

Consistent with the President’s direction for a robust and
well-coordinated Federal response, the Administration has taken swift
action to support Hurricane Helene preparedness, response, and recovery
efforts. Specific actions taken include:

**Approved Emergency Declarations Before Landfall **

-   Before Helene made landfall, the Governors of Alabama, Florida,
    Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina submitted emergency
    declaration requests that President Biden swiftly approved. These
    declarations authorized FEMA to provide assistance for emergency
    measures to save lives, protect property, public health and safety,
    and fund other emergency response measures. The Federal government
    proactively pre-positioned personnel and resources across the region
    before Hurricane Helene made landfall, including power restoration
    teams for temporary emergency power, search and rescue equipment,
    meals, water, generators, and equipment to assist communities and
    states with impacts from the storm.
-   The Administration, through the Department of Health and Human
    Services, declared a Public Health Emergency for the states of
    Florida and Georgia. This gives the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
    Services’ (CMS) health care providers and suppliers [greater
    flexibility](https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/1135-Waivers/Pages/default.aspx)
    in meeting emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid
    beneficiaries.

**Supporting Ongoing Emergency Response Efforts**

-   At the President’s direction, before Helene made landfall, 1,500
    Federal personnel were deployed to the region.
-   Urban Search and Rescue has deployed a total of 14 teams (940
    personnel) to affected states. In Florida, eight teams are
    positioned to respond, and all are equipped with Swift Water Rescue
    Capabilities. In Georgia, two teams with water capability have been
    deployed to support rescue operations. In North Carolina, four teams
    all equipped with Swift Water Rescue Capabilities are in place. 
-   The U.S. Coast Guard crews will continue to respond with vessels and
    aircraft to assist search and rescue activities. Approximately 8,000
    personnel are working on the Coast Guard response. They will
    continue to respond to urgent distress calls to save lives and
    assist those impacted by the storm.
-   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has two teams prepositioned to
    provide temporary emergency power, with additional personnel
    deployed and other are prepared to deploy if needed. In addition to
    temporary emergency power, personnel will assist the states with
    infrastructure assessments, debris management and temporary roofing
    assistance as needed. They have activated six emergency operation
    centers in the region to coordinate operations.
-   The Department of Health and Human Services deployed two Health and
    Medical Task Forces to assist hospitals and other critical care
    facilities with any impacts as a result of the storm.
-   FEMA’s Surge Capacity Force is activated, which enables the
    deployment of additional disaster staff within the Department of
    Homeland Security and across the Federal interagency to assist in
    the areas impacted by the hurricane.
-   The Federal government pre-staged more than 2.7 million meals, 1.6
    million liters of water, 50,000 tarps, 10,000 cots, and 20,000
    blankets in the region to support sheltering needs in impacted
    communities.
-   FEMA pre-positioned tanker trucks with 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel
    and 40,000 gallons of gasoline to surge to impacted communities once
    the storm has passed to help alleviate any fuel shortages.
-   Prior to the storm, FEMA also helped source hundreds of ambulances
    to assist with the movement of any patients out of impacted
    hospitals or other facilities.

**Supporting Communities and Infrastructure Following the Storm’s
Impact**

-   The Department of Energy’s Energy Response Organization is activated
    and closely monitoring impacts and restoration efforts related to
    Helene, including power, fuel, and supply chain interruptions.  Via
    the Electricity Sub-Sector Coordinating Council, the Department also
    works continuously with electric utilities across the country to
    strengthen post-storm power restoration efforts.
-   The Environmental Protection Agency is working closely with Federal,
    state, local, and Tribal partners to help protect water systems,
    prepare for debris management, and ensure facilities, including
    Superfund sites, maintain critical public health and environmental
    protections. EPA stands ready to mobilize additional staff after the
    storm passes and as clean up and recovery efforts begin. 
-   The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has made
    information available from the HHS
    [emPOWER](https://empowermap.hhs.gov/) program, a partnership
    between the [Administration for Strategic Preparedness and
    Response](https://aspr.hhs.gov/) and the Centers for Medicare &
    Medicaid Services, to support public health emergency planning and
    response activities. The program provides valuable information on
    the number of Medicare beneficiaries who rely on
    electricity-dependent durable medical equipment and certain health
    care services, such as dialysis, oxygen tanks, or home health care,
    to help anticipate, plan for, and respond to the needs of at-risk
    residents in areas impacted by the storm. 
-   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) notified
    Public Housing Authorities, multifamily, and healthcare facility
    owners to implement all appropriate protocols to prepare for the
    storm and ensure the safety of their residents. HUD is and will
    continue to work with the Public Housing Authorities, multifamily,
    and healthcare owners and homelessness assistance partners to
    determine damage impact and resident displacement. HUD will also be
    developing vacancy lists of HUD-assisted projects that can be used
    to provide temporary and/or permanent housing to disaster survivors.
-   The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service
    approved Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’
    request to provide operational flexibilities in all of the state’s
    school lunch programs – which will enhance flexibilities for meal
    service during unanticipated school closures.
-   The Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration aerial teams are being deployed to provide valuable
    observations of impacted communities to understand the scope of the
    storm damage and to support disaster response by Federal partners.
    To ensure navigational safety, NOAA experts work around-the-clock
    after a storm acquiring and processing data to speed the reopening
    of ports and waterways by verifying water depth and identifying
    dangers to navigation.
-   Additional personnel from the Department of Commerce’s National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of
    Agriculture, Department of the Interior, Environmental Protection
    Agency, Department of Energy, and Department of Health and Human
    Services are deployed to assist with response and recovery efforts.
