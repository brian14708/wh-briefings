Vice President Kamala Harris met with His Highness President Sheikh
Mohamed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the White House
today, where they reaffirmed the growing partnership between the United
States and the UAE and discussed joint efforts to promote a more secure,
stable, and prosperous Middle East region.  
   
The Vice President welcomed the UAE’s continued leadership and close
partnership with the United States on advanced technology, including the
safe, secure, and trustworthy use of artificial intelligence, as well as
our shared efforts on strategic investments, diversifying supply chains,
and space exploration.  They discussed the immense potential of our two
countries to secure the future and generate prosperity for our people
and the world. The two leaders also reaffirmed the continued importance
of the strong defense partnership between the United States and the UAE
for each country’s security and for regional stability.   
   
The two leaders discussed the war in Gaza and efforts to secure a
ceasefire and hostage deal, and the Vice President underscored the
importance of protecting innocent civilians and sustaining the flow of
life saving humanitarian assistance.  They discussed the importance of
continued coordination to bring this war to an end and plan for the Day
After. They also discussed the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah,
and our work to prevent the conflict from escalating and reach a
diplomatic solution that would allow populations on both sides of the
border to return to their homes.   
   
The Vice President raised her deep concerns about the conflict in Sudan,
which has displaced nearly 10 million people and left 25 million in need
of humanitarian aid.  She expressed alarm at the millions of individuals
who have been displaced by the war and the atrocities committed by the
belligerents against the civilian population.  She underscored the
critical importance of getting the warring parties to the table, ending
the conflict, and allowing unfettered humanitarian access.  Both leaders
reaffirmed their shared commitment to de-escalate the conflict,
alleviate the suffering of the people of Sudan, ensure humanitarian
assistance reaches the Sudanese people, and prevent Sudan from
attracting transnational terrorist networks once again.
