**<u>Partnership to Accelerate Clean Energy (PACE)</u>**  
  
Under the U.S.-UAE Partnership to Accelerate Clean Energy (PACE)
initiative, the United States and the UAE are announcing several
initiatives that will continue our efforts to ensure a swift and smooth
transition towards clean energy. The United States and United Arab
Emirates remain committed to investing together in Africa and working to
end energy poverty across sub-Saharan Africa.  Today, the UAE-based
Averi Finance and AMEA Power are both private sector partners under the
U.S.-led Power Africa Initiative, joining an existing partnership with
UAE-based company Phanes. As private sector partners, these firms will
be offered tailored assistance from transaction advisors and technical
experts and can benefit from services offered by participating U.S.
government departments and agencies.  
  
To support the Power Africa initiative, Averi Finance intends to
facilitate $5 billion in investments, build 3GW of power generation
projects, construct over 3,000 kilometers of transmission or
distribution lines, establish over 500,000 new home and business
connections, and aim for a CO2 equivalent reduction or avoidance of 90
million tons.  AMEA Power and Power Africa have recently entered into a
partnership to accelerate power projects.  AMEA Power is targeting 5GW
of renewable energy capacity in Africa by 2030, and to realize this
target, intends to mobilize $5 billion in capital.   
  
Additionally, under PACE, ADNOC has announced a 35 percent stake in
ExxonMobil’s proposed low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia production
facility in Baytown, Texas.  This facility aims to produce up to
approximately 900,000 tons of low-carbon ammonia per year, enabling the
transition to cleaner fuels in hard-to-abate sectors.  Plynth Energy – a
recently established Abu Dhabi government-owned early-stage fund focused
on fusion technologies and supply chains – invested in the U.S. company
Zap Energy, which plans to build scalable and commercially-viable fusion
energy.  This investment will help fund the further development of Zap
Energy’s small-format commercial fusion technology. Zap Energy is a

Fusion Development Program, and will receive DOE funding based on
reaching development milestones to support the design of a fusion pilot
plant.  
  
Lastly, as two of over 155 participants in the Global Methane Pledge,
the U.S. and the UAE will accelerate their respective domestic methane
reductions, work together to support countries undertaking methane
abatement, and call on others to do the same by advancing methane
reduction projects, strengthening methane standards and regulations,
addressing methane super emitter events, and identifying appropriate
financing for methane reduction.  
  
**<u>Partners in Space Exploration</u>**  
  
As founding nation members of the Artemis Accords, His Highness
President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and President Biden reinforced the
U.S. and UAE’s groundbreaking cooperation in space, the future of human

strongly affirmed the United States’ commitment to the United Arab
Emirates’ security and territorial defense, and to facilitating its
ability to obtain necessary capabilities to defend its people and
territory against external threats.  The leaders reaffirmed their
commitment to a strong bilateral security and defense relationship and
to expanding defense and security cooperation to bolster joint defense
capabilities against external threats, including through the Department
of Defense’s State Partnership Program.  
  
The leaders affirmed a shared vision of an interconnected, peaceful,
tolerant, and prosperous region as outlined by President Biden during
the GCC+3 Summit Meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on July 16, 2022. 
They reviewed the proud legacy of standing shoulder-to-shoulder, in
peace and in conflict, including the UAE’s support for American-led
counterterrorism missions since the attacks in New York, Pennsylvania,
and Washington on September 11, 2001, to deter threats, de-escalate
conflicts, and reduce tensions globally.  Specifically, the leaders
recalled the United States and the United Arab Emirates standing
alongside each other in the global coalition against Da’esh, and prior
conflicts: Somalia, the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya.  
  
The leaders reviewed ongoing initiatives and investments in advanced
systems that have made the United Arab Emirates one of the most capable
U.S. military partners in the region, in addition to a robust schedule

important step for both countries that underscored their vital and
longstanding collaboration in defeating terrorist groups, such as Da’esh
and al-Qaida, securing regional stability, and combatting threats
against their common interests including terrorist financing.  They
underscored the importance of the annual Joint Military Dialogue as the
foremost bilateral defense forum for advancing the U.S.-UAE defense
partnership, including reviewing shared security interests, as well as
discussing strategic objectives for the relationship and challenges in
the region, such as maritime security, counter-piracy, counterterrorism
cooperation, and domain awareness in the Middle East, the Indian Ocean,
and East Africa.  They further noted the recognition by the Security
Council in Resolution 2686 that hate speech, racism, racial
discrimination, xenophobia, related forms of intolerance, gender
discrimination and acts of extremism can contribute to driving the
outbreak, escalation and recurrence of conflict.

The leaders stressed the importance of reaching a peaceful solution to
the dispute over the three islands, Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu
Musa, through bilateral negotiations or the International Court of
Justice, in accordance with the rules of international law including the
UN Charter.  
  
The leaders discussed persisting and emerging threats to peace and
stability in the Middle East and the wider region.  They renewed their
commitment to upholding international law, particularly international
humanitarian law, work with parties to resolve conflicts and protect
civilians, and to provide urgently needed aid to alleviate human
suffering.  They reiterated the importance of sustainable and enduring
solutions to the security threats in the region, including those posed
by non-state terrorist actors.  They discussed the enduring importance
of the Abraham Accords and continuing on the path of peace, integration,
and prosperity in the region.  
  
The leaders discussed the war in Gaza. They underscored their commitment
to continue working together towards ending the conflict, calling for a
lasting and sustainable ceasefire and the release of hostages and
detainees in accordance with the United Nations Security Council
Resolution (UNSCR) 2735, and affirmed that all sides to the conflict
must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law.
President Biden commended the UAE’s extraordinary humanitarian efforts

throughout Gaza.  They called on all parties to ensure the safety,
security, and sustained access of aid workers to all those in need, and
to create the conditions needed to facilitate an effective humanitarian
response in Gaza.  
  
His Highness President Sheikh Mohamed commended the mediation efforts by
the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, to reach a lasting and
sustainable ceasefire and hostage release deal to help end the war in
Gaza.  His Highness also echoed the principles laid out by President
Biden on May 31, 2024, and stressed the importance of building on this
proposal in order to create a serious political horizon for negotiation.
 To that end, the leaders discussed a path to stabilization and recovery
that responds to the humanitarian crisis, establishes law and order, and
lays the groundwork for responsible governance.  The leaders expressed
their commitment to the two-State solution, wherein a sovereign and
contiguous Palestinian state lives side-by-side in peace and security
with Israel, as the only way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
in accordance with the internationally-recognized parameters and the
Arab Peace Initiative.  They stressed the need to refrain from all
unilateral measures that undermine the two-State solution, and to
preserve the historic status quo of Jerusalem’s holy sites, recognizing
the special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in this regard.  
  
On the conflict in Sudan, the leaders expressed their deep concern over
the tragic impact the violence has had on the Sudanese people and on
neighboring countries.  Both leaders expressed alarm at the millions of
individuals who have been displaced by the war, the hundreds of
thousands experiencing famine, and the atrocities committed by the
belligerents against the civilian population.  They stressed that there
can be no military solution to the conflict in Sudan and underscored
their firm and unwavering position on the imperative for concrete and
immediate action to achieve a lasting cessation of hostilities, the
return to the political process, and transition to civilian-led
governance.  
  
Both leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to de-escalate the
conflict, alleviate the suffering of the people of Sudan, ensure
humanitarian assistance reaches the Sudanese people, and prevent Sudan
from attracting transnational terrorist networks once again. Noting
their shared concern about the risk of imminent atrocities, particularly
as fighting continues in Darfur, they underscored that all parties to
the conflict must comply with their obligations under international
humanitarian law, and all individuals and groups that commit war crimes
must be held accountable.  The leaders emphasized that the priority
right now must be the protection of civilians, particularly women,
children and the elderly, securing humanitarian pauses in order to scale
up and facilitate the movement of humanitarian assistance into the
country and across conflict lines, and ensuring the delivery of aid to
those in need, especially to the most vulnerable.  
  
**<u>Partners in Cyberspace</u>**  
  
The leaders emphasized that safety and stability in cyberspace is
critical for digital economic growth and development, and reaffirmed
their commitment to an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable
internet, underpinned by the multistakeholder model of internet
