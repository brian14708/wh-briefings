title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Highlights New Actions to Support\
  \ Women\u2019s Economic\_Security"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new resources to
support women’s economic security and convening stakeholders to discuss
the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to ensure that women age with
the financial security that they deserve.  
   
Under the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris,
working age women’s labor force participation is the highest on record,
the gender pay gap has narrowed, and the Administration is ensuring that
women have access to good jobs and safe workplaces free from
discrimination.  Still, women—and women of color in
particular—experience workplace inequities throughout their lives,
including as a result of discrimination, pay disparities, occupational
segregation, and unpaid caregiving responsibilities.  These inequities
can add up to millions of dollars lost over the course of a lifetime and
contribute to a retirement savings gap between men and women.  While
women typically retire with less savings than men, they are also living
longer—thereby, experiencing more financial strain as they age.    
   
The Council of Economic Advisers is releasing a new issue brief on the
[*Economic Security of Older
Women*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/09/20/economic-security-of-older-women/)
highlighting the economic challenges that compound over the course of a
woman’s life and underscoring that women are more vulnerable to economic
shocks.  The issue brief also highlights Biden-Harris Administration
policies that have helped mitigate these challenges and ensure women’s
economic security as they age.  
   
Since Day One, President Biden and Vice President Harris have fought to
improve women’s economic security and protect and strengthen Social
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid—lifelines for millions of women.  From

for millions of seniors through the historic Inflation Reduction Act to
issuing new rules to ensure that [the financial advice that Americans

is in their best interest, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking
action to support women’s financial security.  The Biden-Harris
Administration is also closing gaps in [women’s health
research](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/18/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-and-announces-new-actions-to-advance-womens-health-research-and-innovation/),
ensuring that women enter retirement more securely, supporting families’
access to care, and protecting women from financial fraud and scams.   
   
As part of the ongoing efforts to support women’s economic security, the
Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the following new actions:  
   
**Supporting Employment Training and Housing for Seniors**. The
Department of Labor (DOL)—through the Senior Community Service
Employment Program—[is
awarding](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20240920) more
than $200 million in new grants to support training and employment for
older adults.  Through these grants, participants—the majority of whom
are women—are connected to jobs, gaining critical workplace skills and a
pathway to financial stability.  The Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) [is
announcing](https://acl.gov/news-and-events/announcements/acl-awards-28-million-through-elder-justice-innovation-grants-program)
nearly $3 million in funding for the Elder Justice Innovation Grants. 
Because traditional emergency housing options often cannot meet the
needs of older adults, older women experiencing abuse are often forced
to return to unsafe environments; these funds will support emergency and
transitional housing tailored to the needs of older women.  
   
**Providing New Resources to Help Support Women’s Retirement
Security**.  HHS is [announcing a new guide to services and
resources](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/ImprovingEconomicSecurityForOlderWomen.pdf)—including
tools for retirement planning and financial literacy—to assist women in
planning for a healthy financial future in older age.  DOL is publishing
resources to assist women navigating challenging retirement scenarios,
including a new effort to educate attorneys and advocates on qualified
domestic relations orders, a critical step in dividing a couple’s
retirement assets in the event of a divorce.  The Department of Treasury
is [publishing a new issue
brief](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/spotlighting-womens-retirement-security)
on the unique challenges that many women face in retirement, and how the
Biden-Harris Administration’s implementation of the SECURE 2.0
Act—including the Saver’s Match, emergency savings provisions, and
expanded coverage for part-time workers—will help mitigate the gender
retirement savings gap.  And the Social Security Administration [is
releasing a new
resource](https://www.ssa.gov/people/materials/pdfs/women1.pdf) for
women and their families about how they can better access Social
Security benefits and services.    
  
**Protecting Women’s Earnings and Savings**.  The Consumer Protection
Financial Bureau (CFPB) is announcing new efforts to help older
women—who are more vulnerable to certain financial frauds and
scams—protect their hard-earned savings.  Today, the CFPB [spotlighted
the legal
challenges](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/debt-collectors-that-take-advantage-of-surviving-spouses-and-their-vulnerabilities/)
faced by surviving spouses—often women—who may be pursued for their
spouse’s medical debt.  Some states have enacted laws making clear that
surviving spouses are not responsible for their deceased partners’
debts, and others limit the circumstances in which a surviving spouse is
responsible; however, the CFPB has found that debt collectors may try to
capitalize on a surviving spouse’s vulnerabilities by attempting to
collect their deceased spouse’s unpaid medical bills without real
consideration of whether the surviving spouse actually owes the debt. 
This follows the CFPB’s proposed rule earlier this year, announced by
Vice President Harris, which proposed to remove medical bills from most
credit reports, increase privacy protections, help to increase credit
scores and loan approvals, and prevent debt collectors from using the
credit reporting system to coerce people to pay.  The CFPB will also
release a report on the barriers that older Americans face in banking
that financial institutions must work to address, including loss of a
spouse, cognitive challenges, and changes in health.  The Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission [is releasing a new
resource](https://www.eeoc.gov/older-women-work-intersection-age-and-sex-discrimination)
highlighting enforcement activities and public education efforts to
combat sex and age discrimination.  
   
Today’s announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions
to help ensure women age with financial security, including—  
   
**Lowering Health Care Costs for Women**  
   
The President and Vice President believe that health care is a right,
not a privilege, and have expanded health care to millions more
Americans while lowering health care costs.  The Administration
continues to build on, strengthen, and protect Medicare, Medicaid, and
the Affordable Care Act and has signed historic new laws to lower
prescription drug costs and health insurance premiums.  The President’s
prescription drug law, the Inflation Reduction Act, is directly
benefiting women with Medicare, including nearly 30 million women
enrolled in Medicare Part D.  These actions are [especially
important](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/ira-research-series-projected-impacts-women-enrolled-medicare)
[for
women](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/fact-sheets/women-and-job-based-health.pdf),
who typically face higher health care costs than men and who are more
likely than men to take less medication than was prescribed because of
cost—with even greater disparities for women of color.  To help address
these challenges, the Biden-Harris Administration is:  

-   **Lowering the Cost of Insulin**.  The Administration is delivering
    on the President’s promise to lower health care costs by capping
    seniors’ insulin costs at $35 for a month’s supply.  As a result,
    all 3.4 million Medicare Part D enrollees who filled an insulin
    prescription in 2023 had their insulin costs capped at $35 per
    month, saving [some seniors hundreds of dollars for a month’s
    supply](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/24/new-hhs-report-finds-major-savings-americans-who-use-insulin-thanks-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act.html)
    and lowering costs for about 733,000 women enrolled in Part D and
    B.  
-   **Capping Out-of-Pocket Prescription Drug Costs.** Under the
    President’s leadership, HHS is implementing a $2,000 out-of-pocket
    cap for prescriptions drugs costs for Medicare Part D enrollees.  In
    2025, when the cap goes into effect, nearly 19 million seniors and
    other beneficiaries are projected to save $400 per year on
    prescription drugs.   
-   **Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs.** For the first-time
    ever, the Administration announced new, lower prices for the first
    ten drugs selected for Medicare drug price negotiations, including
    for drugs that women disproportionately use.  For example, one of
    the [first 10 drugs is
    Enbrel](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-lower-prices-for-first-ten-drugs-selected-for-medicare-price-negotiation-to-lower-costs-for-millions-of-americans/)—an
    arthritis treatment; women comprise 72 percent of the enrollees who
    use Enbrel; a woman with Medicare who takes Enbrel and pays $1,777
    today for a 30-day supply would pay only $589 to fill her
    prescription when the negotiated prices take effect—a 67% decrease
    in out-of-pocket costs.  
-   **Lowering the Cost of Health Insurance. **Millions of women are
    saving an average of $800 on health insurance premiums thanks to the
    Administration’s expansion of the Premium Tax Credit.  This
    expansion has helped drive health insurance coverage to a record
    high, while the Affordable Care Act continues to ensure that
    insurance companies cannot charge women more just because of their
    gender.

**Supporting Women’s Financial Security**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring that women are
supported throughout their working lives—by ensuring access to
high-quality jobs, robustly enforcing workplace antidiscrimination laws,
and closing gender wage gaps—and as they enter retirement.  The
Administration is working to ensure women’s financial security as they
age by:

-   **Safeguarding Social Security Equity and Efficiency. ** Social
    Security is the bedrock of financial security for American seniors
    and for millions of Americans with disabilities.  President Biden
    and Vice President Harris are committed to protecting and
    strengthening Social Security.  SSA also administers the
    Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which provides monthly
    payments to people with disabilities and older adults who have
    little or no income and resources; older women are more likely than
    older men to rely on SSI, making up 64% of SSI recipients aged 65 or
    older.  To simplify and increase access for individuals, SSA
    [announced the first phase of an online, streamlined SSI
    application](https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/2024/#2024-08-27);
    [published three final rules simplifying how non-monetary support
    from friends and family is
    counted](https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/2024/#5-2024-3);
    and [initiated efforts to expedite decisions for people with severe
    disabilities](https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/2024/#2024-08-12). 
    SSA has [also deployed a targeted outreach
    strategy](https://www.ssa.gov/equity/assets/materials/2023.pdf) to
    ensure that beneficiaries are aware of the benefits SSA pays to
    widowed and divorced spouses and dependents of eligible workers—a
    population disproportionately comprised of older women.  To help
    ensure that all beneficiaries receive the benefits that they are
    entitled to, SSA is [also translating more materials into more
    languages](https://www.ssa.gov/eeo/documents/LAP2024-2026.pdf),
    [improving access to interpretation
    services](https://blog.ssa.gov/how-we-serve-people-who-have-limited-english-proficiency/),
    and developed a [Limited English Proficiency
    Toolkit](https://www.ssa.gov/thirdparty/groups/lep.html).  The
    Biden-Harris Administration is fighting to ensure that SSA has the
    funding they need to continue administering these crucial
    programs.  
-   **Protecting Women’s Retirement Savings.  **Earlier this year, DOL
    issued [a final
    rule](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/23/readout-of-white-house-event-announcing-overtime-and-retirement-security-rules/#:~:text=The%20rule%20will%20require%20trusted,%E2%80%94at%20retirement%20savers'%20expense.)
    to close loopholes and ensure that the financial advice that
    Americans get for retirement is in their best interest.  DOL’s rule
    will protect the millions of Americans, including millions of women,
    who are diligently saving for retirement when they rely on advice
    from trusted professionals on how to invest their savings.  The rule
    will require trusted investment advice providers to give prudent,
    loyal, and honest advice, and prevent them from providing
    recommendations that favor the investment advice providers’
    interests—financial or otherwise—at retirement savers’ expense. 
    These new safeguards will save tens or even hundreds of thousands of
    dollars per impacted middle-class saver.  The Administration is also
    implementing the SECURE 2.0 Act, which allows survivors of domestic
    abuse to elect to receive penalty-free distributions from an
    employer-sponsored retirement plan.   
-   **Providing Housing Security for Vulnerable Women.** The Department
    of Housing and Urban Development continues to support housing for
    older Americans, including through the [Home Equity Conversion
    Mortgages for Seniors
    program](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/HECM-Report.pdf),
    which allows seniors to withdraw a portion of their home equity for
    additional income, and the [202
    program](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/mfh/mfinfo/section202ptl),
    which offers direct loans and capital for the provision of secure
    and supportive housing facilities for older persons.  These
    programs—which [predominantly support older
    women](https://www.huduser.gov/Publications/pdf/sec_202_1.pdf)—
    allow senior homeowners to age in place and help expand the supply
    of affordable housing by providing low-income older Americans with
    options that allow them to live independently but in an environment
    that provides support for daily necessities. 

**Supporting Families’ Access to Care**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration—through [implementation of the
President’s Care Executive
Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Progress-Summary.pdf)—is
working to ensure that older women have the support they need as they
age as well as to care for the ones they love.  Even as older adults
require care, they are also often the ones who provide it.  One in four
older women provide some form of unpaid caregiving, and, without
training and support, their health, well-being, quality of life, and
financial future can suffer.  The Administration is supporting families’
access to care by:

-   **Ensuring Safety and Quality Care in Long-Term Care Facilities.**
    Adequate staffing is proven to be one of the measures most strongly
    associated with safety and good care outcomes.  To ensure safety and
    quality care, earlier this year, Vice President Harris announced
    that [HHS finalized a rule to require all nursing
    homes](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/22/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-historic-advancements-in-long-term-care-to-support-the-care-economy/#:~:text=The%20Nursing%20Home%20Minimum%20Staffing,and%20nurse%20aides%20(2.45%20per)
    that receive federal funding through Medicare and Medicaid to have
    3.48 hours per resident per day of total staffing, including a
    defined number from both registered nurses and nurse aides.  This
    means a facility with 100 residents would need at least two or three
    registered nurses and at least ten or eleven nurse aides as well as
    two additional nurse staff (which could be registered nurses,
    licensed professional nurses, or nurse aides) per shift to meet the
    minimum staffing standards.  Many facilities would need to staff at
    a higher level based on their residents’ needs.  It will also
    require facilities to have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day,
    seven days a week, to provide skilled nursing care, which will
    further improve nursing home safety.   And HHS released a [new
    “know-your-rights”
    resource](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/fact-sheets/protecting-rights-women-ages-health-care-fact-sheet/index.html)
    for women to ensure that women can access safe and culturally
    competent health care free from discrimination and with protections
    to their privacy.   
-   **Supporting Family Caregivers**. Through the American Rescue Plan,
    the Administration provided $145 million to help the National Family
    Caregiver Support Program deliver counseling, training, and
    short-term relief to family caregivers and other informal care
    providers.  HHS issued a report documenting actions taken by the
    Biden-Harris Administration [to
    implement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/09/17/hhs-releases-progress-report-on-federal-implementation-of-the-national-strategy-to-support-family-caregivers.html)
    the first-ever National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers; these
    actions have created new initiatives that directly support family
    caregivers, strengthened existing programs, and improved
    coordination across the federal government to improve the lives of
    family caregivers.  HHS has also taken steps to support family
    caregivers’ access to training and beneficiary information during
    the hospital discharge planning process, published the Guiding and
    Improving Dementia Experience Model to support people living with
    dementia and their caregivers, and announced new funding
    opportunities to develop new approaches to support family
    caregivers.  HHS also [published a
    guide](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/CaregivingResourcesForOlderWomen.pdf)
    to help older women find programs and services—such as respite care,
    support groups and individual counseling—to help them maintain their
    own health and well-being while being a caregiver for others.  And
    the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched a [program to
    provide mental health counseling
    services](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/comprehensive-assistance-for-family-caregivers/)
    to family caregivers caring for our nation’s heroes.    
-   **Investing in Care Infrastructure and Supporting Caregivers and
    Care Workers**. The Administration is committed to raising the wages
    and quality of care worker jobs, and to investing in care
    infrastructure. In March 2024, SBA announced new funding
    opportunities to support small businesses in the child care sector
    as well as the creation of a child care business development guide,
    which will provide resources for child care businesses on starting
    and running a business throughout the business life cycle.  In
    addition, SBA is launching a lender campaign to highlight the
    resources SBA has available to support small, minority-owned, and
    women-owned businesses, including child care businesses, and will
    discuss additional reforms to support the growth of child care
    capacity across the country.  The Administration is also taking
    steps to ensure Service members and military spouses—the vast
    majority of whom are women—have the support they need to care for
    themselves and their families while serving our country, including
    by strengthening hiring and retention of military spouses across the
    federal government, and expanding access to child care and other
    employment resources.  And the Department of Labor has published
    [sample employment
    agreements](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/Domestic-Workers) so
    domestic home care, child care, and long-term care workers and their
    employers can help ensure all parties better understand their rights
    and responsibilities.

**Protecting Women from Financial Fraud and Scams**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is working to protect the savings that
older Americans have worked their entire lives to build. Each year,
Americans over 60-years-old lose billions of dollars to scams.  The
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, and other regulatory agencies are taking action to crack down on
frauds and scams that too often target older Americans by—

-   **Protecting Older Women from Financial Fraud**. FTC is pursuing
    actions against scammers who target or disproportionately impact
    older adults in their schemes, including those who conduct prize,
    sweepstakes, and lottery scams; tech support scams; and family and
    friend impersonation.  Last year, FTC’s past enforcement efforts
    resulted in relief of more than $285 million to consumers.  
-   **Equipping Older Women with Tools and Resources to Protect Against
    Scams. ** FTC chairs the [Scams Against Older Adults Advisory
    Group](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-convene-advisory-group-fight-scams-against-older-adults-april-2)
    focused on expanding consumer education and outreach efforts;
    improving industry training on scam prevention; identifying
    innovative or high-tech methods to detect and stop scams; it has
    produced a
    [report](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ftc.gov%2Folderadults&data=05%7C02%7CLGREISMAN%40ftc.gov%7Cb0a1d246724f41e4170f08dcd68a5138%7C7302cabc5af5469baf17700007935a01%7C0%7C0%7C638621138178875227%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=2vtDYyZ0v2gYf5NxAgJEoE4pouM5fqjWgcwTjJWxpdE%3D&reserved=0)
    on what research shows are effective tactics in scam-prevention
    messaging.  And the CFPB has released resources to assist older
    adults—who are disproportionately women—navigate later-in-life
    challenges, such as resources to navigate [critical financial
    moments after losing a
    spouse](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/educator-tools/resources-for-older-adults/discover-resources-for-surviving-spouses/);
    [tools to avoid financial
    exploitation](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/educator-tools/resources-for-older-adults/money-smart-for-older-adults/);
    and [information to help safeguard
