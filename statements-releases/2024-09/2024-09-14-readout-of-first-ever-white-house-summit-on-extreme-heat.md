title: "Readout of First-Ever White\_House Summit on Extreme\_Heat"
---
 
From worker heat exhaustion to bridge failures, extreme heat is
increasingly placing strain on lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure.
Earlier this week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
[announced](https://www.noaa.gov/news/us-sweltered-through-its-4th-hottest-summer-on-record)
that the United States just experienced its fourth-hottest summer on
record.  Globally, August 2024 was the
[warmest](https://www.noaa.gov/news/earth-had-its-hottest-august-in-175-year-record#:~:text=by%20the%20numbers-,August%202024,in%20the%20global%20climate%20record.)
August in the agency’s 175-year record.

Recognizing that extreme heat is the deadliest type of disaster among
[all weather-related
hazards](https://www.ready.gov/heat#:~:text=In%20extreme%20heat%20your%20body,among%20all%20weather%2Drelated%20hazards.),
the Biden-Harris Administration hosted the first-ever White House Summit
on Extreme Heat, bringing together over 100 participants from around the
country and across the government. The Summit,
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-workers-and-communities-from-extreme-weather/)
by President Biden earlier in the summer, convened federal agencies and
White House senior staff alongside leaders – including workers exposed
to extreme heat, healthcare professionals, emergency responders, and
researchers and innovators – who represent many of the communities that
are fighting on the front lines of extreme heat to discuss lessons
learned from this year’s extreme heat, highlight Administration progress
in tackling extreme heat and advancing environmental justice, and
amplify successful best practices to manage extreme heat that have been
locally tailored and community driven.

At the Summit, National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi also announced a new
[Extreme Heat Call to
Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-09-12-Heat-Call-to-Action-Explainer.pdf),
which calls upon state, local, Tribal and Territorial governments, along
with the private sector and non-profit organizations to lead by example
and use all of the tools at their disposal to protect people from
extreme heat looking ahead to 2025. The Call to Action invites
interested organizations to [submit a commitment to take
action](https://46eop.my.site.com/Surveys/survey/runtimeApp.app?invitationId=0KiSJ0000004aZZ&surveyName=extreme_heat_call_to_action&UUID=542e9b36-e1dc-4654-903a-989574211edf)
in advance of the 2025 heat season, including a wide range of approaches
and tools which could be used to protect people and resources from
extreme heat, such as actions highlighted in the [U.S. Climate
Resilience Toolkit](https://toolkit.climate.gov/) and the [National Heat
Strategy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/14/biden-harris-administration-unveils-national-heat-strategy-protect-community-health-extreme-heat.html):

-   Long-term adaptation and resilience actions, like improving tree
    canopy and installing new cooling infrastructure;
-   Heat planning actions, like running a heat tabletop exercise or
    creating a community phone tree in partnership with trusted
    community partners;
-   Heat preparedness actions, like equipping emergency responders and
    healthcare providers with new resources to address extreme heat;
-   Heat response actions, like opening new Resilience Hubs or cooling
    centers during extreme heat events; and
-   Heat recovery actions, such as establishing new ways to track
    progress on key heat and health metrics.

The White House will collect submissions for the Call to Action through
November 1, 2024, which may include information about the goals that
communities have set and the new actions they are planning in advance of
future extreme heat events. As part of this effort, the White House
hopes to understand and amplify a number of promising commitments and
actions. 

The White House also announced the publication of a [Draft Community
Heat Action
Checklist](https://www.heat.gov/pages/community-heat-action-checklist),
a new tool for local governments taking their first critical steps
towards planning and preparing for extreme heat. This document
supplements existing tools on
[Heat.gov](/Users/TACherry/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/JWVP2HVT/heat.gov)
helping communities map, understand, and address their heat risk. It
also builds on major investments by the Biden-Harris Administration
relevant to understanding, preventing, and responding to extreme
heat—including investments in [urban and community
forests](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/urban-forests/ucf/2023-grant-funding),
[green and resilient building retrofits,](https://www.hud.gov/GRRP)
[lowering cooling
costs](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/blog/2022/04/liheap-and-extreme-heat) for
[American
families](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_24_145),
and in [protecting our nation’s
workers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-workers-and-communities-from-extreme-weather/)
from extreme heat. This work also advances the Biden-Harris
Administration’s work to align climate resilience investments across the
public and private sector through common principles and opportunities
for action to build a climate-resilient nation through the [National
Climate Resilience
Framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/National-Climate-Resilience-Framework-FINAL.pdf),
the federal interagency [National Heat
Strategy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/14/biden-harris-administration-unveils-national-heat-strategy-protect-community-health-extreme-heat.html),
and other regulatory actions.

Additionally, given that climate change is fueling extreme heat both at
home and abroad, the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) issued a toolkit to Mission leaders that will help ensure the
well-being of Agency workforce members during extreme heat events across
the world. The toolkit outlines key measures Missions can take to
prepare for and respond to extreme heat. USAID also announced more than
$18 million in humanitarian assistance to populations experiencing the
increasingly severe impacts of climate change – including extreme heat
and drought.

The Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda includes
more than [$50
billion](https://cpo.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/National_Heat_Strategy-2024-2030.pdf)
to help Americans in every state become more resilient to climate
impacts like hurricanes, wildfires, drought, and extreme heat. The
Extreme Heat Summit will highlight how those investments are moving the
country forward in heat response and inspire communities nationwide to
take additional future steps.
