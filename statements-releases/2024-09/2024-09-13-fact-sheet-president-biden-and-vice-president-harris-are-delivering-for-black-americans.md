title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden and Vice President Harris Are Delivering for\
  \ Black\_Americans"
---
 
Over the past four years, President Biden and Vice President Harris have
taken action to ensure the promise of America reaches every
community—including Black communities. These actions have delivered
historic results, enabling more Black Americans to access a quality
education, obtain a good-paying job, start a business, and buy a
home—driving significant gains in wealth. From growing economic and
educational opportunities to improving health outcomes, from enhancing
public trust and public safety to advancing equity, civil rights, and
racial justice, the Biden-Harris Administration has demonstrated its
deep commitment to ensuring equal opportunity for all and investing in
the future of Black Americans.

**Securing Economic Mobility, Educational Opportunity, and the American
Dream for Black Communities**

President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that the promise of
America—the American Dream—is that everyone should have a fair shot at
getting ahead. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, we have made
progress:

    2.4 million jobs for Black workers as of August 2024
-   Lifted 400,000 Black children out of poverty by increased SNAP
    benefits through updating the Thrifty Food Plan, and continuing to
    call on Congress to restore the full expanded Child Tax
    Credit—which, during the COVID-19 pandemic, cut Black child poverty
    in half benefitting 600,000 and brought racial poverty disparities
    to a record low
-   Grew Black American business ownership at the fastest rate in over
    three decades
-   Tripled the number of SBA-backed loans to Black-owned businesses
-   Awarded a record $10 billion in federal contracts to Black-owned
    small businesses in Fiscal Year 2023
-   Invested a record of more than $16 billion in Historically Black
    Colleges and Universities
-   Secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant award—the largest
    increase in the past 10 years—and $23 million in first-ever funding
    to the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program to increase
    the number of teachers of color and multilingual educators across
    the country
-   Approved the cancellation of almost $170 billion in student loan
    debt for nearly 5 million borrowers, including a significant number
    of Black borrowers who are disproportionately burdened by student
    debt 
-   Took on racial bias in home appraisals and closed the Black-white
    home misevaluation gap by 40%
-   Reduced mortgage insurance premiums for FHA loans, saving 76,000
    Black households an average of $900/year

    with the Affordable Connectivity Program
-   Distributed $2.2 billion in financial assistance to over 43,000
    farmers who experienced discrimination

    after adjusting for inflation, is up 60% relative to pre-pandemic
    levels—the largest increase on record

**Ending Health Disparities**

President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to keeping
health care costs down for individuals and families and improving access
to health care to address disparities in Black communities. To improve
health outcomes for the Black community, the Biden-Harris Administration
has:

-   Ensured more Black Americans have health care than ever before by
    lowering premium costs by an average of $800 for millions of
    Americans, increasing Black enrollment in Affordable Care Act
    coverage by 95%, or over 1.7 million people since 2020
-   Lowered monthly premiums for health insurance, capped the cost of
    insulin at $35 and all out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 for people
    on Medicare, and announced new negotiated prices for the first ten
    prescription drugs for Medicare price negotiation—expected to save
    $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs in the first year of the program
    alone

    Medicare & Medicaid Services models, aimed to lower the high cost of
    drugs, promote accessibility to drug therapies, and improve patient
    care

    46 states and Washington, D.C., covering 700,000 more women in the
    year after childbirth

-   Delivered $1 billion to help meet the mental health needs of young
    people by preparing and hiring a projected 14,000 additional mental
    health professionals to serve America’s schools

**Making Communities Safer and Strengthening America’s Commitment to
Justice**

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to using every available
federal lever to advance effective, accountable policing, build trust,
and improve public safety so that the promise of equal justice under the
law is a reality for all. To enhance equal justice and public safety for
all communities, including the Black community, the President has:

-   Signed an Executive Order on police reform when Congressional
    Republicans would not pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act;
    restricted the use of force, banned chokeholds, restricted the use
    of no-knock warrants and created the first-ever national database of

    issued a public health advisory on how to reduce violence.

    most significant gun violence reduction legislation enacted in
    nearly 30 years, and taken more meaningful executive action than any
    other president to make our schools, churches, grocery stores, and
    communities safer
-   Secured $400 million in funding dedicated specifically for community
    violence interventions that invests in evidence-informed strategies
    to prevent violence
-   Cracked down on the source of illegal firearms by making it illegal
    to manufacture “ghost gun” kits, enacting the first-ever federal gun
    trafficking law, taking a “zero tolerance” approach to rogue gun
    dealers, and regulating the number one source of guns involved in
    gun trafficking investigations – unlicensed sellers.
-   Pardoned thousands of Americans under federal and D.C. law for
    simple possession of marijuana
-   Helped bring violent crime to its lowest level in 50 years—lower
    than during any year of the previous administration

**Restoring the Soul of Our Nation**

President Biden believes that advancing equity, civil rights, racial
justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our
government and requires sustained leadership and partnership with all
communities. To make the promise of America real for Black communities,
the President has:

-   Signed two Executive Orders directing the federal government to
    address inequality
-   Protected Black history as American history
-   Signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, the first new
    federal holiday since MLK Day

    women to federal circuit courts than all previous presidents
    combined, and more Black judges in a single term than any other
    president
