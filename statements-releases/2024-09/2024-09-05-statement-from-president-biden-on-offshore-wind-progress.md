title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Offshore Wind\_Progress"
---
 
When I came into office, the United States had zero approved offshore
wind projects in federal waters, and the industry was struggling to gain
a foothold. But now, following my Administration’s investments in our
clean energy future, the private sector has mobilized and the federal
government has approved ten offshore wind projects – enough to power
more than five million homes and equivalent to half of the capacity
needed to achieve our goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
From manufacturing and shipbuilding to port operations and construction,
this industry will support tens of thousands of good-paying and union
jobs, provide reliable clean power to homes and businesses, strengthen
our power grid against outages, and help reduce pollution – all while
protecting biodiversity and marine ecosystems. We will continue to
partner with industry, Tribes, ocean users, and other stakeholders to
support supply chains that are Made in America, incentivize union-built
projects, and continue seizing opportunities for additional clean energy
technologies.
