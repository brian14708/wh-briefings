President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with General Secretary Tô Lâm
of Vietnam in New York. President Biden celebrated the one-year
milestone of our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and reinforced the
United States’ commitment to a strong, prosperous, resilient, and
independent Vietnam. Both leaders reflected on the lasting legacy of the
late General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng and his indelible mark on the
U.S.-Vietnam bilateral relationship.

The two leaders underscored our joint commitment to the Comprehensive
Strategic Partnership and expressed enthusiasm for bringing momentum
into its second year – especially as we prepare to mark important
bilateral milestones in 2025,including 50 years since the end of the war
in Vietnam and 30 years since the normalization of ties.

President Biden raised opportunities to advance cooperation on a range
of  economic, technology, security, and diplomatic issues. President
Biden underscored the important work under the Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework; progress in our cooperation on cybersecurity including for
undersea cables, next steps toward building secure and resilient
semiconductor supply chains and strengthening our technology
partnership. The two leaders discussed the importance of working
together to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, and combatting
environmental and non-traditional security challenges across the Mekong
sub-region. The two leaders reaffirmed the importance of maintaining
peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific – especially in the South China
Sea. President Biden also emphasized the United States’ commitment to
ASEAN centrality and respect for human rights.
