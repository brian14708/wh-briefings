  \ Price\_Index"

Todayâ€™s report shows that we are turning the page on inflation, which
has fallen to 2.5%, close to the level the month before the pandemic
started. With inflation coming back down close to normal levels, it is
important to focus on sustaining the historic gains we have made for
American workers during this recovery.

The President and the Vice President are fighting to lower costs, expand
opportunities, and grow the middle class. That means creating jobs and
supporting small businesses in communities across the country. It means
cutting taxes for middle class families and hardworking Americans, while
asking billionaires and large corporations to pay their fair share to
reduce the deficit. And it means making housing, health care, and
prescription drugs more affordable. Congressional Republicans would
raise costs by nearly $4,000 per family while cutting taxes for the
ultra-wealthy. While the President and Vice President fight for the
future, Congressional Republicans would drag us backward.
