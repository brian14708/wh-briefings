title: "President\_Biden Names Sixteenth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing five new federal judicial nominees, all of
whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule
of law and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.  
  
For example, the slate includes: 

-   A nominee who would be the first Asian American judge to ever serve
    on the Seventh Circuit.
-   A nominee who would be the first Hispanic judge to ever serve on the
    Ninth Circuit from Washington State.
-   A nominee who would be the first Hispanic woman to ever serve as a
    federal judge in the state of Illinois.
-   A nominee who would be would be the only judge of color currently
    serving on the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, and
    the second African American judge to ever serve on the District of
    Delaware.

This is President Biden’s sixteenth round of nominees for federal
judicial positions and his fourth slate of nominations in 2022, bringing
the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 90.

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
