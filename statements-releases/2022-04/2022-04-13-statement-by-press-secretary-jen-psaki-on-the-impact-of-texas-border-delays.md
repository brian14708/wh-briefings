title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on the Impact of Texas Border\_Delays"
---
 
Governor Abbott’s unnecessary and redundant inspections of trucks
transiting ports of entry between Texas and Mexico are causing
significant disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains,
delaying manufacturing, impacting jobs, and raising prices for families
in Texas and across the country. Local businesses and trade associations
are calling on Governor Abbott to reverse this decision because trucks
are facing lengthy delays exceeding 5 hours at some border crossings and
commercial traffic has dropped by as much as 60 percent.  The continuous
flow of legitimate trade and travel and CBP’s ability to do its job
should not be obstructed. Governor Abbott’s actions are impacting
people’s jobs, and the livelihoods of hardworking American families.
