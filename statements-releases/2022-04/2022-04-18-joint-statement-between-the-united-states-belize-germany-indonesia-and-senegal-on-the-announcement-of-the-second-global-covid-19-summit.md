The United States as first COVID Summit Chair, Belize, as CARICOM Chair;
Germany, holding the G7 Presidency; Indonesia, holding the G20
Presidency; and Senegal as African Union Chair, are pleased to announce
we will co-host the second Global COVID-19 Summit, which will be held
virtually on May 12, 2022. The Summit will redouble our collective
efforts to end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for
future health threats.  
   
This Summit follows the first [Global COVID-19
Summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/24/global-covid-19-summit-ending-the-pandemic-and-building-back-better/)
convened by the United States on September 22, 2021. In advance of the
May 12 Summit, we are calling on world leaders, members of civil
society, non-governmental organizations, philanthropists, and the
private sector to make new commitments and bring solutions to [vaccinate
the world, save lives now, and build better health
security](https://twitter.com/i/status/1441202427609305097) — for
everyone, everywhere.  
   
The emergence and spread of new variants, like Omicron, have reinforced
the need for a strategy aimed at controlling COVID-19 worldwide.
Together, we can mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and protect those at
the highest risk with vaccinations, testing, and treatments, actions to
minimize disruption to routine health services, and through support for
the ACT-Accelerator multilateral mechanism. We know we must prepare now
to build, sustain, and finance the global capacity we need, not only for
emerging COVID-19 variants, but also future health crises. To help
achieve these goals, we urge all countries and stakeholders to pledge to
take urgent actions to create the systems we need to end the acute phase
of COVID-19, save lives, and build better health security and health
systems.  
   
The Summit will build on the themes and commitments made at the first
Summit and will place an emphasis on supporting locally-led solutions to
both immediate and long-term challenges, including:

-   Getting shots into arms;
-   Deploying tests and treatments, especially for the highest-risk
    populations;
-   Expanding and protecting the health workforce and minimizing
    disruptions to routine and essential health services;
-   Enhancing access to medical countermeasures, including research and
    development and scaling and diversifying local and regional
    manufacturing; and
-   Generating sustainable financing for pandemic preparedness, health
    security, and health systems 

We look forward to another successful Summit to continue the
international effort in the fight against COVID-19 and to advance global
pandemic preparedness.
