  \ Jake Sullivan\u2019s Call with President Maia Sandu of\_Moldova"
---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with President Maia
Sandu of Moldova. Mr. Sullivan expressed appreciation for Moldova’s
generosity in welcoming individuals fleeing Russian aggression in
neighboring Ukraine. He underscored the U.S. commitment to help Moldova
and the region manage the effects of Russia’s brutal war, including $100
million announced earlier this month to help Moldova meet the needs of
refugees as well as additional financial assistance to multilateral
institutions supporting Moldova. He expressed strong support for
President Sandu’s efforts to build a more democratic and prosperous
county. He thanked her for sharing Moldova’s experience countering
corruption at last year’s Summit for Democracy and noted continued U.S.
support for these reform efforts, including through the recently
announced European Democratic Resilience Initiative. Mr. Sullivan and
President Sandu welcomed the opportunity to further strengthen bilateral
cooperation at the U.S.-Moldova Strategic Dialogue, which will be held
in Washington next week.
