title: "Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Underscores Urgent Need for Additional COVID-\u2060\
  19 Response Funding and the Severe Consequences of Congressional\_Inaction"
---
 
The Biden Administration is sounding the alarm for the urgent need for
Congress to provide funding for the nation’s COVID-19 response and is
underscoring the severe consequences of their inaction: Fewer vaccines,
treatments, and tests for the American people, and fewer shots in arms
around the world.  
  
Over the past 15 months, the Biden Administration has used the resources
Congress provided to mobilize a comprehensive COVID-19 response. As a
result, the United States has made tremendous progress in our fight
against the virus—saving over 2 million American lives, safely reopening
our schools, creating jobs at a record pace, returning to more normal
routines, and averting $900 billion in health care costs.  
  
In March, the President laid out a comprehensive National COVID-19
Preparedness Plan to keep America moving forward safely, by ensuring
that lifesaving tools like vaccines and treatments remain free and
widely available to Americans, by preparing for potential surges and new
variants, and by getting more shots in arms around the world. Executing
this plan remains essential to sustaining the progress we have made and
saving more lives. There has been an uptick in cases in parts of the
country and, while cases will continue to fluctuate, this virus has
proven itself to be unpredictable. Without funding, the United States
will be unprepared for whatever comes next.  
  
COVID-19 isn’t waiting on Congress to negotiate. Other countries will
not wait. Time is of the essence. Congress must act urgently to help
save more American lives and ensure we remain prepared.  
  
Congressional inaction on additional COVID-19 response funding means:  
  
**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Vaccines for
Americans:</span>**

-   **The Administration cannot secure enough booster shots for every
    American, if they are needed in the fall.** At this moment, the
    United States has enough supply to support one booster shot for
    Americans age 12 and over, and additional boosters for
    immunocompromised individuals and those age 50 and older. However,
    if additional booster shots are authorized and recommended for the
    general population, we will not have the supply necessary to provide
    free and easy access to them for all Americans. At this time last
    year, the Administration was contracting for future boosters that
    could ultimately be needed starting in September; this allowed us to
    make those booster shots free and widely available as soon as they
    were authorized. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    needs to begin contracting for boosters imminently so that the
    agency can conclude contractual negotiations as soon as May to
    ensure delivery of sufficient supply by September. Other countries
    are already placing orders for future needs and as a result, will
    get supply before it is available for Americans. Just yesterday,
    Pfizer submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization for its booster
    for kids ages 5 to 11. If these boosters are authorized and
    recommended, we would not have enough supply for every child in that
    age group. Not having enough supply to support booster shots for
    everyone, if needed, puts American lives at risk, and is a
    completely avoidable outcome.
-   **The Administration cannot secure new COVID-19 vaccines to protect
    against multiple variants for the American people.** Vaccine
    manufacturers are working on developing vaccines that could offer
    broader and longer-lasting protection than our existing vaccines—and
    there is ongoing discussion among scientific and medical experts,
    including FDA’s panel of outside experts, about the potential need
    for vaccines with new formulations in the future to better protect
    us from variants. Just this month, Moderna released data on a new
    vaccine that could potentially offer better protection against
    multiple variants. The company also announced that it expects to
    release data on an Omicron-specific vaccine soon. This means that
    there could be more effective vaccines available as soon as this
    fall that can enhance the protection Americans receive from getting
    vaccinated. The United States should be securing these vaccines
    today, but without funding, the Administration cannot purchase doses
    for the American people or even ensure that America is in line for
    them. This could mean people in other countries have access to the
    best lifesaving vaccines before Americans. Vaccines have proven to
    be our single-most important tool in protecting people, and the best
    ones should be available for the American people.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Treatments for
Americans:</span>**

-   **The Administration cannot restock the nation’s supply of
    lifesaving treatments.** To date, the Administration has distributed
    over 9.6 million courses of treatment across the country, working
    with states and territories, Tribes, pharmacies, federal health
    centers, and other partners to provide them to Americans for free.
    Due to a lack of funding, we have already missed the opportunity to
    purchase additional supply of these lifesaving treatments. To
    stretch our supply as much as possible, last month, the
    Administration was forced to cut the number of monoclonal antibody
    treatments distributed to states by over 30 percent. Ensuring these
    treatments remain free, widely available, and easy to access for
    people who need them is crucial to our nation moving forward safely.
-   **The Administration cannot invest in promising treatments or secure
    newer, even better treatments for the American people.** The federal
    government will not be able to invest in next-generation treatments
    that have the potential to provide broader protection against future
    variants or to treat people who may not be able to take full
    advantage of current treatments. Several candidates may be
    promising, and the United States will lose an opportunity to secure
    its spot in line and to support ramped-up manufacturing capacity of
    these treatments if we do not have funding to secure supply prior to
    a potential authorization or approval. Given COVID-19’s potential to
    mutate, it is also prudent to support and secure a range of
    effective treatments that attack the virus in different ways to
    guard against future variants.
-   **The Administration will have to scale back purchases of treatments
    that protect immunocompromised Americans.** The Administration has
    secured more than 1 million courses of Evusheld, a preventive
    therapy for immunocompromised people. Due to lack of funding, we
    have had to substantially scale back our plans to purchase
    additional supply. This therapy takes months to produce, and at this
    point, we are at risk of missing out on supply that will be
    delivered in the last few months of 2022. Congressional inaction
    will put immunocompromised individuals at greater risk as we enter
    this fall.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Tests for
Americans:</span>**

-   **The Administration cannot sustain domestic testing manufacturing
    capacity and will be unprepared for another surge in testing
    demand.** Omicron drove unprecedented demand for COVID-19 testing
    around the world. As cases have fallen dramatically, so has demand
    for testing. Demand will continue to decrease over time, and as a
    result, domestic manufacturers will start ramping down production
    across the next several weeks and months. Federal investments are a
    crucial way to preserve the domestic testing manufacturing capacity
    we have built over the last 15 months. Without these investments, it
    will take manufacturers months to ramp back up to rebuild capacity,
    so failure to invest now will leave us with insufficient testing
    capacity and supply if we see another surge in cases and demand for
    testing increases once again. This would mean empty store shelves,
    long lines at testing sites, and slower results which will have
    life-or-death consequences for people who need to take lifesaving
    treatments within days of becoming symptomatic. That should not be
    allowed to happen.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Fewer Shots in Arms Around
the World:</span>**

-   **The United States cannot supercharge our effort to get more shots
    in arms, putting us at greater risk for more variants that may prove
    to be even more dangerous than the ones we have faced to date.** The
    U.S. has now delivered over half a billion adult vaccines to 114
    countries. Countries need funding and assistance to turn vaccines
    into vaccinations. Without additional funding for our global
    response, we will not have resources to help get more shots in arms
    in countries in need—which is one of the best ways we can prevent
    future variants. We will also lack funding to provide oxygen and
    other lifesaving supplies, and our global genomic sequencing
    capabilities will fall off—undermining our ability to detect any
    emerging variants around the world.
