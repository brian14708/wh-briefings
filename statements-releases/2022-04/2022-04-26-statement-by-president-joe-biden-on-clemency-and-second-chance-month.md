title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Clemency and Second Chance\_Month"
---
 
America is a nation of laws and second chances, redemption, and
rehabilitation. Elected officials on both sides of the aisle, faith
leaders, civil rights advocates, and law enforcement leaders agree that
our criminal justice system can and should reflect these core values
that enable safer and stronger communities. During Second Chance Month,
I am using my authority under the Constitution to uphold those values by
[pardoning and
commuting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/26/clemency-recipient-list/)
the sentences of fellow Americans.

Today, I am pardoning three people who have demonstrated their
commitment to rehabilitation and are striving every day to give back and
contribute to their communities. I am also commuting the sentences of 75
people who are serving long sentences for non-violent drug offenses,
many of whom have been serving on home confinement during the
COVID-pandemic—and many of whom would have received a lower sentence if
they were charged with the same offense today, thanks to the bipartisan
First Step Act.  

My Administration is also announcing [new
steps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-expands-second-chance-opportunities-for-formerly-incarcerated-persons/)
today to support those re-entering society after incarceration. These
actions include: a new collaboration between the U.S. Department of
Justice and the U.S. Department of Labor to provide job training; new
grants for workforce development programs; greater opportunities to
serve in federal government; expanded access to capital for people with
convictions trying to start a small business; improved reentry services
for veterans; and more support for health care, housing, and educational
opportunities.  

As I laid out in my comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime, helping
those who served their time return to their families and become
contributing members of their communities is one of the most effective
ways to reduce recidivism and decrease crime. 

While today’s announcement marks important progress, my Administration
will continue to review clemency petitions and deliver reforms that
advance equity and justice, provide second chances, and enhance the
wellbeing and safety of all Americans.
