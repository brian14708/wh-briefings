President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will meet virtually with Prime Minister
Narendra Modi of India on Monday, April 11 to further deepen ties
between our governments, economies, and our people. President Biden and
Prime Minister Modi will discuss cooperation on a range of issues
including ending the COVID-19 pandemic, countering the climate crisis,
strengthening the global economy, and upholding a free, open,
rules-based international order to bolster security, democracy, and
prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. The Leaders will advance ongoing
conversations about the development of an Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework and delivering high-quality infrastructure. President Biden
will continue our close consultations on the consequences of Russiaâ€™s
brutal war against Ukraine and mitigating its destabilizing impact on
global food supply and commodity markets. Biden last spoke to Prime
