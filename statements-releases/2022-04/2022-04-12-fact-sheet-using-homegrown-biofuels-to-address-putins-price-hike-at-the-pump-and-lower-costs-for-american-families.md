title: "FACT SHEET: Using Homegrown Biofuels to Address Putin\u2019s Price Hike at\
  \ the Pump and Lower Costs for American\_Families"
---
 
The President is committed to doing everything he can to address the
pain Americans are feeling at the pump as a result of Putin’s Price
Hike. The Administration’s strategy to spur the development of homegrown
biofuels is critical to expanding Americans’ options for affordable fuel
in the short-term and to building real energy independence in the
long-term by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Today, the President
is announcing new steps to achieve that goal by increasing fuel
supplies, offering more consumer choices, and reducing gasoline prices
for Americans.

*Expanding Americans’ Access to Affordable Fuel Options This Summer*

The President will announce today that the EPA Administrator is planning
to allow E15 gasoline—gasoline that uses a 15 percent ethanol blend—to
be sold this summer. This is the latest step in expanding Americans’
access to affordable fuel supply and bringing relief to Americans
suffering from Putin’s Price Hike at the pump.

-   To make E15 available in the summer, the Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) is planning to issue a national, emergency waiver.
    Without this action, E15 cannot be used in most of the country from
    June 1<sup>st</sup> to September 15<sup>th</sup>, and the EPA plans
    to take final action to issue the emergency waiver closer to June
    1<sup>st</sup>. E15 is currently offered at 2,300 gas stations in
    the country, where it can serve as an important—and more
    affordable—source of fuel.

<!-- -->

-   An emergency waiver can help increase fuel supplies, give consumers
    more choice to get lower prices, and provide savings to many
    families. At current prices, E15 can save a family 10 cents per
    gallon of gas on average, and many stores sell E15 at an even
    greater discount. For working families—families eager to travel and
    visit their loved ones—that will add up to real savings. Allowing
    higher levels of blending will also reduce our dependency on foreign
    fuels as we rely more heavily on home-grown biofuels. This will help
    us bridge towards real energy independence.

<!-- -->

-   In implementing this emergency fuel waiver, EPA will work with
    states across the country to ensure there are no significant air
    quality impacts through the summer driving season.

<!-- -->

-   EPA is also considering additional action to facilitate the use of
    E15 year-round, including continued discussions with states who have
    expressed interest in allowing year-round use of E15 and considering
    modifications to E15 fuel pump labeling.

The announcements today build on the steps the President has taken in
recent weeks to address the Putin Price Hike and bring relief to
Americans at the gas pump.

-   President Biden worked with allies and partners through the
    International Energy Agency to authorize a historic release from
    petroleum reserves around the world, putting 240 million barrels of
    oil on the market in the next six months—more than one million
    barrels per day.

<!-- -->

-   The President called for a “use it or lose it” policy to make oil
    companies pay fees on wells from their leases that they haven’t used
    in years and on acres of public lands that they are holding without
    producing.

<!-- -->

-   The President put forward concrete steps to promote real
    independence from fossil fuels by accelerating the transition to
    clean energy, ranging from incentives for electric vehicles to
    Defense Production Act authority for large capacity batteries to a
    new partnership to reduce European reliance on natural gas.

*Enabling Energy Independence by Boosting Homegrown Biofuels*

The President believes that the actions of a dictator half a world away
should not impact what families pay at the pump here at home. Today’s
actions also reinforce the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of
achieving real energy independence and commitment to a long-term
strategy to spur smart development and adoption of sustainable,
homegrown fuels.

The Administration has announced the following key steps:

-   **$700 Million for Biofuels Producers**: As part of the Pandemic
    Assistance for Producers initiative, USDA will provide up to $700
    million in funding through a new Biofuel Producer Program. The
    Program will support agricultural producers that rely on biofuels
    producers as a market for their agricultural products. By making
    payments to producers of biofuels, the funding will help maintain a
    viable and significant market for such agricultural products.
    Producers can expect awards before the end of April.

<!-- -->

-   **$5.6 million for Infrastructure for Renewable Fuels through the
    Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program:** To expand the
    infrastructure for renewable fuels derived from U.S. agricultural
    products, USDA is announcing $5.6 million in grants through [the
    Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive
    Program](https://www.rd.usda.gov/hbiip). The purpose of the program
    is to significantly increase the sales and use of higher blends of
    ethanol and biodiesel. The awards being announced today will support
    9 projects in 7 states.

<!-- -->

-   **$100 Million for Biofuels Infrastructure**: Investing in biofuels
    infrastructure ensures that market opportunities are available for
    sustainable fuel sources—and that those sustainable fuels can reach
    consumers. That is why USDA announced $100 million in new funding
    for grants for biofuels infrastructure. The funding will provide
    grants to refueling and distribution facilities for the cost of
    installation, retrofitting or otherwise upgrading of infrastructure
    required at a location to ensure the environmentally safe
    availability of fuel containing ethanol blends of E15 and greater or
    fuel containing biodiesel blends B-20 and greater. USDA will also
    make funding available to support biofuels for railways as a means
    of assisting with supply chains and helping to reduce costs for
    consumer goods and transportation.

<!-- -->

-   **Spurring a New Market in Sustainable Aviation Fuels**: The
    Administration announced new actions to support sustainable aviation
    with a focus on low-carbon fuels that will create economic
    opportunity for agricultural communities. This included:
    -   A new Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge to inspire the
        dramatic increase in the production of sustainable aviation
        fuels to at least 3 billion gallons per year by 2030;

    <!-- -->

    -   New and ongoing funding opportunities to support sustainable
        aviation fuel projects and fuel producers totaling up to $4.3
        billion; and

    <!-- -->

    -   An increase in R&D activities to demonstrate new technologies
        that can achieve at least a 30% improvement in aircraft fuel
        efficiency.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding Use of Canola Oil:** Today, EPA is also announcing
    efforts to expand supply and choices for other forms of fuel, such
    as diesel and jet fuel. The Agency is proposing a new approval for
    canola oil that will add new pathways for fuels to participate in
    the Renewable Fuel Standard program to provide renewable diesel, jet
    fuel and other fuels. This action demonstrates EPA’s commitment to
    approving new petitions for renewable fuels that can provide
    greenhouse gas benefits as well as reduce reliance on petroleum
    fuels.

These actions are critical to building real energy independence and
protecting Americans from volatile prices by reducing our reliance on
fossil fuels. Together, they will create good-paying jobs, support
American agriculture and manufacturing, and accelerate the transition to
clean energy.
