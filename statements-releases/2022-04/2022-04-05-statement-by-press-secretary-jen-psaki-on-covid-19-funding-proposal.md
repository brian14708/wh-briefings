title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on COVID-\u206019 Funding\_Proposal"
---
 
It is disappointing that Senate Republicans voted down consideration of
a much-needed bill to purchase vaccines, boosters, and life-saving
treatments for the American people. As we have repeatedly said, there
are consequences for Congress failing to fund our COVID Response. The
program that reimbursed doctors, pharmacists and other providers for
vaccinating the uninsured had to end today due to a lack of funds.
America’s supply of monoclonal antibodies that are effective at keeping
people out of the hospital will run out as soon as late May. Our test
manufacturing capacity will begin ramping down at the end of
June. Today’s Senate vote is a step backward for our ability to respond
to this virus. We will continue to work with the House and Senate to
move this vital legislation forward.
