title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Expands Second Chance Opportunities\
  \ for Formerly Incarcerated\_Persons"
---
 
America must offer meaningful opportunities for redemption and
rehabilitation to empower those who have been incarcerated to become
productive, law-abiding, members of society, and reduce crime and make
our communities safer. Leaders on both sides of the aisle recognize that
second chance opportunities offer people who have made mistakes and
served their time a path to make meaningful contributions to their
communities and reduce recidivism. In doing so, we can break the cycle
of crime, and allow law enforcement to focus their time and resources on
the most pressing threats to public safety.  
  
Embodying the President’s belief that America is a nation of second
chances, today the President granted pardons to three people and
commuted the sentences of 75 people, all of whom have made efforts to
rehabilitate themselves, including through educational and vocational
training or drug treatment in prison.  
  
Advancing successful reentry outcomes makes our communities safer,
disrupts cycles of economic hardship, and strengthens our economy.
Improving reentry is also key part of the comprehensive
[strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/)

President Biden announced last June to tackle gun crime and violence.
And, since President Biden took office, our economy has added a record
7.9 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent. At
the same time, many industries are facing workforce shortages to meet
growing demand as their businesses flourish. America is in a prime
position to offer opportunities for meaningful employment to the more
than 600,000 people that leave prison every year—for whom securing
stable employment is among the most significant challenges.  
  
Today, during Second Chance Month, the Biden-Harris Administration is
releasing a comprehensive
[strategy ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Incarceration-to-Employment-Strategy.pdf)that
expands Incarceration to Employment opportunities, as well as the
following concrete policy actions as part of a whole-of-government
effort to advance employment, bolster reentry, empower formerly
incarcerated persons, and strengthen our communities and our economy:  
  
**Investing in Job Training and Intensive Reentry in Federal Prisons**  

-   **Launching Historic DOJ-DOL Partnership.** Today, the Department of
    Justice and the Department of Labor are announcing a
    first-of-its-kind collaboration to invest $145 million over
    FY22-FY23 to provide job skills training and individualized
    employment and reentry plans for people incarcerated in Bureau of
    Prisons (BOP) facilities, and to provide pathways for a seamless
    transition to employment and reentry support upon release. This
    landmark initiative is part of the Department of Justice’s
    implementation of the First Step Act, and it will be the first time
    the Department of Labor will bring its job training and reentry
    support and expertise to federal prisoners.

**Expanding Federal Job Opportunities and Loan Programs**

-   **Providing New Workforce Grant Funding.** The Department of Labor
    has announced solicitations for grants totaling $140 million to
    advance job opportunities:  
    -   [**Growth
        Opportunities**](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/grants/pdfs/FOA-ETA-22-03_.pdf)
        is a new $85 million program that will provide education and
        training, paid work experience, mentorship, and leadership
        development to justice-involved youth and young adults.  
    -   [**Pathway
        Home**](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/grants/pdfs/FOA-ETA-22-04%20.pdf)
        will fund $55 million for job training, pre-apprenticeship
        programs, digital literacy training, and pre-release and
        post-release career counseling for justice-involved adults.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding Access to Business Capital.** This week, the Small
    Business Administration (SBA) will publish changes publish [proposed
    regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/current)
    that remove barriers to federal employment for formerly incarcerated
    individuals under the bipartisan Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs
    Act. Once enacted, these regulations will expand the positions
    covered by the federal government’s “ban the box” policy, which
    delays inquiries into an applicant’s criminal history a conditional
    offer has been made. The regulations also create new procedures that
    outline due process and accountability steps for hiring officials
    who are alleged to have violated the “ban the box” procedures.   
-   **Leveraging Historic Investments in Infrastructure to Promote
    Hiring of Formerly Incarcerated Persons.** The Department of
    Transportation is expanding access to jobs for formerly incarcerated
    persons and historically marginalized populations in bipartisan
    Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act grant programs, including the
    [RAISE Grants](https://www.transportation.gov/RAISEgrants), [INFRA
    Grants](https://www.transportation.gov/grants/infra-grants-program),
    and the [Port Infrastructure Development
    Program](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/PIDPgrants).  
-   **Promoting Best Practices with Federal Construction Industry
    Contractors.** Given the landmark level of funding available under
    the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to the
    construction industry and provisions in those grant programs aimed
    at expanding access to project jobs for formerly incarcerated
    persons, it is critical that federal contractors and subcontractors
    comply with the law. This is why the Department of Labor’s Office of
    Federal Contracting and Compliance Programs (OFCCP) issued [new
    guidance](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOLOFCCP/bulletins/3136722)
    to federal contractors and subcontractors that underscores its
    earlier
    [directive](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/directives/2013-02)
    that criminal background check policies, which may have a disparate
    impact on protected classes, may violate existing nondiscrimination
    obligations.  OFCCP also developed compliance assistance materials
    for contractors including a
    [webinar](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/compliance-assistance/outreach/webinars),
    [Construction Compliance
    FAQs](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/faqs/construction-compliance), and
    a
    [training](https://ofccptraining.dol.gov/catalog/construction-compliance-review-contractors).
    OFCCP has also
    [released](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOLOFCCP/bulletins/2ef6204)
    a new memorandum identifying 400 federal contractors and
    subcontractors who have been neutrally selected to undergo a full
    compliance review of their hiring practices to ensure people with
    arrest and conviction records are not being discriminated against.  
-   **Expanding Second Chance Visiting Fellowship Program. **The
    Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) [brought
    on two new Second Chance
    Fellows ](https://www.ojp.gov/blog/second-chance-fellows-john-bae-and-angel-sanchez)who
    were formerly incarcerated to help develop reentry policy. For the
    first time, one of those Fellows will work with the Department of
    Education (ED) on educational policy for carceral settings and upon
    reentry.

**Promoting Best Practices for Hiring Across the Federal Government**

-   **Providing Interactive Training and Technical Assistance for Job
    Seekers.** The Office of Personnel Management has published
    [detailed guidance](https://chcoc.gov/content/second-chance-month)
    for applicants with arrest and conviction records who are interested
    in federal employment. To further support them, OPM is hosting
    interactive sessions between federal agencies’ Human Resources
    practitioners and applicants with arrest and conviction records.  
-   **Leveraging** **Existing Hiring Authorities for Agencies.** OPM
    will host a [training webinar](https://secondchance.eventbrite.com)
    on April 28 to assist federal hiring officials, human resource and
    DEIA practitioners, and supervisors with leveraging existing federal
    hiring authorities to recruit and hire formerly incarcerated persons
    into the federal government.

**Supporting Veterans**  

-   **Expediting the Restoration of Benefits**. In partnership with the
    Social Security Administration and the Bureau of Prisons, the
    Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veterans Benefits Administration
    [announced](https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5780)
    a new effort to automate information-sharing among these agencies to
    accelerate benefit restoration and reduce the administrative burden
    for veterans.  
-   **Conducting Outreach to Incarcerated Veterans. ** The VA
    [announced](https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5780)
    new efforts to increase the number of state prisons and jails that
    use its Veterans Reentry Search Service, which helps identify
    veterans in their custody and connect them with reentry services.

**Expanding Access to Health Care and Housing**  

-   **Expanding Access to Health Care.** The Department of Health and
    Human Services is
    [proposing](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-4199-p.pdf) to
    establish a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) of six months
    post-release for Medicare for people who missed an enrollment period
    while incarcerated, which would reduce potential gaps in coverage
    and late enrollment penalties.  
-   **Expanding Access to Housing.** The Department of Housing and Urban
    Development announced that it has [initiated a 6-month comprehensive
    review](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Main/documents/Memo_on_Criminal_Records.pdf)
    of its existing regulations and guidance to identify how HUD
    programs can increase their inclusivity of people with arrest and
    conviction records.

**Developing and Amplifying Educational Opportunities**

-   **Expanding Second Chance Pell.** ED will select 73 additional
    schools to
    [expand](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-expansion-second-chance-pell-program-and-actions-help-incarcerated-individuals-resume-educational-journeys-and-reduce-recidivism)
    its Second Chance Pell Initiative. The expansion of the program into
    these schools will ultimately provide access to thousands of
    additional students. First established in 2015 by the Obama-Biden
    Administration, the Second Chance Pell Initiative provides Pell
    Grants to incarcerated individuals to participate in postsecondary
    education programs. This expansion of sites will help the Department
    to prepare for full expansion of Pell Grant eligibility to
    incarcerated students in July 2023.  
-   **Providing a Pathway Out of Loan Default.** ED will also announce
    [changes](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-expansion-second-chance-pell-program-and-actions-help-incarcerated-individuals-resume-educational-journeys-and-reduce-recidivism)
    to policies to help incarcerated individuals get out of loan default
    to access Pell Grants. In the short term, incarcerated persons who
    have defaulted will get a “fresh start.” Like other defaulted
    borrowers, incarcerated borrowers with defaulted loans will reenter
    repayment in good standing when the student loan payment pause ends.
    ED is also announcing a longer-term fix that will take place after
    “fresh start” is implemented: it will allow incarcerated persons to
    consolidate their loans to get out of default. Incarcerated persons
    interested in enrolling in Second Chance Pell were twice as likely
    as the broader population to be turned away because of defaulted
    loans. This change will now allow incarcerated persons the same
    opportunity to get out of default as non-incarcerated persons.  
-   **Investing in Digital Literacy.** The Department of Commerce’s
    [Digital Equity Planning
    Grant](https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/resources/grant-programs/digital-equity-programs),
    funded by the bipartisan Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act,
    will provide $60 million to states and Puerto Rico to invest in
    digital literacy and equity programs for underserved communities, 
    including incarcerated and formerly incarcerated persons.  
-   **Publishing New Guidance on Correctional and Reentry Education
    Resources.** ED published
    [guidance](https://cte.ed.gov/yadiversion/) to states and localities
    on how to divert young adults from the juvenile and criminal justice
    system. ED also published new
    [guidance](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/AdultEd/take-charge-your-future.pdf)
    for incarcerated persons seeking educational opportunities,
    summarizing the resources available to support them.

**Supporting Job Seekers and Establishing Best Practices for Employers**

-   **Tax Credits and Free Bonding Programs for Employers.** DOL
    developed [new
    resources](https://reo.workforcegps.org/resources/2022/04/06/17/28/Reentry-Employment-Opportunities-Recognizes-April-as-Second-Chance-Month)
    for justice-involved job seekers, reentry service providers, and
    employers to learn about existing federal reentry employment
    incentives including the [Federal Bonding
    Program](https://bonds4jobs.com/) and the [Work Opportunity Tax
    Credit](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/work-opportunity-tax-credit).  
-   **Resources for Employers, Job Seekers, and Employees.** The Equal
    Employment Opportunity Commission’s new [landing
    page](https://www.eeoc.gov/arrestandconviction) centralizes existing
    resources on the use of arrest and conviction records in employment
    decisions, and other technical assistance documents for employers
    and job seekers.  
-   **Supporting Reentry 2030.** DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA
     partnered with the Council of State Governments (CSG) to launch the
    [national Reentry 2030
    campaign](https://bja.ojp.gov/events/advancing-successful-reintegration-every-person-reentry-2030-national-launch#:~:text=Reentry%202030%20is%20a%20partnership,towards%20their%20Reentry%202030%20goals.),
    which will work with state leaders to set public reentry goals to
    achieve better economic mobility and outcomes for persons exiting
    prison, parole or probation by 2030.  
-   **Promoting Resources for Second Chance Month. **The National
    Reentry Resource Center (NRRC) is [hosting a
    series](https://nationalreentryresourcecenter.org/second-chance-month-april-2022-calendar)
    of live training and technical assistance events for Second Chance
    Act grantees as well as the public in honor of Second Chance
    Month.  
-   **Reentry Toolkit.** The [National Reentry Resource
    Center](https://nationalreentryresourcecenter.org) launched the
    Bureau of Justice Assistance’s [Reentry
    Toolkit](http://www.reentrytoolkit.org/) for local reentry coalition
    leaders and community leaders to allow assessment of existing
    reentry efforts and opportunities to strengthen outcomes for
    incarcerated persons in their communities. The NRRC will also
    continue to host its searchable database of reentry resources.
