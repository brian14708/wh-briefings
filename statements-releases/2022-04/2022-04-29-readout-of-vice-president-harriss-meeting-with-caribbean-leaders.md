Vice President Kamala Harris met virtually today with 15 leaders
representing Caribbean nations and underscored the importance the
Biden-Harris Administration places on our partnerships throughout the
Caribbean. The Vice President made clear the United States is committed
to work with our Caribbean neighbors to advance cooperation on economic
recovery, the climate crisis, and security, among other areas of mutual
concern.     
   
As part of the Administration’s commitment to continued engagement
within the Caribbean, the Vice President proposed an annual meeting of
this group to continue high-level discussions.   
   
The Vice President discussed economic recovery following the COVID-19
pandemic and reaffirmed that equitable economic growth in the Caribbean
is a priority. As the United States is the region’s largest economic
partner, the Vice President and the leaders discussed ways to further
facilitate trade and attract U.S. investment.  
   
On security, the Vice President informed the leaders that the United
States will expand our assistance to the Caribbean through the Caribbean
Basin Security Initiative (CBSI). The Vice President discussed new
funding to combat firearms trafficking, enhance maritime security, and
support training for police and others.

climate crisis and the transition to clean energy. They discussed ways

and enhance resilience and adaptive capacity to withstand the impacts of
