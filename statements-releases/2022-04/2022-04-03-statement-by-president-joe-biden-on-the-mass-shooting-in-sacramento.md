title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Mass Shooting in Sacramento
---
 
Today, America once again mourns for another community devastated by gun
violence. In a single act in Sacramento, six individuals left dead and
at least a dozen more injured. Families forever changed. Survivors left
to heal wounds both visible and invisible.

I want to thank the first responders in Sacramento, and all those across
the United States, who act every day to save lives. We know these lives
were not the only lives impacted by gun violence last night. And we
equally mourn for those victims and families who do not make national
headlines.

But we must do more than mourn; we must act. That is why my
Administration has taken historic executive action to implement my
comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy — from standing up gun
trafficking strike forces to helping cities across the country expand
community violence interventions and hire more police officers for
community policing.

We also continue to call on Congress to act. Ban ghost guns. Require
background checks for all gun sales. Ban assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines. Repeal gun manufacturers’ immunity from
liability. Pass my budget proposal, which would give cities more of the
funding they need to fund the police and fund the crime prevention and
intervention strategies that can make our cities safer. These are just a
few of the steps Congress urgently needs to take to save lives.
