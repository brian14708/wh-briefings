On April 28, the U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security met in person in
Washington to discuss implementation of the [March 25 Joint
Statement](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/25/joint-statement-between-the-united-states-and-the-european-commission-on-european-energy-security/)
by Presidents Biden and von der Leyen.   
   
The meeting, chaired by Amos Hochstein, U.S. Senior Advisor for Energy
Security, and Björn Seibert, Head of Cabinet of the European Commission
President, reviewed progress on diversifying natural gas supplies to
Europe and reducing Europe’s demand for natural gas. The discussion
followed two recent Task Force convenings that included senior U.S. and
European Commission officials, representatives of EU Member States, and
industry participants.  
   
The sides also discussed the EU Energy Purchase Platform and plans to
establish a framework to accelerate diversification of gas supply,
including additional LNG supplies. The sides also discussed options to
reduce Europe’s demand for natural gas, including with the deployment of
heat pumps, technologies that promote energy efficiency and savings such
as smart thermostats, and renewable energy.  
   
In the coming weeks, work will continue at technical and senior
officials’ levels, and the Task Force decided to reconvene in person in
June, to assess progress on the workplan.
