Tonight, Jewish communities in the United States, Israel, and around the
world will celebrate Passover, a holiday whose ancient story has
inspired humanity for millennia. 

For many, this will mark the first time in three years that families and
friends will be able to gather around the Seder table – a testament to
the life-saving miracle of modern medicine and the progress we’ve made
to address an unforgiving pandemic.

Together again, we will commemorate the Exodus of the enslaved
Israelites from Egypt. And we will retell a timeless story about that
most human quest for freedom. Redemption. Faith. Hope. And, ultimately,
deliverance. A story that has brought solace and a sense of promise to
Jewish communities throughout their history as they endured acts of
persecution, pogroms, and even genocide. And one that inspired and
empowered oppressed peoples everywhere who, even in their deepest
despair, sensed that their own liberation was not beyond reach.

This Passover, we hold in our hearts the people of Ukraine and those
around the world whose heroic stand against tyranny inspires us all. The
enduring spirit of this holiday continues to teach us that with faith,
the driest desert can be crossed, the mightiest sea can be split, and
hope never stops marching towards the promised land. 

To all those celebrating this Festival of Freedom, Jill and I wish you
and your loved ones a Happy Passover. *Chag Sameach*!
