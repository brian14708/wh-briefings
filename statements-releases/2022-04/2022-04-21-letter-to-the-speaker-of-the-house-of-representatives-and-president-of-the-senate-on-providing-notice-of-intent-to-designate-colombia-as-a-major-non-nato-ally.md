Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

In accordance with section 517 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as
amended (22 U.S.C. 2321k), I am providing notice of my intent to
designate Colombia as a Major Non-NATO Ally.

I am making this designation in recognition of the importance of the
U.S.-Colombia relationship and Colombia’s crucial contributions to
regional and international security.

                               Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
