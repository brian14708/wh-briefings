title: "FACT SHEET: White\_House Releases 2022 National Drug Control Strategy that\
  \ Outlines Comprehensive Path Forward to Address Addiction and the Overdose\_Epidemic"
---
 
Today, President Biden sent his Administration’s inaugural [*National
Drug Control
Strategy*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/National-Drug-Control-2022Strategy.pdf)
to Congress at a time when drug overdoses have taken a heartbreaking
toll, claiming 106,854 lives in the most recent 12-month period. The
[*Strategy*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/National-Drug-Control-2022Strategy.pdf)
delivers on the call to action in President Biden’s Unity Agenda through
a whole-of-government approach to beat the overdose epidemic.

The
[*Strategy*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/National-Drug-Control-2022Strategy.pdf)
focuses on two critical drivers of the epidemic: untreated addiction and
drug trafficking. It instructs federal agencies to prioritize actions
that will save lives, get people the care they need, go after drug
traffickers’ profits, and make better use of data to guide all these
efforts.

**Addressing Untreated Addiction for Those At-Risk of an Overdose**  
According to the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, among the
41.1 million people who needed treatment for substance use disorders
(SUD), only 2.7 million (6.5-percent) of them received treatment at a
specialty treatment facility over the previous year. One reason for this
gap is that people with addiction and those who care for them face too
many barriers to treatment. Similarly, key tools like naloxone and
syringe services programs are often restricted or underfunded at the
community level, which limits access for people who use drugs. For
example, some states still have legal barriers that limit access to
naloxone, and even in states where those barriers don’t exist, naloxone
does not always make it to those most at-risk of an overdose. The
President’s National Drug Control Strategy is the first-ever to champion
harm reduction to meet people where they are and engage them in care and
services. It also calls for actions that will expand access to
evidence-based treatments that have been shown to reduce overdose risk
and mortality. Finally, it emphasizes the need to develop stronger data
collection and analysis systems to better deploy public health
interventions.

-   **Expand high-impact harm reduction interventions like naloxone  
      
    **The Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts focus on meeting people
    where they are, and building trust and engagement with them to
    provide care and services. Specifically, the Strategy calls for
    greater access to harm reduction interventions including naloxone,
    drug test strips, and syringe services programs. It directs federal
    agencies to integrate harm reduction into the U.S system of care to
    save lives and increase access to treatment. It also calls for
    collaboration on harm reduction between public health and public
    safety officials, and changes in state laws and policies to support
    the expansion of harm reduction efforts across the country.  
-   **Ensure those at highest-risk of an overdose can access
    evidence-based treatment  
      
    **The Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to expand access to
    treatment are focused around delivering treatment to those at the
    highest-risk of overdosing, which includes people experiencing
    homelessness, those who are incarcerated or re-entering society, and
    people who inject drugs. The Strategy directs federal agencies to
    take actions that meet people who need treatment where they are,
    improves the quality of treatment to include payment reform,
    supports those at-risk of an overdose, and builds up the Nation’s
    treatment workforce and infrastructure. It also includes a chapter
    on Criminal Justice that focuses on direct actions that will improve
    the delivery of evidence-based treatment when appropriate for people
    in carceral settings or in the reentry process in addition to other
    justice-impacted persons.  
-   **Improve data systems and research that guide drug policy
    development.**  
      
    The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to deploying an
    evidence-based approach to policy-making as directed in the
    Presidential Memorandum on scientific integrity and evidence-based
    policymaking. Development of effective drug policy requires timely
    and rigorous data covering the full range of trends and activities,
    including consumption patterns, drug use consequences, prevention,
    harm reduction, treatment, recovery, drug production, transportation
    and distribution by drug trafficking organizations, and many more.
    The Strategy directs relevant agencies to strengthen existing data
    systems, establish new data systems, including for non-fatal
    overdoses, and enhance the usefulness of drug data for
    practitioners, researchers and policy-makers.

**  
Going After Drug Trafficking and Illicit Drug Profits**  
Law enforcement agencies at all levels—federal, state, local, Tribal,
and territorial—work to reduce domestic and international cultivated and
synthetic drug production and trafficking with the goal of protecting
Americans. However, drug producers continue to produce entirely new
synthetic drugs, and drug traffickers continue to refine their methods
and techniques for distributing them throughout our communities.

The Strategy builds on the [President’s FY 23 budget
request](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FY-2023-ONDCP-CONGRESSIONAL-BUDGET-SUBMISSION.pdf)
for a $300 million increase to support the work of Customs and Border
Protection (CBP)–one of the largest ever increases for CBP–and for a
$300 million increase for the Drug Enforcement Administration. The
Strategy prioritizes a targeted response to drug traffickers and
transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) by hitting them where it
hurts the most: their wallets. It also includes efforts to strengthen
domestic law enforcement cooperation to disrupt the trafficking of
illicit drugs within the United States, and increase collaboration with
international partners to disrupt the supply chain of illicit substances
and the precursor chemicals used to produce them. Lastly, the National
Drug Control Strategy includes three companion documents that direct
Federal agencies to take actions that stop the trafficking of drugs
across our Caribbean, Northern, and Southwest Borders.

-   **Obstruct and disrupt financial activities of transnational
    criminal organizations (TCOs) that manufacture illicit drugs and
    traffic them into the United States  
      
    **The illicit drugs smuggled throughout the world generate enormous
    revenue, which must be moved and laundered so that traffickers can
    profit from their illicit enterprise.TCOs also require funds to
    operate their illicit supply chains and exert their transnational
    corruptive influence. While bulk cash smuggling remains one of the
    predominant methods for moving illicit proceeds, smugglers also use
    trade-based money laundering (TBML) such as Black-Market Peso
    Exchanges and mirror transfers via informal networks. Additionally,
    TCOs are adept at using darknet markets and virtual assets to
    launder funds. The National Drug Control Strategy directs agencies
    to strengthen and employ every available tool, and seek new ones, to
    uncover financial networks to obstruct and disrupt the illicit
    financial activities that fund the TCOs who produce and traffic
    illicit drugs into the United States.  
-   **Reduce the supply of illicit drugs through domestic collaboration
    and international coordination.**  
      
    The Strategy directs federal agencies to improve cooperation across
    all levels of government to strengthen our domestic response to drug
    trafficking; commercially disrupt the production, trafficking, and
    distribution of illicit substances; improve assessment of supply
    reduction initiatives; and protect individuals and the environment
    at home from criminal exploitation. The Strategy also aims to
    strengthen foreign partnerships to address drug production and
    trafficking, leverage the influence of multilateral organizations to
    tackle shared challenge of synthetic drugs, and protect individuals
    and the environment abroad from criminal exploitation by those
    involved in drug trafficking.  
-   **Reduce the supply of illicit drugs smuggled across our
    borders.**  
      
    The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on stopping drugs from
    entering our communities. The President’s National Drug Control
    Strategy includes specific border strategies that direct federal
    agencies to strengthen interdiction and law enforcement capabilities
    on our Nation’s borders, counter criminal networks, disrupt illicit
    finance efforts, target drug transportation routes and modalities,
    and otherwise aggressively reduce the trafficking of illicit drugs.
    The Strategy also directs agencies to work with partner governments
    in drug producing and transit countries to prevent illicit drugs
    from ever reaching our borders.

In addition, the Strategy directs federal agencies to expand efforts to
prevent substance use among school-aged children and young adults, and
support community-led coalitions implementing evidence-based prevention
strategies across the country. It directs federal agencies to expand
scientific understanding of the recovery process by establishing a
federal recovery research agenda; adopt flexible, responsive approaches
that help people with SUD find and follow a pathway to recovery or
remission that works for them; and eliminate barriers and increase
economic opportunities for people in recovery. And the Strategy includes
specific actions to improve access to medication for opioid use disorder
(MOUD) programs for jails and prisons; identify ways to advance racial
equity in the investigation, arrest, and sentencing for drug related
offenses without negatively impacting public safety; divert non-violent
individuals from the criminal justice system and juvenile justice
systems to treatment when appropriate; and remove barriers and expand
supportive  services to help reintegrate people into society after
incarceration.
