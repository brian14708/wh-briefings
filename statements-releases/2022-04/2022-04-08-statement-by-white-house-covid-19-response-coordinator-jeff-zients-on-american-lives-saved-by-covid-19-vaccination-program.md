title: "Statement by White\_House COVID-\u206019 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients\
  \ on American Lives Saved by the COVID-\u206019 Vaccination\_Program"

A [new
study](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/impact-us-covid-19-vaccination-efforts-march-update)
out today from the Commonwealth Fund shows that President Biden’s
relentless efforts to get Americans vaccinated saved millions of
American lives. Our vaccination campaign saved 2.2 million American
lives, prevented 17 million hospitalizations, prevented 66 million
COVID-19 cases, and avoided $900 billion in health care costs.

This is the result of the Biden Administration’s efforts to use every
tool to make vaccinations easy and convenient for every American,
Congress providing us the vital resources we needed, and the American
people stepping up and doing their part.

We mounted a historic vaccination effort and invested in tests and
treatments – empowering Americans with more tools than ever before to
protect themselves. Together, we’ve spared millions of families the
immeasurable loss that too many others have suffered, and turned
unthinkable pain into extraordinary purpose and progress.

Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress are now holding up critical
funding we need to make even more progress – to save even more lives.
Make no mistake: Inaction will leave our nation less prepared for any
future surges and variants. It will mean fewer vaccines, treatments, and
tests for the American people. This is deeply disappointing – and it
should be unacceptable to every American. We’ve worked too hard and come
too far to leave ourselves and our economy vulnerable to an
unpredictable virus. The virus is not waiting on Congress to negotiate.
Congress must act with urgency.
