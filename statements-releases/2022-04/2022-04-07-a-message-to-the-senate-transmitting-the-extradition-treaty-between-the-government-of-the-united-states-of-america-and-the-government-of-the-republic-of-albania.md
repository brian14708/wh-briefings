title: "A Message to the Senate transmitting the Extradition Treaty between the Government\
  \ of the United\_States of America and the Government of the Republic of\_Albania"
---
 
TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
   With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the
Republic of Albania (the “Treaty”), signed at Tirana on December 22,
2020.  I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of
the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.

   The Treaty would replace the extradition treaty between the United
States and Albania, signed at Tirana on March 1, 1933.  The Treaty
follows generally the form and content of other extradition treaties
recently concluded by the United States.  It would replace an outmoded
list of extraditable offenses with a modern “dual criminality” approach,
which would enable extradition for such offenses as money laundering,
cyber-related crimes, and other newer offenses not appearing on the
list.  The Treaty also contains a modernized “political offense” clause
and provides that extradition shall not be refused based on the
nationality of the person sought.  Finally, the Treaty incorporates a
series of procedural improvements to streamline and expedite the
extradition process.

   I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to
the Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.

 JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. 

THE WHITE HOUSE,
