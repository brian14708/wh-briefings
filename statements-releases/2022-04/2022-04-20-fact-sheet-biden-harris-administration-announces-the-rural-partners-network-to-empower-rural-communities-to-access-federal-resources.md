title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces the Rural Partners\
  \ Network to Empower Rural Communities to Access Federal\_Resources"
---
 
President Biden is committed to ensuring federal resources and
opportunities that can benefit rural America actually reach rural
America. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching the **Rural
Partners Network (RPN),** a new whole-of-government effort led by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to transform the way federal
agencies partner with rural places to create economic opportunity.

The Biden-Harris Administration is investing historic resources in rural
communities so they can continue to compete and succeed in the
21<sup>st</sup> century. The President’s American Rescue Plan provided
billions of dollars to rural workers, local governments, and small
businesses to rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Biden’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a once-in-a-generation investment in
affordable high-speed internet, clean drinking water, clean and reliable
electricity, and better roads and bridges for rural communities across
America. However, just making resources available is not enough—the
federal government must better serve rural communities, so that they can
take full advantage of these unprecedented opportunities.

To transform how the federal government partners with and delivers
economic opportunity for rural communities across the United States, RPN
will bring the federal government to rural America. New federal field
staff will be placed in more than 25 rural communities in multiple U.S.
states, Tribal Nations and territories to help local leaders navigate
and access the federal resources they need to build a strong and vibrant
economy. Through this unique partnership, RPN staff will also identify
challenges preventing rural communities from accessing federal support
to inform the work of the Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council, a
whole-of-government task force that will ensure rural places are
prioritized in Washington. RPN communities will have a new direct line
to D.C. to foster a federal government that delivers for *all* rural
communities.

To begin making the federal government work better for rural America,
the Rural Partners Network is:

**Helping rural communities identify and leverage critical resources
with the partnership of on-the-ground federal staff**.

To boost local capacity, the Biden Administration will deploy new RPN
staff to help communities access the full breadth of federal resources
for community-led economic development, working in close coordination
with: local leaders in government, business, and community
organizations; federal agency field offices; existing federal efforts
such as [Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities
and Economic Revitalization](https://energycommunities.gov/) and the
President’s [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/);
and staff of the Regional Commissions. RPN Directors will be placed in
states, territories and Tribal Nations to coordinate RPN activities, and
RPN Liaisons will be placed in selected community networks to work with
local leaders on an economic development vision and to secure the funds
to make it a reality. 

While these staff will be funded by USDA, they will have a
whole-of-government mandate: help rural communities create economic
opportunity by leveraging resources from all federal departments and
agencies. To support this effort, 13 key agencies are dedicating a
D.C.-based point person or team to serve as a front door for RPN staff
and communities as they navigate the resources available across the
federal government. These agencies participate in regular convenings of
the Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council, co-led by the White
House Domestic Policy Council and USDA.

Today, the Biden Administration is announcing the launch of this new
program in selected community networks this year. In cohort 1, by the
end of May, RPN staff will be on the ground supporting selected
community networks in the following states and Tribal Nations:

-   **Arizona**:
    -   San Carlos Apache Tribe

    <!-- -->

    -   Tohono O’odham Nation

    <!-- -->

    -   Cocopah Indian Tribe
-   **Georgia**
    -   Southwest Georgia Regional Commission: Counties of Mitchell,
        Baker, Calhoun, Colquitt, Decatur, Dougherty, Early, Grady, Lee,
        Seminole, Miller, Terrell, Thomas, and Worth

    <!-- -->

    -   Ben Hill County and City of Fitzgerald

    <!-- -->

    -   Emanuel County and City of Twin City
-   **Kentucky**
    -   Fulton County Partnership\***:** Cities of Fulton, Hickman, and
        Cayce

    <!-- -->

    -   Kentucky Highlands: Counties of Bell\*, Perry\*, Harlan\*,
        Leslie\*, Letcher\*, Whitley, Knox, Clay\*
-   **Mississippi**
    -   Washington County Economic Alliance: Counties of Washington,
        Bolivar, Sunflower, and Leflore

    <!-- -->

    -   Greater Grenada-Lake District: Counties of Grenada and Yalobusha

    <!-- -->

    -   North Delta Planning and Development Collaborative: Counties of
        Coahoma, Quitman, and Tunica
-   **New Mexico**
    -   Northern New Mexico Pathways: Counties of San Miguel, Taos,
        Mora, and Colfax

    <!-- -->

    -   Southwest New Mexico Council of Governments: Counties of Catron,
        Grant, Hidalgo, and Luna

    <!-- -->

    -   Mesilla Valley Partnership: Doña Ana County

\*Priority Energy Community as determined by the Interagency Working
Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization.

These states and community networks were selected by USDA based on
quantitative and qualitative factors, including levels of economic
distress and readiness of the communities and local stakeholder
organizations to participate in RPN. As part of the selection process,
USDA conducted community engagement sessions with local community
leaders. The communities themselves determined the composition of their
networks.

In addition to this first cohort, RPN will expand to **Nevada, North
Carolina, Puerto Rico, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Tribal communities
in Alaska** in a second cohort to launch by the end of August. If
provided the support from Congress requested in the President’s FY23
Budget, RPN will continue expanding to ultimately serve all 50 states,
as well as more Tribal Nations and territories.

**Empowering rural communities to foster a federal government that
better delivers for rural America.** RPN field staff will be tasked with
feeding key information to federal agencies on community needs and
barriers to accessing federal resources. Agencies will then take this
information and use it to drive policy changes that address the unique
challenges faced by rural communities. As a result, RPN will not only
support selected RPN community networks but inform changes that make the
federal government better deliver for all rural communities.

Through this new direct line between rural communities and Washington,
D.C., the Biden Administration will change business as usual and work
across agencies to coordinate technical assistance to rural communities,
share rural data and measures of success, and align grant requirements.
Members of Congress across the political spectrum have called for this
whole-of-government approach, including U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez
Masto, Joni Ernst, Kirsten Gillibrand, Chuck Grassley, and Mark Kelly,
and U.S. Representatives Angie Craig, Dan Newhouse, Cindy Axne, Adrian
Smith, Tom O’Halleran, and Randy Feenstra.

The federal agencies and regional commissions participating in the Rural
Prosperity Interagency Policy Council include:

-   Department of Agriculture
-   Department of Commerce
-   Department of Education
-   Department of Energy
-   Department of Health and Human Services
-   Department of Housing and Urban Development
-   Department of the Interior
-   Department of Labor
-   Department of Transportation
-   Department of the Treasury
-   Department of Veterans Affairs
-   Environmental Protection Agency
-   Small Business Administration
-   Appalachian Regional Commission
-   Delta Regional Authority
-   Denali Commission
-   Northern Border Regional Commission

**Creating new whole-of-government resources for rural communities.**
Agencies will contribute to whole-of-government rural economic
development resource guides and other informational material that will
help all rural communities better identify and access federal funds.
Agencies will also proactively conduct outreach to rural communities and
rural leaders to disseminate information, offer technical assistance
support, and seek input regarding the economic development barriers they
face and support they need.
