title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting on Reproductive Health and Rights with State\
  \ Legislators from Missouri, Nebraska, and\_Oklahoma"
---
 
Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and
Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director,
hosted a roundtable discussion with state legislators from Missouri,
Nebraska, and Oklahoma to discuss their efforts to protect access to
reproductive health care, in light of a series of unconstitutional
attacks on women’s reproductive rights.

During the meeting, state legislators reported on abortion restrictions
in their states and shared steps they have taken to oppose new
legislative proposals. Leaders in Oklahoma described the potential
impact of recently-passed S 612, which makes providing an abortion a
criminal offense in the state, with narrow exceptions. Nebraska
lawmakers shared their recent success in fighting a trigger ban, which
failed on the legislature floor earlier this month and would have banned
abortion in the state if *Roe* were overturned. State legislators from
Missouri described their efforts to oppose a number of pending
restrictions. All participants underscored the devastating impact these
bills would have on access to critical reproductive health care
services, especially for low-income populations and those living in
rural communities.

Senior Administration officials underscored the Administration’s support
for reproductive rights and determination to protect access to health
care. They thanked the legislators for their leadership in opposing and
raising awareness about these dangerous bills, and made it clear that
the Administration stands with them in the fight to protect reproductive
health care.

The legislation discussed today is just a sample of the onerous and
unconstitutional restrictions that have passed or are pending in states
across the nation. In light of this wholesale attack on reproductive
rights, Administration officials reiterated the President’s support for
the constitutional right affirmed in *Roe v. Wade* and his commitment to
protect women’s access to critical reproductive health care.

State legislators participated in today’s meeting included:

-   Missouri Senator Jill Schupp
-   Missouri Representative Emily Weber
-   Nebraska Senator Machaela Cavanaugh
-   Nebraska Senator Adam Morfeld
-   Oklahoma House Minority Leader Emily Virgin
-   Oklahoma Representative Forrest Bennett
-   Oklahoma Representative Ajay Pittman
