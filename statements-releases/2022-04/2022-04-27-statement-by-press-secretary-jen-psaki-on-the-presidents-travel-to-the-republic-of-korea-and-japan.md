President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will visit the Republic of Korea and
Japan from May 20-May 24 to further deepen ties between our governments,
economies, and people. This trip will advance the Biden-Harris
Administration’s rock-solid commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific
and to U.S. treaty alliances with the Republic of Korea and Japan. It
will build on more than a year of intensive diplomacy with the
Indo-Pacific, including the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit on May 12-13 in
Washington, D.C. In each country, President Biden will hold bilateral
meetings with his counterparts: newly elected President Yoon Suk Yeol of
the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan. The
leaders will discuss opportunities to deepen our vital security
relationships, enhance economic ties, and expand our close cooperation
to deliver practical results. In Tokyo, President Biden will also meet
with the leaders of the Quad grouping of Australia, Japan, India, and
the United States. We look forward to having further details to share
about this trip soon.
