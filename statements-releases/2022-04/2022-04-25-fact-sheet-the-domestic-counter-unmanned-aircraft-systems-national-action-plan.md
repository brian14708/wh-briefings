title: "FACT SHEET: The Domestic Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems National Action\_\
  Plan"
---
 
Over the last decade, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS or “drones”) have
become a regular feature of American life. We use them for recreation,
for research, and for commerce. But the proliferation of this new
technology has also introduced new risks to public safety, privacy, and
homeland security.  Malicious actors have increasingly used UAS
domestically to commit crimes, conduct illegal surveillance and
industrial espionage, and thwart law enforcement efforts at the local,
state and Federal level.  
  
Today, the Biden Administration is releasing the first
whole-of-government plan to address UAS threats in the Homeland. Through
the **Domestic Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems National Action Plan**,
the Administration is working to expand *where* we can protect against
nefarious UAS activity, *who* is authorized to take action, and *how* it
can be accomplished lawfully. The Plan seeks to achieve this legitimate
expansion while safeguarding the airspace, communications spectrums,
individual privacy, civil liberties and civil rights. To achieve this
balance, the Administration is calling on Congress to adopt legislation
to close critical gaps in existing law and policy that currently impede
government and law enforcement from protecting the American people and
our vital security interests.  
  
UAS serve many beneficial commercial and recreational purposes.  As has
been the case with many technological advances, they can also be
exploited for pernicious purposes.  To protect our Homeland and prevent
their growing use from threatening the safety and security of our
people, our communities, and our institutions, this Counter-UAS National
Action Plan will set new ground rules for the expanding uses of UAS and
improve our defenses against the exploitation of UAS for inappropriate
or dangerous purposes.  
  
***Recommendations***  
The Plan provides eight key recommendations for action:

1.  Work with Congress to enact a new legislative proposal to expand the
    set of tools and actors who can protect against UAS by reauthorizing
    and expanding existing counter‑UAS authorities for the Departments
    of Homeland Security, Justice, Defense, State, as well as the
    Central Intelligence Agency and NASA in limited situations. The
    proposal also seeks to expand UAS detection authorities for state,
    local, territorial and Tribal (SLTT) law enforcement agencies and
    critical infrastructure owners and operators.  The proposal would
    also create a Federally-sponsored pilot program for selected SLTT
    law enforcement agency participants to perform UAS mitigation
    activities and permit critical infrastructure owners and operators
    to purchase authorized equipment to be used by appropriate Federal
    or SLTT law enforcement agencies to protect their facilities;  
2.  Establish a list of U.S. Government authorized detection equipment,
    approved by Federal security and regulatory agencies, to guide
    authorized entities in purchasing UAS detection systems in order to
    avoid the risks of inadvertent disruption to airspace or the
    communications spectrum;   
3.  Establish oversight and enablement mechanisms to support critical
    infrastructure owners and operators in purchasing counter-UAS
    equipment for use by authorized Federal entities or SLTT law
    enforcement agencies;  
4.  Establish a National Counter-UAS Training Center to increase
    training accessibility and promote interagency cross-training and
    collaboration;  
5.  Create a Federal UAS incident tracking database as a government-wide
    repository for departments and agencies to have a better
    understanding of the overall domestic threat;  
6.  Establish a mechanism to coordinate research, development, testing,
    and evaluation on UAS detection and mitigation technology across the
    Federal government;  
7.  Work with Congress to enact a comprehensive criminal statute that
    sets clear standards for legal and illegal uses, closes loopholes in
    existing Federal law, and establishes adequate penalties to deter
    the most serious UAS-related crimes; and   
8.  Enhance cooperation with the international community on counter‑UAS
    technologies, as well as the systems designed to defeat them.
