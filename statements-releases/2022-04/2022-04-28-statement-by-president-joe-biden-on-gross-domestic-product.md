title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Gross Domestic\_Product"
---
 
The American economy — powered by working families — continues to be
resilient in the face of historic challenges. Last quarter, consumer
spending, business investment, and residential investment increased at
strong rates. The number of Americans on unemployment insurance remains
at the lowest level since 1970. Later this morning, I will meet with
small business owners who are creating and growing their businesses at a
historic rate. While last quarter’s growth estimate was affected by
technical factors, the United States confronts the challenges of
COVID-19 around the world, Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and
global inflation from a position of strength.

We need to keep making progress — cutting costs for working families,
making more in America, and creating good-paying jobs you can raise a
middle-class family on. Congressional Republicans, led by Senator Scott,
believe the way to fight these global challenges is by raising taxes on
middle class families, including half of small business owners. I have a
different approach. Congress should send to my desk a bipartisan
innovation bill to bolster our supply chains and make more in America.
And Congress needs to pass legislation to lower costs and lower the
deficit, reducing families’ prescription drug and utility bills and
restoring fairness to our tax code — without raising taxes on anyone
making less than $400,000 per year. That’s how we grow our economy and
strengthen the middle class.
