From April 26-28, Deputy National Security Advisory for Cyber and
Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger traveled to India to participate in
the Raisina Dialogue where she met with representatives from multiple
countries and multilateral organizations to discuss cooperation on a
range of global security and geopolitical issues. Neuberger’s visit
continues the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to international
cooperation to ensure critical and emerging technologies work for, not
against, democratic principles and security. Neuberger met with a range
of Government of India officials to deepen our bilateral efforts to
promote secure and open connectivity and a vibrant digital economy and
to build our respective cybersecurity capacity to address shared
threats. Finally, recognizing the importance of public and private
sector cooperation, Neuberger also met with private sector
representatives to discuss the key role of industry in advancing our
shared objectives on cybersecurity and emerging technology, and to
discuss new developments in 5G, artificial intelligence, semiconductors,
and quantum technologies. Across all of her engagements, Neuberger
emphasized the importance of strengthening U.S.-India collaboration in
securing the technologies and infrastructure of the future while
simultaneously bolstering security to protect against present-day cyber
threats.
