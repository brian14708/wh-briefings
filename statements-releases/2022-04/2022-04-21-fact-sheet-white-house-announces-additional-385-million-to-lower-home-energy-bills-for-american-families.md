*Total Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program Funding Reaches Record
$8.3 Billion for Hard-Pressed American Families in Fiscal Year 2022*

Today, the White House is announcing that the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) will release more than $385 million to states
to help families and individuals with their home energy costs –
including summer cooling – through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program (LIHEAP). These funds are in addition to the $4.5 billion that
the American Rescue Plan provided to LIHEAP and the [first $100 million
installment](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2022/president-bidens-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-directs-100-million-lower-heating) of
a five-year, $500 million investment in LIHEAP from President Biden’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Altogether, this year the Biden-Harris
Administration is providing more than $8.3 billion in LIHEAP assistance
to reduce heating and cooling costs for low-income Americans – the
largest investment in a single year since the program was established in
1981.

The President is traveling today to the Pacific Northwest, which saw
record heat last year, where he will highlight actions he has taken to
help lower costs for families, including home energy costs. These
actions include:

**Record LIHEAP Funding for States:** Today, HHS announced the expected
final state-by-state allocation of over $8.3 billion in LIHEAP funding
outlined below. For example, Oregon, where the President is traveling
today, will receive an additional $3.8 million, bringing the total for
Oregon – including American Rescue Plan funds – to $92.6 million in
LIHEAP funding. Washington, where the President will travel tomorrow,
will receive an additional $6.5 million, bringing its total to $151.2
million.

**The American Rescue Plan’s Historic Resources and Relief for
Homeowners:** The American Rescue Plan provided other critical resources
that states and localities can use to address home energy costs. This
includes Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) programs, which received an
additional $21.5 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan, can
provide help with past-due utility bills or ongoing assistance with
energy costs to help distressed renters avoid shut-offs and keep current
on expenses. Over $30 billion of ERA funds have been obligated to assist
households with rent and utility costs. The Treasury Department is also
working with states and tribes to distribute $9.8 billion in funding for
the Homeowners Assistance Fund, with a majority of approved
plans including utility assistance to homeowners in need. State and
Local Fiscal Recovery Funds can also be deployed to help deliver energy
relief to families. Jurisdictions – such as California; Maryland;
Louisville, Kentucky; Mesa, Arizona; Burlington, Vermont; and the
Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin – are already helping households eliminate
unpaid bills, avoid shut-offs, and reduce their energy bills.

**The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Historic Investments to Reduce
Home Energy Costs:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invested a
historic [$3.5 billion in the Department of Energy’s Weatherization
Assistance
Program](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-announces-investments-make-homes-more-energy-efficient-and-lower),
reducing energy costs for hundreds of thousands of low-income households
by increasing their homes’ energy efficiency.

**Saving Families Money with Energy Efficiency Standards:** The
Biden-Harris Administration is continuing a series of 100 actions, to be
completed this year, that together will save families $100 every year
with more efficient home appliances and equipment. The Department of
Energy recently [proposed new
standards](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-energy-saving-rules-federal-buildings-and-proposes-new-standards-consumer)
for appliances like air conditioners to help consumers save on their
utility bills, which is critical as communities cope with increasingly
common and extreme heat events. The Administration will continue taking
action to make homes, offices, schools, appliances, and more energy
efficient to cut costs for consumers.

Today’s announcement also builds on the Administration’s previous
actions to ensure these historic resources are distributed swiftly and
equitably:

-   **<u>Encouraged States to Plan Early:</u>** In November 2021, the
    White House [called on states, localities, and tribes to plan
    early](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/18/fact-sheet-biden-administration-deploys-american-rescue-plan-funds-to-protect-americans-from-rising-home-heating-costs-calls-on-utility-companies-to-prevent-shut-offs-this-winter/) to
    distribute American Rescue Plan funds to address home energy costs.
-   **<u>Secured Commitments from Utilities to Avoid Shut-offs and
    Expedite Aid:</u>** The White House has [called on utility
    companies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/18/fact-sheet-biden-administration-deploys-american-rescue-plan-funds-to-protect-americans-from-rising-home-heating-costs-calls-on-utility-companies-to-prevent-shut-offs-this-winter/) to
    prevent devastating utility shut-offs and help expedite the delivery
    of unprecedented federal aid. [In January, the White House
    announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/07/biden-administration-announces-state-by-state-funding-to-address-home-energy-costs/)
    commitments from fourteen major utility companies across the country
    as well as a delivered fuel trade association.
-   **<u>Called for Coordination of Home Energy Relief to
    Families:</u>** In November 2021, the White House called for
    coordination across programs to maximize the impact of home energy
    assistance. HHS and Treasury [issued
    guidance](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-im-2022-01-liheap-coordination-era-during-winter-fy22)
    and co-hosted webinars on LIHEAP and ERA best practices that
    attracted 500 administrators from across the country. By December
    2021, more than half of these administrators reported that they are
    coordinating across these programs.
-   **<u>Provided Best Practices on Coordination with Utility
    Providers:</u>** In January, HHS and Treasury hosted a webinar [with
    over 700 utility assistance program administrators and utility
    providers](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-dcl-2022-04-additional-training-opportunities-guidance-emergency-rental)
    from across the country to discuss how programs including LIHEAP and
    ERA can coordinate with utility providers to increase the efficiency
    and reach of their programs.
-   **<u>Conducted Outreach and Celebrated National Energy Assistance
    Day:</u>** To celebrate the inaugural National Energy Assistance Day
    on February 1, HHS released a [radio announcement in
    English](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/podcast/liheap-celebrates-national-energy-assistance-day-2022-audio-news-release) and [Spanish](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/podcast/liheap-celebrates-national-energy-assistance-day-2022-spanish) and
    a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XebYS0OEm0) to encourage
    families to apply for LIHEAP. The radio announcement aired over
    5,000 times and reached more than 80 million listeners. HHS also
    [encouraged LIHEAP Administrators to
    participate](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-dcl-2022-06-national-energy-assistance-day-fy2022)
    in National Energy Assistance Day. Agencies across the
    Administration and the White House disseminated information about
    assistance programs and coordinated outreach.
-   **<u>Released Brief on Using Pandemic Emergency Assistance Fund for
    Utility Assistance:</u>** The American Rescue Plan provided $1
    billion for states, territories and tribes to distribute cash or
    targeted assistance to needy families. In February, HHS [released a
    brief](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ofa/peaf_energy_security_brief_1_27_2022_508.pdf) on
    how to use these funds for utility needs.

Households in need of help with their energy bills can identify
resources in their area at [EnergyHelp.us](http://energyhelp.us/) or by
calling the National Energy Assistance Referral hotline at
1-866-674-6327.
