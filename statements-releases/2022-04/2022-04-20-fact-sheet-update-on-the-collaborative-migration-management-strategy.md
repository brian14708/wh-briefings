title: "FACT SHEET:  Update on the Collaborative Migration Management\_Strategy"
---
 
Since the launch of the Collaborative Migration Management Strategy, the
U.S. Government has made progress with its partners on each line of
action, setting the strong foundation of collaborative migration
management upon which to further build.  The February 2, 2021 Executive
Order, *Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the
Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central
America, and to Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at
the United States Border*, called for a strategy to collaboratively
manage migration.  The Collaborative Migration Management Strategy,
launched on July 29, 2021, identifies and prioritizes actions to
strengthen cooperative efforts to manage safe, orderly, and humane
migration in North and Central America.  Specifically, the Collaborative
Migration Management Strategy aims to address urgent humanitarian needs,
promote access to protection and legal pathways for migration, improve
secure and humane border management, and provide support for returnees
to successfully reintegrate into their communities.  Addressing these
objectives requires sustained cooperation with a broad range of
stakeholders, including Congress, civil society, international
organizations, the private sector, labor unions, and governments inside
and outside the region.  
  
**Stabilize Populations with Acute Needs**

-   **Surge U.S. Humanitarian Assistance:**  In light of dire conditions
    and acute suffering faced by millions of people in El Salvador,
    Guatemala, and Honduras, Vice President Harris announced in April
    2021 an additional $310 million in U.S. Government support for
    humanitarian relief and to address food
    insecurity from the Department of State, USAID, DOD and USDA.  This
    announcement brought the total amount of humanitarian assistance
    provided by State and USAID to more than $272 million for the
    responses in Central America and Mexico.  DOD additionally allocated
    or re-aligned a total of $26 million to address the humanitarian
    drivers of migration, with a focus on El Salvador, Guatemala, and
    Honduras projects.  USDA increased its original $55 million
    commitment to support food security by extending two of its existing
    programs in Guatemala and Honduras by an additional $20 million,
    bringing the total value to $75 million.  
-   **UN Humanitarian Response Plans: ** The United Nations (UN)
    launched the 2021–2022 Humanitarian Response Plans for El Salvador,
    Guatemala, and Honduras in response to high-level engagement and
    direct appeals by the United States, with the UN appealing for $588
    million to target 4.3 million people in need of urgent humanitarian
    assistance.  The United States has provided nearly $169 million
    toward the efforts laid out in the UN Humanitarian Response Plans
    for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

**Expand Access to International Protection**

-   **Build and Improve National Asylum Systems: ** In Guatemala, the
    State Department funded the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
    (UNHCR) to continue supporting the Government of Guatemala to build
    its asylum capacity in line with its national action plan
    commitments under the Comprehensive Regional Protection and
    Solutions Framework (MIRPS).  Guatemala received more than 1,000
    asylum claims in 2021, which is over double the number received in
    any prior year.  In Mexico, the Commission for Refugee Assistance
    (COMAR) accepted more than 131,000 applications for asylum in 2021,
    becoming the third highest receiver of claims in the world.  With
    State Department support through UNHCR, COMAR granted asylum to
    37,806 individuals in 2021.  
-   **Establish Migration Resource Centers (MRCs)**:  With State
    Department funding, the International Organization for Migration
    (IOM), UNHCR, and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) collaborated with
    the Government of Guatemala to establish three MRCs (referred to
    locally as Centros de Atención a Personas Migrantes y Refugiadas, or
    CAPMIRs) in Guatemala City, Tecun Uman, and Quetzaltenango.  In
    addition, seven mobile units operate as part of the MRC network,
    covering six departments of Guatemala.  The MRCs are located to
    benefit communities at risk of displacement, with high levels of
    emigration, and also along transit routes.  They are designed to
    evaluate individuals’ protection, humanitarian, and economic needs
    in order to provide appropriate services and referrals, and have
    reached more than 32,000 individuals.  
-   **Child Protection: ** In Guatemala, the State Department funded
    UNICEF to support the Guatemalan Migration Institute to establish a
    new Child Protection Unit (UAPNA), which deployed Child Protection
    Officers to the southern and northern borders of Guatemala.  At the
    municipal level, State Department funding for UNICEF supported the
    establishment of Child Protection Offices in 40 percent of the 340
    Guatemalan municipalities.  In addition, State Department funding
    for UNHCR supported five departments in Guatemala implementing
    protocols for foster homes as an alternative care model for
    unaccompanied children.  In Mexico, State Department funding to
    UNICEF and UNHCR helped child welfare authorities in Tijuana and
    Ciudad Juarez to eliminate long-standing backlogs of hundreds of
    best interest determinations for migrant children, which are
    required by Mexican law for all children encountered by the national
    migration authority.

**Expand Access to Protection in Countries of Origin**

-   **Humanitarian and Development Assistance for Internally Displaced
    Persons (IDPs): ** In El Salvador, the State Department supported
    the UNHCR launch of the Creating Opportunities program to offer
    technical and professional courses to improve livelihoods of young
    IDPs and others at risk of violence or exploitation by gangs,
    including forced recruitment.  In Honduras, the U.S. Agency for
    International Development (USAID) funded psychosocial support,
    gender-based violence prevention activities, migration awareness,
    and children’s rights protection information to approximately 5,100
    Honduran youth and to over 1,375 returned migrants and IDPs impacted
    by the 2020 hurricanes.  
-   **Detection and Services for Trafficking Victims: ** USAID funding
    in El Salvador supported work at the border to detect and refer
    victims of trafficking for appropriate services.  In Guatemala, the
    State Department funded the Pan American Development Foundation in
    partnership with local organizations to improve the detection of
    human trafficking cases and provide services to over 250 victims,
    including medical care, mental health support, legal assistance,
    education, and reintegration services.

**Expand Third Country Labor Migration Programs While Improving Worker
Protections**

-   **Institutional Capacity Building: ** USAID supported the Guatemalan
    Ministry of Labor, the Honduran Ministry of Labor, and the
    Salvadoran Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the design and
    implementation of new processes to increase access to seasonal work
    opportunities abroad, resulting in a record number of H-2B visas
    issued to nationals of these countries in FY 2021 with further
    growth expected in FY 2022.  In Costa Rica, State Department funding
    for IOM supported the processing of 18,000 migrant requests in the
    agricultural temporary labor migration category.  In addition, State
    Department funding for IOM supported a bilateral dialogue forum
    between the Governments of Belize and El Salvador on opportunities
    to improve labor migration regularization procedures between both
    countries.  
-   **Expand Support for Migrant Worker Protections: ** In El Salvador,
    Guatemala, and Honduras, USAID funded pre-departure training for
    seasonal workers on their rights under the H-2 visa program.  In El
    Salvador, State Department funding for IOM supported the
    participation of officials from the Ministries of Labor and External
    Affairs in a specialized course on best practices in labor migration
    management.  The Salvadoran Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare
    also hosted an event to share best practices on ethical recruitment,
    involving participants from El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama.   
-   **Strengthen Worker Outreach and Compliance Assistance: ** The U.S.
    Department of Labor, through its Wage and Hour Division (WHD)
    redoubled its efforts to conduct outreach to stakeholders regarding
    the requirements of the H-2A and H-2B programs, as well as the
    Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act.  Since
    August 2021, WHD has conducted 597 outreach events through its
    district and regional offices.  WHD also provided compliance
    assistance and education to multiple national agricultural employer
    stakeholders and participated in a cross-departmental presentation
    hosted by DHS to over 300 stakeholders in addition to interagency
    meetings with Northern Central America government agencies to
    explain H-2A program requirements.  Finally, WHD published a
    one-page summary sheet on key H-2A worker protections and shared
    this information, along with other outreach materials, such as
    worker rights cards and information on how to file a complaint, with
    consular staff and USAID contractors for distribution to workers.

**Assist and Reintegrate Returned Persons**

-   **Expand Reception and Reintegration Services: ** Over the last two
    years, almost 120,000 (22,308 women, 75,271 men, 7,866 girls and
    13,740 boys) returned migrants have gone through the USAID-supported
    reception processes in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. USAID
    provided almost 9,000 returned or prospective migrants with
    psycho-social assistance, job skill development and vocational
    training, job orientation and placement, and reinsertion to school
    in the three countries.  The USAID-supported Reception Center for
    Returned Migrants in Guatemala City established a permanent presence
    of officials to issue national identification cards to returnees
    free of charge, an official clinic and COVID-19 vaccination center
    for returnees, and the permanent presence of the Ministry of Labor,
    including initial pilot programs to link returnees with job
    opportunities.  
-   **Support Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR):**  From August through
    December 2021, the State Department funded IOM to administer AVR
    supporting 1,250 vulnerable migrants in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize,
    Honduras, and El Salvador.  The State Department is funding an IOM
    regional program to expand AVR to additional countries and
    nationalities in the Western Hemisphere.

**Foster Secure and Humane Management of Borders**

-   **Institutional Capacity Building: ** In order to manage irregular
    migration and the growing number of unaccompanied children
    transiting through and departing from Guatemala, from July through
    December 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trained
    over 600 Government of Guatemala personnel.  In addition, DHS
    mentors in Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Tijuana in Mexico worked
    alongside Government of Mexico officials to counter human smuggling
    and fraud.  DHS mentoring efforts in Honduras resulted in the arrest
    of 110 human smugglers in 2021 and the transfer of over 190
    unaccompanied migrant children to Honduras’s children and family
    directorate.  These capacity building efforts represent a U.S.
    Government multi-agency effort to enhance security throughout the
    law enforcement process, from investigation to arrest to successful
    prosecution.  
-   **Enhance Migrant-Smuggling and Human-Trafficking Investigations and
    Prosecutions:** DHS information exchange with Mexican and Central
    American counterparts resulted in multiple leads for Operation
    Sentinel, an interagency counter-network operation targeting
    transnational criminal organizations affiliated with the smuggling
    of migrants.  In addition, under Joint Task Force Alpha, the
    Department of Justice with DHS investigated and prosecuted human
    smuggling and trafficking groups operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El
    Salvador, and Honduras.  In Guatemala, efforts focus on the
    indictments and extraditions of Guatemalan human smugglers to the
    United States to face prosecution.  In Honduras, DHS is supporting
    Operation Scorpion, a border surge initiative of the Honduran
    National Police, targeting human smugglers and traffickers.  
-   **Increase Information Sharing with and among Regional Partners:** 
    State Department foreign assistance funding supported a regional
    effort to share criminal intelligence about transnational criminal
    organizations and associated criminals in Central America, with a
    focus on migrant smuggling and human trafficking.  During 2021, this
    effort facilitated the identification of suspected members and
    networks of transnational criminal organizations.

**Strengthen Regional Public Messaging on Migration**

-   **Promote Accurate Information Countering Human Smugglers**: The
    State Department provided factual information about U.S. immigration
    policies, including digital content specifically for Haitian
    migrants reaching more than 1.5 million individuals between August
    and December 2021.  The State Department supported IOM to expand its
    Migration Information Portal and register over 4,500 new portal
    users from July to December 2021 to provide information on legal
    migration pathways in the region.  USAID also launched migration
    messaging campaigns in the region: in El Salvador, the “*De Aquí
    Soy*” campaign launched in September 2021 and reached almost two
    million people in three months; in Honduras, the two-part
    documentary “In the Claws of the Coyote” reached approximately
    800,000 viewers; and in Guatemala, the “*Quédate Aquí*” video series
    was seen by more than 1.6 million viewers on local TV.

**Expand Access to Lawful Pathways for Protection and Opportunity in the
United States**

-   **Restart and Expand Central American Minors (CAM) Program and other
    U.S. Refugee Admissions Program Processing:** In September 2021, the
    State Department and DHS expanded the eligibility categories for
    U.S.-based relatives who can apply for their children in Northern
    Central America to access the CAM program.  State is working to
    streamline the CAM application and has put out a Notice for Funding
    Opportunities for organizations to have dedicated funding to work on
    CAM applications.  Since its restart, cases for nearly 1,700
    children have been either reopened or submitted.  As of April 13,
    there have been 1,023 beneficiaries from CAM and other U.S. refugee
    admissions programs in Central America who arrived in the United
    States in FY 2022.  
-   **Increase Access to Temporary Work Visas While Ensuring Worker
    Protections: ** DHS and DOL will issue two temporary final rules
    this fiscal year, providing for supplemental visa allocations of
    18,000 H-2B visas reserved for nationals of Honduras, Guatemala, El
    Salvador, or Haiti (6,500 allotted for the first half of FY 2022 and
    11,500 for the second half of FY 2022).  These follow an H-2B
    supplemental allocation that DHS and DOL issued in May 2021,
    reserving an allocation for the first time for Northern Central
    American nationals.  The United States has also undertaken efforts
    to significantly increase the number of Northern Central American
    agricultural workers who receive an H-2A visa, and has conducted
    outreach with stakeholders and provided information on program
    requirements and worker protections.  *Cierto Global*, a non-profit
    ethical recruiter, has received private funding to establish
    operations in Guatemala in order to ethically recruit, train, and
    place H-2A agricultural workers on farms in the United States. 
    USAID facilitated contacts between *Cierto Global* and the
    Government of Guatemala to help *Cierto* quickly establish
    operations in Guatemala.  
-   **High-Level Donor Roundtable for Humanitarian Response Plans:**  In
    order to internationalize the response to the UN Humanitarian
    Response Plans and broaden the funding base, the United States,
    Canada, and European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid
    Operations, in partnership with the UN, co-hosted a high-level
    virtual donor roundtable meeting in November 2021.  
-   **Migration Ministerial Meeting: ** In October 2021, the United
    States and Colombia co-hosted a Ministerial Meeting in Bogotá on the
    Causes and Challenges of Irregular Migration, resulting in a Joint
    Declaration signed by 17 countries from our region, reiterating the
    United States’ commitment to working collaboratively to address the
    migration challenges throughout the region.  In April 2022, the
    United States and Panama co-hosted a further Ministerial Meeting in
    Panama City to redouble collaborative efforts on the regional
    response to migration and displacement.
