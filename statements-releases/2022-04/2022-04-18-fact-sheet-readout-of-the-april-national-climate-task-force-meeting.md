*Task Force kicked off Earth Week by highlighting historic progress on
climate*

Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy held the eleventh meeting
of the National Climate Task Force to launch a week of Administration
actions leading up to Earth Day that build on President Biden’s historic
progress to tackle the climate crisis and reduce emissions across every
sector of the economy – furthering the President’s efforts to lower
costs for families, advance environmental justice, and build an
equitable clean energy future.   
   
The Task Force received a briefing from Dr. Kate Calvin, NASA Chief
Scientist and Senior Climate Advisor and lead author on
the recently-published IPCC Report on Climate Mitigation. The Task Force
agreed that the findings are clear and compelling – the
world must accelerate climate action and we have the tools to fight the
climate crisis in every part of the economy. The Task Force discussed
further how the Administration’s efforts were aligned with the IPCC’s
findings — focused on tackling emissions sector-by-sector by deploying
record amounts of clean energy; electrifying our cars, trucks, and
buses; decarbonizing industrial processes; and phasing down
super-polluting HFCs.   
   
Since last Earth Day 2021, the Biden Administration has turbocharged the
American offshore wind industry, jumpstarted our electric transportation
future, helped weatherize homes to save families money, enlisted nature
in the fight against climate change, and more – all while advancing
environmental justice and creating good-paying, union jobs.
The [National Climate Task
Force](https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate/) microsite has been updated
to reflect these Administration accomplishments and continued climate
action.  
   
Task Force members also discussed the importance of meeting Americans
where they are and ensuring the benefits of deploying clean energy reach
every community and corner of the country. Energy Secretary Granholm
reiterated the President’s commitment to minimizing pain at the
pump caused by President Putin’s unprovoked war against
Ukraine, and Infrastructure Coordinator Landrieu emphasized the
importance of helping all communities – particularly rural and
disadvantaged – realize the benefits of the President’s historic
infrastructure investments.  
   
As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 [Executive Order on Tackling
the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/),
the Task Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor and includes
Cabinet-level leaders from more than 25 federal agencies to mobilize the
Biden-Harris Administration’s implementation of a whole-of-government
