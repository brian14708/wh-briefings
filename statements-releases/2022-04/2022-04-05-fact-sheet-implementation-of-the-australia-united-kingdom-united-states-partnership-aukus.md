title: "FACT SHEET: Implementation of the Australia \u2013 United Kingdom \u2013 United\_\
  States Partnership\_(AUKUS)"
---
 
Today, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, Prime Minister Boris
Johnson of the United Kingdom, and President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the
United States reviewed progress in implementing the Australia – United
Kingdom – United States (AUKUS) partnership. The leaders reaffirmed
their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, and more broadly to an
international system that respects human rights, the rule of law, and
the peaceful resolution of disputes free from coercion – a commitment
whose importance has only grown in response to Russia’s unprovoked,
unjustified, and unlawful invasion of Ukraine.

Implementation of the AUKUS partnership has now begun. It has two
related lines of effort.

-   Submarines. AUKUS will provide Australia with a conventionally
    armed, nuclear powered submarine capability at the earliest possible
    date, while upholding the highest non‑proliferation standards.

<!-- -->

-   Advanced capabilities. AUKUS will develop and provide joint advanced
    military capabilities to promote security and stability in the
    Indo-Pacific region.

**<u>Senior-Level Meetings</u>**

Since AUKUS was announced on September 15, 2021, the three countries
have held multiple high-level meetings.

-   Senior Officials Group. On March 10, 2022, National Security
    Advisors from the three allies met virtually to review AUKUS
    progress and provide direction to the trilateral partnership going
    forward. 

<!-- -->

-   Joint Steering Groups. The three countries have held multiple Joint
    Steering Group meetings for each of the two AUKUS lines of effort,
    including in-person sessions in Canberra, London, and Washington,
    D.C. 

<!-- -->

-   Working Groups. Seventeen trilateral working groups have been
    established (nine relating to conventionally-armed nuclear-powered
    submarines, and eight relating to other advanced military
    capabilities); each has met multiple times.

**<u>Australia’s Future Conventionally-Armed Nuclear-Powered Submarine
Capability</u>**

When AUKUS was announced in September 2021, Prime Minister Morrison,
Prime Minister Johnson, and President Joe Biden agreed to determine, by
March 2023, the optimal pathway for an Australian conventionally-armed,
nuclear-powered submarine capability. AUKUS partners have taken
important steps toward implementation.

-   Information exchange. The Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion
    Information Agreement (ENNPIA) entered into force on February 8,
    2022, enabling AUKUS partners to share naval nuclear propulsion
    information trilaterally. 

<!-- -->

-   Nuclear stewardship. For several weeks in February, combined teams
    from Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States visited
    multiple sites in Australia to baseline its nuclear stewardship,
    infrastructure, workforce, and industrial capabilities and
    requirements. On February 28, findings were considered by the Joint
    Steering Group on submarines. The Joint Steering Group will use this
    information as it develops the optimal pathway for Australia to
    acquire nuclear-powered submarines. 

<!-- -->

-   Australia workforce. Initial steps are underway to ensure Australia
    has a workforce with the necessary skills, training, and
    qualifications to build, operate, and sustain a conventionally-armed
    nuclear-powered submarine capability. For example, a cohort of
    Australian personnel have commenced higher-education and training
    opportunities in nuclear science and engineering. 

<!-- -->

-   New submarine base. Prime Minister Morrison announced, on March 7,
    Australia’s plan to establish a future submarine base on the east
    coast of Australia to support the basing and disposition of future
    nuclear-powered submarines. This new facility will operate in
    conjunction with Australia’s existing submarine base in Western
    Australia.

<!-- -->

-   Nuclear Powered Submarine Construction Yard: The Australian
    Government is taking initial steps to secure additional land on
    which to build the Nuclear-Powered Submarine Construction Yard,
    including land adjacent to the existing Osborne North Shipyard in
    South Australia. 

<!-- -->

-   Non-proliferation. Since the announcement of AUKUS, our nations have
    been engaging proactively with the International Atomic Energy
    Agency on the non-proliferation aspects of our
    partnership.  Following the initiation of technical consultations
    with the IAEA, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano
    Grossi [reported](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-generals-introductory-statement-to-the-board-of-governors-7-march-2022) to
    the IAEA Board of Governors on March 7 that Australia, the United
    Kingdom, and the United States “are committed to ensuring the
    highest non-proliferation and safeguards standards are met.” 

**<u>Advanced Capabilities</u>**

AUKUS partners have made strong progress in the four advanced
capabilities that the President and Prime Ministers identified in
September 2021, and have recently initiated work in four additional
areas. As we mature trilateral lines of effort within these and other
critical defense and security capabilities, we will seek to engage
allies and close partnersas appropriate. 

-   Undersea capabilities. Through the AUKUS Undersea Robotics
    Autonomous Systems (AURAS) project, our nations are collaborating on
    autonomous underwater vehicles, which will be a significant force
    multiplier for our maritime forces. Initial trials and
    experimentation of this capability are planned for 2023.  

<!-- -->

-   Quantum technologies. The AUKUS Quantum Arrangement (AQuA) will
    accelerate investments to deliver generation-after-next quantum
    capabilities.  It will have an initial focus on quantum technologies
    for positioning, navigation, and timing.  Together, we will
    integrate emerging quantum technologies in trials and
    experimentation over the next three years.  

<!-- -->

-   Artificial intelligence and autonomy. Trilateral cooperation on
    artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy will provide critical
    enablers for future force capabilities, improving the speed and
    precision of decision-making processes to maintain a capability edge
    and defend against AI-enabled threats. Early work is focused on
    accelerating adoption, and improving the resilience of, autonomous
    and AI-enabled systems in contested environments.  

<!-- -->

-   Advanced Cyber. In light of the importance of the cyber domain to
    advanced capabilities, we are focusing our efforts on strengthening
    cyber capabilities, including protecting critical communications and
    operations systems.  

<!-- -->

-   Hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities. The AUKUS partners
    will work together to accelerate development of advanced hypersonic
    and counter-hypersonic capabilities.

<!-- -->

-   Electronic warfare.  The electromagnetic spectrum is increasingly
    contested.  The three countries will work together to share
    understanding of tools, techniques, and technology to enable our
    forces to operate in contested and degraded environments.  

<!-- -->

-   Innovation. Our work on innovation aims to accelerate our respective
    defense innovation enterprises and learn from one another, including
    ways to more rapidly integrate commercial technologies to solve
    warfighting needs.

<!-- -->

-   Information sharing. We will expand and accelerate sharing of
    sensitive information, including as a first priority enabling
    workstreams that underpin our work on agreed areas of advanced
    capabilities.
