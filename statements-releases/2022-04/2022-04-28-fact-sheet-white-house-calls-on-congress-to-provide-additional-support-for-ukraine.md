  Ukraine"

The assistance the Biden-Harris Administration has provided to Ukraine
to date has made a significant difference on the battlefield, helping
Ukrainians defend their country and win the battle for Kyiv. Now, as the
war shifts to and intensifies in Ukraine’s eastern front, the
Biden-Harris Administration is [calling
on](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/28/letter-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-of-representatives-on-fiscal-year-2022-emergency-supplemental-funding/)
Congress to provide additional resources to help ensure Ukraine’s
democracy prevails over Putin’s aggression.  
  
The supplemental resources Congress provided on a bipartisan basis in
March have been critical to bolstering security in Eastern Europe,
countering Russia’s malign activities in the region, and delivering
critical humanitarian and economic assistance to Ukraine and neighboring
partners. Almost all of the $3.5 billion in drawdown authority Congress
provided in March has been exhausted as the Biden-Harris Administration
has surged military assistance to Ukraine, which they have used to great
effect. U.S. supplied weapons and ammunitions – including anti-tank and
anti-air systems, helicopters, drones, grenade launchers, and more than
50 million rounds of ammunition – have been flowing into Ukraine daily,
and the United States has been working with allies and partners to
facilitate deliveries of additional weapons capabilities. The Defense
Department has also used $1 billion in supplemental resources to
reinforce NATO’s eastern flank and bolster NATO’s security posture to
deter Russian aggression.

At the same time, the Administration is delivering humanitarian,
economic, food, and other security assistance to Ukraine and the region.
This includes roughly $1.7 billion to ensure continuity of Ukraine’s
democratic operations and provide other macroeconomic assistance to the
region. It also includes $650 million in military assistance to Ukraine,
eastern flank countries, and other partners in the region, as well as
hundreds of millions of dollars in food, shelter, and other humanitarian
aid to help Ukrainians who have been displaced by Russia’s
war. Supplemental resources are also supporting efforts to hold Putin
and his cronies accountable for their war of choice, helping the United
States seize billions in assets and holdings.

Continued bipartisan support in Congress is vital to ensuring that the
Ukrainian people have the resources they need to win this war, and this
Administration is committed to working with lawmakers and our global
allies and partners to keep aid flowing to Ukraine uninterrupted and to
support those devastated by the food crisis that Putin’s war has
exacerbated.  
  
The $33 billion in security, economic, and humanitarian aid requested
today will:  
  
***Help Ukraine Defend Itself Over the Long-Term***  
  
The Administration is requesting $20.4 billion in additional security
and military assistance for Ukraine and for U.S. efforts to strengthen
European security in cooperation with our NATO allies and other partners
in the region. This includes $5 billion in additional drawdown
authority, $6 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,
and $4 billion for the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing
program. These resources will put urgently needed equipment into the
hands of Ukraine’s military and police, as well as help NATO deter and
defend against Russian aggression over the long-term. These additional
resources will be used to provide Ukraine and Eastern flank allies with:

-   **Additional artillery, armored vehicles, anti-armor and anti-air
    capabilities** flowing into Ukraine uninterrupted**.**  
-   **Accelerated cyber capabilities and advanced air defense systems**,
    improved production capabilities for munitions and strategic
    minerals, and increased intelligence support.  
-   **Assistance to clear landmines, improvised explosive devices, and
    other explosive remnants of war** and for the Government of Ukraine
    in securing and addressing threats related to chemical, biological,
    radiological, and nuclear materials.  
-   **A stronger NATO security posture** through support for U.S. troop
    deployments on NATO territory, including transportation of U.S.
    personnel and equipment, temporary duty, special pay, airlift,
    weapons system sustainment, and medical support.

***Additional Economic Aid to Support Democracy in Ukraine***  
  
The Administration is calling on Congress to provide an additional $8.5
billion in economic assistance to help the Government of Ukraine respond
to the immediate crisis and continue to provide basic citizen services.
This includes funds to:

-   **Ensure Ukraine’s democratic government continues functioning;**
    support food, energy, and health care services for the Ukrainian
    people; and assist the Ukrainian government in responding to
    operational challenges as businesses shutter and revenue collection
    plummets.  
-   **Counter Russian disinformation and propaganda narratives**,
    promote accountability for Russian human rights violation, and
    support activists, journalists, and independent media to defend
    freedom of expression.  
-   **Support small- and medium- sized agrobusinesses during the fall
    harvest and for natural gas purchases** by the Ukrainian state
    energy company in order to address critical food security, energy,
    and other emerging needs in Ukraine.

***Address Humanitarian Needs due to Russia’s War  
***  
The $3 billion in additional humanitarian assistance will provide
critical resources to address food security needs around the globe,
provide wheat and other commodities to people in need, build countries’
resilience to global food supply and price shocks, and provide
lifesaving aid to people displaced by or otherwise impacted by Putin’s
War in Ukraine. This funding will mean:

-   **Direct food support, including wheat and flour, for individuals in
    developing countries** impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as
    well as helping countries build more resilient agricultural
    systems.  
-   **Medical supplies, high thermal blankets, emergency health kits,
    safe drinking water, shelter materials**, and other lifesaving
    humanitarian assistance for Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s war.  
-   **Job training, trauma-informed mental health services, and
    resources for local school districts to support Ukrainians arriving
    in the United States,** including the new Uniting for Ukraine
    program.

***Bolster Sanctions Enforcement***  
  
Resources will also bolster the Department of Justice’s KleptoCapture
Task force efforts to pursue high value asset seizures from sanctioned
individuals related to Russian actions in Ukraine. The Administration is
also proposing legislation to streamline the process to recoup proceeds
from seized and forfeited assets and use them to remediate the harm
caused in Ukraine.  
  
***Addressing Economic Disruptions at Home and Around the World Due to
Putin’s Aggression***  
  
An additional $500 million in domestic food production assistance will
support the production of U.S. food crops that are experiencing a global
shortage due to the war in Ukraine, for example, wheat and soybeans.
Through higher loan rates and crop insurance incentives the request
provides greater access to credit and lowers risk for farmers growing
these food commodities, while lowering costs for American consumers.  
  
Additional funding will also allow use of the Defense Production Act to
expand domestic production of critical minerals and materials that have
been disrupted by Putin’s war in Ukraine and that are necessary to make
everything from defense systems to automobiles.  This will help address
economic disruptions and reduce price pressures at home and around the
world.
