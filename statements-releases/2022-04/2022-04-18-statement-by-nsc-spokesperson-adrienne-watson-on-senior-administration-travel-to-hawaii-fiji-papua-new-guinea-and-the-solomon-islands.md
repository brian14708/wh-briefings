This week, National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt
Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink will lead a delegation of U.S. government
officials to three Pacific Island nations: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and
the Solomon Islands. The delegation—which will include representatives
from the National Security Council, the Department of State, the
Department of Defense, and the United States Agency for International
Development—will seek to further deepen our enduring ties with the
region and to advance a free, open, and resilient Indo-Pacific. In
Hawaii, the delegation will consult with senior military officials and
regional partners at United States Indo-Pacific Command. In Fiji, Papua
New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, the delegation will meet with
senior government officials to ensure our partnerships deliver
prosperity, security, and peace across the Pacific Islands and the
Indo-Pacific. They will also meet with representatives of the Pacific
Islands Forum, a critical driver of regional action, to discuss issues
of importance to the Pacific as a whole. The trip builds on Secretary
Antony Blinken’s travel in February to the region, during which the
Administration released the [Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United
States](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/U.S.-Indo-Pacific-Strategy.pdf) and
furthered our shared commitment to democracy and prosperity in the
Pacific.
