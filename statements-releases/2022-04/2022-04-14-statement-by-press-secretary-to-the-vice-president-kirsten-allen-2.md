Today, the Vice President spoke with International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers’ (IBEW) locals across the country to discuss the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to workers, and to encourage
collaboration as we implement the historic, Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law which will create good-paying, union jobs across the country. She
also talked about her memorable visits to IBEW halls, facilities, and
programs through the years, including as Vice President, most recently
during a trip to North Carolina.  
   
The Vice President thanked IBEW President Lonnie Stephenson for his
leadership, and said she looks forward to their continued work together.
