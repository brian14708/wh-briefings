title: "Statement from Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on Oklahoma Law Restricting Access\
  \ to Reproductive Health\_Care"
---
 
Today, the country’s most restrictive legislation regulating access to
reproductive health care was signed into law in Oklahoma. This law makes
providing an abortion illegal in the state of Oklahoma, with only a
narrow exception for medical emergencies and no exception for rape or
incest. 

This unconstitutional attack on women’s rights is just the latest and
one of the most extreme state laws signed into law to date. Protecting
the right recognized in *Roe v. Wade* continues to be a priority for the
Biden-Harris Administration, and we call on Congress to pass the Women’s
Health Protection Act, which would shut down these attacks and codify
this long-recognized, constitutional right. Make no mistake: the actions
today in Oklahoma are a part of disturbing national trend attacking
women’s rights and the Biden Administration will continue to stand with
women in Oklahoma and across the country in the fight to defend their
freedom to make their own choices about their futures.
