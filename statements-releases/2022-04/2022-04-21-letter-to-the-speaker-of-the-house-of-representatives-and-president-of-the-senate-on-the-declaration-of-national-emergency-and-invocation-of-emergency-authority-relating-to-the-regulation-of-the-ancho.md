Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Pursuant to the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) and
section 1 of title II of Public Law 65-24, ch. 30, June 15, 1917, as
amended (Magnuson Act) (*46 U.S.C. 70051),* I hereby report that I have
issued a proclamation with respect to the policies and actions of the
Government of the Russian Federation to continue the premeditated,
unjustified, unprovoked, and brutal war against Ukraine, which
constitute a national emergency by reason of a disturbance or threatened
disturbance of international relations of the United States.

The proclamation prohibits Russian-affiliated vessels from entering into
United States ports with limited exceptions for Russian-affiliated
vessels used in the transport of source material, special nuclear
material, and nuclear byproduct material for which, and for such time
as, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Commerce, determines that no viable source of
supply is available that would not require transport by
Russian‑affiliated vessels; and for Russian-affiliated vessels
requesting only to enter United States ports due to force majeure,
solely to allow seafarers of any nationality to disembark or embark for
purposes of conducting crew changes, emergency medical care, or for
other humanitarian need.  The proclamation also authorizes the Secretary
of Homeland Security to make and issue such rules and regulations as the
Secretary may find appropriate to regulate the anchorage and movement of
Russian-affiliated vessels, and delegates to the Secretary my authority
to approve such rules and regulations, as authorized by the Magnuson
Act.

I am enclosing a copy of the proclamation I have issued.

Sincerely,

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
