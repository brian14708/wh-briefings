Jill and I join fellow Christians around the world in celebrating Easter
Sunday — a day of joy and hope, of renewal and rebirth.

Once again, Holy Week has taken us on a journey from sorrow to
salvation. As we reflect today on Christ’s Resurrection, we are reminded
that with faith, hope, and love — even death can be defeated.

And, as we emerge from this pandemic, we are grateful that so many are
able to celebrate this day of joy and renewal with services and family
gatherings in person and together again. But we know this Holy Day falls
on heavy hearts for those who have lost loved ones and those among us
living in the dark shadow of war, persecution, and poverty.

On this day and each day, we pray for them, and for peace, freedom, and
the basic dignity and respect for all of God’s children. As we look
ahead with His blessing, may we share a common hope for the future,
reaffirm love and compassion for one another, and cherish the blessing
of the dawn of new possibilities.

From our family to yours, we wish you hope, health, joy, and the peace
of God, which passes all understanding.

Happy Easter and may God bless and keep you.
