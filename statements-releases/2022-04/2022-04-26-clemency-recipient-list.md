title: Clemency Recipient List
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. is granting clemency to 78
individuals, consisting of three pardons and 75 commutations.  
  
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. is pardoning the following three
individuals:  
  
**Abraham W. Bolden, Sr.** – Chicago, Illinois  
Abraham Bolden is an 86-year-old former U.S. Secret Service agent and
was the first African American to serve on a presidential detail.  In
1964, Mr. Bolden was charged with offenses related to attempting to sell
a copy of a Secret Service file.  His first trial resulted in a hung
jury, and following his conviction at a second trial, even though key
witnesses against him admitted to lying at the prosecutor’s request, Mr.
Bolden was denied a new trial and ultimately served several years in
federal custody.  He has steadfastly maintained his innocence, arguing
that he was targeted for prosecution in retaliation for exposing
unprofessional and racist behavior within the U.S. Secret Service.  Mr.
Bolden has received numerous honors and awards for his ongoing work to
speak out against the racism he faced in the Secret Service in the
1960s, and his courage in challenging injustice.  Mr. Bolden has also
been recognized for his many contributions to his community following
his release from prison.  
  
**Betty Jo Bogans** – Houston, Texas  
Betty Jo Bogans is a 51-year-old woman who was convicted in 1998 of
possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in the Southern
District of Texas after attempting to transport drugs for her boyfriend
and his accomplice, neither of whom were detained or arrested.  At the
time of her conviction, Ms. Bogans was a single mother with no prior
record, who accepted responsibility for her limited role in the
offense.  Because of the harsh penalties in place at the time she was
convicted, Ms. Bogan received a seven-year sentence.  In the nearly two
decades since her release from custody, Ms. Bogans has held consistent
employment, even while undergoing treatment for cancer, and has focused
on raising her son.     
  
**Dexter Eugene Jackson** – Athens, Georgia  
Dexter Jackson is a 52-year-old man who was convicted in 2002 for using
his business to facilitate the distribution of marijuana in the Northern
District of Georgia.  Mr. Jackson was not personally involved in
trafficking marijuana, but allowed marijuana distributors to use his
pool hall to facilitate drug transactions.  He accepted full
responsibility for his actions at the time he was charged, and pled
guilty.  Since his release from custody, Mr. Jackson has converted his
business into a cell-phone repair service and hired local high school
students through a program that seeks to provide young adults with work
experience.  Mr. Jackson has also worked to build and renovate homes in
a community that lacks quality affordable housing.
