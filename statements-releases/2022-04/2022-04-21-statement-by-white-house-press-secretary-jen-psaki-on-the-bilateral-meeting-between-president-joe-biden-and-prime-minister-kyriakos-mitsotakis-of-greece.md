President Biden looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister
Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece to the White House on May 16, 2022. The
Prime Minister’s visit provides an opportunity to affirm our strong
bilateral partnership and to celebrate 201 years of Greek independence.
The leaders will discuss ongoing efforts with Allies and partners to
support the people of Ukraine and impose economic costs on Russia for
its unprovoked aggression. They will discuss our close cooperation on
global challenges, including climate change and energy security. The
leaders will take stock of our joint efforts to promote global security
through NATO, as well as our shared goals for peace and prosperity in
the region. They will also celebrate the history, democratic values, and
trade and investment links that have united our peoples and countries
for generations.
