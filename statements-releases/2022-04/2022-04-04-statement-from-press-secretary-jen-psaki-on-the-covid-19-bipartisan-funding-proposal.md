title: "Statement from Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on the COVID-\u206019 Bipartisan\
  \ Funding\_Proposal"
---
 
We are grateful for the Senate’s work on a bipartisan plan to help meet
some of the country’s COVID-19 response needs.  The Administration
requested $22.5 billion to continue to provide critical protections like
vaccines, boosters, treatments, and tests to people here at home and for
help putting shots in arms around the world. Every dollar we requested
is essential and we will continue to work with Congress to get all of
the funding we need. But time is of the essence.  We urge Congress to
move promptly on this $10 billion package because it can begin to fund
the most immediate needs, as we currently run the risk of not having
some critical tools like treatments and tests starting in May and
June.  We will continue to work with Congress to fund our remaining
domestic needs and will work with Senators Schumer and Romney – and
others — to build bipartisan support for a package to fund our global
COVID-19 response.  We must continue our work to vaccinate the world
both because it is the right thing to do, and also, because as it is
critical to reducing the risk of new variants, which in turn is critical
to the safety of the American people.
