On April 18, National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt
Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink convened a meeting in Honolulu with U.S. Navy
Adm. John C. Aquilino, Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and senior
officials from Australia, Japan, and New Zealand on developments in the
Pacific Islands. In Honolulu, the officials reaffirmed the four
countries’ enduring and shared commitment to the Pacific Islands. The
United States resolved to intensify its engagement in the region to meet
21st-century challenges, from maritime security and economic development
to the climate crisis and COVID-19. We will do this in ever-closer
partnership with Pacific Island nations, including through a united
Pacific Islands Forum; and together with like-minded countries, within
and beyond the region, including in Europe. Officials from the four
countries represented also shared concerns about a proposed security
framework between the Solomon Islands and the People’s Republic of China
(PRC) and its serious risks to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The meeting
was part of regular and extensive U.S. consultations with allies and
partners on the Indo-Pacific and is part of the announced senior
administration travel this week to Hawaii, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and
the Solomon Islands.
