title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Unemployment Insurance\_Claims"

Americans are getting back to work at a historic pace, with fewer
America is back to work. Over the last four weeks, fewer Americans filed
initial claims for unemployment insurance than at any time in our
nation’s recorded history. Our economy added 7.9 million jobs since I
took office – more jobs created on average per month than under any
other President in history. That’s millions of families with a little
more breathing room and the dignity a job provides. This historic job
growth is a direct result of the American Rescue Plan, which funded our
vaccination strategy, re-opened schools, and helped grow the economy
from the bottom up and middle out. While we have more work to do to
combat Putin’s Price Hike and lower costs for families, today’s data
demonstrate that America is on the move again and the economy is
uniquely well-positioned to overcome the global challenges brought on by
the pandemic and Putin’s War of Choice.
