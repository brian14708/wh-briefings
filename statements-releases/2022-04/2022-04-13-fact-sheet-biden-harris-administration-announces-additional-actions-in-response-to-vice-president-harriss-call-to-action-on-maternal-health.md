*Vice President Harris to Host First-Ever Meeting with Cabinet Officials
on Maternal Health*

On Wednesday, April 13, 2022, during Black Maternal Health Week, Vice
President Kamala Harris will convene a meeting with Cabinet Secretaries
and agency leaders to discuss the Administration’s whole-of-government
approach to addressing maternal mortality and morbidity. The Vice
President will convene leaders across the federal government – including
agencies that may not have historically taken a leading role addressing
the maternal health crisis.  
   
In December 2021, Vice President Harris convened the first-ever federal
Maternal Health Day of Action, where she announced a historic Call to
Action to improve health outcomes for parents and infants in the United
States. This resulted in the Administration’s announcement of [private

and [public
sector](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=dd8d87202c&e=60572324a0)
investments. Ahead of the meeting with Cabinet officials, the
Administration is following up with additional actions to address
maternal health, and to combat the systemic inequities that lead to
worse maternal outcomes for Black, Native American, and rural women.  
   
**<u>New Announcements:</u>**

-   **11 Additional States and D.C. Ask to Extend Medicaid and CHIP
    Coverage to a Full Year After Pregnancy under American Rescue
    Plan:** The American Rescue Plan is working to make Medicaid and
    CHIP coverage for 12 months after pregnancy a reality for people
    across the country. The Vice President called on states to expand
    their postpartum coverage during her Call to Action in December.
    -   The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has approved
        Louisiana, Virginia, New Jersey, and Illinois’ extension of
        Medicaid and CHIP coverage for 12 months after pregnancy on or
        before April 1, 2022. CMS is also working with another eleven
        states and the District of Columbia to extend postpartum
        coverage for a full year after pregnancy, including: California,
        Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, New
        Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia.  In
        addition, a number of other states have announced that they are
        working to extend Medicaid and CHIP coverage to 12 months after
        pregnancy, and CMS looks forward to working with those states.
    -   In order to receive federal funds and to ensure consistency with
        federal standards, including those set by the American Rescue
        Plan, states must go through a formal process run by CMS.
        Medicaid covers more than 40 percent of births in the United
        States, and extending this coverage will bring the peace of mind
        of health coverage to parents and children during the vulnerable
        post-partum period. 
    -   Based on HHS estimates, approximately 720,000 people would
        benefit if all states were to adopt the American Rescue Plan’s
        new option to extend post-partum Medicaid and CHIP coverage for
        a full 12 months.
-   **“Birthing-Friendly” Hospital Designation:** CMS is proposing the
    “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation to drive improvements in
    maternal health outcomes and maternal health equity. The
    “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation would assist consumers in
    choosing hospitals that have demonstrated a commitment to maternal
    health. The Administration announced this new designation during the
    White House Maternal Health Day of Action Summit.
    -   Initially, the designation would be awarded to hospitals based
        on attestation that the hospital has participated in maternity
        care quality improvement collaboratives and implemented best
        practices that advance health care quality, safety, and equity
        for pregnant and post-partum patients.
    -   Data will be submitted by hospitals for the first time in May
        2022, and CMS will post data for October to December 2021 in
        fall 2022. Criteria for the designation may be expanded in the
        future.
-   **Engaging the Health Care Industry to Improve Health Outcomes:** In
    Summer 2022, CMS will convene health care industry stakeholders –
    including health care facilities, insurance companies, state
    officials and providers – to focus on industry commitments to
    improve health outcomes experienced by pregnant and postpartum
    people. CMS and experts will share best practices and commitments
    and request that health care industry leaders make commitments to
    advance maternal health.
-   **Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV)
    Programs:** The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
    through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA),
    announced approximately $16 million to strengthen Maternal, Infant,
    and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Programs through seven
    awards supporting eight states.
    -   These awards will advance data and technology innovations to
        support positive maternal and child health outcomes in states
        and communities, and focus on addressing health disparities.
-   **State Maternal Health Innovation and Implementation (State MHI)
    Program:** State MHI supports state-level development and
    implementation of proven strategies to improve maternal health and
    address maternal health disparities. The new funding, $9 million,
    will continue to build state capacity to deliver high-quality
    maternity care services and provide training for maternal care
    clinicians. It also adds a component to enhance the quality of
    state-level maternal health data through better collection,
    reporting and analysis. The program will fund up to nine cooperative
    agreements, and each will receive up to $1 million over five years.
-   **Maternal Health Best Practices:** HHS, through the Health
    Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is also, on
    telehealth.hhs.gov, posting a new Maternal Health Best Practice
    Guide for providers to incorporate telehealth for prenatal and
    postpartum care, and monitoring within high-risk pregnancy. Through
    remote patient monitoring, screening and treatment for postpartum
    depression, and lactation consulting, maternal telehealth can help
    reduce barriers to access to critical care for mothers before,
    during and after a pregnancy.

**<u>Previous Actions Announced since the Vice President’s Call to
Action in December</u>**

-   **Investing in Doulas:** HHS
    [announced](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=4a82af5246&e=60572324a0)
    the availability of $4.5 million for hiring, training, certifying,
    and compensating community-based doulas in areas with high rates of
    adverse maternal and infant health outcomes, doubling the number of
    Healthy Start doula programs nationwide.
-   **Title X**: HHS
    [restored](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=014e3bb105&e=60572324a0)
    access to Title X family planning services nationwide to fill
    service gaps caused by more than a quarter of Title X providers
    withdrawing from the program over the past two and a half years in
    response to the previous administration’s Title X rule. HHS awarded
    $256.6 million in grant funding to support 76 grantees to deliver
    equitable, affordable, client-centered, and high-quality family
    planning services.
-   **FY23 Budget Request**: The President’s budget includes $470 
    million to: reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates; expand
    maternal health initiatives in rural communities; implement implicit
    bias training for healthcare providers; create pregnancy medical
    home demonstration projects; and address the highest rates of
    perinatal health disparities, including by supporting the perinatal
    health workforce.

        noting the urgent need to address this crisis.
        -   At the Summit, the Vice President
            [announced](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=9726cc666b&e=60572324a0)

-   The Omnibus spending bill passed in March and signed by the
    President includes both the Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act
    and an expansion of the Rural Maternal and Obstetric Modernization
    of Services (Rural MOMS) program. 
    -   These foundational bills authorize and improve programs to
        address the maternal mortality crisis in this country and build
        on current funding at the Centers for Disease Control &
        Prevention (CDC) and Health Resources and Services

    which includes its vision to strengthen health care and  women’
    health, including through addressing the maternal mortality crisis
    in the United States and abroad.
-   As a Senator, Vice President Harris was a champion on the issue of
    maternal health. She brought racial disparities in maternal
    mortality, particularly for Black women, to the forefront
    legislatively, increasing awareness among her colleagues and leading
    to a broader discussion of racial disparities across other health
    issues.
    -   She convened roundtables, lifted up local organizations that are
        focused on the issue, and ensured that initiatives on maternal
        health included references to racial disparities and relevant
        solutions.

She introduced several bills in the Senate specifically targeted to
addressing racial disparities in maternal mortality, including the
Maternal CARE Act and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act.
