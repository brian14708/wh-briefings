title: "Addressing the Collective Challenges of our Time: Implementing the U.S. Strategy\
  \ to Prevent Conflict and Promote\_Stability"
---
 
Every country, including our own, experiences risks and challenges
related to stability and conflict.  The international community grapples
with issues that cut across borders, societies, ways of life, and
economies.  As the world has witnessed too often, the effects of
conflict and instability are not constrained by borders or
technologies.  Cooperation and long-term investments in conflict
prevention and stabilization are needed now more than ever to build
peace across divided communities and boundaries.  We must collectively
bolster societal resilience to prevent and reduce the heavy human and
financial costs of conflicts that undermine global peace, security and
sustainable development.   
   
On April 1, 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration launched the
implementation of the [U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote
Stability](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2020-United-States-Strategy-to-Prevent-Conflict-and-Promote-Stability-2.pdf)
with partner countries across the globe.  The Strategy outlines a
ten-year, evidence-based, whole-of-government effort to foster peace and
long-term stability through integrated U.S. diplomacy, development, and
security-sector engagement with dual goals of strengthening national and
regional peace, resilience and stability and enhancing the way our
government operates in a variety of contexts.  
   
Through collective action and partnership, the United States seeks to
advance the vision and goals of the landmark Global Fragility Act
through this Strategy in four diverse countries and one sub-region
facing a wide variety of challenges to peace and stability.  This
Strategy advances U.S. national security and interests.  The work now
underway represents an important milestone, and next step, in the
implementation of the Global Fragility Act, which continues to enjoy
strong support within the U.S. Congress and among civil society. 
Through a spirit of partnership, we can and will build on strengths of
communities, governments, and nations to rebound from shocks, confront
negative global trends and create new paradigms for broader
cooperation.  The Strategy and Prologue chart a new path toward positive
results that strengthen democracy, rule of law, security, good
governance, gender equity and equality, health, education, and respect
for human rights all aligned to fuel reservoirs of peace, strength and
recovery and extinguish potential discord before it is sparked.  
   
The United States will partner with Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, Papua New
Guinea, and Coastal West Africa (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea,
and Togo) guided by these principles:

-   Work collaboratively with government and civic partners on an
    integrated approach to prevent conflict, promote resilience and
    stability, and advance economic development;  
-   Look beyond urgent crises and near-term needs to focus on mutually
    determined strategic goals and interests through whole-of-government
    ten-year plans;  
-   Utilize development, diplomacy, and security-sector means in a
    coordinated way to support the pursuit of goals, foster an enabling
    environment, and solidify progress;  
-   Provide new tools and insights to strengthen democratic
    institutions, for example in the areas of rule of law,
    anti-corruption, law enforcement, and fiscal transparency, and to
    promote human rights and gender equity and equality;  
-   Adapt to and learning from changing conditions, anchor efforts in
    local communities, and make strategic adjustments based on joint
    analyses, research, and monitoring and evaluation; and  
-   Take a multifaceted approach to address other current and emerging
    challenges, such as the climate crisis, global pandemics and
    declining democratic practices. 

The U.S. Congress authorized up to $200 million a year for these efforts
and appropriated $125 million in Fiscal Year 2022 for the Prevention and
Stabilization Fund, which supplements existing bilateral U.S. assistance
to these partner countries.  This funding will support the development
of ten-year implementation plans and related regional and multilateral
activities.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration will closely monitor progress,
milestones, and accomplishments under the Strategy.  These efforts will
endure across future U.S. Administrations and advance much needed
innovative approaches to peace and stability.
