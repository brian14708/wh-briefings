title: "President\_Biden Announces Five New Nominees to Serve as U.S.\_Attorneys"
---
 
President Biden is announcing five new nominees to serve as U.S.
Attorneys across the country, as wel as three new nominees to serve as
U.S. Marshals. These are officials who will be indispensable to
upholding the rule of law as top federal law enforcement officials.

These individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law,
their professionalism, their experience and credentials in this field,
their dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment
to the independence of the Department of Justice.

The President has proposed a budget that would significantly increase
funding for law enforcement as part of a comprehensive approach to
tackling the rising crime rate this administration inherited last year.

The President has also launched a comprehensive effort to take on the
uptick in gun crime that has been taking place since 2020—putting more
cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking
down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys as the chief
federal law enforcement officers in their district is important for
these efforts.

The President has now announced 48 nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys,
and 5 nominees to serve as U.S. Marshals.
