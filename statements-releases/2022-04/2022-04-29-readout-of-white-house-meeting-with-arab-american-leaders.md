Earlier this week, to honor National Arab American Heritage Month,
Senior Biden-Harris Administration Officials hosted a listening session
with Arab American community leaders at the White House. During the
meeting, leaders discussed the Administration’s efforts to promote
prosperity, civil rights, and equal representation for the Arab American
community.

Participants shared their own experiences as leaders in the Arab
American community, and relayed key priorities including representation,
immigration, education, anti-discrimination, disability rights, civil
rights, foreign policy, and data collection, among others.
Administration officials highlighted the work of the Civil Rights
Division at the Department of Justice to root out hate and
discrimination, however they manifest, and specifically the Division’s
efforts to combat Anti-Arab discrimination and Islamophobia.
Administration officials also discussed the Equitable Data Working
Group’s recent
[report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eo13985-vision-for-equitable-data.pdf)
highlighting the need to build a Federal data infrastructure that better
reflects the diversity of the American people and any inequities in
their experiences, as well as the work underway at the U.S. Census
Bureau to improve data collection for people of Middle Eastern and North
African heritage. Participants and Administration Officials also
discussed the recent  tensions in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and
expressed hope that the final week of Ramadan would pass peacefully.

The community leaders and Administration officials agreed to continue
working together on these priorities in the months ahead.
