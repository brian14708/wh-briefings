*The President and First Lady to Host the White House Easter
“EGGucation” Roll on Monday, April 18, 2022*

The White House announced today the full program of activities for the
2022 White House Easter Egg Roll, a tradition dating back to 1878.  A
teacher for more than 30 years, First Lady Jill Biden created this
year’s event theme, “EGGucation!,” with the South Lawn to be transformed
into a school community, full of fun educational activities for children
to enjoy.   
   
In addition to the time-honored traditions of rolling and hunting eggs,
this year’s White House Easter “EGGucation” Roll will also feature a
School House Activity Area, Reading Nook, Talent Show, Field Trip to the
Farm, Picture Day, a Physical “EGGucation” Zone, a Cafetorium and
more.   
   
In total, approximately 30,000 people will take part in this year’s
Easter “EGGucation” Roll, including thousands of military families, and
the crew members and families from the U.S.S. DELAWARE, the U.S. Naval
Submarine, for which the First Lady is the sponsor. Tickets for the
general public were distributed to guests from all across the country
through an online public lottery.    
  
This year’s event will be broken into five sessions, beginning at 7:30
AM ET and end at 6:30 PM ET.  Follow along with the White House Easter
“EGGucation” Roll festivities with \#EasterEggRoll and \#EGGucation, and
the official @White House, @POTUS, @FLOTUS social media accounts on
Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
