Jill and I send warm wishes to all our friends in the Orthodox Christian
community observing Easter. We rejoice with you in the Resurrection of
Jesus Christ and the triumph of light over darkness.

During this sacred season, we hold in our prayers all those who are
suffering from the brutality of war and persecution. We mourn with all
those who have lost loved ones or who fear for their safety, and
rededicate ourselves to working for peace with justice and for the
freedom and security of all people.

This year, we have once more seen the essential ways in which Orthodox
Christians strengthen our nation and world: through compassion and
service to others; demonstrations of interfaith solidarity; advocacy for
religious freedom for everyone, everywhere; and care for creation. Let
us continue to spread the message of Easter joy through our shared work
to build a world that values the inherent dignity and infinite worth of
every human being.

May the peace of Christ be with you now and always. Happy Easter.
