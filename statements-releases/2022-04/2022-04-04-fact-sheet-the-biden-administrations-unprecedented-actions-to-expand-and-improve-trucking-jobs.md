title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration\u2019s Unprecedented Actions to Expand\
  \ and Improve Trucking\_Jobs"
---
 
Since Day 1, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken on the supply
chain disruptions and price increases resulting from the decades-long
lack of investment in the nation’s goods movement supply chain. The
Administration enacted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to bring our
infrastructure to the 21<sup>st</sup> century, worked with ports to
[clear the
docks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nec/briefing-room/2022/01/20/a-record-year-for-americas-ports-and-a-look-to-the-year-ahead/)
and gets good moving, launched [a pilot
initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-initiative-to-improve-supply-chain-data-flow/)
to create the digital infrastructure to connect key stakeholders in the
supply chain, and more. The result is a modern goods movement system
that boosts American competitiveness and cuts families’ costs.  
  
Trucking moves 72 percent of goods in America and is a lynchpin in our
goods movement supply chain. Trucking costs [grew more than 20 percent
last year](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=NEHY) as a surge in
demand for goods caused by the pandemic confronted a decline in trucking
employment that preceded the pandemic. The low supply of drivers is
driven by high turnover and low job quality. Turnover in trucking
routinely [averages 90
percent](https://www.trucking.org/news-insights/turnover-remained-unchanged-large-truckload-fleets-fourth-quarter#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%2C%20the,72%25%20in%20the%20previous%20year.)
for some carriers and drivers [spend about 40 percent of their
workday](https://transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2021-11-17%20Hearing%20Testimony%20-%20David%20HC%20Correll%20UPDATED.pdf)
waiting to load and unload goods –  hours that are typically unpaid.
Many truckers are not directly employed and operate as independent small
businesses, bearing the burden of leasing, gas, insurance, and
maintenance costs themselves. These financial burdens cause many to
leave the profession. Trucking also draws on an older, heavily male
workforce—the median age is [four years
higher](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18b.htm) than the overall
workforce and [almost 90 percent](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm)
of the industry is men—which adds to its recruiting challenges.  
  
Last December, the Administration confronted these challenges head on. 
The U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Labor
[launched a Trucking Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-trucking-action-plan-to-strengthen-americas-trucking-workforce/)
to increase the supply of truck drivers by creating new pathways into
the profession, cutting red tape to expand high quality training through
Registered Apprenticeship, and laying the foundation for improving job
quality to keep people in the profession.  
  
**Major Achievements of Biden Effort to Expand and Improve Trucking
Jobs:**

-   Getting Americans Working in Better Trucking Jobs: Since President
    Biden took office, we have seen historic increases in trucking
    employment with 2021 registering as the best year for trucking
    employment growth since 1994 and December 2021-February 2022 as the
    best three-month stretch for long distance truck hiring since the
    1990s. And frontline truckers’ real wages grew this year despite
    elevated inflation.  
-   Cutting red-tape in Commercial Driver’s licensing: DOT gave states
    the tools to more than double new commercial driver’s license
    issuances in January and February 2022 compared to January and
    February 2021. States have issued more than 876,000 CDLs since
    January 2021.  
-   Scaling Registered Apprenticeships in trucking to improve retention:
    Over 100 employers including Domino’s, Frito-Lay, and UPS launched
    Registered Apprenticeship programs in 90 days as DOL cut the amount
    of time it takes to a launch a program from months to as little as
    48 hours. This could result in more than 10,000 additional
    apprentices.  
-   Helping connect veterans to trucking careers: The trucking industry
    partnered with leading Veterans Service Organizations to launch
    *Task Force Movement: Life-Cycle Pathways for Veterans and Military
    into Trucking,* chaired by former Congressman and veteran Patrick
    Murphy, to support the recruitment and retention of veterans and
    military family members. 

Since the launch of the plan in December, the Administration hosted
seven listening sessions with over 100 participants. Continuing to
listen and work with drivers is a pillar of the Administration’s work to
address job quality in the DOL and DOT’s *Driving Good Jobs Initiative*.
This initiative supports the trucking workforce by creating a task force
on truck leasing arrangements, launching a Women of Trucking Advisory
Board, and more. The Administration is also committed to addressing core
job quality challenges from misclassification to hours of service to
workplace safety.

**Getting Americans to Work in Better Trucking Jobs**  
When President Biden took office, there were 30,000 fewer trucking jobs
than in February 2020 and trucking employment had been falling even
before that. But last year’s historic job growth across the economy
resulted in 2021 registering as the best year for trucking job growth
since 1994. Trucking employment now exceeds its pre-pandemic level by
35,000 and is higher than it was before it began to decline in 2019.
Trucking employment growth over the last year was strongest in
California where it exceeded 10 percent as well as Missouri, New Jersey,
Ohio, and Washington where it exceeded 8 percent.

Long-distance truck driving has been the sector of trucking facing the
most challenges, but we are now seeing fresh momentum there: December
through February was the best three-month stretch for long-distancing
trucking employment growth since the 1990s (data are currently only
available through February).

**Cutting Red Tape: More than Doubling Commercial Driver’s License
Processing Compared to 2021**  
The Administration and U.S. Department of Transportation worked with
states and Governors to accelerate CDL processing. DOT announced over
$57 million in funding available to help states expedite CDLs,
coordinated waivers, sent all 50 states a toolkit detailing specific
actions to expedite licensing and worked hand-in-hand with states to
address challenges. This resulted in a 112 percent increase in CDL
processing in January and February 2022 compared to January and February
2021. States have issued more than 876,000 CDLs since January 2021.

**Scaling Apprenticeships: Moving the Market on How Truckers are
Recruited, Trained, and Retained**  
The Departments of Labor and Transportation launched the [90 Day
Trucking Apprenticeship
Challenge](/www.apprenticeship.gov/90-day-trucking-apprenticeship-challenge&data=04%7C01%7Cbenjamin.halle@dot.gov%7C86cf7ddd4b6a4ffb94a808d9d5eecc30%7Cc4cd245b44f04395a1aa3848d258f78b%7C0%7C0%7C637776043870402562%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=%7C3000&sdata=ytX8ojo+2PmP1cmtIIw/y0H+mR/nGLZ96AJwdDE4j2s=&reserved=0%3c) to
jumpstart this proven workforce strategy in trucking.

-   Over 100 employers across trucking, food and grocery, and the oil
    and gas industries launched Registered Apprenticeship programs in 90
    days. This includes Domino’s, Frito-Lay, UPS, states and national
    partners such as FASTPORT and the International Brotherhood of the
    Teamsters. This proven earn and learn model of workforce training
    will help employers and labor develop and retain a skilled
    workforce. Apprentices are already hitting the road with NFI and
    Total Transportation each hiring over 50 apprentices after launching
    new programs under the Apprenticeship Challenge.

With these 100 employers and 7 trade associations now offering
apprenticeships, we have nearly doubled the number of programs
nationwide. This could, in turn, double the number of registered
apprenticeships in 2022 and result in more than 10,000 new registered
apprenticeships. As a point of comparison, annual trucking employment
growth averaged 24,000 in the decade before the pandemic.

-   Through the Apprenticeship Challenge, industry associations are now
    leading on the expansion of trucking apprenticeships and will be
    across the U.S. for years to come. This includes the American
    Trucking Association, the National Tank Truck Association, FMI (the
    Food Industry Association), the National Minority Trucking
    Association, the North American Punjabi Trucking Association, and
    the Truckload Carriers Association. And the Trucking Alliance, where
    every member carrier – among the largest long-haul companies that
    collectively employ more than 80,000 drivers – committed to offer
    truck driver registered apprenticeships in more than 200
    apprenticeship locations in 36 states across the country.  
-   Over 70 additional employers of all sizes and industry segments
    including Sysco and WM (Waste Management Inc.) are in the process of
    developing and launching apprenticeship programs.  
-   DOT [launched the *Safe Driver Apprenticeship
    Pilot*](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safedriver), established through
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to safely connect American adults
    under the age of 21 to good-paying jobs in the trucking industry
    through Registered Apprenticeship.

**Connecting Veterans to Trucking: Forging Partnerships to Help Veterans
and Transitioning Service Members Enter Trucking**  
The Administration worked with Veterans Service Organizations and
related associations representing more than 4 million veterans and
military family members to create ways for the industry to attract,
train, place, and retain veterans in trucking jobs. This builds on the
already strong connection between veterans and trucking as [at least one
in ten truckers are
veterans](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/06/america-keeps-on-trucking.html#:~:text=At%20least%20one%20in%2010,a%20disability%20than%20other%20workers.),
which is double the rate of workers overall.

-   The trucking industry partnered with leading Veterans Service
    Organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American
    Legion, and the Union Veterans Council to launch *Task Force
    Movement: Life-Cycle Pathways for Veterans and Military into
    Trucking,* chaired by former Congressman and veteran Patrick Murphy,
    to support the recruitment and retention of veterans and military
    family members in trucking.  
-   DOL partnered with FASTPORT to connect transitioning service members
    with apprenticeship and employment opportunities in the trucking
    industry, while DOD has committed to improve its credentialing
    programs for all service members—200,000 of whom [transition out of
    military service each
    year](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/programs/tap#:~:text=Every%20year%2C%20approximately%20200%2C000%20men,the%20military%20to%20civilian%20transition).

**Continuing the *Driving Good Jobs* Initiative to Improve the Quality
of Trucking Careers**  
The Administration launched the new *Driving Good Jobs* initiative
between DOL and DOT to commit to ongoing work to ensure trucking jobs
are good jobs. Over the last 90 Days, the Administration held a number
of listening sessions and engagements with drivers, unions and worker
centers, industry, and advocates to ensure their voices and experiences
are shaping future actions across key areas. The initiative will
maintain a focus on:

-   ***Ensuring a safe and inclusive industry for women***: Expanding
    opportunities for women in trucking, including by creating safe and
    inclusive work environments, is critical for increasing trucking
    supply. This includes:  
-   The *Women of Trucking Advisory Board* will review and report on
    challenges facing woman drivers and those interested in joining the
    profession, such as on-the-job safety risks, mentorship, quality
    training, and opportunities for advancement.  DOT [has
    begun](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/newsroom/fmcsa-announces-call-applications-women-trucking-advisory-board)
    soliciting nominations.  
-   The Administration is announcing a Day of Action in April,
    coinciding with Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, to
    raise awareness and advocate for the prevention of sexual assault
    and sexual harassment in trucking. We will call on industry to
    commit to actions to promote safe training and work environments
    including zero-tolerance policies for sexual assault, improving
    sexual harassment training, and more.  
-   The Administration is taking steps to ensure drivers entering the
    profession have a safe environment. DOT is now highlighting
    whistleblower and coercion protections for individuals facing sexual
    harassment and unsafe training conditions in its Entry Level Driver
    Training Program FAQ, which will be distributed to the 11,000
    training providers. DOL is identifying employers in the trucking
    industry that have built supportive and inclusive workplaces for
    women and developing a “train the trainer” module for new Registered
    Apprenticeships sponsors who would receive a “seal of approval” upon
    completion to indicate training programs follow model
    gender-responsive training standards.  
-   ***Truck Leasing:*** DOT, DOL, and the Consumer Financial Protection
    Bureau (CFPB), have stood up a Truck Leasing Task Force to address
    predatory truck leasing arrangements and identify actions that could
    make leases more equitable and transparent.  The Task Force will
    review and report on **c**ommon leasing arrangements, arrangements
    that result in outsize and unanticipated debt for incoming drivers,
    and more.  
-   ***Detention Time and Compensation Studies:*** DOT released a scope
    of work to study driver detention time — the loading and unloading
    time that is often unpaid — and its impact on safety and
    compensation. This study will provide a detailed understanding of
    wait time’s effects on drivers across jurisdictions and industry
    sectors. DOT is also partnering with the National Academies of
    Science to study the impact various methods of driver compensation
    have on safety and retention.  
-   ***Truck Parking:*** Lack of truck parking across the country is
    about more than just inconvenience, it impacts safety and retention
    as exhausted drivers have nowhere to rest. The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides funding in at least five programs
    that states can use to address truck parking while requiring states
    to include an analysis of truck parking needs in their State freight
    plans, laying the foundation to understand local needs.  
-   ***Strengthening workplace safety and worker’s rights:*** DOL and
    DOT will continue coordination on critical truck driver labor,
    employment and safety protections, including releasing new guidance
    and information for drivers about their workplace rights, and
    employers about their obligations. Additionally, they are conducting
    joint outreach and education to employers and drivers about these
    rights and responsibilities under federal wage and hour law.  The
    Administration is committed to addressing core challenges, such as
    worker misclassification, while expanding high-road employer
    practices to build a next generation trucking workforce.
