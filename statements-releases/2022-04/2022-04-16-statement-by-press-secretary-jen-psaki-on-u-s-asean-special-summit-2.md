President Biden will host the Leaders of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Washington, DC on May 12 and 13 for a
U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.

The Special Summit will demonstrate the United States’ enduring
commitment to ASEAN, recognizing its central role in delivering
sustainable solutions to the region’s most pressing challenges, and
commemorate 45 years of U.S.-ASEAN relations. It will build on President
Biden’s participation in the October 2021 U.S.-ASEAN Summit, where the
President announced $102 million in new initiatives to expand our
engagement with ASEAN on COVID-19 recovery and health security, fighting
the climate crisis, stimulating broad-based economic growth, promoting
gender equality, and deepening people-to-people ties. 

It is a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration to serve as a
strong, reliable partner in Southeast Asia. Our shared aspirations for
the region will continue to underpin our common commitment to advance an
Indo-Pacific that is free and open, secure, connected, and resilient.
