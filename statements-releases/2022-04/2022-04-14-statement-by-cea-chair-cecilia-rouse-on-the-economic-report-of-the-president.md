Today, I am pleased to announce that the Council of Economic Advisers
has released the Economic Report of the President, which includes the
Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers. This Report
demonstrates the robust economic progress we have made over the past
year, and makes the case for the Administration’s economic policy
priorities.

The Report begins with a reflection by President Biden on the
Administration’s economic accomplishments over the 2021 calendar year
and opportunities and challenges ahead. The Annual Report of the Council
of Economic Advisers follows and includes seven chapters, a report on
CEA’s activities in 2021, and statistical tables relating to income,
employment, and production.
