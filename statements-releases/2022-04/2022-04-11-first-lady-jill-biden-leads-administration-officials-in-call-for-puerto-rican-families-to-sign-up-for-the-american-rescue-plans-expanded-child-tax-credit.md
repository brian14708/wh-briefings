title: "First Lady Jill\_Biden Leads Administration Officials in Call for Puerto Rican\
  \ Families to Sign Up for the American Rescue Plan\u2019s Expanded Child Tax\_Credit"
---
 
President Biden is committed to creating an economy that works for every
American. Part of that agenda is to ensure that families in Puerto Rico
are treated fairly in our tax system. Historically, the prior Child Tax
Credit (CTC) only applied to families in Puerto Rico with three or more
qualifying children, and therefore only 10% of families with children
were eligible.  
   
That changed when President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP).
It not only provided the largest Child Tax Credit nationwide to the most
ever families, it also made sure that, for the first time, families and
children in Puerto Rico fully benefited – permanently fixing the credit
to give Puerto Rico families equal access. This tax filing season, 97%
of Puerto Rico families with children are now eligible for the expanded
CTC. The law also *<u>permanently</u>* changed the structure of the CTC
so that every child in Puerto Rico will get the credit on the same basis
as all other American children. This will mean that parents in Puerto
Rico will have, as President Biden says, a “little more breathing room”
in meeting the costs of raising a family and that there will be fewer
children in Puerto Rico living in poverty.  
   
The ARP also meant a historic expansion of the federal government’s
commitment to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in Puerto Rico.
Together, the expanded CTC and EITC could provide an estimated $1
billion annually in critical benefits to hundreds of thousands of low-
and moderate-income working people and families in Puerto Rico.  
   
Today, as part of a final push to encourage families in Puerto Rico to
file their taxes and receive both the CTC and EITC, First Lady Dr. Jill
Biden, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, House Chairwoman Nydia
Velazquez, Deputy Secretary of Treasury Wally Adeyemo, and American
Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling are holding a special virtual
event with UnidosUS, the Hispanic Federation, the Institute of Youth
Development/Instituto del Desarrollo de la Juventud (IDJ), Espacios
Abiertos, and United Way of Puerto Rico. The Biden Administration and
these leading non-profits are urging families to file their taxes by
April 18<sup>th</sup> to take advantage of this critical aid.   
  
**The American Rescue Plan made historic, permanent changes to the Child
Tax Credit for Puerto Rico families – making the credit available to 97%
of Puerto Rico families this year, compared to 10% before the ARP**

-   Previously, ***<u>only Puerto Rico families with three or more
    qualifying children or more qualified for any Child Tax Credit
    benefit</u>***.  
-   This meant that before the American Rescue Plan, ***<u>only about
    10% of Puerto Rico families qualified for any Child Tax Credit.  
    </u>***
-   The ARP permanently changed that policy to extend the CTC to Puerto
    Rico families with fewer than three qualifying children who were
    previously excluded. [As a
    result](https://www.cbpp.org/blog/tax-credit-expansions-expected-to-significantly-reduce-poverty-in-puerto-rico)
    of the ARP, ***<u>97% of Puerto Rico families with children are
    eligible for the 2021 Child Tax Credit.  
    </u>***
-   For 2021, the ARP increased the Child Tax Credit to ***<u>$3,600 per
    child under 6 and $3,000 per child 6-17</u>*** – and ensured that
    lower income families could access the full credit.  
-   In addition, the ARP provided the first-ever federal support for
    Puerto Rico’s local Earned Income Tax Credit – allowing Puerto Rico
    to **<u>more than</u>** triple EITC **<u>benefits</u>** and extend
    **<u>the EITC</u>** to more workers for the next 10 years.

Together, the ARP’s expansions of the CTC and EITC
are [estimated](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/american-rescue-plan-act-provides-critical-permanent-tax-relief-to-puerto-rico) to
**provide over $1 billion in tax relief** per year going forward. They
stand to benefit hundreds of thousands of Puerto Rico families – with
the families of over 500,000 children eligible for the 2021 expanded
CTC.  
  
**Today’s event builds on substantial White House-Treasury Department
efforts to ensure access to the 2021 Child Tax Credit in Puerto Rico:**

-   **The White House and Treasury Department in collaboration with
    UnidosUS created a Weekly CTC/EITC Puerto Rico Working Group, with
    the Youth Development Institute (IDJ), Espacios Abiertos, Hispanic
    Federation, and others, to increase awareness and take up rates**
    among newly eligible families in Puerto Rico for the CTC and Local
    EITC. This group is comprised of representatives of the Puerto Rico
    government, Hacienda (the local tax authority), Treasury, IRS, and
    local stakeholders — including community-based organizations and
    other advocates in Puerto Rico – who work to remove barriers for the
    implementation of tax credit policies. Collaboration across these
    groups has already led to the execution or launch of over 35 local
    community events, navigator trainings and capacity building
    engagements for local elected officials and municipal staff. More
    than 240 municipal and state agencies employees were trained to
    scale and implement integrated outreach strategies and provide free
    tax preparation services for low-to-middle income communities.  
-   **The White House and Treasury Department collaborated closely with
    the Governor of Puerto Rico, Mayors, foundations and NGOs on the
    island to increase awareness and CTC sign-ups in Puerto Rico.** The
    White House ARP Implementation Coordinator, White House
    Intergovernmental Affairs and Treasury teams met twice at the White
    House with the Governor of Puerto Rico on CTC outreach strategy and
    had several meetings with top Puerto Rican mayors. The White House
    ARP Implementation Team also organized several meetings with
    foundations on the importance of investing in CTC outreach in Puerto
    Rico.  
-   **The Administration launched a stand-alone section of
    ChildTaxCredit.gov for Puerto Rico families and outreach partners.**
    [Childtaxcredit.gov/es/puerto-rico/](https://www.childtaxcredit.gov/es/puerto-rico/)
    highlights the unique and unprecedented access for families with
    children to benefit from the enhanced CTC and provides information
    on how to claim the credit in plain language, Spanish, and a mobile
    friendly format.  
-   **The Treasury Department and the White House worked to build
    capacity for Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Centers and
    Facilitated Self-Assistance (FSA) Sites**, including through
    navigator training and volunteer recruitment scale-up for tax prep
    assistance in low income communities. Currently there are 43 tax
    assistance sites, including VITA and FSA in the island.  
-   **The Administration amplified the island-wide public campaign by
    the Alliance for Economic Security in Puerto Rico, and garnering
    support from state/local government.** The Alliance, composed by the
    Hispanic Federation, Instituto del Desarrollo de la Juventud (IDJ)
    and Espacios Abiertos coalesced to launch
     [ReclamaTuDineroPR.com](https://reclamatudineropr.com/) to further
    promote awareness of these tax benefits. In addition, the
    Administration has helped amplify these efforts and match trained
    IRS volunteers with Mayors and municipalities to host “Fill-a-thons”
    (“Llenatones” in Spanish) – to ensure all families with children
    learn about the credit and can receive tax filing assistance through
    a local community event.   
-   **Treasury provided training for mayors in Puerto Rico on how to
    leverage ARP State & Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) to do CTC and
    EITC outreach and tax filing assistance outreach** in collaboration
    with the White House, the Government of Puerto Rico, the Association
    of Mayors, and the Federation of Mayors of Puerto Rico to maximize
    critical State and Local ARP funds for local governments in Puerto
    Rico.
