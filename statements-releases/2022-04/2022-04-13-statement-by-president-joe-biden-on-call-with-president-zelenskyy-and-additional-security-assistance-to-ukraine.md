title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Call with President Zelenskyy and Additional\
  \ Security Assistance to\_Ukraine"
---
 
I just spoke with President Zelenskyy and shared with him that my
Administration is authorizing an additional $800 million in weapons,
ammunition, and other security assistance to Ukraine. The Ukrainian
military has used the weapons we are providing to devastating effect. As
Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region, the United
States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend
itself.  
   
This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective
weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored
to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine.
These new capabilities include artillery systems, artillery rounds, and
armored personnel carriers. I have also approved the transfer of
additional helicopters. In addition, we continue to facilitate the
transfer of significant capabilities from our Allies and partners around
the world.   
   
The steady supply of weapons the United States and its Allies and
partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its
fight against the Russian invasion. It has helped ensure that Putin
failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine. We cannot
rest now. As I assured President Zelenskyy, the American people will
continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for
freedom.
