This week, Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh was in New
Delhi to discuss ways to deepen U.S.-India economic cooperation and
advance our shared interest in a free and open Indo-Pacific. Singh also
continued our close consultations with Indian counterparts about the
destabilizing economic impacts of Russiaâ€™s war against Ukraine. Singh
met with Principal Secretary P.K. Mishra, Minister of Commerce and
Indian G20 Sherpa Piyush Goyal, Foreign Secretary Harsh V. Shringla,
Deputy National Security Advisor Vikram Misri, and Department of
Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth. Singh consulted with Indian
counterparts on the goals and mechanisms of U.S. sanctions imposed on
Russia and ways to cooperate on addressing global food insecurity and
global energy prices. Singh and his counterparts also advanced ongoing
discussions about the development of an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework,
delivering high-quality infrastructure through Build Back Better World,
the development of an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and strengthening
the global economy. The conversations were productive and both sides
committed to continue their close consultations.
