title: "FACT SHEET: The Small Business Boom Under the Biden-\u2060Harris\_Administration"
---
 
Through the American Rescue Plan and the equitable implementation of
emergency relief programs, President Biden and Vice President Harris
fostered the strongest recovery for Main Street on record. In 2021,
Americans applied to start 5.4 million new businesses—more than 20
percent higher than any previous year on record.

The boom in new business creation has been particularly strong for
entrepreneurs of color. In 2021, Hispanic Americans started new
businesses at the fastest rate in more than a decade and 23 percent
faster than pre-pandemic levels.

And, in the three-quarters of 2021, small businesses with fewer than 50
employees created 1.9 million jobs, the fastest start to small business
job growth in any year on record.

This new White House report details the historic recovery for America’s
small businesses and demonstrates how the Biden-Harris agenda laid the
foundation for this small business boom. By focusing on combatting the
pandemic, providing Americans with greater financial security, and
delivering more than $450 billion in emergency relief to small
businesses, the Biden-Harris Administration has helped create the
conditions for unprecedented business and job creation.

The Biden-Harris strategy to rescue and revitalize Main Street contrasts
sharply with the latest tax plan from Republicans in Congress. The
Congressional Republican proposal put forward by Senator Rick Scott to
impose a minimum tax on middle-class families would increase taxes on
small businesses across the country. In addition to detailing the
historic economic progress the Biden-Harris Administration has made to
date, the Appendix includes a new state-by-state analysis of the
Congressional Republican tax plan. The analysis finds that this tax plan
would raise taxes on nearly half of small business owners (6.1 million
people), including 82 percent of small business owners making less than
$50,000 per year. Under the Congressional Republicans’ plan, the typical
small business owner would see their taxes increased by almost $1,200.

President Biden rejects Congressional Republicans’ plan to increase
taxes on half of small business owners. His four-pillar economic
strategy for small businesses will lower costs and level the playing
field for families and small businesses. The plan is focused on:

1.     Expanding access to capital,

2.     Making historic investments in helping small businesses navigate
available resources,

3.     Leveraging federal spending to support small businesses, and

4.     Leveling the playing field for small business owners by reforming
the tax code.
