As the world reels from the impact of geopolitical events, like Putin’s
war of choice, and other supply chain shocks, it is clear that investing
in domestic manufacturing is critical for our economic and national
security. Today, the EXIM Bank Board of Directors voted unanimously to
approve the Make More In America Initiative. This program will expand
the export prowess of American manufacturing and support new jobs for
Americans all across the country. 

The Make More in America Initiative will help expand production capacity
in the United States by providing vital access to capital—one of the
barriers American manufacturers face when trying to expand their
operations, especially the small and medium-sized businesses that are
the core of America’s domestic industrial base.  As American
manufacturers compete with unfair practices overseas, this program is
one step toward a more even playing field. This initiative will support
the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to expand America’s global
competitiveness in the industries of the future—from clean energy and
clean technology to semiconductor production.

Establishment of this initiative was a key recommendation from the
President’s Executive Order 14017 to build more resilient, secure, and
sustainable supply chains. We applaud the EXIM Bank’s Board in moving
forward to bring this initiative to life.
