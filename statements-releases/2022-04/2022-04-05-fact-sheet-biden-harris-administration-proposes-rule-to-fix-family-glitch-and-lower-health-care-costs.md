*President Biden Announces Proposal to Take Most Significant
Administrative Action to Improve Implementation of the ACA Since its
Enactment*

President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that health care is a
right, not a privilege. They promised to protect and build on the
Affordable Care Act (ACA), lowering costs and expanding coverage so that
every American has the peace of mind that health insurance brings.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration continues to deliver on that promise.
Thanks to the landmark American Rescue Plan, ACA premiums are at an
all-time low, while enrollment is at an all-time high. Four out of five
Americans can find quality coverage for under $10 a month, and families
are saving an average of $2,400 on their annual premiums—$200 in savings
every month back to families. The Administration has lowered costs and
increased enrollment to a record high of 14.5 million
Americans—including nearly 6 million who newly gained coverage. With the
addition of Missouri and Oklahoma, two states that expanded Medicaid
last year, nearly 19 million low-income Americans are enrolled in the
ACA’s Medicaid expansion coverage, adding up to a record nearly 80
million children, pregnant women, seniors, people with disabilities, and
other low-income Americans covered by Medicaid.  
  
**<u>PROPOSING TO FIX THE “FAMILY GLITCH”</u>**  
  
**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a rule to
strengthen the ACA by fixing the “family glitch,” which would save
hundreds of thousands of families hundreds of dollars a month.**  
  
Under the ACA, people who do not have access to “affordable” health
insurance through their jobs may qualify for a premium tax credit to
purchase affordable, high-quality coverage on the ACA’s health insurance
marketplaces. Current regulations define employer-based health insurance
as “affordable” if the coverage solely for the employee, and not for
family members, is affordable, making family members ineligible for a
premium tax credit even though they need it to afford high-quality
coverage through the Marketplace.  For family members of an employee
offered health coverage through an employer, the cost of that family
coverage can sometimes be very expensive and make health insurance out
of reach. The “family glitch” affects about 5 million people and has
made it impossible for many families to use the premium tax credit to
purchase an affordable, high-quality Marketplace plan.  
  
The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service are proposing
to eliminate the “family glitch.” Should today’s proposed rule be
finalized, family members of workers who are offered affordable
self-only coverage but unaffordable family coverage may qualify for
premium tax credits to buy ACA coverage. Should the proposed change be
made, it’s estimated that 200,000 uninsured people would gain coverage,
and nearly 1 million Americans would see their coverage become more
affordable. Many families would be able to save hundreds of dollars a
month thanks to lower premiums. This proposed rule would amount to the
most significant administrative action to improve implementation of the
ACA since its enactment.  
  
**<u>EXECUTIVE ORDER CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN AMERICANS’ ACCESS TO
AFFORDABLE, QUALITY HEALTH COVERAGE</u>**  
  
Last January, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/28/executive-order-on-strengthening-medicaid-and-the-affordable-care-act/)
directing federal agencies to take action to strengthen Medicaid and the
Affordable Care Act. Today, President Biden is building on that
directive with a new Executive Order directing federal agencies to
continue doing everything in their power to expand affordable, quality
health coverage. This includes:

-   Making it easier for people to enroll in and keep their coverage.  
-   Helping people better understand their coverage options so they can
    pick the best one for them.  
-   Strengthening and improving the generosity of benefits and improving
    access to health care providers.  
-   Improving the comprehensiveness of coverage and protecting Americans
    from low-quality coverage.  
-   Continuing to make health coverage more accessible and affordable by
    expanding eligibility and lowering costs for Americans with ACA,
    Medicare, or Medicaid coverage.  
-   Connecting people to health care services by improving access to
    health care providers and linkages between the health care system
    and communities to help Americans with health-related needs.  
-   Taking steps to help reduce the burden of medical debt that far too
    many Americans experience.

**<u>ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE ACA AND MEDICAID</u>**  
  
These latest actions build on months of work to strengthen the ACA and
Medicaid by lowering costs and expanding coverage.

-   ***Lowered premiums and out of pocket costs for millions of
    Americans.*** As the biggest expansion of affordable health care
    since the ACA, the American Rescue Plan (ARP) included enhanced
    subsidies that lowered premiums for 9 million Americans by an
    average of $50 per month per person. The enhanced subsidies helped
    [expand](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/18cd655222dc3de64866b269143731ce/aca-briefing-book-aspe-03-2022.pdf)
    the availability of free and low-cost health plans to millions of
    consumers with nearly half of existing consumers able to enroll in a
    silver level plan with no premium and 70 percent of existing able to
    enroll in a low-premium silver plan. In addition, the Administration
    lowered the cap on total out-of-pocket costs by $400 in 2022.  
-   ***Made it easier to sign up for affordable coverage, including
    opening a Special Enrollment Period in 2021.*** In addition to
    opening a Special Enrollment Period last year, which enabled nearly
    3 million Americans to newly sign up for coverage under the ACA, the
    Administration extended HealthCare.gov’s Open Enrollment period by
    one month, giving people more time to sign up for coverage The
    Administration operated the most successful Open Enrollment Period
    in history last year, with a historic 14.5 million Americans signing
    up for ACA coverage and another million people signing up for the
    Basic Health Program, an alternative coverage program created by the
    ACA.  The Administration also eliminated unnecessary paperwork and
    increased outreach, quadrupling the number of trained Navigators to
    help Americans sign up for coverage on HealthCare.gov. These efforts
    helped reach communities that have historically been left behind,
    with the HealthCare.gov enrollment rate increasing by 26 percent for
    Hispanic Americans and 35 percent for Black Americans.  
-   ***Facilitated the expansion of Medicaid in Missouri and
    Oklahoma.*** The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
    helped Missouri and Oklahoma become the 38<sup>th</sup> and
    39<sup>th</sup> states to expand Medicaid, which will cover nearly
    half a million more low-income Americans in those two states.
    Missouri and Oklahoma are also taking advantage of the ARP’s
    financial incentive to expand Medicaid, which is
    [expected](https://www.medicaid.gov/state-resource-center/downloads/allstatecall-20210330.pdf)
    to provide an extra $968 million and $500 million in federal dollars
    to these states, respectively.   
-   ***Expanded and strengthened access to home care for millions of
    older Americans and people with disabilities.*** The ARP provided
    states with increased Medicaid funding to help expand access to home
    care services, furthering the Administration’s commitment to
    ensuring people can get the care they need in their homes and
    communities.  The additional Medicaid funding will also help states
    strengthen their home- and community-based services programs by
    investing in the home care workforce and other innovations to
    improve the delivery of care.  
-   ***Provided new options to help people experiencing a behavioral
    health crisis.*** Thanks to the ARP, states can now receive enhanced
    Medicaid funding to establish mobile crisis intervention services
    teams to help provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries
    experiencing a behavioral health crisis.  This new option is a key
    component in the Administration’s
    [strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-strategy-to-address-our-national-mental-health-crisis-as-part-of-unity-agenda-in-his-first-state-of-the-union/)
    to address the Nation’s mental health crisis by ensuring that
    Medicaid beneficiaries experiencing a behavioral health crisis can
    get connected to the care they need.  
-   ***Tackled the maternal health crisis.*** Medicaid covers more than
    40 percent of births in the United States. Thanks to the ARP and the
    Vice President’s leadership, the Biden-Harris Administration
    partnered with Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, and Louisiana to make
    sure new moms can keep their Medicaid coverage for a year after they
    deliver. Another 9 states are in the process of seeking CMS approval
    to expand postpartum coverage to their states as well. Based on HHS
    estimates, more than 83,000 beneficiaries across five states will
    benefit from this extended post-partum coverage during the critical
    first year after delivery.
