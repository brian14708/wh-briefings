title: Statement by President Biden Marking the Occasion of Ramadan
---
 
Jill and I extend our best wishes to Muslim communities here in the
United States and around the world on the beginning of the blessed month
of Ramadan.

For so many around the globe, including fellow Americans all across the
country, this sacred month is a time for reflection and spiritual
growth. Communities come together to practice forgiveness and
resilience, to show compassion and generosity of spirit to those in
need, of giving, and to celebrate the many blessings of life with loved
ones.

This year, the simple act of breaking the fast will be an even more
poignant reminder of the joys of health, family, and community.  And we
will continue to hold in our hearts all those families grieving a lost
loved one who are facing an empty chair at the table.

As we continue to rebuild from the pandemic, we must also continue all
of our efforts to stand with all those who are suffering and vulnerable
around the world, those who are facing persecution or hardship.  As the
Holy Qur’an teaches, “whoever does even an atom’s weight of good will
see its results.”

Every day, we see heartbreaking accounts of lost lives and the images of
families and children struggling to survive. These tragedies remind us
of our common humanity—and the common teaching of all great faiths,
including Islam—that we should always do unto others as we would have
done unto us. During this holy month, as Muslims everywhere honor God’s
great mercy let us also renew our shared commitment to show kindness,
mercy, and understanding to one another.  Let us honor the simple yet
profound truth that all people are equal in dignity and rights. That’s
why the United States will continue to speak out for human rights
everywhere–including for Uyghurs in China, Rohingya in Burma, and other
Muslim communities all over the world.

From the Biden family to yours, and from the People’s House to your own
homes, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a blessed and prosperous
month. *Ramadan Kareem*!
