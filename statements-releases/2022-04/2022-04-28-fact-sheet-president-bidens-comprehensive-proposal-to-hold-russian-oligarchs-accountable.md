title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Comprehensive Proposal to Hold Russian\
  \ Oligarchs and Elites\_Accountable"
---
 
Today, in concert with his supplemental request to Congress to support
Ukraine, President Biden will send a proposal for a comprehensive
legislative package that will enhance the United States Government’s
authority to hold the Russian government and Russian oligarchs
accountable for President Putin’s war against Ukraine. The proposals
were crafted in close consultation with interagency partners, including
the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, the
Department of State, and the Department of Commerce. The Biden
Administration looks forward to working closely with Members of Congress
as a whole to implement this package of proposals.

This package of proposals will establish new authorities for the
forfeiture of property linked to Russian kleptocracy, allow the
government to use the proceeds to support Ukraine, and further
strengthen related law enforcement tools. 

**Establishing a Streamlined Administrative Authority to Seize and
Forfeit Oligarch Assets:** This proposal aims to streamline the process
for seizure of oligarch assets, expand the assets subject to seizure,
and enable the proceeds to flow to Ukraine. It would:

-   Create a new, streamlined administrative process involving the
    Departments of the Treasury and Justice, for the forfeiture of
    property in the United States that is owned by sanctioned Russian
    oligarchs and that has a connection to specified unlawful conduct. A
    forfeiture decision would be reviewable in federal court on an
    expedited basis.

<!-- -->

-   Create a new criminal offense, making it unlawful for any person to
    knowingly or intentionally possess proceeds directly obtained from
    corrupt dealings with the Russian government.

**Enabling the Transfer of the Proceeds of Forfeited Kleptocrat Property
to Ukraine to Remediate Harms of Russian Aggression.** This proposal
would improve the United States’ ability to use forfeited oligarch funds
to remediate harms caused to Ukraine by Russian aggression. Under the
proposal, the Departments of Justice, Treasury, and State will work
together to use forfeited funds related to corruption, sanctions and
export control violations, and other specified offenses to remediate
harms of Russian aggression toward Ukraine.

**Clamping Down on Facilitation of Sanctions Evasion:** This proposal
would allow for the forfeiture of property that Russian oligarchs use to
facilitate the evasion of sanctions. Under current law, the United
States can forfeit the proceeds of sanctions violations, but it cannot
forfeit property used to facilitate sanctions violations. This proposal
closes that gap.

**Modernizing Racketeering to Include Sanctions Evasion:** This proposal
would strengthen the United States’ ability to investigate and prosecute
sanctions evasion by adding the crime of sanctions evasion to the
definition of “racketeering activity” in the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. This proposal would give the
Department of Justice a powerful forfeiture tool used against
racketeering enterprises to dismantle organizations that enable
violations of U.S. sanctions.

**Expanding the Time Limit to Follow the Money:** This proposal would
improve the United States’ ability to pursue money laundering
prosecutions (and post-conviction forfeitures) based on foreign offenses
by extending the statute of limitations from five years to ten
years. Criminal investigations of oligarchs can be complicated because
sophisticated criminals use intricate schemes that may cut across
multiple jurisdictions. The United States often works with international
partners on these cases. Extending the statute of limitations would
provide additional time for investigators and prosecutors to hold
oligarchs criminally accountable.

**Leveraging Foreign Partners’ Ability to Freeze and Seize Oligarch
Wealth:** This proposal would improve the United States’ ability to work
with international partners to recover assets linked to foreign
corruption. This proposal would make several amendments to improve our
ability to enforce foreign restraint and forfeiture orders in the United
States. 

**The United States has already been working with allies and partners to
track down assets all over the world:**

-   In March, the U.S., led by the Department of the Treasury and
    Department of Justice, launched the Russian Elites, Proxies, and
    Oligarchs Task Force with international partners to coordinate the
    freezing and seizing of Russian assets around the world.
-   So far, member states in the European Union have reported freezing
    over $30 billion in assets, including almost $7 billion in boats,
    helicopters, real estate, and artwork.
-   Dozens of yachts have been seized by REPO Task Force member
    countries. The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned and blocked vessels and
    aircraft worth over $1 billion, as well as frozen hundreds of
    millions of dollars of assets belonging to Russian elites in U.S.
    bank accounts.
-   Last week, in the wake of criminal charges, Treasury designated a
    global sanctions evasion network associated with Konstantin
    Malofeyev, crack downing on the movement of illicit assets.
-   [Earlier this
    month](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/90-million-yacht-sanctioned-russian-oligarch-viktor-vekselberg-seized-spain-request-united),
    the Department of Justice announced that Spain seized a 255-foot,
    $90 million yacht of sanctioned Russian Oligarch Viktor Vekselberg
    at the request of United States.
