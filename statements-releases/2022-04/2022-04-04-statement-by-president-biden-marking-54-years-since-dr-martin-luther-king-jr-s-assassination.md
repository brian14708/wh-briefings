title: "Statement by President\_Biden Marking 54 Years Since Dr. Martin Luther King,\
  \ Jr.\u2019s\_Assassination"
---
 
A few years ago, I visited the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis,
which is the site of the Lorraine Motel. I stood on its balcony, where
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. last stood before a hateful gunman took away
his last breath fifty-four years ago today.

The motel balcony leads back into Dr. King’s room, preserved just as it
was on that day.  The bed is unmade. Coffee cups are on the table. 
There is a restless spirit in that room – of a dream deferred, of
unfinished business. The night before, Dr. King preached from the pulpit
of Mason Temple and delivered what would be his final sermon, *“Let us
move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America
what it ought to be.”*  
   
Fifty-four years later, his charge remains as vital as it was that
night. A charge to make real the promise of America for all Americans –
a promise that holds we are all created equally and deserve to be
treated equally throughout our lives. As a nation, we have never fully
lived up to that promise, but we have never fully walked away from it
either.

And in this past year, we have made great strides forward by putting
racial equity at the center of our work: to beat COVID-19, rebuild our
economy, tackle the climate crisis, and root out systemic racism from
our nation’s laws, policies, and institutions. But whether it’s
delivering racial justice, safeguarding the sacred right to vote, or
giving hate no safe harbor, we know that challenges remain.

As we look ahead, on this day of remembrance, let us pray for Dr. King
and his family. Let us redouble our efforts to deliver the promise of
America that he gave his life for.

Let us move on in these powerful days to come.
