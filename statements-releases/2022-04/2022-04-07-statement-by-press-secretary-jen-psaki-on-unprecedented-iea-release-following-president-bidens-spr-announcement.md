title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on Unprecedented IEA Release Following\
  \ President\_Biden\u2019s SPR\_Announcement"
---
 
Last week, President Biden announced a historic release from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve of 1 million barrels a day for six months
and said it would be in coordination with other countries releasing tens
of millions of additional barrels on the market. Today after around the
clock diplomacy by the United States and our allies and partners, the
International Energy Agency announced a historic collective release with
member countries outside of the United States releasing an additional 60
million barrels. Together with the United States’ commitment, this will
add a combined global amount of 240 million barrels. It is both the
largest release from the United States and the largest release from
other IEA countries in history, and will support American consumers and
the global economy.

Today’s announcement is another result of President Biden’s unwavering
focus on doing everything in his power to help American families who are
paying more out of pocket as a result of Putin’s war of choice against
Ukraine. Since Putin accelerated his military build-up around Ukraine
this past winter, gas prices have increased by nearly a dollar per
gallon because less oil is getting to market, and the reduction in
supply is raising prices at the pump for Americans. We will continue to
take every action we can to increase supply in the immediate term so
families can pay for gas while at the same time working with the
international community to achieve energy independence that reduces
demand for oil and bolsters our clean energy economy.
