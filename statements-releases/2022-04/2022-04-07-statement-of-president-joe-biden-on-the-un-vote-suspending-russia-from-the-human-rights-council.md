title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the UN Vote Suspending Russia from the\
  \ Human Rights\_Council"
---
 
I applaud the overwhelming vote today in the General Assembly of the
United Nations to kick Russia off the UN Human Rights Council. This is a
meaningful step by the international community further demonstrating how
Putin’s war has made Russia an international pariah.

The United States worked closely with our Allies and partners around the
world to drive this vote because Russia is committing gross and systemic
violations of human rights. Russian forces are committing war crimes.
Russia has no place on the Human Rights Council. After today’s historic
vote, Russia will not be able to participate in the Council’s work or
spread its disinformation there as the Council’s Commission of Inquiry
investigates Russia’s violations and abuses of human rights in Ukraine. 

The images we are seeing out of Bucha and other areas of Ukraine as
Russian troops withdraw are horrifying. The signs of people being raped,
tortured, executed—in some cases having their bodies desecrated—are an
outrage to our common humanity. Russia’s lies are no match for the
undeniable evidence of what is happening in Ukraine. That’s why nations
in every region condemn Russia’s unprovoked and brutal aggression
against Ukraine and support the brave people of Ukraine in their fight
for freedom. And we will continue to work with responsible nations
around the world to gather evidence to hold Russia accountable for the
atrocities being committed, increase the pressure on Russia’s economy,
and isolate Russia on the international stage.
