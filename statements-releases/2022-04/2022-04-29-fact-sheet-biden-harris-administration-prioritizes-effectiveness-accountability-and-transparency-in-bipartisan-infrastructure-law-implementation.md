Today, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released initial
[guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/M-22-12.pdf)
to federal agencies to set a strong foundation for effective, efficient,
and equitable implementation of President Biden’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law—a historic investment in rebuilding roads and
bridges, providing clean drinking water, and ensuring access to
affordable internet. As the President said in the State of the Union,
“in my administration, the watchdogs are back.” President Biden has a
long-standing commitment to collaboration with Inspectors General (IGs)
and the broader oversight community, dating back to his leadership as
Vice President when he was tasked with implementation of the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act. He has made clear that results and
accountability go hand-in-hand, and that to deliver results for all
Americans, the federal government must act—and support appropriate
oversight of its activities—in a manner deserving of public trust.   
  
The initial guidance will ensure that there is minimal fraud, waste, and
abuse in the implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and
projects are delivered on time and on budget by delivering results with
accountability, effectiveness, and transparency, collaborating with
inspectors general and the oversight community, and, providing technical
and financial assistance for communities. The guidance was informed by
the Infrastructure Implementation Task Force and stakeholders, reflects
discussion with the oversight community, and reflects President Biden’s
long-standing commitment to robust oversight and effective stewardship
of taxpayer dollars.  
  
This afternoon, President Biden and senior administration
officials—including OMB Director Shalanda Young, Infrastructure
Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu, American Rescue Plan
Implementation Coordinator Gene Sperling, and OMB Deputy Director for
Management Jason Miller—will meet with agency Inspectors General (IGs)
who have been providing oversight to the implementation of the American
Rescue Plan and who will provide oversight of implementation of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The meeting will also include the
leadership of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and
Efficiency (CIGIE) and the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee
(PRAC).  The President, his senior advisors, and IGs will discuss steps
they are taking to ensure robust oversight of federal programs.  
  
Upon signing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, President Biden signed
an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/15/fact-sheet-president-bidens-executive-order-establishing-priorities-and-task-force-for-implementation-of-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law/)
establishing the Task Force to coordinate effective implementation.
Co-chaired by Senior Advisor and Infrastructure Implementation
Coordinator Mitch Landrieu and National Economic Director Brian Deese,
Task Force members include the heads of federal departments, agencies,
and offices with infrastructure implementation responsibilities. The
Task Force—which has held 11 Cabinet-level meetings—has focused on
cross-agency coordination, ensuring public trust and accountability, and
tackling important interagency issues like developing technical
assistance and capacity-building resources for state, local, Tribal and
territorial governments that will spend as much as 90 percent of the
law’s funding. To date, each primary agency has identified an
infrastructure implementation coordinator. The White House
Infrastructure Implementation Team and agency coordinators have convened
at least weekly since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed.  
  
**DELIVERING RESULTS WITH ACCOUNTABILITY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND
TRANSPARENCY**  
  
One of the primary goals for implementation of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law established by the President’s Executive Order was to
“invest public dollars efficiently, avoid waste, and focus on measurable
outcomes for the American people.” The initial implementation guidance
issued by OMB today directs agencies to ensure accountable stewardship
of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, building on effective
practices from the Administration’s implementation of the American
Rescue Plan, as well as existing financial management and reporting
requirements set forth in statute and prior OMB guidance. Additional
guidance may be issued by OMB on topics that require further direction,
including on the implementation priorities set forth by the President in
his Executive Order. The guidance includes direction on:

-   **Using data and evidence.** In designing and implementing
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Programs, agencies are charged to make
    evidence-based decisions, transparently describe the criteria for
    investment decisions, set and track measurable goals, performance
    indicators, and milestones, use data to measure and evaluate
    progress, and foster a culture of continuous improvement.
-   **Planning for program implementation.** To ensure Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law-funded programs are implemented efficiently and
    effectively, agencies must plan for program implementation to be
    consistent with statutory requirements and address the requirements,
    recommendations, and priorities in the President’s Executive Order
    and the new OMB guidance. This implementation planning must also
    include program-level financial management controls and risk
    mitigation strategies.
-   **Documenting selection criteria and review processes.** Agencies
    must also document their review and selection process for
    discretionary programs, which must be consistent with the criteria,
    review, and selection information provided in Notices of Funding
    Opportunity (NOFOs), so that projects meet program goals.
-   **Reporting on awards and subawards.** Agencies are already
    reporting monthly, including information about obligations and
    outlays, to USAspending.gov for all funding through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. Agencies are directed to ensure the quality and
    accuracy of award descriptions and recipient data on USAspending.gov
    to help inform the public of the purpose of the federal awards and
    where the funding ultimately goes.
-   **Going farther in post-award reporting.** For grant and cooperative
    agreement programs funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
    post-award reporting that demonstrates progress toward achieving
    outcomes will help maintain accountability to taxpayers and advance
    equity. The Administration is prioritizing post-award reporting of
    data with the following goals in mind: designing programs with clear
    goals and objectives; executing programs efficiently and
    effectively; promoting transparency and building trust with the
    public; delivering exemplary customer experience for recipients; and
    building capacity for evidence building. Agencies will take
    program-specific approaches to collecting and reporting post-award
    information about project location and phase of project
    implementation, going farther than past reporting requirements.
    Public-facing performance dashboards will be developed and shared
    online.

**COLLABORATING WITH INSPECTORS GENERAL AND THE OVERSIGHT COMMUNITY**  
  
At the President’s direction and through the leadership of the American
Rescue Plan Implementation Coordinator Gene Sperling, the Administration
has been collaborating across agencies and with the PRAC on the
implementation and stewardship of programs funded through the American
Rescue Plan. To institutionalize the President’s approach and the
lessons learned in ARP implementation, OMB issued
[guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/M-22-04-IG-Cooperation.pdf)
last December directing agency leaders to support the important role of
agency IGs, including by communicating with their staffs the President’s
expectation of cooperation with IG offices.    
  
In the first five months of implementation of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the Task Force has regularly met with CIGIE and the
Government Accountability Office (GAO), and leaders of agencies with
infrastructure implementation responsibilities are meeting with their
agency IGs, consistent with OMB’s Government-wide guidance on agency-IG
cooperation.  
  
The new OMB guidance directs agencies to continue this collaboration
through implementation of programs funded through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. The guidance includes direction on: 

-   **Engaging with IGs at the front end of program design.** Agencies
    are directed to proactively engage with oversight entities,
    including agency IGs and the GAO, delivering on President Biden’s
    expectation that agencies ensure that programs balance efficient
    results, equitable access, and program integrity, including minimal
    waste, fraud, and abuse.
-   **Holding joint program review meetings with IGs.** For new and
    expanded Bipartisan Infrastructure Law programs where significant
    program design is being implemented, agencies must engage with OMB
    and the agency’s IG for a dedicated joint review meeting to
    proactively discuss program design, risk mitigation strategies,
    financial controls, and data, tracking, and reporting. The “Gold
    Standard Meeting” process was developed by the White House American
    Rescue Plan Implementation Team and OMB, and these meetings have
    promoted proactive and transparent collaboration for new and
    expanded programs with tangible improvements.
-   **Identifying and mitigating risks.** Agencies are directed to use
    enterprise risk management practices and cooperation with their IGs
    to identify and mitigate risks during program design, including
    putting in place financial management controls to address payment
    integrity risks. The OMB guidance charges agency leadership to
    inform their IG when the agency is deciding to take on added risk,
    especially in new or changed programs, to expand access to the
    program, or when leveraging new technology or systems.

**PROVIDING TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR COMMUNITIES**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is working to ensure that the benefits
of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law reach all communities, including
rural communities and communities that are marginalized, underserved,
overburdened, or capacity constrained. These communities often lack
adequate resources to navigate complex federal award-making processes.
Building on ongoing Administration efforts, the new OMB guidance directs
agencies to reduce barriers, including administrative burden, and
increase access for communities, funding recipients, and funding
beneficiaries. The guidance includes direction on:

-   **Collaborating with state, local, Tribal, and territorial
    governments.** The guidance charges agencies to collaborate with
    state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to support
    communities in accessing infrastructure funding. This includes
    designating teams to provide central coordination among agencies and
    territorial governments, as well as teams to coordinate across
    agencies on rural issues and technical assistance for economically
    distressed, rural communities. In addition, agencies will ensure
    their Tribal relations or Tribal affairs offices have designated
    liaisons to coordinate with, so that the Administration expands
    technical assistance and support for Tribal governments.
-   **Providing technical assistance to underserved and
    capacity-constrained communities.** Agencies are directed to use to
    the fullest extent possible existing and new technical assistance
    resources to support underserved and capacity-constrained
    communities, including rural communities, in accessing federal
    resources. This includes providing direct federal technical
    assistance in accessing grants and other types of financial
    assistance, as well as support for data infrastructure and tools for
    evidence building and use among funding recipients.
-   **Engaging with affected communities.** Agencies are directed to,
    when feasible, engage affected communities so their perspectives and
    expertise inform policy development, program design, and delivery
    processes.  Agencies will focus particularly on underserved and
    capacity-constrained communities and stakeholders who may not have
    previously been able to apply for federal funding, including rural
    and urban communities and Tribal and territorial governments.
