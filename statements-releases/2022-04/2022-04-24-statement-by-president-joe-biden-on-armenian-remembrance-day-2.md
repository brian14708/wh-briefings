title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Armenian Remembrance\_Day"
---
 
On April 24, 1915, Ottoman authorities arrested Armenian intellectuals
and community leaders in Constantinople. Thus began the Armenian
genocideâ€”one of the worst mass atrocities of the 20th century. Today, we
remember the one and a half million Armenians who were deported,
massacred, or marched to their deaths in a campaign of extermination,
and mourn the tragic loss of so many lives.

As we reflect on the Armenian genocide, we renew our pledge to remain
vigilant against the corrosive influence of hate in all its forms. We
recommit ourselves to speaking out and stopping atrocities that leave
lasting scars on the world. And, as we mourn what was lost during the
Meds Yeghern, let us redouble our efforts toward healing and building
the better, more peaceful world that we wish for our children. A world
where human rights are respected, where the evils of bigotry and
intolerance do not mark our daily lives, and where people everywhere are
free to pursue their lives in dignity and security.

This is also a moment to reflect on the strength and resiliency of the
Armenian people. After enduring a genocide, the Armenian people were
determined to rebuild their community and their culture, so often in new
homes and new lands, including the United States. Armenian Americans are
a vital part of the fabric of the United States. They make our nation
stronger and more dynamic, even as they continue to carry with them the
tragic knowledge of what their ancestors endured. We recognize their
pain and honor their story.

Today, 107 years later, the American people continue to honor all
Armenians who perished in the genocide.
