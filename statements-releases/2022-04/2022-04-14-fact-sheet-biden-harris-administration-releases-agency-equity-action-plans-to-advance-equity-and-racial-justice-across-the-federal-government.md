title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Releases Agency Equity Action\
  \ Plans to Advance Equity and Racial Justice Across the Federal\_Government"
---
 
On his first day in office, President Biden signed [Executive Order
13985](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/),
Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through
the Federal Government. That historic Executive Order directed the whole
of the federal government to advance an ambitious equity and racial
justice agenda. Today, more than 90 federal agencies, including all
Cabinet-level agencies, are releasing the first-ever Equity Action Plans
that lay out more than 300 concrete strategies and commitments to
address the systemic barriers in our nation’s policies and programs that
hold too many underserved communities back from prosperity, dignity, and
equality.  
  
Advancing equity is not a one-year project—it is a generational
commitment. These plans are an important step forward, reflecting the
Biden-Harris Administration’s work to make the promise of America real
for every American, including by implementing the first-ever national
strategy on gender equity and equality; working to ensure the federal
government is a model for diversity equity, inclusion and accessibility;
working to deliver environmental justice through the Justice40
Initiative; and working to prevent and combat discrimination on the
basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.

**Delivering Greater Equity for the American People**  
  
Across the federal government, agencies are taking ambitious action to
expand federal investment and support in communities that have been
locked out of opportunity for too long, including communities of color,
Tribal communities, rural communities, LGBTQI+ communities, people with
disabilities, women and girls, and communities impacted by persistent
poverty. New agency commitments include:

-   The **Department of Labor** is strengthening the enforcement of our
    nation’s wage and hour protections to support underserved workers
    who are the most vulnerable to wage theft and violations, especially
    women of color, and is in the process of launching a new initiative
    to address barriers that workers of color face in equitably
    accessing Unemployment Insurance benefits.
-   The **Department of Housing and Urban Development** is working to
    eliminate the racial gap in homeownership, address the
    disproportionate rates of homelessness among underserved
    communities, and reduce bias in home appraisals through the
    interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity.  
-   The **Environmental Protection Agency** is developing a
    comprehensive framework for evaluating the cumulative impacts of
    pollution on underserved, low-income communities.  EPA will also
    reinvigorate civil rights enforcement to ensure that environmental
    justice is at the heart of the agency’s mission.  
-   The **Department of Transportation** is increasing investments in
    underserved communities by launching a national technical assistance
    center to provide targeted support with planning, project
    development, grant applications, and project delivery for
    communities that face barriers to accessing transportation
    resources.  
-   The **Department of Justice** is improving language access to its
    programs so that Americans with limited English proficiency can
    better report crimes, access services, understand their rights, and
    otherwise have full and equal access to the Department’s programs
    and resources.  
-   The **Department of the Interior** is providing technical assistance
    to Tribes to help them navigate grant application processes, and
    partnering with Tribal Colleges and Universities to build capacity
    for Tribes to apply for funding.  
-   The **Department of Commerce** is investing nearly $50 billion in
    broadband infrastructure deployment, affordability, and digital
    inclusion efforts to help close the digital divide, particularly for
    rural and Tribal communities.  
-   The **Department of Health and Human Services** is increasing
    outreach to communities of color to encourage enrollment in free and
    low-cost health care, and is addressing the maternal mortality
    crisis that disproportionately impacts Black and Native families,
    including by working with states to extend postpartum coverage in
    Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.   
-   The **Department of Homeland Security** is working to ensure
    that underserved communities are treated fairly in airport
    screenings by improving systems and enhancing training for officers.
    DHS is also engaging with and improving underserved communities’
    access to grant programs that help counter domestic violent
    extremism to better address the terrorism-related threat to our
    country posed by white supremacists and other domestic terrorists.  
-   The **Department of Defense** is advancing the safe and equitable
    use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to mitigate
    algorithmic bias by investing in agency-wide responsible AI
    development and investing in the development of a more diverse AI
    workforce, including through partnerships with Historically Black
    Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions
    (MSIs).  
-   The **State Department** is increasing engagement with partners from
    underserved racial and ethnic communities, applying new equity
    analyses, and improving demographic data collection and analysis to
    better embed equity and gender equality into U.S. foreign
    policies.   
-   The **Department of Veterans Affairs** is advancing health equity by
    further addressing the social and economic determinants of health
    for underserved veterans, including veterans of color, women
    veterans, and LGBTQI+ veterans. The Department is also launching a
    Data for Equity strategy, a veteran-centered model that will
    synchronize data on health care, disability benefits, and other
    services to identify and address gaps.  
-   The **U.S. Department of Agriculture** is expanding equitable access
    to nutrition assistance programs and strengthening gender equity by
    implementing a national awareness campaign and expanding the
    implementation of online ordering in the Women, Infants, and
    Children (WIC) nutrition program.  
-   The **Department of Education** is advancing college access and
    college completion by investing in HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, community
    colleges, and other under-resourced public institutions, and
    supporting schools to raise college completion rates for underserved
    students.  
-   The **Department of Energy** is ensuring equitable access to
    weatherization assistance programs so that low-income households
    have increased access to energy security.  
-   The **Small Business Administration** is investing in improved
    technology to increase access to capital for businesses in
    underserved communities and minority-owned businesses by
    streamlining program applications and integrating data.  
-   The **National Aeronautics and Space Administration** (NASA) is
    releasing Earth science data in more accessible formats, and
    providing free, multi-lingual training on how to use NASA data to
    help mitigate environmental challenges in underserved communities.
    NASA will also conduct an analysis to identify and address barriers
    to awards of its grants to HBCUs and MSIs.  
-   The **Social Security Administration** is identifying inequalities
    and addressing systemic administrative barriers to participation in
    key safety net programs, such as disability benefits, and ensuring
    equitable service delivery for unrepresented individuals navigating
    the disability application appeals process, and increase gender
    equity in its services.  
-   The **Federal Emergency Management Agency** (FEMA) is closing the
    flood insurance gap to increase the financial resilience of
    flood-prone, low-income households. FEMA is also promoting equitable
    outcomes for disaster survivors by increasing eligibility for and
    access to assistance programs for underserved and vulnerable
    applicants.

**Embedding Equity in the Everyday Business of Government**  
  
In addition to prioritizing greater equity in the services the federal
government provides the American people, Agency Equity Action Plans also
contain innovative new strategies to embed equity, racial justice, and
gender equality in day-to-day governing. These approaches include:  

-   **Building accountability for equity through data collection and
    reporting.** Better demographic data is key to advancing equity,
    offering insight into whether government programs, benefits, and
    services are reaching all communities. Recognizing this, President
    Biden established a first-of-its-kind Equitable Data Working Group
    to facilitate appropriate expanded collection and use of demographic
    data toward advancing equity. Cross-agency practices are being
    developed to address specific barriers to generating and using
    equitable data efficiently and appropriately, including how best to
    share and acquire disaggregated data and how to increase community
    access to data while protecting individual privacy and promoting
    public trust in the data. More information on the Working Group’s
    efforts, including initial recommendations, will be released in the
    coming weeks.  
-   **Reducing administrative burdens and simplifying government
    services.** Under newly-released
    [guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/M-22-10.pdf)
    from the Office of Management and Budget, agencies are reducing the
    complexity of forms and enrollment procedures to address the
    often-hidden barriers to access for governmental services, ensuring
    that information is written clearly, and expanding from in-person
    interview requirements to telephone or virtual options.  
-   **Reimagining federal service design and delivery through life
    experiences.**  The Biden-Harris Administration is building a new
    approach to delivering government services based on how people
    actually live their lives rather than an approach based on
    bureaucracy. This new approach requires agencies to work within and
    across government, to better serve Americans during significant
    events or transitions that often require interaction with multiple
    federal agencies and levels of government, like surviving a
    disaster.  
-   **Engaging with stakeholders and communities who have been
    historically excluded**. To ensure government policies are informed
    by the broadest cross-section of Americans, agencies are engaging
    trusted intermediaries and tailoring outreach to make meaningful and
    authentic participation possible for a wider range of Americans.  
-   **Narrowing wealth gaps through federal contracting and
    procurement**. As the largest buyer in the world, the federal
    government will address racial and gender wealth gaps by leveraging
    the power of federal procurement to drive greater investment in
    minority-owned and women-owned small businesses.  
-   **Delivering equity through grantmaking**. Persistent barriers make
    it difficult for under-resourced and underserved communities to be
    aware of, compete for, and effectively deploy federal grants for
    everything from infrastructure to medical research. Agencies are
    addressing these barriers by helping underserved communities learn
    about and navigate federal funding opportunities, expanding
    capacity-building efforts, and embedding a focus on equity into
    decision-making about how to award federal grants.  
-   **Advancing equity through American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law Implementation**. The President has made equity a
    priority in the implementation of two of the most ambitious
    legislative packages in generations, with the goal of ensuring an
    inclusive response and recovery from the pandemic and in rebuilding
    our nation’s infrastructure.
