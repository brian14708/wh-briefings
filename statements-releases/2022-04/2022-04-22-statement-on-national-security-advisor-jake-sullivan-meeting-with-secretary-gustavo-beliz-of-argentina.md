addressing food security and energy resilience.  They also spoke of the
importance of responding to humanitarian crises.  In addition, they
continue their work on the roadmap for bilateral cooperation and a
partnership for sustainable and inclusive development that has led to

satellite technology, and human rights since their first meeting in
August 2021. They highlighted the importance of the knowledge economy
and leading-edge technology in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic
and promoted cooperation in strategic sectors such as green energy and

of strengthening the multilateral development banks and attracting U.S.
private investment to build a green, equitable, and inclusive  recovery
from the pandemic.  Mr. Sullivan and Secretary Beliz discussed President
Biden and President Fernandez’s vison and shared commitments towards
sustainable and inclusive development in the region that will be
highlighted in the Summit of the Americas.
