title: "Statement from the President on Delivery of Air Defense Systems to\_Ukraine"
---
 
Since the outset of my administration, the United States has placed the
highest priority on delivering critical military capabilities to Ukraine
so it can defend itself against Russian aggression. The entire world has
now witnessed the effectiveness of those weapons, as courageous
Ukrainian forces have used them to repel the Russian attack on Kyiv,
keep the skies of Ukraine contested, and deliver severe blows to the
Russian military.

In addition to U.S.-produced weapons, we have also worked to facilitate
the transfer of capabilities from our Allies and partners around the
world. I want to thank the Slovakian government for providing an S-300
air defense system to Ukraine, something President Zelenskyy has
personally raised with me in our conversations. To enable this transfer
and ensure the continued security of Slovakia, the United States will
reposition a U.S. Patriot missile system to Slovakia.  

Now is no time for complacency. The Russian military may have failed in
its objective of capturing Kyiv, but it continues to inflict horrific
acts of brutality on the Ukrainian people. As the Russian military
repositions for the next phase of this war, I have directed my
Administration to continue to spare no effort to identify and provide to
the Ukrainian military the advanced weapons capabilities it needs to
defend its country.
