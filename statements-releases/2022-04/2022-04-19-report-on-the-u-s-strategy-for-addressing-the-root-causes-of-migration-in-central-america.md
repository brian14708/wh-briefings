[Vice President Harris launched the Root Causes
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/29/fact-sheet-strategy-to-address-the-root-causes-of-migration-in-central-america/)
on July 29, 2021, to align U.S. Government efforts to address the
economic, governance, and security drivers of irregular migration from
Central America.  Tackling the persistent challenges that drive
irregular migration requires sustained political will and cooperation
across a broad range of stakeholders to foster long-term development in
the region.  The Vice President has led progress on the Administration’s
Strategy, including by traveling to
[Guatemala](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/07/fact-sheet-u-s-guatemala-cooperation/),
[Mexico](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/11/18/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-lopez-obrador-of-mexico-before-bilateral-meeting/),
and
[Honduras](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/27/readout-of-vice-president-harriss-meeting-with-president-castro-of-honduras/)
to launch new initiatives that sustainably address the root causes of
migration. 

Recognizing the important role for the private sector, Vice President
Harris brought together private sector leaders through a [*Call to
Action,*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-new-commitments-as-part-of-the-call-to-action-for-the-private-sector-to-deepen-investment-in-central-america-now-totaling-over-1-2-billion/)
which has resulted in over $1.2 billion in private sector commitments in
Central America to create new jobs and opportunities for people in the
region.  Vice President Harris also engaged partners around the world to
support our work and generate new commitments.  

The Biden-Harris Administration’s strategy represents a comprehensive
approach to promoting inclusive economic growth in the region with a
sharp focus on strengthening democratic governance and combatting
corruption, women’s empowerment, climate change, human rights, security
and curbing gender-based violence.  It integrates various U.S.
Government tools, including foreign assistance, development finance,
public diplomacy, and economic sanctions and visa restrictions.  Because
the region’s long-term development will require more than just the
resources of the U.S. Government, the Strategy forges strong
partnerships with the private sector and international partners. 

**Mobilizing Private Sector Investment**

The Vice President’s leadership has brought together private sector
leaders through a *Call to Action*.  In collaboration with the
Partnership for Central America, this has resulted in  more than $1.2
billion in private sector commitments in Central America to create new
jobs and opportunities for people in the region.  The *Call to Action’s*
six focus areas are intended to support long-term development of the
region.  They are: promoting a reform agenda; digital and financial
inclusion; food security and climate-smart agriculture; climate
adaptation and clean energy; education and workforce development; and
public health access.

Companies that have made investments and commitments in the region
include Microsoft, Nespresso, Mastercard, CARE International, Cargill,
Grupo Mariposa, Parkdale Mills, PepsiCo, JDE Peet’s, and PriceSmart. 
These initial commitments are already bearing fruit.  Some highlights
include:

-   **Internet Access: ** Microsoft catalyzed the development of digital
    access training centers, clean off-grid energy, and broadband access
    covering a population of 1.1 million people, and is on track to
    connect 4 million people to broadband by 2024.
-   **Support for Farmers**:  Nespresso works with over 1,200 farms in
    Guatemala to improve livelihoods in the region. The company
    announced its first-ever coffee sourcing from Honduras and El
    Salvador, with plans to increase activities in the region for the
    next harvest season. This is part of the company’s commitment to
    support the region’s economy with a minimum of $150 million to be
    spent across coffee purchases, price premiums, and technical
    assistance by 2025.

<!-- -->

-   **Digital and Financial Inclusion**:  Mastercard committed to bring
    five million people in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras into the
    formal financial economy and to digitize one million micro and small
    businesses.** ** The company established a Digital Country
    Partnership with Guatemala’s Ministry of the Economy, accelerating
    their work to bring five million people in El Salvador, Guatemala,
    and Honduras into the formal financial economy.  This will also
    enable one million micro and small businesses to access online
    payment and management systems.

<!-- -->

-   **Job Creation and Supply Chain Resilience**:  Parkdale Mills is
    investing $150 million in a new yarn spinning facility in Honduras. 
    This support will provide customers with sources for purchasing one
    million pounds of yarn per week within the region while increasing
    U.S. supply chain resilience. The investment is intended to support
    roughly 500 employees at each location and increase indirect job
    growth in Honduras and in the United States, particularly in the
    U.S. cotton industry across 18 states. The investment also includes
    $24 million in new investments in solar energy, water recapture, and
    energy efficient HVAC systems.

<!-- -->

-   **Infrastructure and Renewable Energy Investments**:  PepsiCo will
    invest at least $190 million in northern Central America through
    2025.  The company’s planned investments include improvements to its
    infrastructure and manufacturing plants; expansion of new
    distribution routes; IT projects; and investments aligned with its
    “pep+” (PepsiCo Positive) agenda. This includes spreading
    regenerative farming practices across seven million acres (which is
    approximately the size of the company’s entire agricultural
    footprint), becoming Net Water Positive by 2030 by reducing absolute
    water use and replenishing watersheds, and achieving net-zero
    emissions by 2040 by increasing the use of renewable energy, among
    other efforts.

<!-- -->

-   **Support for Small Businesses**:  Grupo Mariposa will provide over
    70,000 small-business owners with access to credit and digital
    services.  It will also support 3,500 small and medium-enterprises
    with access to telemedicine, education, and Internet connectivity,
    impacting more than 200,000 people and expanding healthcare and
    telemedicine solutions to 2,000 remote communities. In addition, it
    will invest more than $10 million to grow its coffee footprint,
    creating more than 500 new jobs and supporting more than 400 small
    and medium-sized coffee producers to increase productivity and
    earnings potential.

<!-- -->

-   CARE announced its plans to establish a $50 million Center for
    Gender Equity in Central America focused on women and young people
    and designed to reach 500,000 individual women and their families,
    impacting two million people in total.  The Center will support
    public and private programs in the region – scaling up those that
    work – to support financial inclusion, women’s economic empowerment
    (including in the protection of labor rights and in supporting
    entrepreneurship), improved agricultural outcomes, and reductions in
    gender-based violence. In particular, CARE will support companies
    joining the Call to Action with technical assistance to ensure that
    a gender-based lens is applied to new programs and investment.

**Creating Economic Opportunity**

-   **Job Creation:**  In Fiscal Year 2021, USAID support to private
    sector firms in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras helped create
    more than 70,000 jobs, spurred $415 million in sales, and supported
    agricultural producers to gain access to $860 million in financing. 
    In Honduras, USAID helped establish a new $20 million loan facility
    to lend to underserved agricultural clients, especially women
    agribusiness owners.

<!-- -->

-   **Mobilizing Investment:**  Through USAID’s Guatemalan
    Entrepreneurship and Development Innovation initiative, announced by
    Vice President Harris in June 2021, USAID has leveraged $59 million,
    against its $7.5 million investment, from international and local
    private sector partners to scale technology-driven, market-led
    solutions to critical development challenges throughout the country.

<!-- -->

-   **Public-Private Partnerships:**  U.S. Government advocacy
    contributed to Guatemala’s first public-private partnership (PPP)
    project in November 2021, which will extend and repair the highway
    that connects the capital with the country’s primary Pacific port,
    Puerto Quetzal, and can serve as a model for other infrastructure
    investment and help Guatemalans bring their products to the global
    market.  The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), in December
    2021, awarded a feasibility study grant to develop a PPP that would
    install LED streetlights along more than 500 kilometers of highway
    across El Salvador to improve safety, increase energy efficiency,
    and lower energy costs.  These PPPs can serve as powerful models for
    future infrastructure investment collaboration in the region.

<!-- -->

-   **Access to Finance:**  In October 2021, the U.S. International
    Development Finance Corporation (DFC) disbursed $100 million to the
    Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) to fund
    financial institution intermediaries in El Salvador, Guatemala, and
    Honduras which will then lend to micro, small, and medium
    enterprises (MSMEs) to support economic recovery in the wake of the
    COVID-19 pandemic.  The DFC, with USAID funding, provided additional
    loan guarantees to entities in El Salvador and Honduras to enhance
    lending to women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and SMEs in
    high growth sectors of the economy to support economic growth and
    job creation within historically marginalized communities.  In
    September 2021, USAID finalized a new loan guarantee that is
    facilitating access to loans for SMEs in the Western Highlands of
    Guatemala, a region with high levels of out-migration.

<!-- -->

-   **Trade Facilitation:  **In August 2021, the Department of
    Commerce’s Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) and
    International Trade Administration (ITA) conducted a regional trade
    facilitation workshop with Guatemalan customs and trade ministries.
     In May and June of 2022, CLDP will host two workshops in Honduras
    on customs valuation and communication.  These workshops are part of
    a multiphase effort to promote transparency, cooperation, and
    coordination among the northern Central American governments and
    improve inter-regional trade.

**Strengthening Health and Education**

-   **Vaccine Doses:**  To assist people in the region in combating the
    COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Government has delivered more than 15
    million free-of-cost vaccine doses bilaterally and in partnership
    with COVAX to countries in northern Central America. Vaccination
    rates are steadily increasing in all three countries with Guatemala
    at 33 percent, Honduras at 46 percent, and El Salvador at 66 percent
    of their populations completing the initial COVID-19 vaccination
    protocol.

<!-- -->

-   **Vaccine Financing:**  In September 2021, the DFC, in conjunction
    with Citigroup Inc., provided a risk management solution to Gavi,
    the Vaccine Alliance, to mitigate risk and overcome financial
    hurdles with governments that are funding COVID-19 vaccine purchases
    through the COVAX Facility.  Of the $383 million in political risk
    insurance provided to Gavi, $50 million was provided to support
    allocation of vaccines to Guatemala.

<!-- -->

-     The U.S. Government has provided $26.4 million to El Salvador,
    $81.5 million to Guatemala, and $57.1 million to Honduras to support
    the fight against COVID-19 and strengthen health systems. 
    Assistance is supporting training health care workers and public
    health staff in critical care management and safe and effective
    administration of vaccines, building laboratory capacity,
    strengthening contact tracing efforts, sharing critical information
    to prevent the spread of disease, providing technical assistance for
    the health information systems needed to evaluate vaccine
    distribution equity and monitor vaccine safety, and bolstering
    oxygen systems to ensure availability for patients who need them in
    Guatemala and Honduras. 

<!-- -->

-   **Education:**  In El Salvador in November 2021, USAID launched a
    $20 million Scholarships for Education Project to curb irregular
    migration by increasing equitable access to formal educational
    opportunities for 6,450 returnees and potential migrants.  In
    Honduras, USAID installed Internet hotspots in 60 community learning
    centers and increased access to remote learning for more than 5,000
    people, including more than 600 returned migrant children. USAID
    also completed repairs on and expansions to two schools in western
    Honduras, which serve more than 1,800 local students in this area of
    high out-migration.  In Guatemala, USAID provided education
    assistance to more than 6,300 at-risk youth and launched new
    partnerships to strengthen English language programs.

**Enhancing Climate Resilience and Food Security**

-   **Humanitarian Assistance: ** Since April 2021, USAID reached
    approximately 1.9 million people impacted by recurrent droughts,
    COVID-19, and severe damage from Hurricanes Eta and Iota in northern
    Central America with life-saving humanitarian assistance such as
    emergency food assistance, health, livelihoods restoration,
    protection, shelter as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
    support. 

<!-- -->

-   **Food Security: ** The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    provided $30 million to expand its Food for Progress program in
    Guatemala, which will enable it to reach an additional 18,000
    producers.  USDA provided $45 million to expand its McGovern-Dole
    school feeding, health, nutrition, and educational programming in
    Guatemala and Honduras, reaching an additional 124,000
    beneficiaries, with a projection of nearly 400,000 beneficiaries
    over the life of the program.** ** In addition, in Fiscal Year 2021,
    USAID’s Feed the Future activities in Honduras directly assisted
    nearly 16,000 farm families and agribusinesses in adopting
    technologies to increase yields.  This assistance contributed to
    over $23 million in incremental sales.  In Guatemala, USAID’s Feed
    the Future activities created nearly 30,000 jobs and over $76
    million in sales while leveraging over $10 million in financing and
    $6 million in investment in the agricultural sector.

**Combating Corruption**

-   **Anti-Corruption Task Force:**  In June 2021, Vice President Harris
    announced the establishment of the Department of Justice’s
    Anti-Corruption Task Force (ACTF). The ACTF subsequently created a
    new tip line for reporting corruption in the region and the FBI has
    reviewed and followed up on the resulting tips.  The ACTF continues
    to operate the tip line and relies on relationships with
    counterparts, witnesses, cooperators and others in the region to
    streamline and prioritize investigations.  In addition, the number
    of Department of Justice Resident Legal Advisors (RLAs), supported
    by the Department of State, was increased throughout the region, and
    RLAs continue to work with their counterparts in El Salvador,
    Guatemala, and Honduras.  In November 2021, an RLA-assisted Honduran
    anti-corruption unit secured guilty verdicts against the former
    minister of health and former minister of labor on charges of
    embezzlement, bribery, fraud, and money laundering.  

<!-- -->

-   **Sanctions and Visa Restrictions: ** In December 2021, the
    Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on officials in El
    Salvador and Guatemala in connection with public corruption pursuant
    to the Global Magnitsky sanctions program, which allows for the
    targeting of corruption and serious human rights abuse.  In
    addition, the Department of State publicly designated several
    Guatemalan and Salvadoran officials under Section 7031(c) of the
    Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs
    Appropriations Act for their involvement in significant corruption,
    generally rendering them and their immediate family members
    ineligible for entry into the United States.  Prior to these
    actions, the Department of State publicly included multiple current
    and former officials and private individuals on the Section 353
    Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors List generally rendering these
    individuals ineligible for visas and admission to the United
    States. In August 2021, the United States also launched a new visa
    restriction authority under Section 212(1)(3)(C) of the Immigration
    and Nationality Act on the issuance of visas to current or former
    Guatemalan, Honduran, or Salvadoran government officials and other
    individuals believed to be responsible for, or complicit in,
    undermining democracy or the rule of law. 

<!-- -->

-   **Audit and Oversight:**  To promote transparency and fight
    corruption, USAID trained 100 auditors in Guatemala’s Specialized
    Center for Tax and Customs Crimes to better identify tax crimes,
    donated computer equipment for use in field audits, and provided
    technical assistance on the documentation of criminal complaints. 
    With USAID support, the Center has recovered nearly $80 million in
    tax revenue since its inception.

**Advancing Democracy, Promoting the Rule of Law, and Protecting Human
Rights**

-   **Democratic Elections:**  The Department of State and USAID engaged
    all levels of Honduran society and the government ahead of the
    November 2021 presidential election to promote free, fair, and
    peaceful elections that reflected the will of Honduran voters. 
    USAID assistance helped facilitate the country’s election through
    support to journalists and civil society organizations to
    objectively report on information about the election process,
    independent analyses that informed recommendations on elections
    security, and get out the vote campaigns.  USAID also supported the
    strengthening of electoral management bodies.  The Department of
    State supported training for police officers in advance of the
    elections, including content on the use of force and relevant
    election laws and procedures, and distributed 20,000 election day
    pocket guides to police officers emphasizing the importance of
    respecting the rights of all citizens to vote.  The election,
    characterized by high voter turnout, resulted in the peaceful
    election of the country’s first woman president. 

<!-- -->

-     Across the northern Central American countries, the Department of
    State and USAID worked together to promote human rights, labor
    rights, and press freedom.  USAID increased resources to respond to
    rising protection needs, providing critical support to journalists,
    human rights defenders, and anti-corruption champions.  USAID
    provided timely assistance to more than 30 human rights defenders
    and democracy advocates in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.  To
    respond to high rates of extortion, human trafficking, and violence
    among marginalized sexual and gender minority individuals, USAID
    supported LGBTQI+ civil society organizations to address regressive
    policies and advocate for reforms to key laws.  In Honduras, this
    included advocating for transgender individuals to be able to
    legally register under their chosen names, rather than the names on
    their birth certificates under the law governing the National
    Persons Registry.  A public petition garnered more than 4,000
    signatures before submission to the Honduran National Congress in
    November 2021.  As the Congress considers its response, LGBTQI+
    advocacy groups are engaged in related advocacy and policy efforts
    to further promote necessary protections. In addition, U.S. Southern
    Command’s Human Rights Initiative has efforts in all three northern
    Central American countries, helping to institutionalize respect for
    human rights in partner nation armed forces doctrine and
    professional education.

<!-- -->

-   **New Technical Assistance to Promote Labor Rights: ** The
    Department of Labor (DOL) recently announced $20 million in new
    programs in northern Central America.  Activities will focus on
    increasing collective action to address child and forced labor and
    improve occupational safety and health conditions of workers in the
    region.  Efforts also will improve the ability of workers to
    exercise their labor rights in agricultural supply chains in
    Guatemala and Honduras and the textile/apparel sector in El
    Salvador.  ** **

<!-- -->

-   **Labor Roundtables: **In June and July 2021, DOL hosted nine labor
    roundtables, convening over 50 unions and civil society
    organizations from the United States, El Salvador, Guatemala, and
    Honduras to discuss the nexus between labor issues and migration. 

**Combating Crime and Increasing Security **

-   **Human Smuggling: ** In June 2021, Vice President Harris announced
    the creation of a regional task force to identify, disrupt, and
    prevent migrant smuggling and human trafficking operations.Working
    with partners in the region, the Departments of Justice and Homeland
    Security’s Joint Task Force Alpha, which targets human smuggling,
    continues to identify and pursue priority human smuggling cases for
    prosecution within the United States.  Department of Justice RLAs,
    with Department of State support, are working with counterparts in
    El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to pursue investigations and
    prosecutions.  In November 2021, prosecutors mentored by RLAs
    obtained indictments against twenty members of a human smuggling
    organization (HSO) that operated throughout El Salvador and
    Guatemala.  In a coordinated effort, Guatemalan police and
    prosecutors also executed search warrants at five locations linked
    to the same HSO.  In January 2022, as part of another coordinated
    investigation with DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations,
    Guatemalan authorities executed 19 search warrants, seized over
    $200,000, and arrested ten Guatemalan nationals for violations of
    foreign law related to human smuggling and money laundering. In
    Honduras, U.S. government efforts resulted in the formation of a
    migration task force to focus on investigation and prosecution of
    smuggling and trafficking networks.  Since January 2021 this and
    other border security programs have resulted in the arrest of 283
    alleged human smugglers, the rescue of 200 minors, and a tripling in
    the number of migrants checked against U.S. criminal and terrorist
    databases.

<!-- -->

-   **Money Laundering:**  In November 2021, U.S.-mentored prosecutors
    in Honduras secured money laundering convictions against seven
    Honduran nationals who were high-level members of the Byron Ruiz
    drug trafficking organization previously convicted of aggravated
    drug trafficking charges in Honduras.

<!-- -->

-   **Civilian Law Enforcement:**  The Department of State worked to
    professionalize security forces across the region by training more
    than 5,000 civilian police in calendar year 2021 on topics such as
    community policing, investigations, and human rights.   
-   **Conventional Weapons Destruction:  **In 2021, the Department of
    State provided explosive ordnance disposal and stockpile management
    training to 86 security forces personnel, destroyed 7.91 metric tons
    of obsolete munitions, and provided physical security upgrades to
    vulnerable weapons storage facilities in El Salvador and Guatemala
    to prevent the illicit pilferage and proliferation of State-held
    weapons which contribute to armed violence and criminal activity in
    the region.  
-   **Regional Information Sharing:**  The Department of State supported
    a regional effort to share criminal intelligence about transnational
    criminal organizations and associated criminals in Central America,
    with a focus on migrant smuggling and human trafficking.  In 2021,
    this effort facilitated the identification of nearly 1,200 members
    of transnational criminal organizations.

<!-- -->

-   **Reinsertion of Former Offenders:**  In El Salvador, USAID
    supported an innovative and evidence-based reinsertion model for
    adult and youth populations exiting prison and gang-involvement,
    which in the last year has led to a 70 percent success rate of
    participants receiving employment or consistently participating in
    skill building support and not re-offending.    

**Focusing on Women and Youth**

-   **Gender-Based Violence:**   In February 2022, USAID awarded a $5
    million grant to El Refugio de la Niñez, a Guatemalan NGO, to expand
    education, legal, housing, medical, psychosocial and other services
    to survivors of trafficking in persons and unaccompanied migrant
    children. In September 2021, the Department of State supported the
    design and implementation of a specialized course for Honduran
    prosecutors on gender-based violence, including domestic violence,
    which launched with an initial class of 25 prosecutors in
    February 2022.  U.S. support is helping the Honduran National Police
    revamp its training curriculum to focus on incidents of gender-based
    violence and train 911 operators on how to prioritize and route the
    more than 60 reports of such violence daily.  U.S. programs are also
    significantly increasing post-violence victim support and resources.

<!-- -->

-   **Young Women’s Empowerment**:  With the June 2021 launch of its $40
    million Young Women’s Empowerment Initiative, USAID is partnering
    with Guatemalan indigenous and women’s organizations, private
    sector, and international organizations to increase education,
    professional training, and income-generating opportunities for
    thousands of indigenous Guatemalan women and girls.

<!-- -->

-   **Women Entrepreneurs:**  The Department of State’s Academy of Women
    Entrepreneurs (AWE) program in northern Central America provides
    women participants the knowledge, networks, and access to launch and
    scale their businesses through a proven combination of business
    classes, professional mentoring, and seed money.  In September 2021,
    Honduras added 315 new participants and in November 2021, Guatemala
    graduated a class of 120 women, including representatives from
    highland and Afro-Guatemalan Garifuna communities with high rates of
    emigration, while El Salvador graduated a class of 176 women, 36 of
    whom received $24,000 in seed capital to invest further in their
    businesses and create jobs in their communities.

<!-- -->

-   **Advancing Women’s Economic Empowerment:**  On January 4, 2022,
    USAID launched the *MujerProspera* (WomenProsper) challenge, seeking
    solutions that advance women’s economic security, employment, and/or
    entrepreneurship in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  With this
    challenge, USAID expects to issue up to 14 awards each valued
    between $150,000 and $500,000 later this spring.

<!-- -->

-   **At-Risk Youth:**  Since July 2021, USAID has provided psychosocial
    support and family counseling, gender-based violence prevention
    activities, life-skills training, vocational workshops, digital
    inclusion, sports and arts activities, and alternative education for
    youth left out of the formal education system for more than 27,500
    children and youth in 80 high-crime and out-migration communities of
    the north, central, and western regions of Honduras.  The Department
    of State worked with certified Gang Resistance Education and
    Training (G.R.E.A.T.) instructors across Honduras to reach more than
    100,000 children and help strengthen their ability to resist gang
    recruitment. In El Salvador, USAID launched a $20 million alliance
    (which includes $10 million in private sector leverage) with local
    partner Glasswing International to improve citizen security in
    targeted Salvadoran communities to help reduce irregular migration,
    with a goal of reaching 30,000 people (mostly youth) in five years
    with economic and educational opportunities.

**Enhancing Partnerships**

-   **Engaging Local Organizations:**  In November 2021, USAID announced
    *Centroamérica Local*, a five-year, $300 million initiative to
    empower local organizations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras
    to address the drivers of irregular migration to the United States.

<!-- -->

-   **Cooperation with Mexico:**  In December 2021, the United States
    and Mexico announced *Sembrando Oportunidades*, a new framework for
    development cooperation to address the root causes of irregular
    migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  These efforts
    are underway. In El Salvador, USAID is providing scholarships to
    graduates of Mexico’s youth workforce program, and in Honduras,
    USAID and its Mexican counterpart aim to reach more than 500,000
    at-risk youth with skills and experience that can lead to long-term
    employment.

**Diplomatic Engagement Around the World to Address Root Causes**
