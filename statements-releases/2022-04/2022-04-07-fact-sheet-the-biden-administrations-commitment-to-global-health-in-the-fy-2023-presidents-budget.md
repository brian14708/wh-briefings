  \ the FY 2023 President\u2019s\_Budget"
---
 
The United States Government is proud to be the largest donor for global
health and supporter of research and cooperation worldwide. As we work
to end the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to investing in global
public health, science partnerships and collaboration, strengthening
health systems and institutions, advancing global health security, and
accelerating efforts towards achieving universal health coverage and the
objectives of the Sustainable Development Agenda. The President’s Budget
for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 requests mandatory and discretionary funding
totaling over $17 billion for the Department of State (State) and the
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and over $11 billion
for the Department of Health and Human Services to advance U.S.
leadership in global health, including health system strengthening;
HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; maternal and child health; family
planning and reproductive health; nutrition; global health security, and
pandemic and other biological threat preparedness, and neglected
tropical diseases.

We continue to lead the global community toward a safer, more equitable
future.  Investments in global health advance U.S. foreign policy
interests by protecting Americans at home and abroad, promoting economic
progress and recovery, and supporting the rise of capable partners to
better solve regional and global problems.  
Over the last year, the Biden-Harris Administration has renewed U.S.
leadership in global health, and the FY 2023 Budget will continue to
advance global health priorities on the following:

-   **Strengthening health systems, including the global health
    workforce. **The FY 2023 Budget prioritizes sustained investment
    across health programs to support health system resilience and
    strengthening. The Budget provides $1 billion in mandatory funding
    for State and USAID to support and protect the global health
    workforce as part of the Administration’s increased prioritization
    and investments in human resources for health.  These resources are
    intended to support the Administration’s launch of a new Global
    Health Worker Initiative, which complements the Domestic Health
    Worker Initiative launched by the Administration last year.  In
    addition, the FY 2023 Request includes $10 million for USAID to
    establish a Health Resilience Fund (HRF) to support cross-cutting
    health systems strengthening in countries emerging from crisis. The
    HRF will provide flexible, no-year funding to ensure basic health
    services are accessible to those most in need and to build more
    resilient health services and systems in order to prevent worse
    outcomes from ongoing health crises. The FY 2023 Request also
    includes over $265 million in discretionary funding for the Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for partnerships that build
    critical health system capacity for global immunizations and the
    fight against parasitic diseases and malaria.  
-   **Supporting enhanced global leadership on addressing HIV/AIDS,
    malaria, and tuberculosis.** The Budget includes $4.37 billion for
    State to support U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
    (PEPFAR) bilateral programs and the global AIDS response. Funds will
    continue to save lives, prevent millions of HIV infections, and help
    countries build a strong foundation to prevent, detect, and respond
    to other health threats, including COVID-19. Across 55 countries,
    PEPFAR invests in strengthening local health systems’ ability to
    respond to HIV. The FY 2023 Budget also includes $2 billion to
    support the Global Fund’s seventh replenishment for an intended
    pledge of $6 billion over three years, to save lives and continue
    the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, as well as
    $780 million for the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative to continue
    the fight against malaria. Finally, the FY 2023 Budget requests $350
    million for USAID to support programs combatting tuberculosis around
    the world.  
-   **Strengthening multilateral global health institutions:** Funding
    requested in FY 2023 will support efforts to strengthen our
    partnerships with multilateral global health institutions, including
    the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s
    Fund.   
-   **Building global health security and pandemic preparedness
    capacities.** The FY 2023 President’s Budget includes nearly $750
    million for USAID, and over $1.5 billion in mandatory and
    discretionary funding for CDC, to expand global health security
    capacity building to additional partner countries, strengthen global
    disease detection, bolster our commitment to the multilateral Global
    Health Security Agenda, and accelerate progress toward improved
    prevention, detection, and response to infectious disease threats.
    Funding through USAID would support $250 million for Access to
    COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator multilateral organizations, and
    $590 million in discretionary and mandatory funding to replenish
    USAID’s Emergency Reserve Fund for Contagious Infectious Diseases
    (ERF).    
-   **Financing for global health security and pandemic
    preparedness. **The Budget includes $4.75 billion in mandatory and
    discretionary funding for State to establish a new financial
    intermediary fund (FIF) at the World Bank focused on global health
    security and pandemic preparedness. This catalytic, fit-for-purpose
    financing mechanism is critical to filling major gaps in the world’s
    ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease
    threats and future pandemics at the national, regional and global
    levels.  The Budget also provides $500 million over five years for
    the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to
    support innovations in science and technological capabilities to
    shorten the cycle for development of safe, effective, and globally
    accessible vaccines for pathogens with pandemic potential.  
-   **Building global medical countermeasure readiness, research and
    development,** and **advancing capacity to conduct variant and
    strain surveillance** through support for global innovations in
    vaccine and therapeutics policy development, program design, and
    effective monitoring of the viral strains that are circulating
    globally to detect the emergence of significant variants. The Budget
    includes $5.9 billion in mandatory funding for CDC for this effort
    which would expand and strengthen multi-pathogen and molecular
    laboratory capabilities, bioinformatics systems, and data
    modernization to detect and monitor respiratory and other
    high-consequence pathogens.   
-   **Advancing biosafety and biosecurity in the United States and
    globally to prevent biological incidents. **The Budget supports
    applied research and innovation in biosafety and biosecurity, which
    will expand capabilities to identify and minimize safety and
    security risks in the design and development of biotechnology. It
    also enables CDC and USAID to expand efforts to strengthen biosafety
    and biosecurity practices and globally.  
-   **Leading global threat detection innovations** through a globally
    connected network of public health surveillance systems that
    optimizes disease prevention and health promotion as we strengthen
    surveillance initiatives to provide necessary actionable data
    before, during, and after a pandemic. The Budget includes $2.47
    billion in mandatory funding for CDC to will include enhancements to
    domestic sentinel surveillance programs, expansion of domestic and
    global wastewater surveillance, and investments in global genomic
    surveillance approaches as well as global respiratory disease
    surveillance platforms. CDC will transition and sustain genomic
    surveillance capacities initially developed for COVID-19 to support
    additional priority pathogens.  
-   **Sustaining commitments in global maternal and child health.** As
    the largest donor to both maternal health and voluntary family
    planning programs, including the provision of life-saving health
    care services in crisis settings, the United States will continue
    its efforts to make pregnancy and childbirth safer by strengthening
    health systems to provide women with integral health services,
    including increased access to maternal health care and voluntary
    family planning. The FY 2023 Budget includes $879.5 million for
    USAID to continue the United States’ sustained commitment to ensure
    that critical health services continue to prevent child and maternal
    deaths globally. This includes $290 million for a contribution to
    Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to reach children with cost-effective
    vaccines to accelerate progress towards preventing child deaths. In
    addition, $25 million is requested for USAID to support the
    implementation of the U.S. Government’s Strategy Advancing
    Protection and Care for Children in Adversity and USAID’s Child
    Blindness Program to reduce childhood blindness and improve eye
    health.  
-   **Advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights.**  In the
    last year, the Administration has taken several legislative and
    policy steps to advance sexual and reproductive rights around the
    world, starting with President Biden’s issuance of a Presidential
    Memorandum on Protecting Women’s Health at Home and Abroad in his
    first days in office, which revoked the expanded Mexico City Policy
    and directed agencies to resume funding to the United Nations
    Population Fund (UNFPA) in support of its essential work to prevent
    maternal deaths, expand access to voluntary family planning, and
    prevent and respond to gender-based violence around the world. 
    Under the leadership of Secretary Blinken, the Department of State
    has returned to reporting on sexual and reproductive health issues
    in its Annual Country Reports on Human Rights. The Administration
    continues to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights
    (SRHR) for all, in support of accelerating progress toward universal
    health coverage and gender equality. The FY 2023 Budget provides
    $597 million to continue support for critical SRHR programs
    globally, as well as a $56 million contribution to the United
    Nations Population Fund. As the largest bilateral donor to family
    planning, the United States will continue to lead globally by
    advancing SRHR in multilateral fora and with bilateral partners.
    Funds will support increased access to SRHR services.  
-   **Continuing to demonstrate strong global leadership on
    nutrition.** Given increased rates of global malnutrition, and
    expected further impacts on global food security from Russia’s
    unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine, the United States will
    accelerate efforts to support global nutrition, particularly for
    vulnerable populations. The FY 2023 Budget includes $150 million for
    USAID for global health nutrition programs, in addition to over $1
    billion in State and USAID economic and development assistance, $1.7
    billion in emergency food aid via Food for Peace Title II, and
    humanitarian assistance to support food security and nutrition
    globally.  
-   **Supporting efforts to address neglected tropical diseases.** The
    FY 2023 Budget includes $114.5 million to continue USAID’s
    long-standing and effective public-private partnerships with
    pharmaceutical companies to focus on ending the most prevalent
    neglected tropical diseases (NTD). Over the past 15 years, USAID has
    leveraged $27.6 billion in donated medicines, resulting in the
    delivery of more than 2.8 billion treatments to approximately 1.4
    billion people. This funding will also support USAID in achieving
    its goal to eliminate at least one NTD as a public health problem
    within 5 years in 15 countries, and to expand private sector
    partnerships.  
-   **Leading the global COVID-19 response.** The Biden Administration
    has submitted an urgent request to Congress for $5 billion to
    accelerate near-term COVID-19 global response.  Without additional
    funding to support getting shots into arms, U.S. agencies will have
    to cut short efforts to turn vaccines into vaccinations across the
    globe.  Leaving large unvaccinated populations worldwide will
    increase the risk of new, emerging deadly variants that could evade
    our current vaccines and treatments.  Without additional funds, the
    Administration would be unable to extend Global VAX surge support to
    20+ additional under-vaccinated countries that will need intensive
    support this year to get shots in arms. This will devastate our
    ability to ensure those countries can effectively deploy safe and
    effective vaccines. U.S. agencies will also be unable to provide
    life-saving supplies, tests, therapeutics, oxygen, and humanitarian
    aid to countries still struggling to manage a continuing COVID-19
    disease burden.
