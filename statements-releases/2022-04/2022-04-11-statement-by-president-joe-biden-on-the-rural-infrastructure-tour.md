title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Rural Infrastructure\_Tour"
---
 
I have always believed that for America to succeed, rural America must
succeed. Since taking office, my Administration has focused on building
pathways to the middle class for rural Americans in rural America –
including investing in rural infrastructure and rebuilding the
communities that feed and fuel our country.

For far too long, opportunity has been out of reach for rural
communities. My Administration is changing that. Through the American
Rescue Plan, we supported rural families and provided rural communities
with the tools and resources that made them central to America’s strong
economic recovery. I also secured historic investments for rural America
through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make sure we revitalize and
rebuild rural communities for years to come. These generational
infrastructure investments will provide rural communities across America
affordable high-speed internet, clean drinking water, reliable
electricity, better roads and bridges, and good-paying jobs. Strong
infrastructure in rural communities is good for jobs, good for keeping
the economy moving, good for lowering prices, and good for America.

I am proud today that my Administration is launching a rural
infrastructure tour to double down on our unwavering commitment to
building a better America where rural communities thrive. In the coming
weeks and beyond, Cabinet members and senior administration officials
will crisscross the country to meet with, listen to, and deliver
infrastructure investments to rural communities. As we unlock federal
resources and generate results for these communities, we are unlocking
opportunity – job opportunities, educational opportunities, and the
opportunity for a better future.
