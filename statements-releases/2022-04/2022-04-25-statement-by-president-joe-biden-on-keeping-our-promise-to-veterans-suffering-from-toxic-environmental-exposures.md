title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Keeping our Promise to Veterans Suffering\
  \ from Toxic Environmental\_Exposures"
---
 
America’s veterans are the best of us. I’ve always believed that we have
a sacred obligation to equip all those we send into harm’s way and to
care for them and their families when they come home. That’s especially
true for veterans suffering the visible and invisible wounds of war,
whether they were injured in combat or breathed in toxic smoke from burn
pits on base. We can and must do more to address the harms that come
from hazardous exposures, which have gone unaddressed for far too long.

We learned a horrible lesson after Vietnam, when the harmful effects of
exposure to Agent Orange sometimes took years to manifest, and too many
veterans were left unable to access the care they needed. I refuse to
repeat that mistake when it comes to the veterans of our wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

In my State of the Union address, I announced that we would propose
expanding disability and health benefits to veterans suffering from nine
rare respiratory cancers. Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs is
delivering on that promise and upholding that sacred obligation to the
women and men who have worn the uniform of our country. This new action
is guided by science and driven by a desire to ensure that our nation’s
veterans receive timely access to the benefits and services they
deserve.

Supporting our veterans is a critical part of the Unity Agenda I
proposed for our nation. No matter where we live or who we voted for in
the last election, we all agree that we should serve our veterans as
well as they have served us. My Administration will continue to do
everything in its power to support our nation’s veterans, and I urge
Congress to pass bipartisan legislation to comprehensively address toxic
exposures and further deliver the vital benefits our veterans have
earned. I will sign it immediately.
