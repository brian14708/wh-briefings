President Joseph R. Biden spoke today with His Majesty King Abdullah II
of Jordan to consult on a range of regional and global issues.  The two
leaders discussed in detail recent efforts to stem violence in Israel
and the West Bank, including at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount complex
in Jerusalem.  The President welcomed recent steps to reduce tensions
and expressed his hope that the final week of Ramadan will pass
peacefully.  He underscored the need to preserve the historic status quo
at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, and recognized the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan’s role as the custodian of Muslim holy places in
Jerusalem.  The King briefed the President on his recent engagements in
the region and the President emphasized the U.S. commitment to the
Middle East and regional stability.
