No one should die from a mosquito bite. Seventy years ago, the United
States eliminated malaria in our country. And, thanks to strong
bipartisan leadership in Congress, and the enormous generosity of the
American people, we lead the fight to end malaria worldwide.

As the largest donor in the battle to end malaria, the United States has
helped save more than 10.6 million lives and prevent 1.7 billion malaria
infections in partner countries around the world. Together with our
partners, we have developed the knowledge and toolset – including the
promising new malaria vaccine – to end malaria illness and death in our
lifetime. We have worked together to bolster health systems and invest
in health workers. We will continue to invest in research and expand our
partnerships with regional and multilateral institutions to ensure
science is driving our response.

Tragically, a child still dies every two minutes from malaria. We must
step up and do more to finish this fight. We risk losing valuable
progress as the disease develops resistance to drugs and mosquitoes
develop resistance to insecticides. And, as climate change causes
warmer, wetter, and more extreme weather, malaria-carrying mosquitoes
will be able to breed and spread their disease more easily. That’s why I
am proud to host the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and
Malaria’s Replenishment Conference later this year. Working with allies
and partners around the world, we can accelerate the fight against
malaria and advance progress towards the Sustainable Development Agenda.

My Administration is committed to making the vision of a malaria-free
future a reality. Together, we can build a safer, more prosperous, and
more equitable world for everyone.
