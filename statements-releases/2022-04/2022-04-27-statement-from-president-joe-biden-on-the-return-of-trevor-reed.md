title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Return of Trevor\_Reed"
---
 
Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the
family that missed him dearly. Trevor, a former U.S. Marine, is free
from Russian detention. I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how
much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence. And I was
delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s
freedom.

I’m grateful for the tireless and dedicated work of Special Presidential
Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, U.S. Ambassador to the Russian
Federation John Sullivan, and many others across our government to
ensure that Trevor came home safely. The negotiations that allowed us to
bring Trevor home required difficult decisions that I do not take
lightly. His safe return is a testament to the priority my
Administration places on bringing home Americans held hostage and
wrongfully detained abroad. We won’t stop until Paul Whelan and others
join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends.
