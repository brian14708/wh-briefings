The Vice President underscored the importance of our economic and
commercial partnership, and discussed recent reforms and others needed
to further strengthen our investment relationship. The two leaders noted
they are looking forward to the entry into force of an Open Skies Air
Transport Agreement, which establishes a modern civil aviation
relationship between the United States and Tanzania and agreed it will
promote increased travel and trade and help spur economic growth. They
also welcomed nearly $1 billion of new investments by U.S. companies in
Tanzania in tourism, conservation, and clean energy sectors.  
   
The Vice President discussed our efforts to address the COVID-19
pandemic, including through Tanzania’s participation in the U.S.-led

doses provided to Tanzania since the beginning of the pandemic. They

including supporting women and children’s health.  
   
Lastly, they discussed several regional and global issues of concern.
The Vice President emphasized the importance of the world standing
together in support of international rules and norms, including the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations. The Vice President

against the people of Ukraine and noted there must be severe costs for
Russia’s actions.
