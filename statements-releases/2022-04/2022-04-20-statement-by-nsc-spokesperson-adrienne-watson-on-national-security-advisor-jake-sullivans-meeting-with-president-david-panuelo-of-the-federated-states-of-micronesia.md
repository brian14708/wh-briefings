National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with President David
Panuelo of the Federated States of Micronesia to affirm the abiding U.S.
commitment to the security and prosperity of the Freely Associated
States, as well as to discuss issues of common concern in the Pacific
Islands region. Noting the appointment of Special Presidential Envoy
Ambassador Joseph Yun to lead negotiations for the United States on
renewing the Compact of Free Association, Sullivan affirmed the U.S.
goal of concluding the process by the end of the year. The two discussed
the existential threat posed by climate change to Pacific Island
nations, and voiced common concern about the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China
and the Solomon Islands signing a bilateral security agreement.
President Panuelo and Mr. Sullivan agreed to identify additional
opportunities to continue deepening U.S. engagement in this vital
region.
