President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Prime Minister Narendra
Modi of India to inaugurate the fourth U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial
Dialogue. Together, they committed to strengthening the U.S.-India
relationship through cooperation on clean energy, technology and
military cooperation, and expanded economic and people-to-people ties.
They also committed to continue cooperation – bilaterally and
multilaterally – on ending the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening global
health security, advancing global food security, and ensuring a free and
open Indo-Pacific. They emphasized their shared commitment, as leaders
of the world’s largest democracies, to respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of all nations in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. The
two Leaders also discussed the destabilizing impacts of Russia’s war
against Ukraine, with a particular focus on global food supply.
President Biden and Prime Minister Modi looked forward to meeting in
person later this spring, in Tokyo, for the Quad summit.
