title: "President\_Biden Statement on UN-Mediated Truce in\_Yemen"
---
 
I welcome the announcement today of a two-month truce in the Yemen
conflict. This initiative is a long-awaited reprieve for the Yemeni
people. It entails a halt to all military activities by any party inside
Yemen and across its borders, the entry of fuel ships into Hudaydah
port, and the renewal of commercial flights to and from Saan’a to agreed
destinations. These are important steps, but they are not enough. The
ceasefire must be adhered to, and as I have said before, it is
imperative that we end this war. After seven years of conflict,
negotiators must undertake the hard and necessary work to reach
political compromises that can bring about an enduring future of peace
for all the people of Yemen. I am grateful for the leadership role of
Saudi Arabia and Oman in bringing this initiative to fruition before the
Holy Month of Ramadan. I am also grateful for the hard work of the
Yemeni Government and the confidence they have placed in UN-led
mediation. The United States of America will work to deter threats to
our friends and partners as we continue to strive for de-escalation and
peace throughout the region. I wish the people of Yemen a peaceful
Ramadan, and assure them of our ongoing commitment to help end this
terrible war.
