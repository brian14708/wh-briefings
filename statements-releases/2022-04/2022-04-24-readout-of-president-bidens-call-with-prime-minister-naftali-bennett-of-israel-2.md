President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Prime Minister Naftali
Bennett of Israel to discuss shared regional and global security
challenges, including the threat posed by Iran and its proxies. The two
leaders emphasized the strong personal bond they have developed since
the Prime Minister’s visit to Washington last summer. This personal
relationship has animated the work of our diplomatic and national
security teams, enabling both countries to arrive at common positions on
difficult matters. The President welcomed the visit to Washington this
week by the Prime Minister’s National Security Advisor. The President
also accepted an invitation to visit Israel in the coming months. The
President took note of ongoing efforts between Israeli and Palestinian
officials to lower tensions and ensure a peaceful conclusion to the holy
season of Ramadan. He affirmed his unwavering support for Israel and its
defense needs, and welcomed the historic $1 billion allocation to
replenish Israel’s Iron Dome system. The two leaders committed to stay
in regular contact to follow up on the important work of the U.S-Israel
Strategic Consultative Group, chaired by their respective National
Security Advisors.
