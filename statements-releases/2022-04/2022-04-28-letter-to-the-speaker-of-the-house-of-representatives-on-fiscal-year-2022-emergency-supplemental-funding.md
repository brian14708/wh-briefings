  \ Emergency Supplemental\_Funding"

Dear Madam Speaker:  
   
I am writing to provide you with my request for fiscal year (FY) 2022
emergency supplemental funding for critical security and economic
assistance to Ukraine.  
   
I appreciate the Congress’ continued bipartisan support for Ukraine,
NATO, and other partner countries affected by Russia’s War in Ukraine. 
My Administration is committed to providing the Ukrainian people the
assistance they need.  Our assistance to date has made a difference on
the battlefield, helping Ukraine win the battle for Kyiv.  This $33.0
billion request for additional funding and authority builds on the
Congress’ supplemental appropriation of $13.6 billion on March 15, 2022,
and seeks to address immediate and near-term security and economic
needs.  Additional security assistance will put urgently needed
equipment into the hands of Ukraine’s military and police, including
ammunition, armored vehicles, small arms, demining assistance, and
unmanned aircraft systems.  Economic assistance will provide Direct
Budget Support to provide rapid, flexible funds to assist the Government
of Ukraine in responding to the immediate crisis and continue to provide
basic citizen services.  Additional food security and humanitarian
assistance will provide wheat and other commodities to people in need,
build countries’ resilience to global food supply and price shocks, and
provide lifesaving aid to people displaced by or otherwise impacted by
Russia’s War in Ukraine.  Additionally, the request includes funding to
support the production of United States food crops that are experiencing
a global shortage due to the war in Ukraine, for example, wheat and
soybeans helping to address rising food prices here at home and around
the world.  The request also would help increase domestic production for
strategic minerals and materials produced in Russia or Ukraine and
respond to global shortfalls and reduce price pressures.  The request
also outlines a number of authorities needed to support Ukraine, our
European allies and partners, and address other emergent global needs. 
The details of this request are set forth in an enclosed addendum.  
   
Though we expect our NATO allies and EU partners will be making even
larger collective contributions than the United States, there is no
doubt that continuing to support Ukraine in this war against Russian
aggression will require a substantial additional investment on our
part.  What I want to make clear to the Congress and the American people
is this:  the cost of failing to stand up to violent aggression in
Europe has always been higher than the cost of standing firm against
such attacks.  That is as it always has been, and as it always will be. 
America must meet this moment, and do its part.   
   
In addition to the legislative proposals in this package, my
Administration is also sending a proposal to the Congress to enhance the
United States’ ability to hold Russia accountable financially for its
ongoing invasion of Ukraine.  These proposals would strengthen our
whole-of-government approach — along with those of our international
partners — by providing for expanded and expedited measures for
investigating, prosecuting, and forfeiting assets of Russian oligarchs
to be used for the benefit of Ukraine.  
   
Finally, I also appreciate the Congress’ bipartisan support for ensuring
we can continue to provide the American people with the tools they need
to protect themselves from COVID-19, and again urge the Congress to act
promptly to provide the $22.5 billion I requested on March 2, 2022. 
Without additional funding, we are unable to purchase additional
life-saving treatments for the American people, and we are losing our
spot in line to other countries for vaccines that may provide better and
more durable protection against multiple variants.  We also must stop
the spread of possible new variants from around the world as every COVID
variant has emerged from overseas.  We have to keep vaccinating the
world to save lives here at home and protect our economy from further
supply chain disruptions, but we need funding to help get shots into
arms.  To avoid needless deaths in the United States and around the
world, I urge the Congress to include this much needed, life-saving
COVID funding as part of this supplemental funding request.     
   
I urge the Congress to address these critical and urgent needs
promptly.  The amounts included in this request are requested to be
designated by the Congress as being for an emergency requirement
pursuant to section 4001(a)(1) and section 4001(b) of S. Con. Res. 14
(117th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for FY 2022.

   Sincerely,  
   
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
