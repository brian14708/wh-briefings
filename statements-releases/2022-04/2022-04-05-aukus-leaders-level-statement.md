Today, the leaders of the Australia-UK-US (AUKUS) partnership – Prime
Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of
the United Kingdom, and President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United
States – assessed progress under AUKUS.

We reaffirmed our commitment to AUKUS and to a free and open
Indo-Pacific. In light of Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified, and unlawful
invasion of Ukraine, we reiterated our unwavering commitment to an
international system that respects human rights, the rule of
law, and the peaceful resolution of disputes free from coercion.

We are pleased with the progress in our trilateral program for Australia
to establish a conventionally armed,
nuclear‑powered submarine capability. We are fully committed to
establishing a robust approach to sharing naval propulsion technology
with Australia that strengthens the global non-proliferation regime. 

We also committed today to commence new trilateral cooperation
on hypersonics and counter-hypersonics, and electronic warfare
capabilities, as well as to expand information sharing and to deepen
cooperation on defense innovation. These initiatives will add to our
existing efforts to deepen cooperation on cyber capabilities, artificial
intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea
capabilities. As our work progresses on these and other critical defense
and security capabilities, we will seek opportunities to engage allies
and close partners.
