President Biden looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Mario Draghi
of Italy to the White House on May 10, 2022.  The visit will reaffirm
the deep bonds of friendship and strong partnership between the United
States and Italy.  The leaders will discuss their ongoing coordination
with Allies and partners on measures to support of the people of Ukraine
and to impose economic costs on Russia for its unprovoked aggression.
 They will discuss our close cooperation on promoting global economic
prosperity, increasing Europe’s energy security, and combatting climate
change.  They will also exchange views on regional and global security
issues, as well as preparations for the G7 and NATO summits in June.
