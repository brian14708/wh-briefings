title: "Statement from President\_Biden on State Unemployment\_Rates"
---
 
Americans are getting back to work in every corner of the country in
record numbers. Right now, 17 states are at or tied with the lowest
unemployment rate they’ve ever had – and 20 states have jobless rates
below 3%. Over the last year, the unemployment rate dropped in every
state and many states have reached historic lows. These aren’t just
numbers on a page: these are millions of Americans back at work and able
to support themselves and their families with good-paying jobs and enjoy
the dignity a job provides.  

This wasn’t an accident: this was the direct result of my economic plan
to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. There’s still
more work to do to build on this recovery and bring down costs for
working families – and my Administration is working on that every day –
but we can’t lose sight of how far, and how quickly, we’ve come.
