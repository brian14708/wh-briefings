title: "Statement from Jen\_Psaki on Awarding First Barrels from Historic Strategic\
  \ Petroleum Reserve\_Release"

President Biden is using all the tools at his disposal to address
Putin’s Price Hike at the pump. Today, the Department of Energy
announced that it has awarded contracts for *all* of the initial thirty
million barrels it put up for sale as part of the emergency release of 1
million barrels per day in oil for the next 6 months. This is an
important step to addressing the supply shortage and the Putin Price
Hike Americans are facing. These sales will continue. And because of
round-the-clock diplomatic efforts, our partners and Allies have
committed to releasing an additional 60 million barrels. 

This is just the latest result of the Biden Administration’s efforts to
do everything in our power to lower energy costs for American families,
including accelerating the deployment of cost-saving clean energy with
the urgency this moment requires. Last week, the President announced
that his Administration is planning to allow the sale of E15 gasoline in
all parts of the country this summer, so that Americans have access to
more choices and lower prices. And the Administration continues to work
toward *real* energy independence by rapidly reducing our dependence on
oil—including this week’s announcement of critical investments to deploy
clean energy.
