title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration Accelerates Whole-of-Government Effort\
  \ to Prevent, Detect, and Treat Long\_COVID"
---
 
The U.S. has made tremendous progress in our fight against COVID-19.
Today, Americans have the tools they need to protect against and treat
the virus. At the same time, millions of individuals continue to
experience prolonged illness from COVID-19, known as “Long COVID.” Many
report debilitating, lasting symptoms that can persist long after the
acute COVID-19 infection has resolved, and can manifest in anyone who
has had COVID-19. These symptoms often look like those associated with
other chronic medical conditions.

The Administration has mobilized to advance our nation’s understanding
of Long COVID and its associated conditions, promote high-quality care
for patients, and help individuals access supportive services—especially
for those from communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic.
The President’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan makes clear that we
are committed to accelerating these efforts, with additional support and
resources from Congress.

Today, President Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the
Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to coordinate a new effort
across the federal government to develop and issue the first-ever
interagency national research action plan on Long COVID. The effort will
advance progress in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and provision of
services, supports, and interventions for individuals experiencing Long
COVID and associated conditions. The Presidential Memorandum also
directs HHS to issue a report outlining services and supports across
federal agencies to assist people experiencing Long COVID, individuals
who are dealing with a COVID-related loss, and people who are
experiencing mental health and substance use issues related to the
pandemic. This report will specifically address the long-term effects of
COVID-19 on high-risk communities and efforts to address disparities in
access to services and supports.

Today’s announcement builds on the Administration’s ongoing work to
implement the recommendations of the [Presidential COVID-19 Health
Equity Task
Force](https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/healthequitytaskforce/). It
also builds on a number of additional actions the Administration is
taking to support the millions of Americans experiencing Long COVID and
their families by delivering high-quality care and expanding access to
services and supports, as well as actions to advance efforts to detect,
prevent, and treat Long COVID.

These actions include:

**Delivering high-quality care for individuals experiencing Long
COVID:** As a complex condition that can affect multiple organ systems,
Long COVID may require care and coordination across multiple medical
specialties. The Administration recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic
has resulted in new members of the disability community and has had a
tremendous impact on people with disabilities. The Administration will
continue to center the voices of patients in this work and is advancing
efforts to deliver high-quality, high-value care to people experiencing
Long COVID—especially communities hardest-hit by COVID-19. In
collaboration with patients, payers, and providers across the care
continuum, the Administration will accelerate and disseminate clinical
support and best practices to promote coordinated, integrated care
models and expand access to high-quality care in communities across the
country.

-   Launching Centers of Excellence and promoting evidence-based care
    models: Through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
    (AHRQ), the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) budget will invest
    in a multi-year initiative, beginning with $20 million in FY23, to
    investigate how health care systems can best organize and deliver
    care for people with Long COVID, provide telementoring and expert
    consultation for primary care practices, and advance the development
    of multispecialty clinics to provide complex care. This work would
    fund institutions across the country that bring together leading
    researchers and care providers across the full care continuum –
    including hospitals, health centers, long-term care services and
    supports, and other providers – and promote the implementation of
    new evidence into care, especially for disproportionately affected
    populations. As information emerges on effective Long COVID
    treatments and care, AHRQ in partnership with the Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
    (SAMHSA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH)—in collaboration
    with clinical leaders, professional societies, and the national
    academies—will build on existing [interim clinical
    guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/post-covid-index.html)
    to get providers and patients the care information they need.
-   Expanding and strengthening Long COVID clinics: Across the country,
    18 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities have already
    established Long COVID care programs, consolidating
    multidisciplinary clinical expertise in locations veterans know and
    trust. The VA will expand on the success of these programs by
    establishing additional Long COVID programs and robust referral and
    follow-up systems across its facilities. These programs, and others
    established by hospitals and health systems across the country, are
    serving as a source of rapid learning and long-term research on best
    practices and new therapies, along with the broader provider,
    patient, and scientific community. The Office of the Assistant
    Secretary for Health (OASH) will launch the Health+ project to gain
    insights into the experiences and patient journeys of people living
    with Long COVID and associated conditions, to help inform
    high-quality care and contribute to standardized best practices at
    Long COVID clinics.
-   Promoting provider education and clinical support: The
    Administration will continue to work with providers to advance our
    recognition and understanding of Long COVID and associated
    conditions, including by sharing culturally competent information
    and resources through platforms like the Centers for Medicare &
    Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Learning Network and Indian Health
    Service (IHS) provider education and partnerships with academic
    institutions. The Administration will also launch targeted clinician
    and medical coder education on the
    [ICD-10-CM](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm) code (U09.9)
    effective last year to support diagnosis, billing, and tracking of
    Long COVID. To further support equitable access to high-quality care
    in communities hard-hit by the pandemic, the Administration, through
    the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), will
    continue to build sustainable telementoring programs and networks in
    rural and medically underserved communities. HHS will additionally
    convene experts across the country to provide recommendations to our
    nation’s providers on best practices in the identification and
    management of the mental and behavioral health disorders associated
    with Long COVID.  
-   Bolstering health insurance coverage for Long COVID care: The
    Administration is working to make Long COVID care as accessible as
    possible. CMS has clarified that, under the American Rescue Plan
    (ARP) requirement that state Medicaid and Children’s Health
    Insurance Program (CHIP) programs cover treatments for COVID-19,
    states must also cover treatments and therapies for Long COVID.
    Additionally, the essential health benefits (EHB) provided by the
    Affordable Care Act (ACA) generally provide coverage for the
    diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, including Long COVID, though
    coverage and cost-sharing details vary by plan. CMS has also
    expanded Medicare coverage for pulmonary rehabilitation services for
    Long COVID care beginning in the [2022 Physician Fee
    Schedule](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/calendar-year-cy-2022-medicare-physician-fee-schedule-final-rule).
    Moving forward, the Administration will continue to assess
    opportunities to enhance access to care for Long COVID and its
    associated symptoms through Medicare, Medicaid, insurance
    marketplace coverage, and other options. The Office of Personnel
    Management (OPM) will also increase awareness of Long COVID among
    Federal Employee Health Benefit (FEHB) Program carriers—serving over
    8.2 million federal employees, retirees, and their families—and call
    on them to closely monitor care for individuals with Long COVID. OPM
    will additionally enhance enrollee education on plans’ coverage of
    the assessment and treatment of Long COVID and associated symptoms
    such as respiratory illness and chronic fatigue.

**Making services and supports available for individuals experiencing
Long COVID:** The Administration continues to work to understand Long
COVID and its impact across populations, including how it interacts with
other medical and physical conditions. Individuals with Long COVID may
need help doing things they did by themselves in the past, or may need
accommodations in their daily activities based on changes in their
abilities. In addition to the Long COVID guidance
[package](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-marks-anniversary-of-americans-with-disabilities-act-and-announces-resources-to-support-individuals-with-long-covid/)
released during the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA), the Administration is raising awareness of Long COVID as a
potential cause of disability, and strengthening services and supports
available for individuals experiencing Long COVID.

-   Raising awareness of Long COVID as a potential cause of disability:
    To protect individuals with Long COVID from discrimination, HHS and
    the Department of Justice (DOJ) have released
    [guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/civil-rights-covid19/guidance-long-covid-disability/index.html)
    explaining that some individuals with Long COVID may have a
    disability under civil rights laws, including the ADA, Section 504
    of the Rehabilitation Act, and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care
    Act. The Department of Education (ED) also released a
    [resource](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-factsheet-504-20210726.pdf)
    to support children, students, educators, schools, service
    providers, and families—providing information about Long COVID as a
    disability and about schools’ and public agencies’ responsibilities
    for the provision of services and reasonable modifications to
    children and students for whom Long COVID is a cause of a
    disability. The Administration for Community Living (ACL) and the
    HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) are continuing to disseminate
    resources to help people with Long COVID understand if they have a
    disability, educate people on their rights, and to inform
    organizations of their obligations.
-   Translating research into inclusive disability policy: Through the
    Social Security Administration’s close collaboration with research
    agencies and other entities, the Administration will continue to
    clarify and update policy guidance as the science develops to
    support inclusive disability policy and claims adjudication
    processes through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)
    and Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) programs for individuals
    experiencing Long COVID. This includes building on its [Emergency
    Message on Evaluating Cases with
    COVID-19](https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/04162021020344PM)
    and continuing to be responsive to findings from the medical and
    scientific communities about the types of evidence that can help
    establish impairments and identify functional limitations linked to
    Long COVID, when appropriate. Additionally, ACL and the Department
    of Labor (DOL) continue to elevate experiences of individuals with
    disability due to Long COVID, including on return-to-work.
-   Connecting people with the resources they need: The Administration
    will help connect people with Long COVID to information, resources,
    and service and support options. This includes incorporating
    multilingual information and support into the [CDC-INFO call
    center](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/dcs/ContactUs/Form), [Disability
    Information and Access Line (DIAL)](https://acl.gov/DIAL), and call
    centers run by CMS—which together receive over 3 million calls each
    month—and providing Long COVID-specific trainings for customer
    service representatives. Through ACL’s DIAL and [Eldercare
    Locator](https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/Index.aspx), the
    Administration will also continue to connect older adults and
    individuals with disabilities to critical local services, such as
    transportation to receive care. IHS will additionally train business
    office and benefit administrator staff to assist Tribal communities
    in navigating Long COVID. SAMHSA will additionally collaborate with
    stakeholders to advance our understanding of the mental health
    effects of COVID-19 and promote high-quality mental and behavioral
    health care services for those who need it.
-   Strengthening support for workers experiencing Long COVID: The
    [Equal Employment Opportunity
    Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws#N)
    (EEOC) and DOL recently released guidance on access to equitable
    employment opportunities for people experiencing the impact of
    COVID-19 and the symptoms of Long COVID. To protect workers
    experiencing Long COVID, DOL, in coordination with the EEOC, will
    continue supporting enforcement of the ADA, and other federal
    disability related nondiscrimination requirements for all workers.
    DOL’s [Job Accommodation Network](https://askjan.org) (JAN) also
    helps individuals with Long COVID remain in or return to their jobs.
    This includes both resources to empower workers to request and
    negotiate accommodations, as well as resources for employers on
    effective accommodation strategies. Additionally, through the legal
    networks funded by ACL, the Administration will continue to support
    legal assistance related to Long COVID to older adults and people
    with disabilities.

**Advancing the nation’s understanding of Long COVID:** Robust data and
information are essential to our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and
its long-term effects. The Administration will support and accelerate
research to understand, prevent, diagnose, treat, advance
non-discrimination for, and otherwise support individuals with Long
COVID. This includes efforts to better identify and characterize Long
COVID – including with respect to its frequency, severity, duration, and
risk factors; account for its impact on hard-hit and high-risk
populations; and better understand its symptoms—including anxiety and
depression, fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating,
heart palpitations, disordered sleep, chest and joint pain, and
headache. These symptoms may look like those associated with other
chronic medical conditions—including dysautonomia, myalgic
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and mast cell
activation syndrome (MCAS). In collaboration with patients, academia,
providers, and other stakeholders, the Administration will continue to
take critical steps to advance our scientific understanding in order to
prevent, detect, and treat Long COVID.

-   Launching the first-ever *National Research Action Plan on Long
    COVID*: Today, President Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum
    directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate a
    new effort across the federal government to develop and issue the
    first-ever interagency national research action plan on Long COVID.
    The effort will advance progress in prevention, diagnosis,
    treatment, and provision of services, supports, and interventions
    for individuals experiencing Long COVID. This effort, building on
    the landmark [Researching COVID to Enhance
    Recovery](https://recovercovid.org/) (RECOVER) Initiative and other
    initiatives across the federal government, will advance our
    understanding of Long COVID, foster the development of new
    treatments and care models, and inform services, support, and
    interventions for individuals experiencing Long COVID.
-   Accelerating enrollment into the RECOVER Initiative: Last year, the
    NIH launched its $1.15 billion RECOVER Initiative to advance our
    understanding of and ability to predict, treat, and prevent Long
    COVID. To help catalyze progress, the Administration will accelerate
    the enrollment of approximately 40,000 individuals with and without
    Long COVID into RECOVER’s longitudinal observational arm—in addition
    to advancing RECOVER’s pathobiology studies, EHR studies, and
    clinical trials. Equity remains at the center of the
    Administration’s COVID-19 response efforts, and RECOVER will focus
    on enrolling individuals across all ages, races, ethnicities, and
    socioeconomic statuses—including pregnant people, individuals with
    disabilities, and those from the communities hardest hit by the
    pandemic. RECOVER will also continue to bolster its patient-centered
    approach, leveraging its National Community Engagement
    Group—comprised of patient representatives across its pathobiology
    task forces and executive, steering, and oversight committees—to
    enable patients to shape research design and execution, listen for
    community feedback, and learn from patients’ first-hand experience.
-   Making further investments to advance Long COVID research and
    surveillance: Building on the $50 million CDC has already invested,
    the President’s FY23 budget has requested $25 million to answer key
    questions on the characteristics, risk factors, underlying
    mechanisms, and health impacts of Long COVID—through clinician
    engagement, electronic health data analyses, and grant funding. This
    includes through the [Innovative Support for Patients with
    SARS-CoV-2 Infections Registry (INSPIRE)
    study](https://www.covidinspire.org/) by CDC, which will follow
    nearly 6,000 individuals nationwide for up to 18 months, and other
    dedicated research in Tribal and other hard-hit, high-risk
    communities.
-   Leveraging the power of federal data: With its robust, national
    health care databases, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
    offers a wealth of information on the risks and burdens of COVID-19.
    Using data from over 600,000 individuals with COVID-19, the VA will
    continue advancing its work to assess the different health impacts
    of COVID-19 over time. This includes building on its already
    published analyses relying on EHR data on
    [kidney](https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2021060734),
    [cardiovascular](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01689-3), and
    [mental health](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2021-068993) outcomes in
    people who have gotten COVID-19, through a national study surveying
    infected Veterans and uninfected controls about persistent symptoms.
    Additionally, the Department of Defense (DOD) has launched the
    Epidemiology, Immunology, and Clinical Characteristics of Emerging
    Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential (EPICC) study of
    Military Health System beneficiaries to help determine effects of
    COVID-19 and define clinical strategies to address them. This
    foundational study will not only support our military medical
    readiness but also our broader understanding of the disease.
-   Identifying workplace interventions that help keep individuals
    connected: To inform the development of inclusive disability
    policies and benefits, the DOL is scaling its work to identify early
    intervention strategies for workers who experience injuries or
    illnesses, including Long COVID, when working. DOL is expanding
    beyond its initial pilot study—to Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio,
    and Vermont—to help workers find alternatives as they decide whether
    to stay at or return to work following an illness like Long COVID.
