Following President Biden’s fruitful conversation with Israeli Prime
Minister Bennett on April 24, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
met today with his Israeli counterpart, National Security Advisor Dr.
Eyal Hulata, to discuss a range of regional and global security issues. 
Mr. Sullivan emphasized that the United States is attuned to Israel’s
concerns about threats to its security, including first-and-foremost
from Iran and Iranian-backed proxies.  They agreed to further enhance
the ongoing coordination through the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative
Group and strengthen security and diplomatic cooperation wherever
possible with other regional partners.  They also discussed Israel’s
relationships with key Indo-Pacific countries.  Sullivan and Hulata
continued their discussions regarding Russia’s war on Ukraine and the
need to continue supporting our Ukrainian partners.  They committed to
continue their close coordination on the range of security issues of
importance to both the United States and Israel, and they look forward
to President Biden’s visit to Israel in the coming months.
