title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris On Extending the Pause on Student\
  \ Loan Repayment Through August 31st,\_2022"
---
 
Today, the President announced that our Administration is pausing
federal student loan repayments through August 31, 2022. This pause will
help 41 million people keep up with their monthly bills and meet their
basic needs. It will give borrowers some urgently needed time to prepare
for a return to repayment.    
  
This is personal for me. I had student loans. Each month, I would sit at
the kitchen table, fill out paperwork, and send a check to pay down my
balance. Later, as California Attorney General, I took on predatory
for-profit colleges and won $1 billion for defrauded veterans and
students. President Biden and I understand that student loan debt adds
stress for borrowers and their families.  
  
We have made strong progress as a country in the face of a global
pandemic and an economic downturn, but there is still work to do.
Today’s announcement will make a meaningful difference as we continue
moving forward.
