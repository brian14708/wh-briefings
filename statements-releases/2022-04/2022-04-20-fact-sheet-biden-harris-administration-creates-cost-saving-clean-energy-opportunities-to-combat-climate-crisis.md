  \ Opportunities to Combat Climate\_Crisis"

*New Initiatives Remove Barriers to Local Clean Energy, Reduce
Greenhouse Gas Emissions*

Since taking office, President Biden has prioritized expanding clean
energy technologies as part of his historic efforts to tackle the
climate crisis – all while helping American families lower their energy
costs and creating good-paying, union jobs. Distributed Energy Resources
(DERs) – like rooftop solar, battery storage, heat pumps, and electric
vehicles – will cut consumer costs, improve public health, strengthen
U.S. energy security, and help meet the President’s goal to reduce
emission 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030. Recent analysis shows that
the average American family can save an additional $500 a year from
using clean electricity like solar and heat pumps to power their homes.
The President’s National Climate Task Force formed a Distributed Energy
Resources Working Group to advance these clean energy technologies and
ensure these cost-saving opportunities are available to all Americans.  
  
Today, as part of the President’s commitment to tackling the climate
crisis, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new partnerships
and initiatives designed to increase access to these cost-saving local
clean energy resources. These announcements leverage existing programs,
funding, and guidance, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to
unlock resources and pave the way for good-paying jobs in the growing
clean energy economy in communities across the country. Additionally,
they build on those investments proposed in the [President’s FY 2023
Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/03/28/president-bidens-fy-2023-budget-reduces-energy-costs-combats-the-climate-crisis-and-advances-environmental-justice/?msclkid=fd01b572c0b411ec90840de7b0f43bef).
These announcements will also further the President’s Justice40
Initiative which commits to delivering at least 40 percent of the
benefits from federal climate and clean energy investments to
disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, or
overburdened by pollution.  
  
**STREAMLING CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES FOR AMERICANS**

-   **Leveraging Community Financial Institutions to Lower Costs and
    Expand Clean Energy:** Existing programs at the Department of Energy
    (DOE), Treasury and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are
    collectively poised to support the investment of billions of dollars
    in state and local DER projects. These investments can be leveraged
    by institutions like community development financial institutions,
    credit unions, green banks, regional and community banks and state
    revolving funds to drive climate resilience and clean energy
    projects in underserved communities across the country. To
    accelerate these cost saving projects DOE, Treasury, and USDA will
    convene a community of practice to help community financial
    institutions understand how existing federal funding and technical
    assistance for clean energy investments can be leveraged for DER
    projects. To complement the work of the community of practice, the
    Distributed Energy Resources Working Group formed under the
    President’s National Climate Taskforce will compile a toolkit of DER
    financing resources, convene a community financial institutions
    summit focused on leveraging private and philanthropic capital for
    DER projects, and expand the work of the National Community Solar
    Partnership’s [Credit Ready Solar
    initiative](https://www.energy.gov/communitysolar/credit-ready-solar-initiative)
    to include all DERs.  
-   **Charting Strategic Deployment of DERs:** DOE and [Lawrence
    Berkeley National Lab](https://appliedenergyscience.lbl.gov/)
    (LBNL), as part of the [National Community Solar
    Partnership](https://www.energy.gov/communitysolar) , are enhancing
    their REPAIR modeling tool to better understand how to maximize the
    benefits and cost savings of community solar and other DER projects
    to the local grid. DOE will use this tool and stakeholder engagement
    efforts to develop case studies and model technical, policy, and
    economic scenarios to inform stakeholders, like utilities, public
    service commissions, and DER developers on how to maximize the
    benefits of DER for communities.  
-   **Enabling More Efficient Systems and Grid Infrastructure:** DOE is
    announcing the establishment of new Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    funded programs that will provide rebates for replacing old
    transformers and electric motor systems with newer ones that will be
    resilient to the impacts of extreme weather and increase energy
    efficiency. Replacing aging electric motor systems helps companies
    make pumps, fans, and compressors more efficient, providing
    significant energy and cost savings opportunities. Likewise,
    switching-out distribution transformers, which are some of the most
    vulnerable parts of America’s power grid, increases resilience and
    energy efficiency.

**DELIVERING CLEAN ENERGY TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES**

-   **Developing a Community Solar Customer Platform: **The Department
    of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS) [will partner to develop and pilot a digital
    platform](https://energy.gov/communitysolar/liheap-community-solar-subscription-platform)
    that will manage the enrollment, use, and monitoring of community
    solar subscriptions for customers in the [Low-Income Home Energy
    Assistance
    Program](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/low-income-home-energy-assistance-program-liheap)
    (LIHEAP). The platform will connect customers who are
    LIHEAP-eligible with community solar subscriptions, to further
    reduce customer energy costs and remove barriers for application,
    while increasing the deployment of community solar projects and
    reducing the cost of customer acquisition. DOE’s [National Community
    Solar Partnership](https://www.energy.gov/communitysolar) will lead
    coordination with HHS, utilities, state and local governments, and
    industry to develop the platform, with the goal of piloting the
    subscription program in 3-5 states.  
-   **Ensuring Residents of HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing Benefit
    from Solar Energy:** Washington, D.C.’s “Solar for All” initiative
    aims to bring the benefits of solar energy to 100,000 families with
    low to moderate incomes in the District of Columbia. The U.S.
    Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has determined
    that D.C. Solar for All’s community-net-metering (CNM) credits will
    be excluded from household income and utility allowance calculations
    and therefore will not increase housing costs for residents in
    properties participating in HUD Multifamily rental assistance
    programs. HUD is also updating guidance to allow residents of
    affordable housing to better access cost-saving community solar
    subscriptions and reviewing guidance to allow Public Housing
    Authorities to more easily enter into power purchase agreements for
    low-cost clean energy.

**BUILDING THE CLEAN ENERGY WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE**

-   **Creating Youth Climate Jobs:** The Department of Labor’s (DOL)
    [Youthbuild](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/youth/youthbuild)
    program will award 68 organizations more than $90 million to support
    the development of Registered Apprenticeship and other career
    pathway models that prepare underserved young adults (16-24 years)
    who are not currently in school for jobs in construction and other
    in-demand industries, including green building. This model will
    provide valuable training enabling the acquisition of occupational
    skills while promoting educational opportunities with youth –
    splitting time between workplace training and the classroom to
    obtain their high school diploma or equivalency degree.
