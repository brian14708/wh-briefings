Today Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to Ray Chambers, Vice Chair of
the Partnership for Central America and World Health Organization Global
Ambassador, about the ongoing work to address the root causes of
migration from Central America. The Vice President provided an update on
progress in implementation of the Administration’s Root Causes Strategy,
including marshalling private sector investment in the region through
the Vice President’s “Call to Action,” which has generated more than
$1.2 billion in private sector commitments to create new jobs and
opportunities for people in the region. Mr. Chambers provided an update
on the Partnership’s progress in implementing economic development
programs with private sector partners, and he shared recommendations to
spur additional investment that benefits people in the U.S. and in
Central America. The Vice President thanked Mr. Chambers for his
leadership as Vice Chair of the Partnership. They discussed next steps
to build on the progress achieved since the Vice President launched the
“Call to Action” last year.
