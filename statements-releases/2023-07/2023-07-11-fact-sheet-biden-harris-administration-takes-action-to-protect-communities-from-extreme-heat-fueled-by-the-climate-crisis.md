title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Action to Protect Communities\
  \ from Extreme Heat Fueled by the Climate\_Crisis"
---
 
*New measures will protect communities from extreme heat*

Millions of Americans are being impacted by extreme heat waves, which
are growing in intensity, frequency, and duration due to climate change.
In June, heat waves broke records across the country. Puerto Rico
experienced its hottest month in more than 120 years, and Texas recorded
its top 19 hottest days ever. Parts of Michigan, New York and Vermont
also broke their daily temperature records. And in the first six months
of 2023, there were 12 individual billion-dollar weather and climate
events across the country. The situation is alarming, and it requires an
all-of-society response to ensure that communities have the support they
need to [plan, prepare, and
recover](https://www.heat.gov/pages/planning-and-preparing) from these
extreme weather events, which are costing the U.S. billions of dollars
every year.  
  
From day one, President Biden has taken action to address the climate
crisis, which includes securing more than $50 billion to help Americans
in every single state [become more
resilient](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-makes-historic-investments-to-build-community-climate-resilience/) to
climate impacts like heat waves. He has continued to deliver on the most
ambitious climate agenda in American history—an agenda that is lowering
energy costs for hardworking families, bolstering America’s energy
security, creating thousands of good-paying jobs, and strengthening
community-driven climate resilience across the country. Meanwhile, many
Republicans in Congress continue to deny the very existence of climate
change and remain committed to repealing the President’s Inflation
Reduction Act – the biggest climate protection bill ever – which would
undermine the health and safety of their own constituents.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing additional measures
to protect communities from extreme heat:

-   **The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will
    establish two virtual research centers to help communities manage
    and improve resilience to extreme heat.** Coordinated through the
    National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS) and
    supported by a $5 million investment from the Inflation Reduction
    Act, the centers will help provide technical assistance and
    actionable, locally-tailored information that historically
    marginalized and underserved communities can use to better prepare
    for extreme heat.
-   **The White House Interagency Working Group (IWG) on Extreme Heat,
    together with the NIHHIS, will develop a National Heat Strategy
    centered on equity and environmental justice.** This strategy will
    align with the forthcoming [National Climate Resilience
    Framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-makes-historic-investments-to-build-community-climate-resilience/) announced
    by President Biden last month.
-   **The White House will convene Mayors and other local and Tribal
    officials **from communities that are currently facing long duration
    extreme heat events to bolster preparedness. The meeting will
    include Federal emergency response agencies and voluntary
    organizations such as the American Red Cross to identify what can be
    done now to support vulnerable populations and discuss how the
    Federal government can provide support to State, local and Tribal
    partners to better equip communities in managing extreme heat that
    so many Americans are facing this summer.
-   **The White House today convened leaders from across the nation for
    a Summit on Climate Resilience and Sustainability in Affordable
    Housing.** The Summit will focus on how property owners, developers,
    and asset managers can leverage historic investments from President
    Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act to
    reduce the risks posed by extreme heat and other climate impacts to
    low-income Americans.

Today’s announcements [build on numerous
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/26/fact-sheet-10-ways-the-biden-harris-administration-is-responding-to-extreme-heat/) that
the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to bolster heat response and
resilience nationwide. The White House also continues to work with state
and local partners to provide clear and accessible information on how
people can protect themselves from extreme heat.  
  
To protect communities from extreme heat, the Biden Harris
Administration is:

**Providing Clear and Accessible Information to Protect Communities**

-   **Launched Heat.gov. **Last year, the Administration
    launched [**Heat.gov**](https://www.heat.gov/pages/funding-opportunities),
    a website that provides the public and state, local, and tribal
    decision makers with clear, timely, and science-based information to
    understand and reduce the health risks of extreme heat. This
    one-stop hub includes heat forecasts and climate outlooks, tools and
    tips for heat protection, and the latest information on
    opportunities to leverage the President’s historic Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act to support
    communities affected by extreme heat. NIHHIS also maintains
    the [**Heat Equity mapping
    tool**](https://www.heat.gov/pages/heat-equity) to identify
    disadvantaged communities that are at greatest risk from extreme
    heat.
-   **Launched \#SummerReady Campaign. **The Federal Emergency
    Management Agency (FEMA) is also running a [**\#SummerReady
    Campaign**](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230621/fema-announces-first-summerready-extreme-heat-campaign-promote-preparedness),
    which launched at the start of this summer, to build awareness of
    the hazards that communities face during the summer months. This is
    one component of the 2023 Federal Extreme Heat Safety Campaign, a
    coordinated effort by the IWG on Extreme Heat and NIHHIS to ensure
    communities are equipped with the information they need during the
    hottest days. In addition, FEMA’s Ready.gov provides key
    information, checklists, and templates to help people plan for all
    hazards, including extreme heat, and resources to help members of
    the community to protect themselves and each other when facing
    extreme heat.
-   **Established a New Climate-Oriented Public Health
    Office. **President Biden established the Office of Climate Change
    and Health Equity within the Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS) to protect the health of people throughout the country in the
    face of climate change, especially those experiencing a higher share
    of exposures and impacts. The new office produces the [**Climate and
    Health
    Outlook**](https://www.hhs.gov/climate-change-health-equity-environmental-justice/climate-change-health-equity/climate-health-outlook/index.html) to
    help professionals and the public protect individual and community
    health in light of anticipated climate events. HHS also produces
    the [**Heat & Health
    Tracker**](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/heatTracker/), a
    web-based tool that provides daily data and county-specific
    information to help communities proactively address heat-related
    illness.
-   **Reaching Underserved Communities. **The Environmental Protection
    Agency’s (EPA) [**Let’s Talk About Heat
    Challenge**](https://www.epa.gov/innovation/lets-talk-about-heat-challenge),
    supported by the American Rescue Plan, is funding 10 community
    groups and localities across the country to implement innovative
    communication strategies designed to help Americans protect
    themselves against extreme heat risks. The Challenge focuses on
    engaging underserved and overburdened communities.
-   **Launched Heat Mapping Campaigns in 154 Communities. **This summer,
    NOAA [launched](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-communities-to-map-heat-inequities-in-14-states-1-international-city#:~:text=This%20summer%2C%20NOAA%20and%20citizen%20scientists%20will%20map,extreme%20heat%2C%20which%20often%20target%20the%20most%20vulnerable.) campaigns
    to map extreme heat and urban heat islands in an additional 154
    communities across 14 states, adding to a growing list of over 70
    communities where the inequitable distribution of heat has been
    measured. These communities are using heat maps to direct
    investments, inform local planning and cooling strategies, and help
    secure environmental justice in low-income communities, communities
    of color, and historically redlined neighborhoods that face
    disproportionate exposure to heat hazards. To learn more about the
    campaigns and see their results,
    visit [Heat.gov](https://www.heat.gov/pages/planning-and-preparing).

**Lowering Cooling Costs and Strengthening the Power Grid**

-   **Lowering Cooling Costs for Low-Income Households. **In FY 2022
    alone, HHS deployed $3.85 billion for the Low Income Home Energy
    Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and helped over 6 million households
    lower cooling costs for low-income households, open cooling centers,
    or buy, distribute, or loan efficient air conditioning equipment.
    HHS’s [**Heat Stress
    Dashboard**](https://liheap-and-extreme-heat-hhs-acf.hub.arcgis.com/) details
    how LIHEAP funds are supporting heat resilience nationwide. DOE is
    also investing $3.5 billion through its [Weatherization Assistance
    Program](https://www.energy.gov/scep/wap/weatherization-assistance-program#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Energy,ensuring%20their%20health%20and%20safety.) to
    help make low-income households more comfortable and safer in
    extreme weather, all while saving on energy costs, creating jobs,
    deploying new weatherization techniques and technology.
-   **Strengthening the U.S. Power Grid. **As part of President Biden’s
    Investing in America agenda, the Department of Energy (DOE) is
    providing [$2.3
    billion](https://netl.doe.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/Allocations%20for%2040101d%20Formula%20Grants%20-%20ALRD%20Amendment%20006.pdf) in
    grants over the next five years to states, territories, and
    federally recognized Tribes to help modernize the electric grid to
    reduce impacts of extreme weather, including extreme heat. More than
    $125 million in grants through this program have been announced so
    far this year.
-   **Using Greenscapes to Provide Relief from Extreme Heat. **The U.S.
    Forest Service continues to increase equitable access to trees and
    green spaces in urban communities where more than 84% of Americans
    live, work, and play, including by making available [**$1 billion in
    grants**](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/urban-forests) through
    the Inflation Reduction Act for this purpose. Tree canopies and
    other greenscapes reduce temperatures across urban heat islands and
    provide shade and relief during the hottest days, all while
    mitigating the emissions that drive climate change. The urban forest
    grant program is part of President Biden’s commitment to
    environmental justice and his Justice40 Initiative, which works to
    deliver 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments
    to disadvantaged communities.
-   **Making HUD-Supported Housing More Energy Efficient. **The
    Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is announcing more
    than $830 million for its [**Green and Resilient Retrofit
    Program**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-and-investments-to-lower-energy-costs-and-make-affordable-homes-more-energy-efficient-and-climate-resilient-for-hard-working-families/),
    which will upgrade affordable multifamily housing to save residents
    money, reduce building emissions, and protect residents from
    climate-driven hazards like extreme heat. Eligible upgrades include
    cool coatings for roofs to bring down building temperatures during
    high heat days, installation of heat pumps to reduce energy demand
    and keep units cool, and upgraded windows and sealing to maintain
    comfortable indoor temperatures. 
-   **Preparing Schools for Extreme Heat. **Through President Biden’s
    American Rescue Plan, EPA provided technical assistance to four
    communities through the [**Schools as Community Cleaner Air and
    Cooling
    Centers**](https://www.epa.gov/arp/schools-community-cleaner-air-and-cooling-centers) program.
    Following in-person workshops, EPA provided each county with a
    tailored “playbook” of actions and next steps to upgrade school
    facilities to be safe spaces for children and their families during
    extreme heat and wildfire smoke events. Later this summer, EPA will
    publish resources with lessons learned from this program to help
    guide principals and school administrators, facilities managers,
    teachers, and parents and caregivers. These resources will be posted
    on [www.epa.gov/schools](http://www.epa.gov/schools).
-   **Building Community Resilience to Extreme Heat. **FEMA
    recently [announced](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230519/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-160-million-build-climate) an
    additional $136 million for its Building Resilient Infrastructure
    and Communities (BRIC) program. This program is helping communities
    build resilience against extreme heat through innovative
    infrastructure design and nature-based solutions, among other
    strategies. FEMA will host a series of webinars this summer to help
    emergency managers and others design successful pre-disaster
    mitigation project proposals for BRIC. In May, HUD also released
    a [guide](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/Designing-for-Natural-Hazards-Series.html) to
    help builders and developers incorporate resilience in housing
    design and identify above-code construction techniques for a wide
    range of natural hazards, including extreme heat. These techniques
    maximize the impact of grant funding and reinforce a home’s ability
    to remain livable during long-term exposure to extreme heat.

**Building a Heat Ready Workforce**

-   **Providing Job Training. **NOAA recently opened a $60 million
    competitive funding opportunity to build a Climate Ready Workforce.
    This funding will connect people across the country to good-paying
    jobs, including heat health outreach specialists and climate equity
    officers, that tackle the climate crisis and boost local
    resilience.  
     
-   **Protecting Workers.** Since October 2021, The Department of Labor
    (DOL)’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has
    conducted over 2,800 inspections across the nation as part of DOL’s
    effort to protect indoor and outdoor workers from heat stress. OSHA
    is also in the process of developing a standard for Heat Injury and
    Illness Prevention in Outdoor and Indoor Work Settings, designed to
    protect indoor and outdoor workers from extreme heat, including farm
    workers. DOL
    recently [announced](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20230622-0) that
    it is inviting small business owners and representatives from local
    government entities to join the OSHA and other government agencies
    for a series of upcoming discussions on the potential impacts of a
    workplace heat standard on small businesses.
