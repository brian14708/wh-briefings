title: "Readout of Vice President Harris\u2019s Convening on Transportation Accessibility\
  \ and the Americans with Disabilities Act\_(ADA)"
---
 
This week, Vice President Kamala Harris convened disability rights
leaders to highlight the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to
building a nation where people with disabilities are afforded the
opportunities, independence, and respect they deserve, including through
efforts to increase transportation accessibility. She was joined by
Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, White House Domestic Policy
Advisor Neera Tanden, and White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch
Landrieu.

During the event – held during Disability Pride Month and in recognition
of the 33rd Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) –
Vice President Harris and senior Biden-Harris officials discussed how
the ADA has transformed our country. They outlined how the
Administration is expanding accessibility through historic investments
in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including $1.75 billion under
the [All Stations Accessibility
Program](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ASAP) (ASAP)  to make it easier for
people with disabilities to access our nation’s oldest and busiest rail
transit systems, and $5 billion through the [Airport Terminals
program](https://www.faa.gov/bil/airport-terminals) to make airports
across the country more accessible and equitable.

Vice President Harris and senior officials also applauded disability
advocates for their leadership and reiterated the Administration’s
commitment to fulfilling the promise of the ADA and all of our
disability civil rights laws.
