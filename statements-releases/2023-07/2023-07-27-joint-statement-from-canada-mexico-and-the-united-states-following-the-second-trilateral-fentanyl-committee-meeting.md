title: "Joint Statement from Canada, Mexico, and the United\_States Following the\
  \ Second Trilateral Fentanyl Committee\_Meeting"
---
 
On July 25, 2023 Mexico’s Secretary of Security Rosa Icela Rodriguez
hosted U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and
Canada’s National Security and Intelligence Advisor Jody Thomas
(virtually) in the second meeting of the Trilateral Fentanyl Committee
to propel and expand actions on our shared commitment to combat the
trafficking of synthetic drugs.  
   
President Joe Biden, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau established this trilateral Committee,
comprising high-level representatives from the three countries, during
the North American Leaders’ Summit on January 9-10, 2023, to guide
priority actions to address the illicit fentanyl threat facing North
America.   
   
The three co-chairs reaffirmed commitments to jointly confront the
deadly scourge of synthetic drugs, and discussed the steps we are taking
to fulfill them, including by: 1) intensifying and expanding prosecution
of drug traffickers and dismantling criminal networks; 2) targeting the
supply of precursor chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl and inviting
action by private chemical and shipping companies to prevent diversion;
3) preventing the trafficking of drugs across our borders; and 4)
promoting public health services to reduce harm and demand, educate
individuals on the risks of substance use, and provide treatment to
those seeking it.  
   
The three delegations committed to create an expert working group to
identify challenges related to our respective legislative and regulatory
frameworks associated with precursor chemicals, and related equipment.
The three countries also committed to establishing an agile mechanism to
promptly share emerging illegal drugs and drug trafficking trends.  
   
The three countries committed to continue working together to expand
international support to address the threat of synthetic drugs, building
on the very strong collaboration of Canada, Mexico, and the United
States, and working through the new Global Coalition to Address
Synthetic Drug Threats. To that end, the three countries committed to
present progress on their joint efforts within the Trilateral Fentanyl
Committee to Coalition partners at the next meeting of the Global
Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats on the margins of the United
Nations General Assembly.  
   
Representing Mexico were the Secretary of Security and Citizen
Protection, Rosa Icela Rodríguez; the Secretary of Foreign Affairs,
Alicia Bárcena Ibarra; the Secretary of the Interior, Luisa María
Alcalde Luján; the Secretary of National Defense, Gen. Luis Cresencio
Sandoval González; the Secretary of the Navy, Adm. José Rafael Ojeda
