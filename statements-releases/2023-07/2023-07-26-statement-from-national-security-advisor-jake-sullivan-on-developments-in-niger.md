title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan On Developments in\_\
  Niger"
---
 
The United States is deeply concerned about today’s developments in
Niger.  We strongly condemn any effort to detain or subvert the
functioning of Niger’s democratically elected government, led by
President Bazoum.  We specifically urge elements of the presidential
guard to release President Bazoum from detention and refrain from
violence.  We welcome the strong statements and steps taken by the
Economic Community of West African States and the African Union to
defend Niger’s democracy.  We are closely monitoring the situation to
ensure the safety of our citizens.

Niger is a critical partner for the United States.  We have shared
values on democracy and human rights, and collaborate to advance
regional security and prosperity, and our substantial cooperation with
the Government of Niger is predicated on Niger’s continued commitment to
democratic standards.
