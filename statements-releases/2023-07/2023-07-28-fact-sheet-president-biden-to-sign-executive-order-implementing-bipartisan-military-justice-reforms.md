title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden to Sign Executive Order Implementing Bipartisan\
  \ Military Justice\_Reforms"
---
 
Today, President Biden will sign an Executive Order to implement
historic, bipartisan military justice reforms that significantly
strengthen how the military handles sexual assault cases. The Executive
Order transfers key decision-making authorities from commanders to
specialized, independent military prosecutors in cases of sexual
assault, domestic violence, murder, and other serious offenses by
amending the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  
  
These changes, which implement reforms passed by Congress in the Fiscal
Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (FY22 NDAA), represent the
most significant transformation of the military justice system since the
UCMJ was established in 1950. The historic reforms announced today will
better protect victims and ensure prosecutorial decisions are fully
independent from the chain of the command. They follow decades of
tireless efforts by survivors, advocates, and Members of Congress, to
strengthen the military justice system’s response to gender-based
violence and build on recommendations from the Independent Review
Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military (IRC), which Secretary
Austin established at President Biden’s direction as one of his earliest
acts in office.  
  
These reforms are a turning point for survivors of gender-based violence
in the military. They fulfill President Biden’s promise to fundamentally
shift how the military justice system responds to sexual assault and
related crimes, which is something President Biden has prioritized since
Day One of this administration. Ending gender-based violence wherever it
occurs has been a top priority for the President throughout his
career—as a Senator, and as Vice President. As Commander in Chief, he’s
made clear that our one truly sacred obligation as a nation is to
prepare and equip those we send into harm’s way, and to care for them
and their families both while they are deployed and when they return
home. The reforms implemented through today’s Executive Order do just
that, promoting dignity and respect for those who serve by better
protecting our servicemembers and making the military safer and more
just.  
  
**<u>Today’s Executive Order takes important action to reform our
military justice system by amending the Manual for Courts-Martial and
its accompanying Rules for Courts-Martial including by:</u>**

-   Establishing the rules that will govern the new Offices of Special
    Trial Counsel (OSTC), the independent military prosecutors who will
    now decide, in the place of commanders, whether to prosecute covered
    offenses such as sexual assault and domestic violence, child abuse,
    and murder;
-   Making clear that prosecutorial decisions made by special trial
    counsel are binding and fully independent from the chain of command;
-   Delineating the relationship and authorized interactions between
    special trial counsel and commanders to protect the independence of
    special trial counsel;
-   Modernizing procedures to better protect victims and promote
    fairness before, during and after court-martial proceedings;
-   Reforming the court-martial sentencing system to promote uniformity
    and fairness, as recommended by the IRC, to reduce disparities in
    sentencing in cases of rape and sexual assault; and
-   Creating a uniform evidence standard for non-judicial punishment
    actions, which the IRC highlighted as critical to make consistent
    across the military services given that most sexual misconduct cases
    are handled by nonjudicial punishment rather than courts-martial.

This month also marks two years since the IRC published its [final
report](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2681145/independent-review-commission-recommendations-on-countering-sexual-assault-in-t/),
outlining recommendations to improve accountability, prevention, climate
and culture, and victim care and support. Today’s Executive Order
advances the IRC’s core accountability recommendations and builds on the
progress that has already been made by the Department of Defense in
implementing the IRC’s more than 80 recommendations, including:

-   **Establishing the Offices of Special Trial Counsel. **In July 2022,
    with [direction](https://dacipad.whs.mil/images/Public/10-Reading_Room/SecDef_Policies-Governing-OSTC_20220311.pdf) from Secretary
    Austin, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, including the
    Space Force, established and staffed their OSTCs to assume authority
    for prosecutorial decisions for covered offenses including sexual
    assault and domestic violence at the end of 2023. Beginning January
    1, 2025, special trial counsel prosecutorial authority will expand
    to include sexual harassment cases.
-   **Hiring, Training, and Empowering the Prevention
    Workforce. **Consistent with the IRC’s recommendation to establish a
    dedicated prevention workforce with public health expertise, the
    Department of Defense launched a phased approach to hiring a primary
    prevention workforce with 2,000 skilled professionals who will
    promote the health of their military community and work with leaders
    to change policies and implement prevention activities. In December
    2022, the Department of Defense
    released [guidance](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/640011p.PDF?ver=_-WRNG-g78mHPx4gQwkeaQ%3D%3D) for
    this new workforce, and hiring and onboarding is underway at
    installations around the world.
-   **Strengthening and Professionalizing the Sexual Assault Response
    Workforce. **The Department of Defense, in collaboration with the
    Military Services and National Guard has adopted a comprehensive
    approach to restructuring, professionalizing, strengthening, and
    resourcing for the sexual assault response workforce. This includes
    moving Sexual Assault Response Coordinators (SARCs) and Victim
    Advocates (VAs) from the command reporting structure, and generally
    eliminating collateral duty for SARCs and VAs.  This standardized
    approach across the Department of Defense is nearing completion.
-   **Improving the Military’s Response to Domestic Violence and Sexual
    Harassment. **Recognizing sexual assault can overlap with other
    forms of gender-based violence, the IRC recommended ways to improve
    accountability and support to survivors of domestic violence and
    sexual harassment. The Administration has:  
    -   Reissued and revised the Defense Department’s domestic
        abuse [policy](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/640006p.pdf) in
        December 2021. Key updates include expanding eligibility for
        Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program services to
        domestic violence survivors who have experienced sexual assault;
    -   Tracked the prevalence of domestic abuse/intimate
        partner-related sexual assault by collecting information on the
        victim-perpetrator relationship in the Workplace and Gender
        Relations Surveys of Active-Duty Members (WGRA), and Workplace
        and Gender Relations Surveys of Reserve Component Members
        (WGRR);
    -   Expanded victim advocate services, reporting options and support
        to survivors of sexual harassment, through new guidance issued
        by the Department of Defense in September 2022. This guidance
        has been implemented across all Military Departments;
    -   Starting with
        the [Navy](https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Messages/ALNAV/ALN2022/ALN22024.txt?ver=6JqcUUa8IXVnUSy-TX_XoA%3d%3d) and
        the Marine Corps,
        issued [policies](https://www.hqmc.marines.mil/Portals/135/Site%20Documents/Practice%20Directives/Practice%20Directive%201-22%20(Independent%20Sexual%20Harassment%20Investigators)%208%20July%2022.pdf?ver=0uRy6xGXlT3DjU09lVCUyg%3D%3D) for
        the independent investigation of sexual harassment reports,
        moving these investigations outside the chain of command of both
        the individual reporting sexual harassment and the alleged
        offender. The Department of Defense is working to develop a
        comprehensive approach to address this issue across all Military
        Departments; and
    -   Amended the Manual for Courts-Martial through an [Executive
        Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/26/fact-sheet-executive-order-2022-amendments-to-the-manual-for-courts-martial/) in
        January 2022 that established sexual harassment as a specific
        offense under the UCMJ, strengthening the military justice
        response in prosecuting cases of domestic violence, and
        implementing changes to the UCMJ to criminalize the wrongful
        broadcast or distribution of intimate visual images.
