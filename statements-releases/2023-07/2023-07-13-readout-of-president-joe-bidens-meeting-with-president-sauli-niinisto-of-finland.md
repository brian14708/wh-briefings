President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met in Helsinki with President Sauli
Niinistö of Finland on July 13 ahead of the third U.S.-Nordics Summit
meeting.  The leaders reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to support
Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against Russian aggression.
 President Biden congratulated Finland on becoming our newest NATO Ally
and welcomed its role as a regional security provider.  Both leaders
welcomed the recent agreement between Türkiye, Sweden and NATO
for President Erdoğan to send Sweden’s NATO accession protocol to
Turkish parliament for ratification, and underscored their desire to
welcome Sweden into NATO as soon as possible.  President Biden and
President Niinistö also took note of the recently signed co-financing
agreement between the U.S. and Finnish export credit agencies, which
will enable the United States and Finland to partner more closely on
high priority projects like 5G telecommunications and climate.
