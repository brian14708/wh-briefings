title: "Readout of White\_House Listening Session with Union Leaders on Advancing\
  \ Responsible Artificial Intelligence\_Innovation"
---
 
On Friday, June 30, senior Biden-Harris Administration
officials convened a listening session with leaders and officials from
the labor community to discuss the implications of artificial
intelligence (AI) for workers, unions, the quality of jobs, and the
future of work. Leaders of unions representing diverse sectors of the
economy raised concerns about the risks of AI for workers’ jobs,
physical and mental health, and privacy and civil rights. They also
shared views on possible opportunities for AI to improve workers’
lives when unions and workers are at the table and jointly developing
solutions with employers.  
  
The listening session was attended by officials from the White House
National Economic Council, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and
Office of the Vice President. During the session, White House principals
emphasized that, while AI has the potential to bring significant
benefits, government and employers need to collaborate with unions to
fully understand the risks for workers and how to
effectively mitigate potential harms.   
  
Participants discussed different ways that AI tools are being deployed
in the workplace, as well as the impacts of these tools on job quality.
They shared stories, for example, of employers who have used AI tools to
track workers’ pace of work and monitor work quality. These uses of AI,
union leaders noted, have often introduced inaccuracies and tended
to raise workplace stress and worsen mental health. At the same time,
leaders shared some instances where AI tools have helped support workers
in their jobs, for example, by monitoring and easing the physical toll
of some repetitive or dangerous tasks.  
  
The discussion also covered implications of AI for workers’ privacy,
civil rights, and autonomy— including from employers’ use of AI
to monitor and collect data on workers. Union leaders also agreed that
the deployment of AI in the workplace was changing the sets of skills
that employers require of their workers and
threatening creators’ ownership of their voices, likenesses, and ability
to benefit from the intellectual property they help create.
Additionally, leaders observed how employers can use AI
tools to cut jobs or make work schedules more uncertain. Participants
called upon employers and the Administration to ensure that
workers retain access to high-quality jobs that prioritize their health
and well-being, and that workers participate in decisions about how AI
is deployed in the workplace.  
  
Friday’s meeting was part of an ongoing effort by the Administration to
engage with advocates, companies, researchers, civil rights
organizations, not-for-profit organizations, communities, international
partners, and others on critical AI issues. This engagement builds on
considerable steps the Administration has taken to date to promote
responsible innovation and mitigate the risks from AI.
