Today, President Biden announced his intent to nominate former Maryland
Governor Martin O’Malley as Commissioner of the Social Security
Administration. Governor O’Malley is a lifelong public servant who has
spent his career making government more accessible and transparent,
while keeping the American people at the heart of his work. As Governor,
he made government work more effectively across his administration and
enhanced the way millions of people accessed critical services. Governor
O’Malley will continue to be a strong partner who works tirelessly to
protect and strengthen Social Security for generations to come.

*See below for what they are saying:*

for his pioneering work in \#citistat a program which produced
breakthrough accomplishments in managing government and improving
customer service with data. \#government His goal then and what he did

deserve high quality leadership. The next commissioner will have the
opportunity to attract and retain top talent, improve the employee

sensitivity to an agency where service to people in its main

permanent Commissioner.” \[Statement, 7/26/23\]

Democratic Party, through its 2020 platform, have called for.”

**Social Security Works PAC,** “Social Security Works applauds the

**Social Security Works:** “Social Security Works applauds the
nomination of Governor O’Malley, a longtime Social Security champion.
Like President Biden, O’Malley supports expanding Social Security’s
modest benefits, not cutting them. At a time when Social Security is
under attack from Republicans in Congress, O’Malley is the fighter that
the American people need at SSA’s helm…The Senate should swiftly confirm
O’Malley so he can work to provide the American people with that
first-class service and fight for increasing, not cutting, their
benefits. Notably, SSA has not had a Senate-confirmed commissioner
nominated by a Democratic president since 2001. During that time,
Congressional Republicans have starved SSA of resources, resulting in
backlogs and long waits. With staffing the lowest it has been in a
quarter of a century, SSA’s hardworking and dedicated public servants
are overworked and underpaid. Governor O’Malley is a proven champion and
fighter. As commissioner, he will be in prime position to persuade
Congress to allow SSA to spend just a few percentage points more of
Social Security’s $2.8 trillion surplus on administrative expenses, as
President Biden has requested. We are confident that O’Malley, working
closely with President Biden, will fight not only for expanded benefits
and against cuts, but also for opening new field offices and against
closing existing ones…” \[[Press

it was repealing the death penalty, passing marriage equality, restoring
voting rights, raising the minimum wage, or being a fierce defender of
the environment and addressing climate change, O’Malley’s track record

**Alliance for Retired Americans (@ActiveRetirees):** “Americans earn
their Social Security benefits, paying into the system with every

will deliver.”

“Members of the Alliance for Retired Americans are pleased that
President Biden has nominated former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley
to be the next Social Security Administration (SSA) Commissioner. The
SSA needs a strong Commissioner now more than ever. With 10,000
Americans turning 65 each day, the workload increases every day and the
budget has been woefully inadequate to meet the needs of seniors, people
with disabilities and all American families. Gov. O’Malley has a proven
track record and the experience to navigate these challenges and ensure
that Americans are able to get the benefits they have earned. American
workers have earned their Social Security benefits, paying into the
system with every paycheck. They deserve world class service from a
fully staffed workforce equipped with the best tools and technology
available. The Alliance for Retired Americans is confident that under
Governor O’Malley’s leadership SSA will deliver. There is no time to
waste. We urge the Senate to confirm Gov. O’Malley without delay.”

him and his family for their tradition of service and generations of
thoughtful, effective leadership in all three branches of state
government, including their support for working families and the unions

**Max Richtman, President and CEO, National Committee to Preserve Social
Security and Medicare**: “We commend President Biden for nominating
former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley as Social Security
Commissioner. It has been more than 20 years since the Senate has
confirmed a permanent commissioner nominated by a Democratic president,
and it is way past time for the Social Security Administration (SSA) to
have one. As a confirmed commissioner, Martin O’Malley will be able to
advocate effectively for SSA, which has been chronically underfunded and
has struggled to provide adequate customer service. As a presidential
candidate in 2016, Governor O’Malley championed the expansion of Social
Security. He proposed boosting benefits and adopting a more generous
(the CPI-E) for calculating COLAs — while adjusting the payroll wage cap
so that the wealthy pay their fair share.  He insisted that ‘it is our
responsibility to ensure that Americans who put in a lifetime of hard
work are able to retire with the dignity they deserve.’ American
workers’ payroll taxes largely fund the SSA.  They have every right to
expect the agency that administers their benefits to be fully funded —
with a permanent commissioner at the helm. The Senate should confirm
Governor O’Malley in a timely manner when it returns from August
recess.” \[[Press
