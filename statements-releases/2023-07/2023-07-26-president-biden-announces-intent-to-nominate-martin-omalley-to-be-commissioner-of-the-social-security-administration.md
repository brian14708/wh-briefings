title: "President\_Biden Announces Intent to Nominate Martin O\u2019Malley to be Commissioner\
  \ of the Social Security Administration"
---
 
Today, President Biden announced his intent to nominate former Maryland
Governor Martin O’Malley as Commissioner of the Social Security
Administration.  
  
*Statement from President Biden:*  
  
Governor O’Malley is a lifelong public servant who has spent his career
making government more accessible and transparent, while keeping the
American people at the heart of his work.  
  
As Mayor of Baltimore and Governor of Maryland, he adopted data and
performance-driven technologies to tackle complex challenges facing the
communities he served – and I saw the results firsthand when we worked
together during my time as Vice President. As Governor, he made
government work more effectively across his administration and enhanced
the way millions of people accessed critical services.  
  
Since Day 1 I have fought to strengthen and defend Social Security,
which tens of millions of Americans have paid into and depend on to
support their livelihoods. I know that Governor O’Malley will continue
to be a strong partner who works tirelessly to protect Social Security
for generations to come.  
  
**Martin O’Malley, Nominee for Commissioner of the Social Security
Administration  **  
  
Martin O’Malley is a lifelong public servant, who served as Governor of
Maryland from 2007 to 2015, following two terms as Mayor of the City of
Baltimore. Prior to being elected Mayor, O’Malley served as a member of
the Baltimore City Council from 1991-1999 and Assistant States Attorney
for the City of Baltimore before that.  
  
A pioneer of using performance-management and customer service
technologies in government, O’Malley has written extensively about how
to govern for better results in the Information Age by measuring the
outputs of government on a real-time basis.  
  
Martin O’Malley earned a B.A. from Catholic University and a J.D. from
the University of Maryland School of Law. Since 2016, he has lectured on
public administration at numerous universities and institutions,
including the University of Maryland, Harvard University, Georgetown
University, and Boston College School of Law.
