title: "FACT SHEET: Bidenomics Has Driven $500 Billion in Private Sector Investments\
  \ Across the Country, Is Growing South Carolina\u2019s Economy From the Middle Out\
  \ and Bottom\_Up"

*President Biden to visit West Columbia, where Enphase Energy is
announcing new manufacturing investments and a partnership with Flex,
resulting in up to 600 new jobs in South Carolina thanks to Inflation
Reduction Act—while West Columbia Congressman Joe Wilson voted to repeal
the Inflation Reduction Act and block his constituents from jobs and
opportunity*

President Biden’s economic agenda—Bidenomics—is growing the American
economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
Tomorrow, President Biden will announce that companies have
committed **over $500 billion in manufacturing and clean energy
investments** in the United States since the beginning of his
Administration. The President will visit **South Carolina, where
companies have announced $11 billion** in manufacturing and clean energy
investments, and the Biden-Harris Administration has already
awarded **$2.6 billion in funding for infrastructure projects**. The
President will highlight that Enphase Energy is joining a growing list
of companies beginning clean energy manufacturing operations in the
United States—mobilized directly by President Biden’s Inflation
Reduction Act—**creating 1,800 new jobs nationwide, including up to 600
new jobs in South Carolina between Enphase and its manufacturing
partner, Flex**.

**However, if Republicans in Congress—including every Republican Member
of the House of Representatives from South Carolina—had their way, South
Carolina would have lost out on billions of dollars in investments,
jobs, and opportunity.**

-   Since President Biden took office, companies have announced **$11
    billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments** in South
    Carolina.  
    -   Every South Carolina Republican Member of the House of
        Representatives who was in office at the time, including Joe
        Wilson, voted against the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan
        Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS
        and Science Act. And Republican Members of the House voted to
        overturn the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits
        in April 2023—doubling down on their opposition at a time when
        manufacturers were investing in their state.
-   An analysis from the [Financial
    Times](https://www.ft.com/content/b6cd46de-52d6-4641-860b-5f2c1b0c5622) highlighted
    how **South Carolina was among the top two states with the highest
    number of new manufacturing projects** since President Biden signed
    the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act into
    law.  
    -   Every South Carolina Republican Member of Congress, including
        both Senators, voted against the Inflation Reduction Act, and
        nearly every South Carolina Republican Member of Congress voted
        against the CHIPS and Science Act—laws which have driven the
        surge in manufacturing investments and projects in their own
        state and districts.
-   **Enphase Energy **is announcing they’re investing over $60 million
    to open up six new manufacturing lines in the United States, along
    with significant capital investments from its manufacturing
    partners. The company is creating up to 1,800 jobs that will help
    build America’s clean energy supply chains and help power up to one
    million homes per year with solar, as a result of President Biden’s
    Inflation Reduction Act. Two of these new lines will be in South
    Carolina with global diversified manufacturer Flex. Enphase’s
    expanded production with Flex has the potential to add up to 600 new
    jobs between both companies in South Carolina.  
    -   **Representative Joe Wilson—**who represents the area
        benefitting from Enphase’s investment spurred by the Inflation
        Reduction
        Act, [said](https://twitter.com/RepJoeWilson/status/1558247638964764673) the
        law was passed “to the detriment of American families” and
        called it a “waste” of money. Representative Wilson also voted
        as recently as April to overturn the clean energy tax credits
        from the Inflation Reduction Act, which have mobilized
        investments in his home district, including by Enphase.

**And if most South Carolina Republican Members of Congress had their
way, the state would have lost out on over <u>$2.6 billion in
infrastructure funding and nearly $1 billion in funding for high-speed
internet</u> for South Carolina:**

-   **Nearly $1 billion in funds **were awarded to South Carolina to
    deliver affordable, high-speed internet to every South Carolinian
    under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, using Made in America
    materials:  
    -   **Representative William Timmons**, who represents Greenville
        and Spartanburg Counties,
        where [thousands](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/local/2023/04/27/greenville-spartanburg-broadband-homes-high-speed-internet/70135875007/) of
        South Carolinians lack access to high speed internet, voted
        against the Bipartisan Infrastructure
        Law, [said](https://www.facebook.com/RepTimmons/posts/pfbid02GKpZqhdZrmsLqHCxcwarjV18NY6G6U4Ew3QTzYNxkTdvpvuDJKym1jj5sto8Y4RNl) it
        would do “nothing of the sort” to connect Americans to
        high-speed internet, and said instead it was a “Socialist
        spending spree.”
-   The Federal Aviation Administration awarded **$5 million** to the
    Columbia Metropolitan Airport for a terminal expansion that will
    reduce travel times and bring the current security checkpoint up to
    TSA standards.
    -   **Representative Joe Wilson,** whose district is benefitting
        from the airport
        upgrade, [said](https://www.wistv.com/2021/09/30/what-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-means-south-carolina-which-lawmakers-support-it/) that
        the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was “rife with wasteful
        spending.”
-   The Charleston Area Regional Transportation Authority area
    received **nearly $26 million** to build and repair clean energy
    transportation infrastructure.
    -   **Representative Nancy Mace** congratulated the South Carolina
        organization on winning the funding after voting against the
        legislation that made the investment
        possible—[saying](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1188667414973421) the
        Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was a “down payment on the Green
        New Deal.”
-   The Department of Agriculture awarded **$2.5 million** to Georgetown
    County for watershed and flood prevention operations on Sandy
    Island.
    -   **Senator Tim
        Scott **[said](https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-votes-no-on-12-trillion-spending-bill) the
        Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes “reckless spending on
        unrelated pet projects.”
-   The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded the City of
    Clemson **$3.9 million** to buy new, zero-emission electric buses
    that will improve service reliability and air quality in the city.
    -   **Representative Jeff Duncan,** who represents Clemson, voted
        against the bill,
        falsely [claiming](https://twitter.com/RepJeffDuncan/status/1440381813122166790) “only
        $1 out of every $4 in this bill goes towards things people would
        describe as ‘infrastructure.’”

**Also in South Carolina:**

-   **BMW **is investing $1 billion in Spartanburg to prepare for the
    production of battery electric vehicles and an additional $700
    million to build a new high-voltage assembly facility in Woodruff.
    -   **Representative Ralph Norman, **whose district is adjacent to
        the
        projects, [said](https://twitter.com/RepRalphNorman/status/1673746344908050433) he
        “love\[d\] to see high-voltage batteries for electric vehicles
        being assembled in the USA, and over 300 jobs being brought to
        South Carolina,” yet voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure
        Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which include critical
        provisions that have spurred companies to invest in battery
        manufacturing in the United States. Rep. Norman
        even [claimed](https://norman.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1424) the
        Inflation Reduction Act would spend billions on “nonsense” and
        “ineffective climate programs.”
    -   **Senator Lindsay
        Graham **[said](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/local/2022/10/19/bmw-announces-investment-to-build-all-electric-vehicles-at-spartanburg/69574654007/) “when
        they write the chapter of electrification of the vehicle in the
        United States, South Carolina, the book, we’ll be in the first
        chapter,” yet voted against the Inflation Reduction Act aimed at
        building, expanding, and onshoring electric vehicle production
        in the United States.
-   **Redwood Materials** is investing $3.5 billion—the largest
    investment in the state’s history—to build a battery materials
    facility just outside of Charleston, creating an expected 1,500 new
    jobs and supporting the state’s growing electric vehicle and battery
    supply chain.
    -   **Senator Tim Scott **celebrated the Redwood Materials
        announcement, while opposing the Inflation Reduction Act aimed
        at bringing more clean energy investments like that of Redwood
        to the United States. Senator
        Scott—after [saying](https://scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-statement-on-democrats-latest-spending-spree) the
        bill would “put the American Dream further out of reach for
        families”—said he was “excited to see the work begin” on the EV
        battery plant.
-   **Envision AESC** will build a battery cell Gigafactory in Florence
    County through a $810 million investment that is expected to create
    1,100 new jobs.  
    -   **Representative Russell Fry, **who represents Florence
        County, [said](https://twitter.com/RepRussellFry/status/1666511899947573253) the
        announcement was “exciting news” and celebrated the fact that it
        was “one of the largest economic development announcements ever”
        for the county. Yet less than a year ago,
        Fry [called](https://www.facebook.com/RussellFrySC/posts/pfbid02JE86UPuwWeZebP3eR797zFit6oznYUE3G2G3Hru4hNvppnrAKBNaYySxKBEJdjwSl) the
        Inflation Reduction Act “horrible” and not “in line with helping
        the American people.”
