title: "Bidenomics Is Delivering for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific\
  \ Islanders: The President\u2019s Plan Grows the Economy from the Middle Out and\
  \ Bottom Up\u2014Not the Top\_Down"
---
 
President Biden and Vice President Harris came into office determined to
rebuild our economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top
down—and that strategy is working. Even as they faced an immediate
economic and public health crisis—with a raging pandemic, elevated
unemployment, snarled supply chains, and hundreds of thousands of small
businesses at risk of shuttering—the President and Vice President
understood that it wouldn’t be enough to simply go back to the economy
we had before the pandemic. That economy was saddled with longstanding
challenges that held America back—including [rising
inequality](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=02833aa17d&e=c041147ca9)
and disinvestment from communities across the country.  
   
President Biden recognized that some of those challenges were rooted in
a failed trickle-down theory that supported slashing taxes for the
wealthy and big corporations, shrinking public investment in critical
priorities like infrastructure and education, and failing to safeguard
market competition.  
  
**The President took office determined to move beyond these failed
trickle-down policies and fundamentally change the economic direction of
our country. His plan—Bidenomics—is rooted in the recognition that the
best way to grow the economy is from the middle out and the bottom up.**
It’s an economic vision centered around three key pillars:

-   **Making smart public investments** in America
-   **Empowering and educating workers** to grow the middle class
-   **Promoting competition** to lower costs and help entrepreneurs and
    small businesses thrive

While our work isn’t finished, Bidenomics is already delivering for the
American people, including for AA & NHPI communities. During the
Biden-Harris Administration, we have:

-   Lowered the Asian American unemployment
    [rate](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm) to
    pre-pandemic levels.
-   Achieved the highest Asian American employment
    [rate](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm) since 2008.
-   Increased AA & NHPI enrollment in HealthCare.gov coverage by about
    100,000 from 2020 to 2022.
-   Lifted 18,000 AA & NHPI children out of poverty through the Thrifty
    Food Plan.
-   The number of Asian American owned businesses increased by 18%
    compared to pre-pandemic.
-   Began reversing decades of infrastructure disinvestment in
    communities of color, including with $4 billion to reconnect
    communities that were previously cut off from economic opportunities
    by transportation infrastructure and to help advance transportation
    projects in disadvantaged or underserved communities.
-   Began closing the digital divide for communities of color, with
    funding and a commitment to connect every person in America to
    reliable, affordable high-speed internet by 2030.
-   Set a goal of increasing by 50% the amount of federal contracting
    dollars going to small disadvantaged businesses by 2025—which would
    translate to an additional $100 billion to minority-owned and other
    underserved businesses, and help more Americans realize their
    entrepreneurial dreams.
-   Expanded access to health care and disability benefits, reduced
    homelessness, and achieved historic unemployment rates for veterans,
    including for the nearly 400,000 AA & NHPI veterans.
