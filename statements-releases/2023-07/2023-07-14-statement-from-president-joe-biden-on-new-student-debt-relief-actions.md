title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on New Student Debt Relief\_Actions"
---
 
I have long said that college should be a ticket to the middle class –
not a burden that weighs down on families for decades.  
  
My Administration is delivering on that commitment. Starting today, over
800,000 student loan borrowers who have been repaying their loans for 20
years or more will see $39 billion of their loans discharged because of
steps my Administration took to fix failures of the past. These
borrowers will join the millions of people that my Administration has
provided relief to over the past two years – resulting in over $116
billion in loan relief to over 3 million borrowers under my
Administration.  
  
But we’re not stopping there. My Administration has worked hard to
secure the largest increases to Pell Grants in a decade, fixed broken
loan programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and created a new
income-driven repayment plan that will cut undergraduate loan payments
in half and bring monthly payments to zero for low-income borrowers.
And, when the Supreme Court made the wrong decision, I immediately
announced a new plan to open an alternative path to relief for as many
borrowers as possible, as soon as possible.  
  
Republican lawmakers – who had no problem with the government forgiving
millions of dollars of their own business loans – have tried everything
they can to stop me from providing relief to hardworking Americans. Some
are even objecting to the actions we announced today, which follows
through on relief borrowers were promised, but never given, even when
they had been making payments for decades. The hypocrisy is stunning,
and the disregard for working and middle-class families is outrageous.  
  
As long as I’m in office, I will continue to work to bring the promise
of college to every American.
