partnership and friendship. President Biden will reaffirm the ironclad
commitment of the United States to Israel’s security.  The two leaders
will discuss opportunities to deepen Israel’s regional integration and
to create a more peaceful and prosperous Middle East.  President Biden
will stress the importance of our shared democratic values, and discuss
ways to advance equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and security for
Palestinians and Israelis.  The leaders will also discuss Russia’s
deepening military relationship with Iran, and Iran’s destabilizing
behavior in the region.  Vice President Harris will meet with President
Herzog on July 19 at the White House.  President Herzog will be in
Washington July 18-19 for meetings with a range of interagency officials
and to deliver a Joint Address to Congress.
