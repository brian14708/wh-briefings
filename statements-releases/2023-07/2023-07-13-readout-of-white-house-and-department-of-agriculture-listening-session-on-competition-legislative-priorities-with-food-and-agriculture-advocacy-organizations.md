title: "Readout of White\_House and Department of Agriculture Listening Session on\
  \ Competition Legislative Priorities with Food and Agriculture Advocacy Organizations"
---
 
Promoting competition to lower costs and help small businesses thrive,
including in agricultural markets, is a key pillar of Bidenomics. Today,
the White House and Department of Agriculture convened a listening
session with representatives from 16 food and agriculture advocacy
organizations to discuss the need for more competition in key
agricultural markets.

Senior White House and Department of Agriculture officials opened the
session by explaining that President Biden has made promoting
competition in agricultural markets a priority of his economic agenda.
They explained how industry consolidation—whether in meat and poultry
processing, ocean shipping, or other fields—can decrease options for
inputs like seeds, fertilizer, and farm equipment and limit channels for
selling products. Officials also highlighted [steps that the
Administration has
taken](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/05/04/fact-sheet-usda-fighting-fair-competitive-and-transparent-markets)
to date to spur competition, increase transparency, and support new
markets and opportunities in the agriculture sector. They expressed
support for further legislative action to protect farmers and ranchers
from abuse, promote competition, and make our supply chains more diverse
and resilient, and they noted that they are encouraged to see this is an
area of bipartisan interest.

During the listening session, participants representing a diverse set of
agricultural communities described their experiences with how
consolidation has harmed family farmers and ranchers and raised prices
for American consumers. Many participants noted progress that has been
made under the Biden-Harris Administration to invest in independent meat
and poultry processing capacity, expand market opportunities and seed
choices for farmers and support a growing workforce in rural areas, and
asked that the Administration continue efforts to combat consolidation.
They expressed their support for bipartisan legislation to further
promote competition in the food supply chain. Officials closed the
meeting by reiterating the President’s commitment to promoting
competition across industries and thanked participants for their hard
work and feedback.
