title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Iowa\u2019\
  s Abortion\_Ban"
---
 
Today, Governor Kim Reynolds signed into law an extreme abortion ban
that will take away a woman’s right to choose and is just the latest
state ban enacted by Republican elected officials following the Supreme
Court’s decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade* one year ago. Iowa’s new
law will penalize health care providers and cause delays and denials of
health and life-saving care.  
  
While Republican elected officials advance dangerous laws, President
Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the majority of Americans who
believe personal health care decisions should be between a woman and her
doctor, not politicians, and will continue to call on Congress to codify
the protections of *Roe v. Wade *in federal law. The Biden-Harris
Administration will continue to defend access to reproductive health
care and fight any attempts to pass a national abortion ban.
