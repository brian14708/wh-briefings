title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on June Jobs\_Report"
---
 
This is Bidenomics in action: Our economy added more than
200,000 jobs last month—for a total of 13.2 million jobs since I took
office. That’s more jobs added in two and a half years than any
president has ever created in a four-year term. The unemployment
rate has now remained below 4 percent for 17 months in a row—the longest
stretch since the 1960s.  The share of working-age Americans who have
jobs is at the highest level in over 20 years. Inflation has come down
by more than half. We are seeing stable and steady growth.
That’s Bidenomics—growing the economy by creating jobs, lowering costs
for hardworking families, and making smart investments in America.
