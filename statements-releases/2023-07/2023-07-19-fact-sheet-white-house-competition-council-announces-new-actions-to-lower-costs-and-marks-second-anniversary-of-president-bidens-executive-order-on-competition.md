*Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Initiatives to Lower Food,
Rental Housing, and Other Costs and Updated Guidance Regarding
Enforcement of Antitrust Laws in the Modern Economy*

Promoting competition to lower costs and support small businesses and
entrepreneurs is a central part of Bidenomics. When President Biden took
office, four decades of misguided economic philosophy had led to a pull
back from robust government action to promote competition, and
concentration had increased in [more than
75%](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article/23/4/697/5477414) of U.S
industries. One estimate found that higher prices and lower wages caused
by lack of competition was costing the median American household as much
as [$5,000
annually](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237544).

To turn the tide, almost exactly two years ago, President Biden signed a
landmark Executive Order establishing the [White House Competition
Council](http://www.whitehouse.gov/competition) and directing a “whole
of government” approach to promoting competition. Today, at its fifth
meeting since the Order, agencies represented on the White House
Competition Council took three new actions to promote competition and
lower costs:

-   **Lowering food prices and promoting competition in agriculture:**
    Today, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) launched an [historic
    enforcement
    partnership](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/07/19/usda-launches-historic-partnership-bipartisan-state-attorneys)
    with over two dozen bipartisan State Attorneys General to crack down
    on price-gouging and other anticompetitive practices in food and
    agricultural markets. Under the Agricultural Competition
    Partnership, this bipartisan group will be able to harness all
    available legal enforcement tools—at both the state and federal
    level—to help lower food prices and promote competition in
    agricultural markets. USDA also launched the new Farmer Seed Liaison
    to help to give farmers a voice in the patent process. These
    initiatives build on actions USDA has already taken to help lower
    foods costs and help farmers get a fairer price for their goods,
    including distributing millions of dollars in grants to expand small
    and independent processing, and proposing rules to address
    anticompetitive behavior.  
-   **Exposing rental housing junk fees to lower rental costs**: Today,
    the Competition Council [launched a new
    front](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-on-junk-fees-in-rental-housing-to-lower-costs-for-renters/)
    in the Administration’s war on junk fees, taking action to address
    rental housing fees. This includes rental application fees that
    exceed the actual cost of running the background or credit check,
    and additional charges like so-called “convenience fees” to pay rent
    online. Application fees can be up to $100 or more per application
    and prospective renters often apply to more than one apartment,
    paying hundreds in application fees including for apartments that
    may no longer be available. Today, Zillow, Apartments.com, and
    AffordableHousing.com answered the President’s call to action by
    committing to launch new website features to show prospective
    renters all the fees up front—so they can comparison shop for the
    best deal and know what they are paying for upfront. In addition,
    the Department of Housing and Urban Development [issued a new white
    paper](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/policy-and-practice-publication-2023-july.pdf)
    on rental housing junk fees, including innovative policies to
    address them.  
-   **Providing clarity regarding enforcement of laws prohibiting
    anticompetitive mergers:** Today, the [Department of
    Justice](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-ftc-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines)
    (DOJ) and the [Federal Trade
    Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/07/ftc-doj-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines)
    (FTC) answered President Biden’s call to action in his Competition
    Executive Order by releasing their new proposed Merger Guidelines
    for public comment. The Guidelines seek to give the public,
    businesses, workers, and consumers clarity about how law enforcement
    agencies evaluate mergers under the antitrust laws on the books in
    the context of our modern economy. As the Council of Economic
    Advisers explains in a forthcoming issue brief, this revised
    guidance reflects an approach to antitrust enforcement that is
    informed by the best, most up-to-date economic evidence available.
    Robust enforcement can lower prices, raise wages, and promote
    innovation.

Today’s new announcements build on the dozens of actions agencies have
already taken in just the two years since President Biden signed his
Executive Order. Not only have agencies already delivered on a majority
of the Order’s 72 initiatives, they have gone above and beyond to launch
additional new initiatives, embracing the “all of government” approach
and launching more than a dozen cross-cutting interagency initiatives.
The Biden-Harris Administration’s actions to date include:

***Transportation***

-   President Biden signed into law the bipartisan [Ocean Shipping
    Reform
    Act](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=b3011e7e908c8cb3JmltdHM9MTY4OTU1MjAwMCZpZ3VpZD0yY2M2ZmVkZS1lNTY1LTZmZDgtM2I5MS1lZGZmZTRlOTZlNTcmaW5zaWQ9NTUxMg&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=2cc6fede-e565-6fd8-3b91-edffe4e96e57&psq=ocean+shipping+reform+act&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2hpdGVob3VzZS5nb3YvYnJpZWZpbmctcm9vbS9sZWdpc2xhdGlvbi8yMDIyLzA2LzE2L2JpbGwtc2lnbmVkLXMtMzU4MC8jOn46dGV4dD1TLiUyMDM1ODAlMkMlMjB0aGUlMjAlRTIlODAlOUNPY2VhbiUyMFNoaXBwaW5nJTIwUmVmb3JtJTIwQWN0JTIwb2YsZGlyZWN0bHklMjB3aXRoJTIwc2hpcHBlcnMlMjBhbmQlMjByYWlsJTIwYW5kJTIwbW90b3IlMjBjYXJyaWVycy4&ntb=1),
    which lowers costs for American retailers, farmers, and consumers.
    Ocean shipping prices are down more than 80% from their peak, which
    has contributed to the decline in inflationary pressures—with goods
    prices down sharply, from over 12% to 1.4%, over the past year and a
    half.  
-   Two major global shipping container suppliers
    [abandoned](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/global-shipping-container-suppliers-china-international-marine-containers-and-maersk)
    a proposed merger following a DOJ investigation into whether the
    merger would result in higher prices, lower quality, and more
    fragile global supply chains.  
-   The national electric vehicle charging network will now have open
    and interoperable chargers thanks to a Department of Transportation
    (DOT) [final
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/02/28/2023-03500/national-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-standards-and-requirements).
    The rule also requires privacy protections.  
-   DOJ successfully [sued to
    block](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-statements-district-court-ruling-enjoining-american-airlines-and-jetblue-s)
    a domestic alliance between two airlines that would have raised
    fares and limited choice.  
-   DOT called out airlines’ bad service and got results. Previously,
    none of the 10 largest U.S. airlines guaranteed meals or hotels when
    they caused a cancellation or significant delay and no airline
    guaranteed that parents can sit with their children for free. Now,
    thanks to DOT’s use of the bully pulpit, 9 of the 10 largest
    airlines guarantee hotels, 10 airlines to guarantee meals, and 3
    airlines to guarantee fee-free family seating. Consumers can see
    what services airlines offer at
    [FlightRights.Gov](http://www.flightrights.gov).  
-   DOT is pursuing an unprecedented expansion of airline passenger
    rights and protections. It has put out a suite of proposed rules
    that, if finalized as proposed, would: (1) require airlines to
    [promptly
    refund](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/part-ongoing-airline-consumer-protections-efforts-usdot-announces-new-rulemaking)
    airline tickets when they cancel or significantly change a
    flight; (2) [require
    refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/notice-proposed-rulemaking-nprm-refunding-fees-delayed)
    for services not delivered (like broken Wi-Fi or delayed bags),
    and (3) require fees to be [disclosed
    up-front](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announce-new-effort-save-americans-money-and-spur)
    for add-on services like checking a bag or changing or canceling a
    flight. DOT is also working on rules that would ban family seating
    junk fees and would require airlines to compensate flyers when a
    flight is cancelled or delayed due to the airline’s fault.  
-   The Surface Transportation Board (STB) [has adopted a new
    rule](https://www.stb.gov/news-communications/latest-news/pr-22-55/)
    to make it easier and faster for rail customers to challenge
    excessive railroad rates. The STB is also pursuing a [rulemaking on
    reciprocal
    switching](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/03/2021-28396/reciprocal-switching)
    that, if finalized as proposed, would introduce more rail service
    options to shippers and a [proposed a
    rule](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=81f295b714f3b034JmltdHM9MTY4OTU1MjAwMCZpZ3VpZD0yY2M2ZmVkZS1lNTY1LTZmZDgtM2I5MS1lZGZmZTRlOTZlNTcmaW5zaWQ9NTIwNg&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=2cc6fede-e565-6fd8-3b91-edffe4e96e57&psq=stb+final+rule+expedited+relief&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmVkZXJhbHJlZ2lzdGVyLmdvdi9kb2N1bWVudHMvMjAyMi8wNS8wMi8yMDIyLTA5MDA1L3JlZ3VsYXRpb25zLWZvci1leHBlZGl0ZWQtcmVsaWVmLWZvci1zZXJ2aWNlLWVtZXJnZW5jaWVz&ntb=1)
    that, if finalized as proposed, would allow rail customers to more
    easily seek relief during service emergencies.

***Food and Agriculture***

-   Farmers and ranchers can now anonymously report potential unfair and
    anticompetitive practices through
    [FarmerFairness.gov](http://www.farmerfairness.gov/), a new
    enforcement collaboration between DOJ and FTC that brings both
    agencies’ investigative resources and authorities to bear. This
    enforcement collaboration resulted in [a successful
    settlement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-and-proposed-consent-decrees-end-long-running-conspiracy)
    with major poultry processors that deceived farmers and suppressed
    wages.  
-   Thirty-one small, independent meat and poultry processors have
    received $171 million in USDA award funding to offer more processing
    capacity for farmers in 23 states, through the [Meat and Poultry
    Processing Expansion
    Program](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/business-programs/meat-and-poultry-processing-expansion-program) (MPPEP)
    and [Meat and Poultry Intermediary Lending
    Program](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/business-programs/meat-and-poultry-intermediary-lending-program)
    (MPILP). These awards are part of a broader $1 billion investment to
    expand independent meat and poultry processing capacity across the
    country as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Action Plan for
    a Fairer, More Competitive, and More Resilient Meat and Poultry
    Supply Chain.  
-   USDA stood up and dedicated $500 million for the [Fertilizer
    Production Expansion
    Program](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/business-programs/fertilizer-production-expansion-program),
    which supports fertilizer production that is independent,
    made-in-America, innovative, sustainable, and farmer-focused.  
-   To protect farmers and ranchers from harmful, anti-competitive
    practices, USDA [proposed a Packers and Stockyards Act
    rule](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/09/26/biden-harris-administration-announces-major-actions-spur)
    that, if finalized as proposed, would prohibit discrimination,
    retaliation, and deception in livestock, meat, and poultry markets.
    USDA is also working on additional Packers and Stockyards Act rules
    to address unfair practices in the poultry tournament system and to
    clarify that a market-wide showing of harm to competition is not
    required to establish a violation of the Act.  
-   To give American consumers more accurate information about the food
    they consume, [USDA proposed a
    rule](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/03/06/usda-proposes-new-requirements-product-usa-label-claim)
    that, if finalized as proposed, would allow the voluntary “Product
    of USA” or “Made in the USA” claim to be applied only on meat,
    poultry, and egg products when they are derived from animals born,
    raised, slaughtered and processed in the United States. Under
    current labeling rules, a product could be labeled “Product of USA”
    if it was only processed here—including when meat is raised overseas
    and then merely processed into cuts of meat domestically. That makes
    it hard or impossible for consumers to know where their food comes
    from and to choose to support American farmers and ranchers.  
-   Growers and plant breeders will have more transparency about the
    complex seed system through USDA’s launch of a [Farmer Seed Liaison
    Initiative](https://www.ams.usda.gov/press-release/usda-launches-interagency-working-group-competition-and-intellectual-property-seeds),
    in collaboration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
    This initiative follows a [landmark
    report](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/03/06/biden-harris-administration-announces-actions-investments-create)
    published by USDA on competition problems in seed markets.  
-   Treasury, in consultation with DOJ and FTC, released a
    [report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/competition/) on competition in
    the markets for beer, wine, and spirits, celebrating the vibrancy
    and innovativeness of the U.S. alcohol industry while proposing a
    series of recommendations to level the playing field for small
    businesses. Treasury is working on a suite of rulemakings to
    implement recommendations in the report.

***Technology and Internet Service***

-   **Broadband providers will soon be required to display “Broadband
    Nutrition Labels” for consumers**—**simple labels that provide basic
    information about the internet service offered, including costs and
    fees, so people can compare options more easily**—**thanks to a
    rule**
    [finalized](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-requires-broadband-providers-display-labels-help-consumers)
    **by** Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  
-   Tenants of office buildings and apartments can now access more
    options, thanks to FCC cracking down on “[sweetheart
    deals](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-acts-increase-broadband-competition-apartment-buildings-0)”
    between landlords and internet providers that lock tenants into just
    one provider.  
-   [FCC has proposed
    rules](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-pricing-transparency-requirement-cable-and-satellite)
    that, if finalized as proposed, would require cable providers to
    display total, “all-in” prices clearly and prominently, so consumers
    know what they are getting and at what price.  
-   FTC released a new [enforcement
    policy](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/policy-statement-federal-trade-commission-repair-restrictions-imposed-manufacturers-sellers)
    on the “Right to Repair” and secured major settlements making it
    easier and cheaper to repair [grills, motorcycles, and
    generators](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/07/ftc-announces-three-right-repair-cases-do-your-warranties-comply-law).

    have announced voluntary changes, and
    [Minnesota](https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Consumer/Publications/RightToRepair.asp),
    [Colorado](https://gizmodo.com/colorado-farmers-win-right-to-repair-battle-legislation-1850334154),

    passed new laws.  
-   FTC
    [stopped](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/02/statement-regarding-termination-nvidia-corps-attempted-acquisition-arm-ltd)
    a $40 billion semiconductor megamerger that would have stifled
    innovation.  
-   FTC has [proposed a
    rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring)
    that, if finalized as proposed, would make it as easy to cancel a
    subscription as it was to sign up.  
-   FTC launched the [rulemaking
    process](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/08/ftc-explores-rules-cracking-down-commercial-surveillance-lax-data-security-practices)
    for new privacy rules to crack down on harmful surveillance, data
    collection, and data security practices that threaten Americans’
    privacy and enable companies to profit off collecting vast troves of
    personal data from consumers.  
-   The Department of Commerce announced the Biden-Harris Internet for
    All initiative, a [$45 billion
    investment](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/05/biden-harris-administration-launches-45-billion-internet-all-initiative)
    in high-speed internet access, which, after funding infrastructure
    in areas without access, will provide funding for competitors in
    areas where existing access is low-quality.

***Labor Markets***

-   An estimated 30 million workers could benefit from a [non-competes
    ban](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-noncompete-clauses-which-hurt-workers-harm-competition)
    proposed by the FTC that, if finalized in its current form, could
    raise wages by nearly $300 billion annually. Non-compete agreements
    reduce workers’ mobility, thus suppressing wages and limiting
    opportunity.  
-   The Department of Labor published an [interim final
    rule](https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/trade/02142023) in
    February establishing procedures and timeframes for handling
    whistleblower retaliation complaints under the Criminal Antitrust
    Anti-Retaliation Act (CAARA).  
-   The Department of Labor has also
    [partnered](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/departments-justice-and-labor-strengthen-partnership-protect-workers)
    with the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division to protect
    workers’ rights and support worker mobility and more competitive
    labor markets. Both the
    [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/07/federal-trade-commission-national-labor-relations-board-forge-new-partnership-protect-workers?utm_source=govdelivery%5d)
    and the
    [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-national-labor-relations-board-announce-partnership-protect-workers)
    have also agreed to share information with the National Labor
    Relations Board as part of efforts to protect workers from unfair
    labor practices.  
-   DOJ successfully sued to block Penguin Random House’s [proposed $2.2
    billion
    acquisition](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-obtains-permanent-injunction-blocking-penguin-random-house-s-proposed)
    of Simon & Schuster—a victory for authors, readers, and the free
    exchange of ideas that also sets a landmark legal precedent that
    antitrust laws protect workers.

***Healthcare***

-   President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which
    lowers the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.
    The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is implementing
    key Medicare provisions of the Act, while also pursuing other
    initiatives such as continuing to advance competition from lower
    cost generic drugs and biosimilars.  
-   Hearing aids for mild-to-moderate hearing loss are [now available in
    stores](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/17/fact-sheet-cheaper-hearing-aids-now-in-stores-thanks-to-biden-harris-administration-competition-agenda/)
    without a prescription, thanks to the Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA) finalizing a rule allowing over-the-counter sales. This is
    saving the nearly [30 million
    Americans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564588/) with
    hearing loss as much as $3,000 per pair. And now, 10 months since
    hearing aids became available, new companies are entering the market
    and offering new products and features in thousands of stores across
    all 50 states. Many retailers are expanding both their product
    offerings and the number of stores that sell over-the-counter
    hearing aids.  
-   Consumers have access to new data about ownership in health care as
    the Administration for the first time has made ownership data on
    [hospitals, nursing
    homes](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hhs-releases-new-data-and-report-hospital-and-nursing-home-ownership),
    [hospice providers, and home health
    agencies](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/04/20/first-time-hhs-making-ownership-data-all-medicare-certified-hospice-home-health-agencies-publicly-available.html)
    publicly available. HHS has also proposed new rules that would shed
    light on [private equity
    ownership](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-increase-transparency-nursing-home)
    of nursing homes. HHS has also proposed new requirements for
    hospitals to publicly post their charges in a standardized way and
    to strengthen oversight of noncompliant hospitals.  
-   The Department of Commerce (DOC) and HHS [announced a joint
    effort](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/03/21/hhs-doc-announce-plan-review-march-in-authority.html)
    to produce a whole-of-government framework for making decisions
    about when to exercise “march-in” authority, including when price
    may be a consideration.  
-   Consumers can now compare apples-to-apples when choosing the health
    plan that will work best for them because HHS finalized a rule
    requiring insurers to offer [standardized
    plans](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-9911-f-patient-protection-final-rule.pdf)
    on the ACA Marketplace.  
-   The Administration is [increasing
    scrutiny](https://www.uspto.gov/blog/director/entry/the-biden-administration-is-acting)
    of prescription drug patents that unduly delay competition through a
    joint effort launched between HHS and USPTO.  
-   Doctors will automatically provide patients with a copy of their
    prescriptions immediately after an eye exam if an update to the
    [Eyeglass
    Rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/12/ftc-proposes-updating-eyeglass-rule-require-prescribers-get-signed-confirmation-when-providing?utm_source=govdelivery)
    proposed by the FTC is finalized as proposed.

***Small Businesses***

-   The Biden-Harris Administration delivered more than $450 billion in
    emergency relief funding to over 6 million small businesses during
    the pandemic. During 2021 and 2022, Americans filed a record [10.5
    million](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-expands-access-to-capital-and-support-for-small-businesses/)
    applications to start small business. This recovery and these record
