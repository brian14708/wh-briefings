title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Second Quarter GDP\_Report"
---
 
The economy is growing and we’re lowering costs for families. That’s
Bidenomics at work. Today’s report shows that the economy grew at a 2.4
percent annual rate in the second quarter while inflation fell
significantly.  Private business investment was strong and investment in
manufacturing facilities contributed more to growth than it has in 40
years, consistent with my Investing in America agenda.  The economy’s
continued growth builds on what was already the strongest pandemic
recovery and lowest inflation of any G-7 country. This progress wasn’t
inevitable or accidental—it is Bidenomics in action, growing the economy
from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. And hard-working
Americans are seeing the results: Our unemployment rate remains near
record lows, inflation has fallen by two thirds, real wages are higher
than they were before the pandemic, and we’ve seen more than half a
trillion dollars in private sector investment commitments in clean
energy and manufacturing. My economic plan is working—and we’re just
getting started.
