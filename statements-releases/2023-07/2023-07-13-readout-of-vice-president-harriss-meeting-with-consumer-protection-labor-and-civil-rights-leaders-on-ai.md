title: "Readout of Vice President Harris\u2019s Meeting with Consumer Protection,\
  \ Labor, and Civil Rights Leaders on\_AI"
---
 
This week, Vice President Kamala Harris convened consumer protection,
labor, and civil rights leaders to discuss risks related to artificial
intelligence (AI) and reaffirm the Biden-Harris Administration’s
commitment to protecting the American public from harm and
discrimination. She was joined by White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy Director Arati Prabhakar, White House Domestic Policy
Advisor Neera Tanden, and White House Gender Policy Council Director Jen
Klein.

During the convening, Vice President Harris rejected the “false choice”
between advancing innovation and protecting Americans, and senior
Biden-Harris administration officials stressed the importance of
realizing the benefits that might come from advances in AI, while also
mitigating the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals and
society, including threats to safety, privacy, and those that deepen
existing inequality and discrimination.

Civil society leaders shared real world examples of the ongoing risks
posed to vulnerable people, including seniors targeted by AI enabled
scams, women denied job interviews because of a biased algorithm, and
warehouse workers monitored by automated trackers, forcing them to skip
breaks, move too fast, and risk their health and safety. All emphasized
the need to ensure that AI policy centers the rights of workers,
consumers, and communities.

Biden-Harris officials and participants agreed that more work involving
government, the private sector, and civil society is urgently needed to
develop and ensure safeguards and protections consistent with the
Administration’s efforts to implement the principles and practices
outlined in the [White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of
Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/), including
proactively ensuring that AI tools do not drive harm or discrimination.
