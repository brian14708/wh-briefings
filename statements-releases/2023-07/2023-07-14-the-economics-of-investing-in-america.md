title: "The Economics of Investing in\_America"
---
 
The President took office determined to move beyond failed trickle-down
policies and fundamentally change the economic direction of our country.
His
plan—[Bidenomics](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/28/remarks-by-president-biden-on-bidenomics-chicago-il/)—is
rooted in the recognition that the best way to grow the economy is from
the middle out and the bottom up.

**A core tenet of Bidenomics is making smart public investments in
America.**

This is based on the belief that targeted public investment can attract
more private sector investment, rather than crowd it out. This is
particularly true in sectors that are central to the long-term economic
and national security interests of the United States—from our
infrastructure, to semiconductors, to clean energy and climate
security.  
  
**The President has a unique approach to making smart investments in
America.**

Today, the National Economic Council and the Investing in America Chief
Economist [released a
brief](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Economics-of-Investing-in-America.pdf) that
outlines the *economic case* for this approach—both the investments the
President is making and his approach to making them in a way that
benefits the middle class.  
  
***Bidenomics invests in infrastructure, clean energy and electric
vehicles, semiconductors, and innovation. ***

Why? Because:

-   Investments in industries are
    often [more](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.89.3.619) [productive](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2118280) when
    made on top of a solid foundation of reliable infrastructure.
-   Necessary investments in the semiconductor, clean energy, and
    electric vehicle supply chains will not be made by the private
    sector alone.
-   Risky or long-term investments in innovation require public
    investments to fill the gaps that private investors won’t.

***Bidenomics chooses to invest in industries from the middle out
and the bottom up.***

Why? Because:

-   This is the most effective approach to deliver long-term economic
    benefits to American workers, families, and consumers by building
    pathways to the middle class.
-   In order to recruit workers and build lasting, productive
    industries, employers must offer high-quality jobs—with strong wages
    and benefits.  These jobs offer pathways to the middle class that do
    not require four years of college.
-   Policies that create opportunities in long overlooked communities
    pay off with greater
    economic [benefits](https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/saving-the-heartland-place-based-policies-in-21st-century-america/).
-   Building resiliency within and across industries can protect our
    economy from economic shocks that can raise prices for consumers and
    reduce growth.
-   Creating competitive markets in critical industries makes room for
    new ideas and new businesses that can increase American
    competitiveness and help the economy grow.

**The President’s agenda is already powering a resurgence in American
manufacturing.**

Construction of manufacturing facilities in the U.S. has grown nearly
100 percent in two years. From increasing private investment in
semiconductors, electric vehicles, and clean energy to funding over
35,000 infrastructure projects to building a Made-in-America electric
vehicle charging network, Bidenomics is leading to new investments in
communities all across America.
