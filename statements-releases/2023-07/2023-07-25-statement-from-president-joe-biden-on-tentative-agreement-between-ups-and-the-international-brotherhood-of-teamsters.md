title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Tentative Agreement Between UPS and\
  \ the International Brotherhood of\_Teamsters"
---
 
I applaud the Teamsters and UPS for coming together, negotiating in good
faith, and reaching a tentative agreement today that will avoid a
shutdown at UPS. While this agreement still awaits final ratification by
Teamsters members, today’s announcement moves us closer to a better deal
for workers that will also add to our economic momentum. I’ve always
said that collective bargaining works by providing workers a seat at the
table and the opportunity to improve their lives while contributing
fully to their employer’s success. This agreement is a testament to the
power of employers and employees coming together to work out their
differences at the bargaining table in a manner that helps businesses
succeed while helping workers secure pay and benefits they can raise a
family on and retire with dignity and respect.
