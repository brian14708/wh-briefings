*President Biden Asks the Department of Labor to Issue First-Ever Hazard
Alert for Heat and Announces New Investments to Protect Communities*

Millions of Americans are currently experiencing the effects of extreme
heat, which is growing in intensity, frequency, and duration due to the
climate crisis.

Today, President Biden will convene Mayor Kate Gallego of Phoenix,
Arizona, and Mayor Ron Nirenberg of San Antonio, Texas, to hear from
them directly about how their communities are being impacted by extreme
heat and to discuss the steps the Biden-Harris Administration is taking
to protect communities like theirs. The President will also announce new
measures to protect workers and communities across the country from the
impacts of extreme heat.

-   **President Biden has asked the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue
    the first-ever Hazard Alert for heat, and DOL will also ramp up
    enforcement to protect workers from extreme heat.** For years, heat
    has been the number one cause of weather-related deaths in America.
    And workers, including farmworkers, farmers, firefighters, and
    construction workers, are disproportionately impacted by extreme
    heat. Since 2011, more than [400
    workers](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/36-work-related-deaths-due-to-environmental-heat-exposure-in-2021.htm)
    have died due to environmental heat exposure, and thousands more are
    hospitalized every year. The Hazard Alert will reaffirm that workers
    have heat-related protections under federal law. As part of the
    alert, the Department of Labor will provide information on what
    employers can and should be doing now to protect their workers, help
    ensure employees are aware of their rights, including protections
    against retaliation, and highlight the steps the Occupational Safety
    and Health Administration (OSHA) is currently taking to protect
    workers.

Additionally, the Department of Labor will ramp up enforcement of
heat-safety violations, increasing inspections in high-risk industries
like construction and agriculture, while OSHA continues to develop a
national standard for workplace heat-safety rules.

-   **The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is
    investing up to $7 million from President Biden’s Inflation
    Reduction Act to improve our nation’s weather forecasts.** In
    partnership with universities and other institutions, NOAA will
    establish a new Data Assimilation Consortium focused on developing
    better weather-prediction capabilities and maximizing the value
    provided by NOAA’s global observing system. These improved forecasts
    will allow communities to better prepare for extreme weather events,
    including long periods of extreme heat. As the climate crisis
    contributes to worsening extreme weather events affecting Americans
    nationwide, this investment will give Americans the information and
    tools they need to stay safe.

-   **The Department of the Interior is investing $152 million from
    President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand water
    storage and enhance climate resilience in California, Colorado, and
    Washington.** This investment will help increase water storage
    capacity and lay conveyance pipeline to deliver reliable and safe
    drinking water and build resiliency for communities most impacted by
    drought. In the wake of severe drought conditions throughout the
    West, the Administration is making [coordinated
    investments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/06/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-investments-to-protect-the-colorado-river-system/)
    through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction
    Act to modernize essential water infrastructure, invest in new water
    recycling and desalination projects and expand access to clean
    drinking water for communities that have long-dealt with
    contaminated water supplies.

Today’s announcements build on [numerous
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-action-to-protect-communities-from-extreme-heat-fueled-by-the-climate-crisis/)
that the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to bolster heat response
and resilience nationwide, including providing billions of dollars
through the Department of Housing and Urban Development to communities
to make buildings more energy efficient and to open cooling centers to
keep residents safe.

Since day one, President Biden has taken historic action to address the
climate crisis, which includes securing more than $50 billion through
his Investing in America agenda to help Americans in every single state
become more resilient to climate impacts like heat waves. The
Biden-Harris Administration has continued to deliver on the most
ambitious climate agenda in American history—an agenda that is lowering
energy costs for hardworking families, bolstering America’s energy
security, creating thousands of good-paying jobs, and strengthening
community-driven climate resilience across the country.

Meanwhile, many Republicans in Congress continue to deny the very
existence of climate change, peddle conspiracy theories, and remain
committed to repealing the President’s Inflation Reduction Act – the
biggest climate protection bill ever – which would undermine the health
and safety of their own constituents.
