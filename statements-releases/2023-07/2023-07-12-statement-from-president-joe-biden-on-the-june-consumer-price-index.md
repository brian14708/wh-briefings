Good jobs and lower costs: That’s Bidenomics in action. Today’s report
brings new and encouraging evidence that inflation is falling while our
economy remains strong. Annual inflation has fallen each of the last
twelve months and is now down to 3%. We’ve made this progress while
unemployment remains near record lows and a higher share of working age
Americans are in jobs now than in 20 years. Real wages for the average
American worker are now higher than they were before the pandemic, with
lower wage workers seeing the largest gains. Our progress creating jobs
while lowering costs for families is no accident, and I will continue to
fight for lower costs for families every day. I ran for office to grow
the economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down: that’s
exactly what we’re doing.
