Today, the White House Office of Public Engagement and National Economic
Council hosted the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc. (USBC) to discuss
Bidenomics, the President’s plan to grow the economy from the middle out
and the bottom up, including efforts to expand economic access and
opportunity for Black communities.  
  
During the meeting, President Biden stopped by for a surprise visit to
thank the group of over 80 leaders for their continued partnership. He
went on to highlight historic changes in the economic direction of our
country, including unprecedented job creation, the lowest Black
unemployment rate on record and the highest Black labor force
participation rate since August 2008.  
  
The President emphasized that, despite the progress being made, there is
still work to be done to ensure equitable growth and wealth creation for
communities of color.  
  
Biden-Harris Administration officials followed up by emphasizing the
Administration’s commitment to creating and promoting sustainable
economic growth and inclusive wealth building. They also provided
updates on efforts to advance access to capital, increase government
contracting for Black entrepreneurs and continue implementation of the
President’s equity policy agenda.
