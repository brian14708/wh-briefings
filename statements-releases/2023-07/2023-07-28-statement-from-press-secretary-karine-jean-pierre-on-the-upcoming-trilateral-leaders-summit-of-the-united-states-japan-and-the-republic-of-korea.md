President Joe Biden will host Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan and
President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea for a trilateral
leaders summit at Camp David on August 18, 2023.  At the summit, the
leaders will celebrate a new chapter in their trilateral relationship as
they reaffirm their strong bonds of friendship and the ironclad
alliances between the United States and Japan, and the United States and
the Republic of Korea.  The three leaders will discuss expanding
trilateral cooperation across the Indo-Pacific and beyond – including to
address the continued threat posed by the DPRK and to strengthen ties
with ASEAN and the Pacific Islands.  The summit will advance a shared
trilateral vision for addressing global and regional security
challenges, promoting a rules-based international order, and bolstering
economic prosperity.
