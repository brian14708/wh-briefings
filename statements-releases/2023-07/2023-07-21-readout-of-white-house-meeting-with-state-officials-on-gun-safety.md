title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Officials on Gun\_Safety"
---
 
Today, senior White House staff held a meeting with approximately 70
state legislators, governors’ office staff, and other state leaders to
discuss implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act’s
enhanced background checks for young people under age 21. Already, these
enhanced background checks have stopped hundreds of transfers of
firearms to the hands of individuals under age 21 who are prohibited
from purchasing firearms. Officials from the U.S. Department of Justice
explained how the enhanced background checks process works. To maximize
the benefits of this provision, the White House urged state leaders to
help implement the enhanced background checks by pursuing the following
three actions:

1.  Encourage state repositories of relevant juvenile mental health and
    criminal justice records to respond to enhanced background checks
    inquiries;
2.  Encourage local law enforcement to respond to enhanced background
    check inquiries; and
3.  Make changes, if needed, to state privacy laws to ensure those laws
    do not prohibit states from providing to the federal background
    check system information relevant to the enhanced background checks.

Meeting participants represented 33 states.

In the months ahead, the White House will continue to partner with state
leaders to implement enhanced background checks and advance other
life-saving strategies to reduce gun violence.
