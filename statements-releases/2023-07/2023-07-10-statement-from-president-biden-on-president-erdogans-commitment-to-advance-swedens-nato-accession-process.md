I welcome the statement issued by Türkiye, Sweden and the NATO Secretary
General this evening, including the commitment by President Erdoğan to
transmit the Accession Protocol for Sweden to Türkiye’s Grand National
Assembly for swift ratification.  I stand ready to work with
President Erdoğan and Türkiye on enhancing defense and deterrence in the
Euro-Atlantic area.  I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister
Kristersson and Sweden as our 32nd NATO Ally.  And I thank Secretary
General Stoltenberg for his steadfast leadership.
