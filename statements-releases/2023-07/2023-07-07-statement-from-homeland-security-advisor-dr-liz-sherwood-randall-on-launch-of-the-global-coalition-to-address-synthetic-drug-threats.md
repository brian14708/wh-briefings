title: "Statement from Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall on Launch\
  \ of the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug\_Threats"
---
 
Synthetic drugs like fentanyl are a deadly scourge to Americans and
others around the world.  President Biden has focused intensely on
combatting the opioid crisis, and today’s launch of a global coalition
to counter synthetic drug threats represents a historic step forward in
tackling this lethal threat to humanity.  
   
On March 24, 2023, President Biden announced a global effort to address
the threat of synthetic drugs, building on strong collaboration with
Mexico and Canada to address the fentanyl challenge in North America.   
   
Today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken followed through on the
President’s commitment by convening more than 70 countries and
international organizations to launch the Global Coalition and commit to
concrete actions. Through this unprecedented coalition that spans all
regions of the globe, we will coordinate and leverage our efforts to
prevent illicit drug manufacturing, identify emerging threats, interdict
drug trafficking, and reduce both the supply of and the demand for
deadly drugs. We are eager to work with so many coalition partners who
have committed to meeting this vital challenge posed by synthetic drugs
both at home and abroad.
