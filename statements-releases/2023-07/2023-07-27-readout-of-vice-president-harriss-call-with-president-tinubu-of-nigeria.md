---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with President Bola Tinubu of
Nigeria, the highest-level U.S. engagement with President Tinubu since
his May 2023 inauguration. The Vice President recognized Nigeria as a
leading global voice and Africa’s largest democracy and economy. The
Vice President and President Tinubu underscored their shared commitment
to defending democracy in West Africa and the Sahel and deep concern
about the attempted takeover in Niger. The Vice President strongly
condemned any efforts to seize power by force in Niger, and emphasized
that our substantial cooperation with the Government of Niger is
contingent on Niger’s continued commitment to democratic standards.

The Vice President expressed support for President Tinubu’s steps to
reform Nigeria’s economy, including ending the fuel subsidy and unifying
foreign currency exchange rates. Building on the investments announced
during the Vice President’s trip to Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia earlier
this year—including more than $8 billion in private sector commitments
and $1 billion in U.S. government commitments—the Vice President and
President Tinubu discussed how U.S. and Nigerian public and private
sectors can work together to increase private sector investment, digital
inclusion, women’s empowerment, and expand access to clean energy. The
Vice President underscored the U.S. government’s long-standing support
for Nigeria’s democracy and good governance, including governments’
responsibility to ensure that security services act to serve the people
they are mandated to protect. The Vice President highlighted the deep
ties between the United States and Nigeria, including people-to-people
connections and the Diaspora.
