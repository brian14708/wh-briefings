title: "Readout of the White\_House States Convening on Child\_Care"
---
 
Today, White House officials welcomed more than 90 state legislators
from 41 states across the country to support state actions to make child
care more affordable for working families, increase child care provider
supply, and improve job quality for child care workers. First Lady Jill
Biden, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Minnesota
Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan also attended the convening and
delivered remarks.  
   
This convening reaffirms the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to
child care and demonstrates the Administration’s willingness to use
every avenue available to drive the improvements necessary to lower
costs for families, build child care supply so families have more
options, and improve job quality for child care workers. The
Biden-Harris Administration has been focused on delivering for child
care workers since Day One. Through the investments provided by the
American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act, 225,000 child care providers were able
to stay open or re-open during the worst parts of the pandemic, enabling
them to serve as many as 10 million children. A third of providers
reported they would have closed permanently without those funds.  
   
Earlier this year, the President proposed a vision for early childhood
education that provides universal access to high-quality preschool and
enables working families to access affordable, high-quality child care.
Under the President’s budget, families making less than $200,000 would
be eligible for child care assistance and the average family would pay
no more than $10 a day for care. As Congress considers that proposal,
the President did not want to wait to take action on child care, which
is why he signed a historic [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-most-sweeping-set-of-executive-actions-to-improve-care-in-history/) in
April that directs nearly every cabinet-level agency to expand access to
affordable, high-quality care, and provide support for care workers and
family caregivers. This EO represents the most comprehensive set of
actions any President has taken to advance care.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration understands that the implementation of
high-quality child care depends on the states. In administering the
Child Care & Development Block Grant (CCDBG), states determine who is
eligible for child care assistance, how much parents will pay
out-of-pocket for care, and how much child providers are reimbursed.
Thanks to actions by the Biden-Harris Administration, states have even
more avenues to improve child care access, affordability, and quality.
An HHS notice of proposed rulemaking
(NPRM) [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/11/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-actions-to-lower-child-care-costs-and-support-child-care-providers/) by
Vice President Harris earlier this month would cap child care payments
for families served by CCDBG at 7% of a family’s income, and encourage
states to waive copayments for families at or below 150% of the federal
poverty level ($45,000 for a family of four).  
   
At the convening, state leaders shared successes from the past
legislative session and discussed next steps for further state action on
child care, such as serving more working families, lowering costs, and
supporting providers. Spurred by the historic actions the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken, states across the country have made
significant investments in child care as part of their budgets, expanded
income eligibility for child care subsidies, and increased provider
payment rates.  
   
As we work towards a system of early childhood education that better
supports all children, families, and child care providers, it is
important that we follow the example of states that have already shown
it is possible to transform these systems from the ground-up. Under
Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s leadership, New Mexico became one of
the first states to create a cabinet-level position for early childhood;
made child care free for families at or below 400% of the federal
poverty level – $120,000 for a family of four; compensated child care
providers for the actual cost of providing high-quality care; and passed
a constitutional amendment that provides robust funding for early
childhood in perpetuity.  
   
White House officials thanked the state legislators for their leadership
and dedication to this issue, and discussed steps the Biden-Harris
Administration is taking to support state action to improve child care
access, affordability, and quality.
