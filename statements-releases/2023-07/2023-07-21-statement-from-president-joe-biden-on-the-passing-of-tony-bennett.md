title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Tony\_Bennett"
---
 
For more than 70 years, Tony Bennett didn’t just sing the classics – he
himself was an American classic. Resisting the pull to adjust his style
to fit in with the times, his distinct voice gave melody and rhythm
about the good life, how the best is yet to come, the way you look
tonight, and leaving your heart in San Francisco.  
  
Starting out as a singing waiter in New York City, he became one of
America’s most beloved performers, selling tens of millions of records
and winning over generations of fans. He always found new audiences and
collaborators to enchant – the mark of a truly timeless artist.    
  
Along the way, he lived history. He helped liberate prisoners at a
subcamp of Dachau. He joined the 1965 civil rights march from Selma to
Montgomery. He performed for Nelson Mandela, John F. Kennedy, and Queen
Elizabeth II, and recorded music with everyone from the Count Basie
Orchestra to Lady Gaga.  Bob Hope gave him his stage name. Frank Sinatra
was his mentor. There’s no doubt about it – Tony Bennett’s life was
legendary. And his contributions to the arts in America will endure.    
  
Jill and I have been fans of Tony’s music for a long time – not only
because of his beautiful voice, but also the joy that he brought to
everything he did. We send our deepest condolences to his family and
fans around the world.
