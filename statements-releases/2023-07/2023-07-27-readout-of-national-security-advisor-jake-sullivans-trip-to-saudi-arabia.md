National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan traveled to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
on July 27, 2023 to meet with Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman and senior Saudi officials to discuss bilateral and regional
matters, including initiatives to advance a common vision for a more
peaceful, secure, prosperous, and stable Middle East region
interconnected with the world.  Mr. Sullivan also reviewed significant
progress to build on the benefits of the truce in Yemen that have
endured over the past 16 months and welcomed ongoing UN-led efforts to
bring the war to a close. Both delegations agreed to maintain regular
consultations and follow up on matters discussed throughout the day.
