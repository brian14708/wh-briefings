Today, President Biden announced that Shuwanza Goff will serve as
Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Legislative
Affairs.  
  
*Statement from President Biden:*  
  
“Since taking office, I have relied on Louisa Terrell’s wise counsel and
tireless engagement with our nation’s legislators, and she has delivered
for the American people. I am pleased to announce that Shuwanza Goff, a
Day 1 member of my team, will serve as my new Director of Legislative
Affairs and help finish the job.  
  
“Shuwanza is a proven leader and trusted voice on both sides of the
aisle. She returns to the White House with strong relationships across
both Chambers, forged over more than a decade on Capitol Hill.  
  
“As my Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs, Shuwanza helped pass
monumental pieces of legislation through Congress: from the American
Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, to the Chips and
Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.  
  
“Shuwanza’s close partnership with my decades-long friends in the House
and Senate, and her expertise, instincts and deep respect for the United
States Congress will continue to serve our Administration and the
American people well.”  
  
Goff will be the first African-American woman to serve as White House
Director of Legislative Affairs.
