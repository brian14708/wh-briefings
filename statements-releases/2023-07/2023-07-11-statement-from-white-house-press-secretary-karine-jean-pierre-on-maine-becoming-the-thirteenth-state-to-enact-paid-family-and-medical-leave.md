title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Maine Becoming\
  \ the Thirteenth State to Enact Paid Family and Medical\_Leave"
---
 
Today, Maine has become the thirteenth state, along with the District of
Columbia, to pass paid family and medical leave legislation. President
Biden commends the leadership of Governor Janet Mills, Speaker of the
House Rachel Talbot Ross, Senate President Troy Jackson, legislative
sponsors, and state and community leaders who made this historic
achievement possible.

Paid family and medical leave improves the lives of working families and
strengthens our workforce and economy. The Biden-Harris Administration
has worked to make the Federal government a model by supporting Federal
employees in accessing the leave theyÂ need and continues to call for a
national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program. We
applaud states like Maine that are making progress on this critical
issue.
