  \ Housing to Lower Costs for\_Renters"

*Major rental housing platforms and several states join the President’s
effort to crack down on rental housing junk fees for consumers and
increase transparency*

Today, President Biden is announcing a new front in his crackdown on
junk fees: rental housing. From repeated rental application fees to
surprise “convenience fees,” millions of families incur burdensome costs
in the rental application process and throughout the duration of their
lease. These fees are often more than the actual cost of providing the
service, or are added onto rents to cover services that renters assume
are included—or that they don’t even want.  
  
Rental housing fees can be a serious burden on renters. Rental
application fees can be up to $100 or more per application, and,
importantly, they often exceed the actual cost of conducting the
background and credit checks. Given that prospective renters often apply
for multiple units over the course of their housing search, these
application fees can add up to hundreds of dollars. Even after renters
secure housing, they are often surprised to be charged mandatory fees on
top of their rent, including “convenience fees” to pay rent online, fees
for things like mail sorting and trash collection, and even so-called
“[January
fees](https://www.nclc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/JunkFees-Rpt.pdf)”
charged for no clear reason at the beginning of a new calendar year.
Hidden fees not only take money out of people’s pockets, they also make
it more difficult to [comparison

A prospective renter may choose one apartment over another thinking it
is less expensive, only to learn that after fees and other add-ons the
actual cost for their chosen apartment is much higher than they expected
or can afford.  
  
Today, the President will outline several new, concrete steps in the
Administration’s effort to crack down on rental junk fees and lower
costs for renters, including:

-   New commitments from major rental housing platforms—**Zillow,
    Apartments.com, and AffordableHousing.com**—who have answered the
    President’s call for transparency and will provide consumers with
    total, upfront cost information on rental properties, which can be
    hundreds of dollars on top of the advertised rent;  
-   **New research from the Department of Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD),** which provides a blueprint for a nationwide effort to
    address rental housing junk fees; and  
-   **Legislative action in states across the country**—**from
    Connecticut to California**—who are joining the Administration in
    its effort to crack down on rental housing fees and protect
    consumers.

These announcements build on the President’s effort to tackle junk fees
across industries. President Biden has repeatedly called on [federal
agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/26/readout-of-the-third-meeting-of-the-white-house-competition-council/),
[Congress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-highlights-new-progress-on-his-competition-agenda/),
and [private
companies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/15/president-biden-recognizes-actions-by-private-sector-ticketing-and-travel-companies-to-eliminate-hidden-junk-fees-and-provide-millions-of-customers-with-transparent-pricing/)
to take action to address junk fees across the economy, and ensure
Americans are provided with honest, transparent pricing. These hidden
fees increase the costs consumers pay: studies have found that consumers
pay upward of 20 percent extra when the actual price of the product or
service is not disclosed upfront. Providing consumers with the full
price they can expect to pay creates competition among providers to
lower costs, without relying on hidden fees. Earlier this year HUD
Secretary Marcia Fudge released an [open
letter](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/Junk_Fees_Memo_SOHUD_signed.pdf) to
housing providers and state and local governments to encourage them to
adopt policies that promote greater fairness and transparency of fees
specifically faced by renters.

*Today’s actions include:*  
  
**<u>Commitments by rental housing platforms to show total costs up
front</u>**. Each month, tens of millions of customers search online to
find their next apartment or house. Today, major rental housing
platforms are answering President Biden’s call for pricing transparency
and announcing new steps to provide consumers with up-front information
about fees in rental housing, building on recent actions by private
sector leaders in other sectors, including
[airlines](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard)
and [event

By providing the true costs of rent, people can make an informed
decision about where to live and not be surprised by additional costs
that push them over budget.  
  
These companies are making the following announcements:

-   **Zillow** is today launching a Cost of Renting Summary on its
    active apartment listings, empowering the 28 million unique monthly
    users on its rental platform with clear information on the cost of
    renting. This new tool will enable renters to easily find out the
    total cost of renting an apartment from the outset, including all
    monthly costs and one-time costs, like security deposits and
    application fees.
-   **Apartments.com** is announcing that this year it will launch a new
    calculator on its platform that will help renters determine the
    all-in price of a desired unit. This will include all up-front costs
    as well as recurring monthly rents and fees. The Apartments.com
    Network currently lists almost 1.5 million active availabilities
    across more than 385,000 properties.
-   **AffordableHousing.com**, the nation’s largest online platform
    dedicated solely to affordable housing, will require owners to
    disclose all refundable and non-refundable fees and charges upfront
    in their listings. It will launch a new “Trusted Owner” badge that
    protects renters from being charged junk fees by identifying owners
    who have a history of adhering to best practices, including
    commitment to reasonable fee limits, no junk fees, and full fee
    disclosure.

**<u>New research on policy innovation to address rental fees</u>**.
Today, HUD is releasing a new [research
brief](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/policy-and-practice-publication-2023-july.pdf)
that provides an overview of the research on rental fees and highlights
state, local, and private sector strategies to encourage transparency
and fairness in the rental market, including capping or eliminating
rental application fees; allowing prospective renters to provide their
own screening reports; allowing a single application fee to cover
multiple applications; and clearly identifying bottom-line amounts that
tenants will pay for move-in and monthly rent. The brief provides a
blueprint for how everyone from local government to landlords can do
better for renters.  
  
**<u>Recent state actions to address the hidden and unfair fees.</u>**
In March, the White House [convened hundreds of state legislative
leaders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/08/readout-of-white-house-state-legislative-convening-on-combatting-junk-fees/),
and released a resource entitled, “[Guide for States: Cracking Down on
Junk Fees to Lower Costs for
Consumers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WH-Junk-Fees-Guide-for-States.pdf).”
Since the President drew attention to the pervasive issue of junk fees
throughout the economy, a number of states have already gotten to work
to crack down on rental housing fees, including:

-   Colorado. Enacted House Bill 1099, which allows prospective renters
    to reuse a rental application for up to 30 days without paying
    additional fees; and House Bill 1095, which limits fees to tenants
    when landlords fail to provide a nonrenewal notice that disguise
    fees as “rent,” and limits the amount a landlord can mark up a
    tenant for third-party services.  
-   Rhode Island. Enacted House Bill 6087 to limit rental application
    fees beyond the actual cost of obtaining a background check or
    credit report, if the prospective tenant does not provide their own
    report.  
-   Minnesota. Enacted Senate File 2909, which includes a requirement
    for landlords to clearly display the total monthly payment and all
    nonoptional fees on the first page of the lease agreement and in all
    advertisements.  
-   Connecticut. Enacted Senate Bill 998 to prohibit a landlord from
    requiring a fee for processing, reviewing, or accepting a rental
    application, and set a cap of $50 on the amount that can be charged
    for tenant screening reports. The law also prohibits move-in and
    move-out fees, and certain fee-related lease provisions, including
    certain late fees related to utility payments.  
-   Maine. Enacted Legislative Document 691 to prohibit a landlord from
    charging a fee to submit a rental application that exceeds the
    actual cost of a background check, a credit check, or another
    screening process. The law also prohibits a landlord from charging
    more than one screening fee in any 12-month period.   
-   Montana. Senate passed Senate Bill 320 to require landlords to
    refund application fees to unsuccessful rental applicants except any
    portion of the fee used to cover costs related to reviewing the
    application, including conducting a background check. Landlords may
    only charge candidates for the actual cost of obtaining a background
    check or credit report.  
-   California. Senate passed Senate Bill 611 to require the mandatory
    disclosure of monthly rent rates, including disclosure of a range of
    payments, fees, deposits, or charges, and to prohibit certain fees
    from being charged.

Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the
Federal Trade Commission, both independent agencies, [requested
information](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/ftc-cfpb-seek-public-comment-how-background-screening-may-shut-renters-out-housing)
on tenant screening processes, including how landlords and property
managers set application and screening fees, which will help inform
enforcement and policy actions under each agency’s jurisdiction. The
CFPB has noted that background checks too often include inaccurate or
misleading information and risk scores that lack independent validation
of their reliability.  
  
Today’s announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing
efforts to support renters, including through the release of a
first-of-its-kind [Blueprint for a Renters Bill of
Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-House-Blueprint-for-a-Renters-Bill-of-Rights-1.pdf)
and a [Housing Supply Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/),
focused on boosting the supply of affordable housing—including rental
housing. Reducing housing costs is central to Bidenomics, and recent
data show that inflation in rental housing is abating. Moreover, experts
predict that roughly 1 million new apartments will be built this year,
increasing supply that will further increase affordability. The actions
announced today will help renters understand these fees and the full
price they can expect to pay, and create additional competition housing
providers to reduce reliance on hidden fees.  
  
In the coming months, the Biden-Harris Administration will work with
Congress, state leaders, and the private sector to address rental junk
fees and build a fairer rental housing market. On July 26, the Senate
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs will host its
first-ever hearing on junk fees, including in the rental housing
market.
