title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Louisa\_Terrell"
---
 
As a U.S. Senator for 36 years, I developed a deep respect and reverence
for the United States Congress and its vital institutional role in our
democracy. When I was elected President, I knew that no one understood
that better – or would be a better partner to my decades-long friends
and former colleagues – than Louisa Terrell.  
  
That’s because, for years – as a Senator, as Vice President, as
President, and every moment in between – I have relied on Louisa for her
wise counsel and her skill. I have relied upon her to reflect my values.
And I have relied upon her to deliver for the American people. Every
step of the way, that’s exactly what she has done.  
  
Over the past two and a half years, Louisa has been instrumental in the
historic, monumental, and life-changing legislation we have delivered to
the American people. From the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation
Reduction Act to the CHIPS and Science bill, the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and the
bipartisan budget agreement – Louisa’s steady hand and perseverance have
consistently helped get key priorities over the finish line.  Her work
to secure the confirmation of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to the
Supreme Court, along with a historic number of diverse judges and
appointees across the United States Government, has significantly
furthered our work to build an Administration and judicial benches at
every level that look more like America.   
  
Perhaps most importantly, Louisa has been an extraordinary leader and an
empowering mentor to countless staff, and I know that nothing gives her
more pride than the team she has capably managed and led.  
  
Jill and I extend our deepest gratitude to Louisa for her years of
service to the American people, and also to her family, for sharing her
with us.
