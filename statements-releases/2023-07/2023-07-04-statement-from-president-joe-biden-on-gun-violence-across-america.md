title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Gun Violence Across\_America"
---
 
Over the last few days, our nation has once again endured a wave of
tragic and senseless shootings in communities across America — from
Philadelphia to Fort Worth, Baltimore to Lansing, Wichita to Chicago.
Today, Jill and I grieve for those who have lost their lives and, as our
nation celebrates Independence Day, we pray for the day when our
communities will be free from gun violence.   
   
Today also marks one year since a shooter armed with
an AR-15-style weapon fired upon a crowd of Americans gathered for an
Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois. In mere moments,
this day of patriotic pride became a scene of pain and tragedy.   
   
In the year since, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Highland Park Mayor
Nancy Rotering, legislative leaders, and numerous advocates, and gun
violence survivors have fought tirelessly to turn the pain of Highland
Park and other acts of gun violence into meaningful action on behalf of
all Illinoisans. This past January, they succeeded in banning assault
weapons – like the one used in Highland Park – as well as high-capacity
magazines across Illinois.   
   
Their achievement will save lives. But it will not erase their grief. It
will not bring back the seven Americans killed in Highland Park or heal
the injuries and trauma that scores of others will continue to carry.
And as we have seen over the last few days, much more must be done in
Illinois and across America to address the epidemic of gun violence that
is tearing our communities apart.   
   
It is within our power to once again ban assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines, to require safe storage of guns, to end gun
manufacturers’ immunity from liability, and to enact universal
background checks. I urge other states to follow Illinois’ lead, and
continue to call upon Republican lawmakers in Congress to come to the
table on meaningful, commonsense reforms that the American people
support.
