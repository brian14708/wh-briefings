On July 24, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and senior Government
of Mexico officials hosted a U.S. delegation led by Homeland Security
Advisor Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Deputy Attorney General Lisa O.
Monaco, Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Kristie Canegallo,
and Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Rich Verma to
further the significant cooperation that our countries already have
undertaken, including on the global fight against illicit fentanyl and
dual-use chemical substances, combatting arms trafficking, managing
migration, and modernizing our shared border. This meeting built on
previous high-level meetings led by Dr. Sherwood-Randall and Security
Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez.  
   
The leaders discussed our commitment to continuing joint efforts under
the U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and
Safe Communities to combat drug traffickers, disrupt the supply of the
chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl, prevent trafficking of these
deadly narcotics across our shared border, and promote public health
services to reduce harm and demand and increase treatment services. Our
countries also recognize that discovering, disrupting, and dismantling
firearms trafficking networks is critical to our shared efforts to
combat illicit fentanyl, and we remain committed to addressing firearms
trafficking that contributes to violence and destruction on both sides
of our shared border.  
   
The leaders also discussed the challenges and progress in cooperation
regarding regional migration and committed to continue to forge a
region-wide response, guided by the principles in the Los Angeles
Declaration on Migration and Protection. To that end,the United States
and Mexico committed to further expand the availability of legal
pathways throughout the region, including to Mexico and the United
States. Leaders also discussed expanding our joint development work in
Central America, and maintaining strong consequences for irregular entry
at our shared border.  
   
Finally, the United States and Mexico committed to furthering ongoing
work to modernize and advance infrastructure projects that support our
border communities and benefits both nations and strengthens our
bilateral relationship and security.
