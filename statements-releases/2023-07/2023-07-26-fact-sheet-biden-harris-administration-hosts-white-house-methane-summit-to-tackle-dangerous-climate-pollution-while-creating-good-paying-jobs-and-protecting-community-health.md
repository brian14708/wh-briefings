*New Cabinet-level White House Methane Task Force will strengthen
interagency and multi-stakeholder action to dramatically reduce methane
emissions.*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will convene the first ever
**White House Methane Summit** around the urgent need to dramatically
reduce methane emissions, especially from leaks in the oil and gas
sector, as a way to protect public health, create good-paying jobs, save
consumers money, and advance President Biden’s ambitious climate agenda.
The President’s Investing in America agenda is accelerating adoption of
technologies and tools to address methane emissions and helping the U.S.
unlock a win-win opportunity for communities and the economy. **Just
this week,** [**new
analysis**](https://www.bluegreenalliance.org/work-issue/methane-mitigation/)
**from the Blue Green Alliance found that full adoption of the
Biden-Harris Administration’s proposed leak-reducing actions will create
10,000 net direct and indirect jobs each year, in sectors like
manufacturing, construction, and operations and maintenance.  
**  
Methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is 80 times more potent than carbon
dioxide and can lead to serious public health impacts, from asthma to
cancer to premature deaths. Methane is responsible for one-third of the
warming impacts millions of Americans are experiencing right now – from
record heat waves to smoke-filled skies to flash flooding and more
intense hurricanes. Methane leaks amount to billions of dollars’ of
wasted natural gas every year. In the United States, 30 percent of
methane emissions come from the oil and gas sector, which increasingly
has tools to slash leaks.  
  
Today’s White House Methane Summit will focus on these significant
opportunities:

-   **Establishing a New Cabinet-level Methane Task Force:** The
    Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a new Cabinet-level
    Methane Task Force, which will advance a whole-of-government
    approach to proactive methane leak detection and data transparency,
    and support state and local efforts to mitigate and enforce methane
    emissions regulations. The Task Force will accelerate execution of
    the [U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/US-Methane-Emissions-Reduction-Action-Plan-Update.pdf),
    building on over 80 Administration actions taken to date under the
    Plan.  
-   **Detecting Emissions Using Innovative Technology:** Identifying
    methane emissions at their source is a critical first step to
    tackling climate and health impacts and setting and enforcing robust
    rules of the road, which is why the Administration is focused on
    deploying innovative methane monitoring technologies.  
-   **Taking Common-Sense Actions to Mitigate Methane Emissions:**
    President Biden’s historic investments in methane emissions
    mitigation – from plugging orphaned wells to inspecting thousands of
    miles of pipelines – can prevent major emission leaks before they
    ever occur, all while creating good paying jobs.  
-   **Responding to Emissions Events:** In 2022, [satellites detected
    more than 500 super-emitting
    events](https://www.iea.org/news/methane-emissions-remained-stubbornly-high-in-2022-even-as-soaring-energy-prices-made-actions-to-reduce-them-cheaper-than-ever)
    at oil and gas operations around the world. By building a diverse
    coalition, including States and Tribal governments, to rapidly
    respond to emissions events and hold polluters accountable,
    stakeholders can better harness new tools and technologies to be
    more ready to act quickly, protect public health, and prevent future
    events.  
-   **Leading International Efforts on Methane Management:** The
    Biden-Harris Administration is leveraging domestic action to raise
    global ambition and coordinating international efforts to mitigate
    methane emissions.

step to tackling climate and health impacts and setting and enforcing
robust rules of the road, which is why the Administration is
prioritizing the full use of the latest and most innovative technologies
and tools available today.

-   **Deploying cutting edge technology to make the invisible seen:**
    Federal agencies are deploying next generation tools to help
    identify and quantify methane emissions. Through the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) EMIT instrument on the
    International Space Station, hundreds of methane super-emitter
    events associated with oil and gas infrastructure were identified
    over the last year. These findings were released publicly via the
    [EMIT open data
    portal](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/data/data-portal/coverage-and-forecasts/),
    which is updated daily. Additionally, to ensure detection in urban
    areas, the Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards
    and Technology’s (NIST) Urban GHG Measurement Testbed System
    measures and makes public methane and carbon dioxide concentrations
    in the three urban areas of Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and
    Washington/Baltimore. This summer, the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Atmospheric Emissions and
    Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Area and Coastal Urban
    Plume Dynamics Study programs are measuring methane leaks in urban
    natural gas infrastructure in New York City. Data will be made
    public within the next year.  
-   **Developing data products to improve public understanding of
    methane emissions**: NASA, EPA, NIST and NOAA are developing the
    U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center – an open-access portal that will provide
    policymakers and the public with a comprehensive collection of GHG
    datasets and visualizations. Additionally in January 2023, NOAA and
    NIST launched the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollutants Emissions System
    (GRAAPES) with the long-term goal to measure and model greenhouse
    gas emissions, including methane emissions from the oil and gas
    sector. GRAAPES will launch a mobile laboratory to conduct urban and
    other emissions measurements relevant to oil and gas, conduct
    flights over Utah’s oil and gas producing Uintah Basin and
    Colorado’s Denver-Julesburg Basin, collect data taken by NOAA’s
    satellite instruments for methane source attribution over oil and
    gas fields, and acquire additional remotely-sensed data from leading
    methane plume detection technologies from Gulf of Mexico oil and gas
    platforms.    
      
    **<u>Taking Common-Sense Actions to Mitigate Methane Emissions  
    </u>**  
    President Biden’s historic investments in methane emissions
    mitigation – from plugging orphaned wells to inspecting thousands of
    miles of pipelines – can prevent major emission leaks before they
    ever occur, all while creating good paying jobs.  
-   **Plugging orphaned wells on Federal, state, and private lands to
    protect public health and create good jobs:** Many of the United
    States’ thousands of orphaned oil and gas wells are located in rural
    communities, environmental justice communities, and communities of
    color that have suffered from years of divestment. President Biden’s
    Investing in America agenda through The Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law has invested a historic $4.7 billion for well-plugging to not
    only reduce methane emissions and stop dangerous pollution, but also
    create good-paying, union jobs and spur economic revitalization. To
    date, the Department of Interior has made $1.3 billion of this
    funding available to plug, remediate, and reclaim orphaned wells on
    Federal, Tribal, state, and private lands, and has awarded nearly
    [$660 million in
    grants](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-invests-660-million-states-plug-orphaned-oil-and-gas-wells)
    under the program. This has enabled roughly 3,000 orphaned wells to
    be plugged, with thousands more expected through already-announced
    funding. The funding obligated in FY 2022 alone is expected to
    create and save 7,250 direct and indirect jobs nationwide. The 26
    states eligible for this funding collectively represent nearly every
    state with documented orphan wells in the country. To qualify for
    formula funding, states are required to measure methane emissions
    from orphan wells.  
-   **Improving leak detection and repair to prevent emissions events
    before they start:** Last year PHMSA inspected all federally
    regulated pipelines, liquefied natural gas, and underground natural
    gas storage facility operators—the first time every operator has
    been inspected in a calendar year—to ensure compliance with
    statutorily mandated methane emissions reduction requirements. In
    April 2023, [PHMSA
    awarded](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-funding-37-projects-improve-safety-fix-old)
    37 entities nearly $196 million of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    grant funds to repair, replace, or rehabilitate nearly 270 miles of
    leak-prone natural gas pipe, reducing methane emissions by an
    estimated 212 metric tons, annually, and significantly reducing
    safety risks. These projects are projected to create hundreds of
    jobs in rural and urban communities.  
-   **Updating decades-old federal leak detection and repair
    standards:** Creating strong compliance standards is a win-win for
    the public and for the oil and gas sector. [In May
    2023](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/usdot-announces-bipartisan-pipes-act-proposal-modernize-decades-old-pipeline-leak-detection),
    PHMSA proposed a rule that directly addresses methane leaks and
    intentional venting on more than 2.7 million miles of gas
    transmission, distribution, and gathering pipelines; 400+
    underground natural gas storage facilities; and 165 liquefied
    natural gas facilities. The proposal, if finalized, will generate $2
    billion in public benefits and update decades-old federal leak
    detection and repair standards that rely solely on human and animal
    senses in favor of new requirements that rely on commercially
    available technologies to find and fix methane leaks. Additionally,
    PHMSA is in the process of enhancing safety requirements for gas
    distribution pipelines, through a rulemaking that will implement the
    Leonel Rondon Pipeline Safety Act that Congress enacted as part of
    the bipartisan Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and
    Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020. The proposed rule is currently
    under interagency review and targeted for release in August.  
-   **Funding emissions management and technical assistance:** Earlier
    this week, EPA and DOE released a [notice of
    intent](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/us-environmental-protection-agency-and-us-department-energy-announce-intent-fund)
    to make up to $350 million available for states to help industry
    voluntarily identify and permanently reduce methane emissions from
    low-producing conventional wells. EPA and DOE will also partner to
    offer technical assistance to help companies monitor and reduce
    methane emissions from leaks and daily operations, thereby helping
    reduce inefficiencies of U.S. oil and gas operations, create new
    jobs in energy communities, and realize near-term emission
    reductions. These funding opportunities are made possible by the
    Inflation Reduction Act which has provided $1.55 billion for the
    Methane Emissions Reduction Program.  
-   **Conducting research and developing future mitigation solutions:**
    DOE’s Methane Mitigation Technologies Program supports applied
    research related to methane emissions detection, quantification, and
    remediation in the oil and gas sector, including $47 million [in
    recent
    awards](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-invests-47-million-reduce-methane-emissions-oil-and-gas-sector)
    to 22 research projects. Funds will be used to develop technologies
    such as advanced materials, advanced sensors, inspection and repair
    technologies, and improved mechanical components. The Program is
    currently working with academia and industry partners on developing
    cost-effective, energy efficient technology solutions to eliminate
    flaring from oil and natural gas production operations.  
      
    **<u>Responding to Emissions Events  
    </u>**  
    In 2022, [satellites detected more than 500 super-emitting
    events](https://www.iea.org/news/methane-emissions-remained-stubbornly-high-in-2022-even-as-soaring-energy-prices-made-actions-to-reduce-them-cheaper-than-ever)
    at oil and gas operations around the world. By building a diverse
    coalition, including States and Tribal governments, to rapidly
    respond to emissions events and hold polluters accountable,
    stakeholders can better harness new tools and technologies to be
    more ready to act quickly, protect public health, and prevent future
    events.  
-   **Updating facility emissions reporting requirements, including for
    “super-emitter” events:** EPA issued an Inflation Reduction
    Act-directed [notice of proposed
    rulemaking](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-updates-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reporting-requirements-oil-and-gas)
    in July that would expand its GHG Reporting Program, requiring oil
    and natural gas facilities to report large emission events including
    “super-emitter” events and providing a new pathway for using
    advanced monitoring technologies for emissions quantification of
    these events.  
-   **Utilizing advanced monitoring technologies to detect
    “super-emitter” events:** EPA is developing a final rule for release
    by end of year to limit methane emissions from new and existing oil
    and natural gas facilities. This will build on the [November 2021
    proposed
    rule](https://www.epa.gov/controlling-air-pollution-oil-and-natural-gas-industry/epa-proposes-new-source-performance)
    and its [2022
    supplement](https://www.epa.gov/controlling-air-pollution-oil-and-natural-gas-industry/epa-issues-supplemental-proposal-reduce),
    which proposed to incentivize early implementation of innovative
    methane reduction technologies for the oil and gas sector. The rule,
    if finalized as proposed, would require routine monitoring of all
    oil and gas sites, strengthen limitations on flaring, and establish
    a Super Emitter Response Program, enabling approved entities to
    report “super emitter” events for follow-up investigation and
    remediation.  
-   **Strengthening enforcement through interagency collaboration:**
    Last week, the Department of Justice held its first meeting of the
    Methane Enforcement Interagency Working Group (IWG) which –
    coordinating as appropriate with the White House Methane Task Force
    – seeks to integrate new datasets and the latest technologies into
    enforcement activities related to the venting, flaring, leaking, and
    catastrophic releases of methane. Member agencies will identify
    complementary methane management authorities, share information and
    training of inspectors, and seek to coordinate responses to large
    emissions events. The IWG’s initial area of focus will be on the oil
    and gas sector.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Leading International Efforts
on Methane Management  
</span>**  
At the U.S.-led Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate in September
2021, the President and the European Union announced the Global Methane
Pledge: a global partnership to collectively cut emissions of methane by
30% compared with 2020 levels by 2030. President Biden has helped rally
150 countries to join the initiative, which now covers nearly half of
all methane emissions and 70% of global GDP. If participants meet their
goals, the pledge could eliminate over 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming by
2050.

-   **Accelerating progress to deliver on the Global Methane Pledge**:
    Complementing bold action at home, the United States is
    collaborating with global partners to deliver on the Global Methane
    Pledge with action in the energy, food and agriculture and waste
    sectors, as well as a [$200 million dollar Methane Finance
    Sprint](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/21/chairs-summary-of-the-major-economies-forum-on-energy-and-climate-held-by-president-joe-biden-2/),
    major progress on national methane policies, and a Methane Alert and
    Response System to leverage data for methane action.  
-   **Verifying emissions throughout the global supply chain:** DOE
    leads an international working group to advance a framework for the
    measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) of
    greenhouse gas emissions from the natural gas supply chain. The MMRV
    framework focuses on establishing minimum criteria, independent
    verification, and transparency to the multitude of voluntary
    industry, NGO, and international government initiatives directed at
    quantifying emissions throughout the natural gas supply chain.
