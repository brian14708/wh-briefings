title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Action to Promote Access\
  \ to Behavioral Health Care for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander\_\
  Communities"
---
 
Last week, the Biden-Harris Administration hosted its inaugural mental
health summit focused on improving equity and access to behavioral
health care for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
(AA and NHPI) communities. The White House Initiative on Asian
Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (WHIAANHPI) and the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) hosted this historic
event in recognition of National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month,
building on the Administration’s unprecedented investments to connect
more Americans to care.  
  
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising anti-Asian hate, and the
twin public health and public safety epidemic of gun violence, AA and
NHPI communities have been deeply impacted by the nation’s mental health
crisis. And the task of expanding access to quality and culturally
competent medical, including mental health services for AA and NHPI
individuals has only grown more urgent. In
2020, [suicide](https://wisqars.cdc.gov/data/lcd/home?lcd=eyJjYXVzZXMiOlsiQUxMIl0sInN0YXRlcyI6WyIwMSIsIjAyIiwiMDQiLCIwNSIsIjA2IiwiMDgiLCIwOSIsIjEwIiwiMTEiLCIxMiIsIjEzIiwiMTUiLCIxNiIsIjE3IiwiMTgiLCIxOSIsIjIwIiwiMjEiLCIyMiIsIjIzIiwiMjQiLCIyNSIsIjI2IiwiMjciLCIyOCIsIjI5IiwiMzAiLCIzMSIsIjMyIiwiMzMiLCIzNCIsIjM1IiwiMzYiLCIzNyIsIjM4IiwiMzkiLCI0MCIsIjQxIiwiNDIiLCI0NCIsIjQ1IiwiNDYiLCI0NyIsIjQ4IiwiNDkiLCI1MCIsIjUxIiwiNTMiLCI1NCIsIjU1IiwiNTYiXSwicmFjZSI6WyI0Il0sImV0aG5pY2l0eSI6WyIxIl0sInNleCI6WyIxIiwiMiJdLCJmcm9tWWVhciI6WyIyMDIwIl0sInRvWWVhciI6WyIyMDIwIl0sIm51bWJlcl9vZl9jYXVzZXMiOlsiMTAiXSwiYWdlX2dyb3VwX2Zvcm1hdHRpbmciOlsibGNkMmFnZSJdLCJjdXN0b21BZ2VzTWluIjpbIjAiXSwiY3VzdG9tQWdlc01heCI6WyIxOTkiXSwieXBsbGFnZXMiOlsiNjUiXX0%3D) was
the leading cause of death among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,
ages 10 to 19, and the second leading cause of death among those ages
20-34. And AA and NHPIs currently face unique barriers to behavioral
health care, including:

-   [Language
    barriers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6628721/),
    which can make it difficult for AA and NHPIs to access behavioral
    health services;
-   [Stigmatization and negative cultural conceptualizations of
    behavioral
    health](https://www.samhsa.gov/blog/destigmatizing-mental-health-asian-american-pacific-islander-communities) within
    AA and NHPI communities, which can reduce help-seeking;
-   A perceived [lower need of mental health
    care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3526835/) among
    AA and NHPIs compared to other racial and ethnic groups;
-   A shortage of [clinicians with diverse racial/ethnic
    backgrounds](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/53480/cdc_53480_DS1.pdf?);
    and
-   The lack of [culturally competent
    providers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6571328/) to
    meet cultural, social, and language-related needs

Through the President’s [Mental Health
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-strategy-to-address-our-national-mental-health-crisis-as-part-of-unity-agenda-in-his-first-state-of-the-union/) and [other
initiatives](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-tackle-nations-mental-health-crisis/),
the Biden-Harris Administration is leading a whole-of-society approach
to transform behavioral health services and bolster support,
particularly for underserved communities, including AA and NHPI
communities. Over the past two years, federal agencies have worked to
eliminate barriers to care; expand the full continuum of prevention,
treatment, and recovery services; and prioritize integration of these
services into settings where they can be more easily accessed.

**Funding Programs to Advance Behavioral Health Equity**

-   In September 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS), through Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration
    (SAMHSA), [awarded](https://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/press-announcements/20220909/hhs-awards-hawaii-state-department-of-health-to-develop-center-of-excellence) a
    5-year grant for $700,000 per year to the Hawaii State Department of
    Health to establish [the first ever **Asian American, Native
    Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Behavioral Health Center of
    Excellence (AANHPI-CoE**](https://www.samhsa.gov/aanhpi-coe)**)** to
    advance behavioral health equity for AA and NHPI communities. The
    purpose of the COE is to develop and disseminate
    culturally-informed, evidence-based behavioral health information
    and to provide technical assistance and training on issues related
    to addressing behavioral health disparities in AA, NH, and PI
    communities, include addressing mental health impacts caused by
    unconscious bias and hate against AA and NHPI communities. The COE
    serves as a resource to behavioral healthcare providers,
    community-based and faith-based organizations, research
    institutions, and federal entities. SAMHSA expects this program will
    help reduce the impact of behavioral health-related disparities on
    AA, NH, and PI communities.
-   HHS/SAMHSA also funds the [**National Network to Eliminate
    Disparities in Behavioral Health**](https://nned.net/)** (NNED)**, a
    network of more than 1,500 community-based organizations serving
    underserved communities across the U.S., including AA and NHPI
    populations, focused on the mental health and substance use issues
    facing diverse racial and ethnic communities. Organizations can
    contact the NNED to request information, training, and technical
    assistance to promote behavioral health equity.
-   HHS’s Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Family
    Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) Program awarded $1
    million in September 2022, through a cooperative agreement to
    Pouhana O Na Wahine, to serve as FVPSA’s national technical
    assistance provider for the Native Hawaiian communities and to
    establish the first ever [**Native Hawaiian Resource Center on
    Domestic Violence
    (NHRCDV).**](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofvps/news/ofvps/news/fvspa-funds-new-native-hawaiian-resource-center-domestic-violence) The
    historic center will provide culturally informed support and care
    specific to Native Hawaiians, offering a comprehensive array of
    statewide community education, training, and technical assistance
    resources to organizations and providers of services to Native
    Hawaiians, specifically designed to enhance the capacity of
    organizations and providers to respond to family violence, domestic
    violence, and dating violence in a culturally sensitive and relevant
    manner.
-   HHS’s Administration for Community Living (ACL) funds the **National
    Asian Pacific Center on Aging (NAPCA) **as part of the Older Adults
    Equity Collaborative. NAPCA launched a National COVID-19 Vaccine
    Resource Map, including in-language support for scheduling
    vaccination appointments and in December 2021, called upon the
    nation’s leaders to meet the emerging needs of AA and NHPI
    caregivers. 
-   HHS’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
    an [**Office of Island
    Affairs**](https://www.cdc.gov/islandaffairs/factsheet.html)** (OIA)** that
    strengthens public health systems to improve public health outcomes
    for the U.S. territories and freely associated states by
    facilitating technical assistance, training, information, funding,
    and technology transfer. OIA works closely with the five territories
    (American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam,
    Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and three freely
    associated states (Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of
    Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands), connecting them to
    CDC programs, funding, and resources to strengthen their public
    health systems and improve community health.
-   CDC supports the** Interagency Island Affairs Council**. Launched in
    2022, this council convenes federal leaders to identify, coordinate,
    and advance funding, programmatic, and policy issues to improve
    health equity in the U.S. Territories and Freely Associated
    States. [CDC also funds the Pacific Island Health Officers
    Association](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/partnerships/capacity-building-assistance-OT21-2101.html),
    which trains the next generation of public health leaders through
    its Pacific Public Health Fellowship Program. PIHOA played a central
    role in the region’s COVID-19 response. 
-   HHS’s ACF is combating human trafficking of AA and NHPI populations.
    This is a priority pursuant to the National Action Plan to Combat
    Human Trafficking which calls for HHS to provide training and
    technical assistance for health and human service professionals
    working with populations at high risk for human trafficking and
    intersecting with NHPI community programs.  Indigenous people
    worldwide are at particular risk of both [sex and labor
    trafficking](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/otip/toolkit/native-communities),
    and HHS’s Administration for Native Americans has found that
    American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific
    Islander women and girls are at high risk for experiencing sex
    trafficking. 

**Promoting Language Access and Disseminating Critical Health
Information**

-   Under Secretary Xavier Becerra’s leadership, HHS has prioritized
    providing access to language services appropriate to health and
    behavioral health care services. The cross-agency Language Access
    Steering Committee was relaunched and in May 2023, the HHS Office of
    Civil Rights released its [Language Access Annual Progress
    Report](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/language-access-report-2023.pdf) which
    detailed key priority areas of focus and the strategic creation of
    the new Language Access Coordinator position in OCR, along with a
    centralized language access center. Full implementation of the HHS
    Language Access Plan will result in a department-wide culture change
    that prioritizes equity in the delivery of HHS conducted and funded
    programs, which ultimately will contribute to improved health
    outcomes and reduced health disparities for underserved communities,
    including the AA and NHPI populations.
-   CDC awarded over $3M to the [Asian & Pacific Islander American
    Health
    Forum](https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/whatis/healthequityinaction/topics/api-forum.html) to
    forge community partnerships and translate information into over 30
    AA and NHPI languages.
-   HHS’s Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) continues
    to fund the [Association of Asian Pacific Community Health
    Organizations](https://www.hrsa.gov/library/association-asian-pacific-community-health-organizations),
    which supports health centers serving AA and NHPI populations
    through technical assistance, training, language access, cultural
    competency and supportive services. HRSA produced the Pacific Basin
    Telehealth Resource Center’s [“Translation
    Toolkit”](https://telehealthresourcecenter.org/resources/translated-resources/translation-toolkit/) which
    includes resources in Japanese, Chuukese, Ilocano, Korean,
    Marshallese, Samoan, Tagalog, Chinese and Vietnamese.
-   HHS’s Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded
    culturally appropriate and understandable health care information
    for AA and NHPI communities, including releasing the [“Medicare &
    You”](https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you) handbook for the
    first time
    in [Chinese](https://www.medicare.gov/publications/10050-C-Medicare-and-you.pdf), [Korean](https://www.medicare.gov/publications/10050-K-Medicare-and-you.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https://www.medicare.gov/publications/10050-V-Medicare-and-you.pdf),
    and the AA and NHPI Fact Sheet on Medicare enrollment. CMS is
    implementing a new segment of required cultural competency training
    for Marketplace agents and brokers participating in the Marketplace
    for Plan Year 2023.

**Conducting New Research and Creating Better Data**

-   In May 2022, the White House and WHIAANHPI hosted the White House
    Forum on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders,
    which featured a breakout convening dedicated to the mental health
    of AA and NHPI communities. The event featured White House and
    federal agency officials, along with community advocates and
    stakeholders. [Watch the breakout convening
    here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oix26I6fv1k&t=68s)
-   SAMHSA is committed to increasing actionable data on AA and NHPI
    populations and ensuring adequate sampling and disaggregation of the
    data. SAMHSA’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health with a
    respondent pool of over 65,000 residents in the U.S. and data
    analysis separating AA and NHPI presented their first ever report
    with results disaggregated by race and ethnicity.
-   The [HHS National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research on
    Women’s Health](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/) funded 28 research
    projects addressing AA and NHPI populations in a dozen states to
    reduce the health equity gap among women who have been historically
    understudied, underrepresented, and underreported through the [ORWH
    U3 Interdisciplinary Research
    Program](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/womens-health-research/interdisciplinary-research/u3-interdisciplinary-research/supplement).
-   The **Department of Veterans Affairs** conducted an equity
    assessment to understand the unmet needs of minority and Women
    veterans in the Pacific Islands and freely associated states (FAS).
    VA also completed a study on mental health disparities and released
    the [AA and NHPI Mental Health Information
    Brief](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.va.gov%2FHEALTHEQUITY%2Fdocs%2FAANHPI_Mental_Health_Information_Brief.pdf&data=05%7C01%7CAndrew.Peng%40hhs.gov%7Cbc8069602f3a4bd92c5608db7bef314b%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C638240039479275294%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=gx1dZSlCuO57Jz9QhVp9F%2FWV3ZHZf%2B71aY9sG1NmXzQ%3D&reserved=0) and

**Providing Mental Health Services in Schools**

-   Through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the U.S. Department of
    Education (ED) received $500 million for competitively awarded
    School-Based Mental Health (SBMH) Services Grants designed to
    increase the number of credentialed school-based mental health
    services providers delivering school-based mental health services to
    students.
-   ED also received $500 million for competitively awarded Mental
    Health Services Professionals (MHSP) Demonstration Grants to support
    innovative partnerships involving states, school districts, and
    institutions of higher education (IHEs) to train and increase the
    number and diversity of high-quality school-based mental health
    services providers available to address shortages of such providers
    in schools within high-need districts. Nearly half of the new MHSP
    awardees included a partnership with a Minority Serving Institution,
    Historically Black College or University, or Tribal College.
-   To support grantees funded under the SBHM and MHSP grant programs,
    ED will fund a first of its kind school-based mental health
    personnel technical assistance center. This center will provide
    support and resources to grantees, help ensure accurate
    data-collection and reporting to gauge progress, and disseminate
    best practices in credentialing, recruiting, training and
    developing, and retaining school-based mental health services
    providers.

**Supporting the Mental Health of Workers**

-   The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration developed a [workplace stress
    toolkit](https://www.osha.gov/workplace-stress) for employers with
    guidance, training, and outreach materials to help improve employee
    mental health and well-being. Also, this year’s Safe + Sound week
    will be focusing on mental health. Safe + Sound Week is a nationwide
    event held each August that recognizes the successes of workplace
    health and safety programs and offers information and ideas on how
    to develop safety and health programs. Throughout the week, OSHA
    will be providing resources for businesses on mental health and
    well-being. These OSHA webpages are available in four Asian
    languages (Chinese, Korean, Nepali, and Vietnamese).
-   The U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Disability Employment
    Policy (ODEP) launched in March 2022 a Public Service Announcement
    Campaign titled [“Mental Health at Work: What Can I
    do?”](https://www.whatcanyoudocampaign.org/psa-campaigns/mental-health-psa/) and
    published
    a [guide](https://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/campaign_for_disability_employment/mental_health_workplace_guide/) to
    raise awareness about mental health in their workplaces.

**Delivering Justice and Providing Resources to AA and NHPI
Communities**

-   HHS’s Office of Minority Health is the lead response agency for the
    Memorandum Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and
    Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the
    United States. [HHS and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) jointly
    issued
    guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/05/20/justice-department-announces-new-initiatives-address-prevent-hate-crimes-hate-incidents.html) in
    May 2022 aimed at raising awareness of hate crimes and incidents
    committed on the basis of personal or group characteristics. The
    Office of Minority Health (OMH) has convened a cross-Departmental
    work group of 30+ members to support the development of guidance
    aligned with the Memorandum directives.  Through this guidance, HHS
    and DOJ aim to raise awareness about hate crimes and incidents and
    propel the use of awareness as a tool for action, response, and
    prevention and provide tools to empower law enforcement and
    communities most frequently impacted by unlawful acts of hate.
    Implementation of the guidance is anticipated by September 2023.
-   **Addressing Gender-Based Violence: **DOJ’s Office on Violence
    against Women (OVW) administers grants authorized by the Violence
    Against Women Act and subsequent legislation to address domestic
    violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. OVW
    provides multiple grant opportunities that fund support services for
    historically marginalized and underserved communities, particularly
    those facing disproportionate rates or impacts of violence and
    multiple barriers to services, justice, and safety. AANHPI

-   **Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program
    (**[**JMHCP**](https://bja.ojp.gov/program/jmhcp/overview)**): **The
    DOJ Office of Justice Programs’ (OJP) JMHCP supports innovative,
    cross-system collaborations between public safety and behavioral
    health professionals to improve responses to and outcomes for
    individuals with mental health or co-occurring substance use
    disorders who come in contact with the justice system..
    Specifically,  grants and associated training and technical
    assistance under this program is used to create or expand:
    -   Programs that support cooperative efforts by public safety

    -   Programs that support intergovernmental cooperation between
        state and local governments to address enhanced support to
        individuals with mental health or co-occurring substance use
        disorders
-   **Protecting Rights, Access and Equity for Crime Victims**: This
    year, OJP’s Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) has provided new
    funding opportunities to build the capacity of victim service
    programs and widen the reach of services. OVC initiatives will
    deepen expertise and improve cultural responsiveness
    through [fellowships](https://ovc.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-ovc-2023-171679), [peer-to-peer

    professional development programs in tribal communities. OVC will
    also solicit field-generated proposals to help close the gap between
    victims’ needs and available services.
-   **Advancing Public Safety and Public Trust: **Opportunities are
    available to support innovative
    evidence-based [policing](https://bja.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-bja-2023-171650) and [prosecution](https://bja.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-bja-2023-171539) practices
    under OJP’s Bureau of Justice Assistance’s (BJA) Smart Suite. Other
    grant funding solicitations are designed to support small and rural
    law enforcement agencies, help police address cybercrime and expand
    the ranks of women in the law enforcement profession. Additional
    funding opportunities provided by BJA will help
    jurisdictions [prevent school
    violence](https://bja.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-bja-2023-171666) and
    deliver [training and technical assistance to recipients of STOP
