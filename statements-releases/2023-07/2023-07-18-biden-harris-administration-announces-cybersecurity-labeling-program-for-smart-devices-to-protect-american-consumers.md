title: "Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Cybersecurity Labeling Program\
  \ for Smart Devices to Protect American\_Consumers"
---
 
*Leading electronics and appliance manufacturers and retailers make
voluntary commitments to increase cybersecurity on smart devices, help
consumers choose products that are less vulnerable to cyberattacks.  
*  
*“U.S. Cyber Trust Mark” is the latest in a series of actions President
Biden and the Biden-Harris Administration have taken to protect
hard-working families.*

The Biden-Harris Administration today announced a cybersecurity
certification and labeling program to help Americans more easily choose
smart devices that are safer and less vulnerable to cyberattacks. The
new “U.S. Cyber Trust Mark*”* program proposed by Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel would raise the bar for
cybersecurity across common devices, including smart refrigerators,
smart microwaves, smart televisions, smart climate control systems,
smart fitness trackers, and more. This is the latest example of
President Biden’s leadership on behalf of hard-working families—from
cracking down on hidden junk fees, to strengthening cyber protections
and protecting the privacy of people in their own homes.   
  
Several major electronics, appliance, and consumer product
manufacturers, retailers, and trade associations have made voluntary
commitments to increase cybersecurity for the products they sell. 
Manufacturers and retailers announcing support and commitments today to
further the program include Amazon, Best Buy, Google, LG Electronics
U.S.A., Logitech, and Samsung Electronics. Under the proposed new
program, consumers would see a newly created “U.S. Cyber Trust Mark” in
the form of a distinct shield logo applied to products meeting
established cybersecurity criteria. The goal of the program is to
provide tools for consumers to make informed decisions about the
relative security of products they choose to bring into their homes.  
  
Acting under its authorities to regulate wireless communication devices,
the FCC is expected to seek public comment on rolling out the proposed
voluntary cybersecurity labeling program, which is expected to be up and
running in 2024. As proposed, the program would leverage stakeholder-led
efforts to certify and label products, based on specific cybersecurity
criteria published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) that, for example, requires unique and strong default passwords,
data protection, software updates, and incident detection
capabilities.  
  
Today, the FCC is applying to register a national trademark with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that would be applied to products
meeting the established cybersecurity criteria. The
Administration—including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency—would support the FCC in educating consumers to look for the new
label when making purchasing decisions, and encouraging major U.S.
retailers to prioritize labeled products when placing them on the shelf
and online.

To further enhance transparency and competition:

-   The FCC intends the use a QR code linking to a national registry of
    certified devices to provide consumers with specific and comparable
    security information about these smart products. Working with other
    regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice, the Commission plans
    to establish oversight and enforcement safeguards to maintain trust
    and confidence in the program.
-   NIST will also immediately undertake an effort to define
    cybersecurity requirements for consumer-grade routers—a higher-risk
    type of product that, if compromised, can be used to eavesdrop,
    steal passwords, and attack other devices and high value networks.
    NIST will complete this work by the end of 2023, to permit the
    Commission to consider use of these requirements to expand the
    labeling program to cover consumer grade routers.
-   The U.S. Department of Energy today also announced a collaborative
    initiative with National Labs and industry partners to research and
    develop cybersecurity labeling requirements for smart meters and
    power inverters, both essential components of the clean, smart grid
    of the future.
-   Internationally, the U.S. Department of State is committed to
    supporting the FCC to engage allies and partners toward harmonizing
    standards and pursuing mutual recognition of similar labeling
    efforts.

This new labeling program would help provide Americans with greater
assurances about the cybersecurity of the products they use and rely on
in their everyday lives. It would also be beneficial for businesses, as
it would help differentiate trustworthy products in the marketplace.

As part of the development of the program, the Biden-Harris
Administration and FCC will continue to engage stakeholders, regulators,
and Congress to fully implement this program and work together to keep
Americans safe.

Participants in today’s announcement include: Amazon, Best Buy, Carnegie
Mellon University, CyLab, Cisco Systems, Connectivity Standards
Alliance, Consumer Reports, Consumer Technology Association, Google,
Infineon, the Information Technology Industry Council, IoXT, KeySight,
LG Electronics U.S.A., Logitech, OpenPolicy, Qorvo, Qualcomm, Samsung
Electronics, UL Solutions, Yale and August U.S.###
