  \ of\_Israel"

Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. welcomed President Isaac Herzog of
Israel to the White House.  The two discussed the special significance
of Herzog’s July 19 address to a Joint Meeting of Congress to
commemorate Israel’s 75th anniversary, 35 years after an address by his
father President Chaim Herzog, reflective of the enduring nature of our
partnership, one that has transcended numerous U.S. and Israeli
Administrations.   
   
The two consulted on key issues of mutual concern, including enhanced
coordination to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and Iran’s
growing defense partnership with Russia.  They noted the strength of the
U.S.-Israel relationship, based on the bedrock of shared democratic
values, and discussed the need for a consensus-based approach to the
judicial reform package.  They discussed ongoing cooperation to develop
technology-based solutions to shared global challenges like climate
change, pandemics, and food insecurity.    
   
President Biden reiterated his commitment to maintaining a path for a
negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the
best avenue to a lasting and just peace, and to providing Israelis and
Palestinians equal measures of freedom, prosperity and security.  The
President stressed the need to take additional measures to improve the
security and economic situation in the West Bank and prevent acts of
terrorism.  The two also reviewed opportunities to advance Israel’s
regional integration to create a more peaceful and prosperous Middle
East.  Finally, building on the recently launched U.S. National Strategy
to Counter Antisemitism, they agreed on the need to continue to work
together to address the persistent scourge of antisemitism.
