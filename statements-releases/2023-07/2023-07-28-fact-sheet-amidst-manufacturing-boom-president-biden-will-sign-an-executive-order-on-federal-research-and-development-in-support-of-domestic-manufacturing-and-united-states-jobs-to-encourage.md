*Inventions resulting from Federal funding should benefit American
producers and workers when possible.*

Bidenomics is mobilizing historic levels of private sector investment in
the United States, supporting American innovation and research and
development (R&D), strengthening domestic manufacturing after decades of
offshoring, and creating new, good-paying jobs, including union jobs and
jobs that don’t require a college degree. Over the last several decades,
American workers, researchers and companies have created and
commercialized many of the world’s most important technologies. However,
many innovative technologies have ended up being manufactured elsewhere,
even when the research behind those inventions has been funded with
taxpayer dollars and can be manufactured domestically. **On Friday, July
28,President Biden will sign an Executive Order to prioritize America’s
policy of “invent it here, make it here”—to the benefit of American
workers, communities, and global supply chain resilience.**  
  
With the President’s Invest in America historic investments in Federal
R&D through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science
Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States has a
once-in-a-generation package of tools and resources to expand our
innovative capacity. Through the government innovation practices in the
Executive Order, the Administration will promote R&D investments than
can directly support American manufacturing and American jobs in the
industries of the future—a key pillar of Bidenomics.  
  
To achieve this outcome, today’s Executive Order tackles four core
objectives:  
  
**<u>First, it will improve transparency, cut red tape, and streamline
reporting requirements in the Federal R&D process to better track
progress towards our domestic manufacturing goals.</u>**

-   The Federal Government has historically faced challenges when
    tracking the lifecycle of technologies developed and commercialized
    through Federal R&D investment. In particular, the government has
    lacked the ability to understand how, when, and where investments in
    R&D lead to domestic manufacturing and the creation of good-paying
    U.S. jobs. The Executive Order helps to modernize use of the
    government reporting system—iEdison—to help researchers, companies,
    and the public better understand the innovation landscape in the
    United States.  
-   The Executive Order directs the Department of Commerce to develop
    contract terms for use by agencies to ease implementation. Agencies
    are encouraged to use these terms to collect data on inventions and
    their manufacturing locations. The terms developed by the Department
    of Commerce will make sure that this reporting protects business
    confidential information while providing increased visibility into
    taxpayer-funded R&D investments.  
-   The Executive Order encourages agencies to streamline reporting
    requirements to reduce the administrative burden on funding
    recipients and provide more consistent innovation and
    commercialization data.  
-   The Executive Order directs most agencies to transition reporting
    requirements to a single reporting portal—the National Institute of
    Standards and Technology’s iEdison—by the end of 2025. Already used
    by many agencies, iEdison will simplify and centralize reporting for
    Federal R&D funding recipients and their licensees, who will use one
    system to report all required information.  
-   Beginning within two years after the date of this order, agencies
    that make substantial R&D investments will report annually to the
    Made in America Director in the Office of Management and Budget on
    the utilization of inventions developed through their R&D awards, as
    well as where products using those inventions are being
    manufactured.

**<u>Second, it will boost the incentive to manufacture new inventions
in the United States when those inventions are developed using Federal
funds.</u>**

-   The Executive Order encourages agencies to consider domestic
    manufacturing in their R&D award solicitations.  
-   The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP),
    working through the National Science and Technology Council, will
    seek to add domestic manufacturing to the Federal Government’s
    technology R&D roadmaps. This emphasizes the importance of domestic
    manufacturing for federally funded inventions, and also encourages
    potential recipients of Federal funding to build domestic
    manufacturing into their long-term planning to commercialize their
    inventions.  
-   The Executive Order encourages agencies to consider using the broad
    range of agency authorities used to purchase or invest in
    leading-edge technologies to support their production in the United
    States, extending the incentive to manufacture domestically beyond
    use of those authorities that historically included such a
    requirement.

**<u>Third, it encourages the expansion of domestic production for
critical industries while maintaining flexibility to build strong
international R&D partnerships</u>**

-   In deciding whether to expand domestic manufacturing requirements,
    agencies shall consider the economic and national security interests
    of the United States, including whether certain critical or emerging
    technologies should be produced domestically.  
-   Under the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, domestic manufacturing requirements
    are limited to a narrow set of entities—third parties who have
    received an exclusive license to use and sell an invention in the
    United States. The Bayh-Dole domestic manufacturing requirement
    doesn’t apply to an organization with a non-exclusive license,
    Federal funding awardees themselves, or an organization that takes
    an invention developed with U.S. Federal funding to market to sell
    solely overseas. For critical and emerging technologies, agencies
    are encouraged to expand the domestic manufacturing requirement to
    not just exclusive licensees but other entities.  
-   This Executive Order also is forward-facing and maintains the
    flexibilities to create critical international R&D partnerships that
    support supply chain resilience and economic security.

**<u>Fourth, it will make the domestic manufacturing waiver process
clearer, timelier, and more consistent, including when production is not
commercially feasible.</u>**

-   The Department of Commerce will develop a set of common waiver
    questions for use across the U.S. Government. Relevant criteria for
    these questions should include, among other things, how the waiver
    will be used; why it is important that the invention be brought to
    market; whether there are any potential economic or national
    security impacts to manufacturing the invention outside the United
    States; and what benefits will accrue to domestic manufacturing and
    United States jobs as a result of bringing the invention to
    market.  
-   Importantly, waiver applicants will be required to describe the
    conditions under which the invention will be manufactured abroad,
    including unionization of workplaces, health and safety standards,
    labor and wage laws, and environmental impacts. This will support
    the goal of manufacturing inventions under conditions that are in
    line with U.S. values when they cannot be manufactured
    domestically.  
-   The Executive Order encourages agencies to improve the timeliness of
    the waiver process by acknowledging receipt of waiver applications
    within 10 business days and finalizing waiver decisions as soon as
    possible.  
-   The Executive Order instructs the Department of Commerce to improve
    the transparency of the waiver process by developing public guidance
    on how agencies will approach waiver decisions. The guidance will
    include a non-exhaustive list of factors for consideration when
    assessing whether domestic production of an invention is not
    commercially feasible. This waiver guidance will provide clarity and
    confidence to the business community and continue to enable
    collaboration with trusted allies and partners, all while ensuring
    that U.S.-based manufacturers are not disadvantaged.
