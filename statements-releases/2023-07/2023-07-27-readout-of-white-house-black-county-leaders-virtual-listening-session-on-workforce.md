Yesterday, the White House hosted local leaders who represent
significant African American populations to discuss the opportunities
and challenges with training a skilled workforce for the President’s

America](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
agenda. White House staff from the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs,
the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation
Reduction Act implementation teams provided an overview of the resources
and workforce funding opportunities available from the investments. The
group then had an open dialogue with the leaders from these communities
on their workforce needs. 

The elected officials from these counties emphasized how these historic
investments will help rebuild and strengthen their respective
communities. The elected officials praised the flexibility of the
American Rescue Plan and its ability to provide funding for supportive
services like transportation and career readiness efforts. The officials
also discussed challenges on sustainability of funding for supportive
services and the need to create pathways and opportunities for students
in high school. 

The Administration committed to supporting these counties through our
workforce resources and continued dialogue. This was the second in a
series of virtual sessions. The White House previously met with African
American mayors on their workforce challenges, and has heard from local
elected leaders and staff from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois,
Iowa, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. The White
House will continue this effort by bringing together more stakeholders
to support equitable training pathways.
