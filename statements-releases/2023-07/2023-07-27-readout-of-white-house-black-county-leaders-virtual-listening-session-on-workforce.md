Yesterday, the White House hosted local leaders who represent
significant African American populations to discuss the opportunities
and challenges with training a skilled workforce for the
President’s [Investing in
America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) agenda.
White House staff from the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, the
American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation
Reduction Act implementation teams provided an overview ofthe [resources
and workforce funding
opportunities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strategies-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/) available
from the investments. The group then had an open dialogue with the
leaders from these communities on their workforce needs. 

The elected officials from these counties emphasized how these historic
investments will help rebuild and strengthen their respective
communities. The elected officials praised the flexibility of the
American Rescue Plan and its ability to provide funding for supportive
services like transportation and career readiness efforts. The
officials also discussed challenges on sustainability of funding for
supportive services and the need to create pathways and opportunities
for students in high school. 

The Administration committed to supporting these counties through our
workforce resources and continued dialogue. This was the second in a
series of virtual sessions. The White House previously met with African
American mayors on their workforce challenges, and has heard from local
elected leaders and staff from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois,
Iowa, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. The White
House will continue this effort by bringing together more stakeholders
to support equitable training pathways.
