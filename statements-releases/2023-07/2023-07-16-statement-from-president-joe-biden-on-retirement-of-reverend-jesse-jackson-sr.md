title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Retirement of Reverend Jesse Jackson,\_\
  Sr."
---
 
The promise of America is that we are all created equal in the image of
God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. While we’ve
never fully lived up to that promise, we’ve never fully walked away from
it because of extraordinary leaders like Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr.

Throughout our decades of friendship and partnership, I’ve seen how
Reverend Jackson has helped lead our nation forward through tumult and
triumph. Whether on the campaign trail, on the march for equality, or in
the room advocating for what is right and just, I’ve seen him as history
will remember him: a man of God and of the people; determined,
strategic, and unafraid of the work to redeem the soul of our nation.

Jill and I are grateful to Reverend Jackson for his lifetime of
dedicated service and extend our appreciation to the entire Jackson
family. We look forward to working with the Rainbow PUSH Coalition as he
hands the torch to the next generation of leadership, just as we will
continue to cherish the counsel and wisdom that we draw from him.
