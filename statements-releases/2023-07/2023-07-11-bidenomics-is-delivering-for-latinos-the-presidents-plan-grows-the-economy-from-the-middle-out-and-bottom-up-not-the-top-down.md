title: "Bidenomics Is Delivering for Latinos: The President\u2019s Plan Grows the\
  \ Economy from the Middle Out and Bottom Up\u2014Not the Top\_Down"
---
 
President Biden and Vice President Harris came into office determined to
rebuild our economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top
down—and that strategy is working. Even as they faced an immediate
economic and public health crisis—with a raging pandemic, elevated
unemployment, snarled supply chains, and hundreds of thousands of small
businesses at risk of shuttering—the President and Vice President
understood that it wouldn’t be enough to simply go back to the economy
we had before the pandemic. That economy was saddled with longstanding
challenges that held America back—including [rising
inequality](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=02833aa17d&e=c041147ca9)
and disinvestment from communities across the country.  
   
President Biden recognized that some of those challenges were rooted in
a failed trickle-down theory that supported slashing taxes for the
wealthy and big corporations, shrinking public investment in critical
priorities like infrastructure and education, and failing to safeguard
market competition.  
  
**The President took office determined to move beyond these failed
trickle-down policies and fundamentally change the economic direction of
our country. His plan—Bidenomics—is rooted in the recognition that the
best way to grow the economy is from the middle out and the bottom up.**
It’s an economic vision centered around three key pillars:

-   **Making smart public investments** in America
-   **Empowering and educating workers** to grow the middle class
-   **Promoting competition** to lower costs and help entrepreneurs and
    small businesses thrive

While our work isn’t finished, Bidenomics is already delivering for the
American people, including for Latinos. During the Biden-Harris
Administration, we have:

-   Achieved the lowest Latino unemployment rate on record.
-   Achieved the largest-ever single calendar-year decline in Latino
    unemployment.
-   Achieved a record low Latino teen unemployment rate.
-   Increased Latino enrollment in HealthCare.gov coverage by 900,000,
    or 53%, from 2020 to 2022.
-   Reduced the Latino child poverty rate by greater than 7%, impacting
    over 300,000 children, through the Thrifty Food Plan.
-   Achieved the fastest creation rate of Hispanic-owned businesses in
    more than a decade, which was over 20% faster than pre-pandemic
    levels.
-   Began reversing decades of infrastructure disinvestment in
    communities of color, including with $4 billion to reconnect
    communities that were previously cut off from economic opportunities
    by transportation infrastructure and to help advance transportation
    projects in disadvantaged or underserved communities.
-   Began closing the digital divide for Latino families, with funding
    and a commitment to connect every person in America to reliable,
    affordable high-speed internet by 2030, considering over a third of
    Latino households report not having high-speed internet at home.
-   Set a goal of increasing by 50% the amount of federal contracting
    dollars going to small disadvantaged businesses by 2025—which would
    translate to an additional $100 billion to minority-owned and other
    underserved businesses, and help more Americans realize their
    entrepreneurial dreams.
-   Expanded access to health care and disability benefits, reduced
    homelessness, and achieved historic unemployment rates for veterans,
    including for the nearly 1.6 million Latino veterans.
