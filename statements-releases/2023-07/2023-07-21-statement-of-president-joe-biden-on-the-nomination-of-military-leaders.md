title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Nomination of Military\_Leaders"
---
 
  
Today, I am nominating four of our nation’s most experienced and highly
qualified officers to mission-critical positions of leadership in the
United States military. Each of these nominees brings an essential skill
set that will enhance and strengthen the operating capacity of the
greatest military and naval force the world has ever seen—an anchor of
our national security.  
   
As our next Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Lisa Franchetti will
bring 38 years of dedicated service to our nation as a commissioned
officer, including in her current role of Vice Chief of Naval
Operations. Throughout her career, Admiral Franchetti has demonstrated
extensive expertise in both the operational and policy arenas. She is
the second woman ever to achieve the rank of four-star admiral in the
United States Navy, and when confirmed, she will again make history as
the first woman to serve as the Chief of Naval Operations and on the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.  
   
To serve as the next Vice Chief of Naval Operations, I nominate Vice
Admiral James Kilby. In his current role as Deputy Commander of U.S.
Fleet Forces Command, Vice Admiral Kilby has done outstanding work to
ensure that our naval forces are combat-ready and deployable
worldwide.  
   
I am also nominating Admiral Samuel Paparo for Commander of Indo-Pacific
Command and Vice Admiral Stephen “Web” Koehler for Commander of U.S.
Pacific Fleet. These two officers both have significant experience
serving in the Indo-Pacific, where our military strength is critical to
ensuring the security and stability of this vital region of the
world.   
   
I want to thank each of these leaders for their willingness to continue
serving the nation and leading our brave women and men in uniform.  Each
of them will help ensure the safety and the prosperity of the American
people in the years ahead.  Given the national security challenges we
face around the world, I urge the Senate to move quickly in confirming
them, along with the other military nominations currently on hold. These
leadership positions are far too important to delay filling while one
Senator prioritizes his domestic political agenda over our military
readiness.  
   
It has long been an article of faith in this country that supporting our
servicemembers and their families, and providing for the strength of our
national defense, transcends politics. What Senator Tuberville is doing
is not only wrong—it is dangerous. In this moment of rapidly evolving
security environments and intense competition, he is risking our ability
to ensure that the United States Armed Forces remain the greatest
fighting force in the history of the world. And his Republican
colleagues in the Senate know it.  
   
The American people support our military and their families. I urge the
Senate to approve all the outstanding military nominees as quickly as
possible.
