title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on EU Adoption of Adequacy Decision for\
  \ U.S.-EU Data\_Flows"
---
 
 I welcome the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S.
Data Privacy Framework—which will allow personal data to be transferred
from Europe to U.S. companies safely and securely. Today’s announcement
represents the culmination of years of close cooperation between the
United States and the European Union, and affirms the strength of our
transatlantic relationship founded on our shared democratic values and
vision for the world. The decision reflects our joint commitment to
strong data privacy protections and will create greater economic
opportunities for our countries and companies on both sides of the
Atlantic.
