title: "Readout of the Fifth Meeting of the White\_House Competition\_Council"
---
 
Yesterday, the President convened the White House Competition Council to
mark the two-year anniversary of his [Executive Order on Promoting
Competition in the American
Economy](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-expands-war-junk-fees-rental-housing-unveils-new-merger-guidelines-2023-07-19/) and
to announce new initiatives to support healthy competition, lower costs,
and crack down on hidden junk fees. The Competition Council drives the
Administration’s whole-of-government effort to restore competition and
coordinate progress on the Executive Order’s 72 initiatives, delivering
concrete benefits of increased competition to America’s consumers,
workers, farmers, and small businesses.  
   
The President spoke to how promoting competition is a core important
part of Bidenomics. He thanked the Council for their ongoing work to
increase competition across the economy, including actions that have
already made hearing aids more affordable and accessible, lowered
insulin costs, and taken aim at prevalent junk fees. The President
celebrated new actions announced yesterday to lower food prices, crack
down on junk fees in the housing rental market, and provide clarity
around enforcement of laws prohibiting anti-competitive mergers.
Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack then spoke to a new
enforcement partnership with bipartisan state Attorneys General, as well
as the Department’s ongoing work to invest in expanding independent meat
and poultry processing and to issue new rules under the Packers and
Stockyards Act to prevent abuse of farmers. Vilsack noted he was
encouraged to see bipartisan interest in Congress in addressing
competition issues in agriculture, but that the Department would
continue to use its available tools to act now.  
   
Yesterday’s announcements include:

-   The Department of Agriculture (USDA) launched a new enforcement
    effort, the [Agricultural Competition
    Partnership](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/07/19/usda-launches-historic-partnership-bipartisan-state-attorneys),
    with over two dozen bipartisan State Attorneys General to address
    anticompetitive and anti-consumer practices in food and agricultural
    markets, including in grocery, meat-processing, and other markets.
    This bipartisan group will use both state and federal enforcement
    tools to reduce prices and increase competition. USDA also announced
    a [Farmer Seed
    Liaison](https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/seed-liaison) to
    give farmers a voice in the patent process. These announcements
    follow ongoing work by USDA to support farmers and shoppers,
    including through proposing rules to address anticompetitive
    behavior and providing millions of dollars in grants for small and
    independent processing.
-   The Competition Council announced a new front in the war against
    junk fees by announcing new actions to [address rental housing
    fees](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-on-junk-fees-in-rental-housing-to-lower-costs-for-renters/).
    For example, rental application fees are often as much as $100, far
    above the cost of running a background or credit check – and add up
    when consumers apply to multiple units in a tight rental market. The
    White House announced that Zillow, Apartments.com, and
    AffordableHousing.com have committed to release new website features
    to allow prospective renters to see all the fees up front so they
    know what they’ll actually be paying as they comparison shop.
    The [Department of Housing and Urban
    Development](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_146) also [issued
    a new white
    paper](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/policy-and-practice-publication-2023-july.pdf) on
    rental housing junk fees and how to address them.
-   The [Department of
    Justice](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-ftc-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines) and
    the [Federal Trade
    Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/07/ftc-doj-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines) answered
    President Biden’s call to action in the Competition Executive Order
    and released new proposed Merger Guidelines for public comment.
    These Guidelines aim to provide the public, businesses, workers, and
    consumers with more clarity around how law enforcement agencies
    assess mergers under current antitrust laws. The [Council of
    Economic Advisers
    explained](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/07/19/protecting-competition-through-updated-merger-guidelines/) that
    the new proposed Guidelines are informed by the best and most recent
    economic evidence available, and that robust enforcement of mergers
    can lower prices, increase wages, and strengthen innovation.

The Council members used the rest of the meeting to discuss recent
accomplishments and their priorities for the coming months, including
how the Council can continue to support labor market competition and
deliver cost-saving measures for Americans.
