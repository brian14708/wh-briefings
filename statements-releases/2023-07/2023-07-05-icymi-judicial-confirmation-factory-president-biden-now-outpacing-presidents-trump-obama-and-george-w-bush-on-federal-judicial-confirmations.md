Carl Huse wrote recently in the **[New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/us/federal-judges-appointed.html)** that
President Biden and Senate Democrats “have transformed the Senate into a
judicial confirmation factory.”

Indeed, President Biden has now seen 136 federal judges confirmed – more
judicial confirmations than Presidents Trump, Obama, and George W. Bush
up to this point in their presidencies. He’s done it against the
backdrop of a closely divided Senate. The President also recently hit
100 district court confirmations.

But it’s not just about the numbers.

Michael Tomasky wrote last week in the **[New
Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/174042/defeat-federalist-society-take-back-supreme-court)**:
“More meaningful than the number is the type, as two-thirds of those
nominees are women and two-thirds are people of color. Many are from
plainly progressive backgrounds in the law. In just the last month or
so, these judges are among those confirmed:

-   Nusrat Choudhury, the first Muslim American woman (and first
    Bangladeshi woman) to be named to the federal bench; a civil rights
    lawyer with the ACLU
-   Natasha Merle, an African American woman out of the NAACP Legal
    Defense and Education Fund
-   Dale Ho, an Asian American voting rights attorney
-   Casey Pitts, an openly LGBTQ labor lawyer
-   Hernán Vera, a Latino former staff attorney at the Mexican American
    Legal Defense and Education Fund”

The success to date is no accident.

“Joe Biden, a former longtime chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, made judicial nominations a top priority [before he was even
sworn
in](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-courts-progressive-nominees_n_5fecc527c5b6e7974fd18321) as
president.” And since being sworn in, the President, Leader Schumer, and
Chairman Durbin have moved swiftly to confirm a historic number of
highly-qualified, civil rights attorneys and public defenders. Just look
at the **[last three
weeks](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/federal-court-judges-civil-rights-lawyers-confirmations_n_64a30de0e4b0035bc5c8606e?utm_campaign=share_twitter&ncid=engmodushpmg00000004)**:

“Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) lined up and confirmed
six of Biden’s most trailblazing judicial nominees to date, some of whom
are certainly contenders for future Supreme Court seats. All are civil
rights attorneys. All have been priorities for progressive judicial
advocacy groups. All are relatively young, meaning they likely have
decades ahead of them in their lifetime appointments. And all bring
badly needed diversity to the federal bench.”

President Biden promised the American people he would make upholding the
rule of law with deeply qualified judicial nominees who represent the
diversity of our nation a core priority. Fulfilling that pledge is one
of his proudest accomplishments. The Biden-Harris pace of judicial
confirmations has surpassed the last three presidencies while shattering
all previous records when it comes to making the federal bench look like
America.

The President is determined to keep driving forward with more
barrier-breaking nominees.
