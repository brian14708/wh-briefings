President Biden looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Ulf
Kristersson of Sweden to the White House on Wednesday, July 5 to further
strengthen the close ties between the United States and Sweden.
President Biden and Prime Minister Kristersson will review our growing
security cooperation and reaffirm their view that Sweden should join
NATO as soon as possible.  The leaders will discuss our shared
commitment to supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s brutal war of
aggression and to closer transatlantic coordination on the People’s
Republic of China. They will also talk about our close coordination on
addressing climate change as well as new and emerging technologies.
