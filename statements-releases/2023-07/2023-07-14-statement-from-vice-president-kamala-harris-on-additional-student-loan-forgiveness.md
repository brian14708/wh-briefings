title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Additional Student Loan\_\
  Forgiveness"
---
 
President Joe Biden and I are committed to delivering relief to student
loan debt borrowers to help them move forward with their lives – whether
they want to start a family, buy a home, or become an entrepreneur.
Today, we are taking another historic step by forgiving $39 billion in
student loan debt for 804,000 borrowers who have been paying down their
debts for 20 years or more and should qualify for relief. Instead, many
were placed into forbearance by loan servicers in violation of the
rules, and others did not get appropriate credit for their monthly
payments. Addressing these harmful practices and reducing student loan
debt has been a priority throughout my career. As California Attorney
General, I won $1 billion for defrauded veterans and students by taking
on predatory for-profit colleges.  
   
We will not stop there. Last month, President Biden announced we are
pursuing an alternative path to provide relief through the Higher
Education Act, and we finalized our new income-driven repayment plan –
which will cut monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans. Our
Administration will continue to fight to make sure Americans can access
high-quality postsecondary education without taking on the burden
of unmanageable student loan debt.
