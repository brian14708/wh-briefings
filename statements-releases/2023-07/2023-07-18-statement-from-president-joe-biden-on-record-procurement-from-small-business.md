title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Record Procurement from Small\_Business"
---
 
I came to office determined to build the economy from the middle out and
bottom up, not the top down – that’s Bidenomics – and supporting small
business has been central to the progress we’ve made. My first two years
saw the most Americans applying to start small businesses of any on
record. Today’s report from the Small Business Administration shows that
we’ve also made progress leveling the playing field in federal
contracts, with a record $163 billion going to small businesses. Just in
the last fiscal year, our policies have supported one million jobs in
small businesses.

This report also shows progress in increasing the share of federal
contracts going to small disadvantaged businesses. Vice President Harris
and I are committed to ensuring that federal investments build wealth
and opportunity for underserved entrepreneurs and small business owners
in every community across the country. Small businesses are the engines
of our economy and the heart and soul of our communities, and investing
in our small business entrepreneurs means investing in competition and
job creation.
