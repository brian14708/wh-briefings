title: Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Welcoming Iraqi Progress
  Toward Energy Self-Sufficiency
---
 
We welcome the finalization of Iraq’s unprecedented Gas Growth
Integrated Project (GGIP) with French firm TotalEnergies. Formally
signed this week, this massive deal, which will include participation
from regional and American companies, is a major step towards both
establishing Iraq’s energy self-sufficiency and meeting its climate
goals. Once the project is complete, Iraqis will benefit from increased
domestic supply of electricity and reduced health problems associated
with the harmful practice of gas flaring. The United States fully
supports Iraq’s ongoing efforts to enhance domestic resilience, and
diversify its energy supply, including through broader integration into
the Middle East region. This energy and gas capture project, together
with the ongoing programs to connect Iraq’s electricity grid to the
grids in the GCC and Jordan, will significantly enhance Iraq’s energy
security and the reliability of its electricity network for the benefit
of the Iraqi people. We will continue to work closely with Prime
Minister Sudani and the Government of Iraq to help ensure Iraq’s
abundant natural resources benefit its people and address their needs.
