title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Delivers on Major Trade and\
  \ Investment Deals Following the 2022 U.S.-Africa Leaders\_Summit"
---
 
In December 2022, President Biden hosted leaders from across the African
continent for the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, DC. At the
Summit, business and government leaders committed to catalyze trade and
investment deals and partnerships which will create jobs and foster
shared prosperity for people across the African continent and the United
States.  
  
Today at the U.S.-Africa Business Summit hosted by the Corporate Council
on Africa and the Government of Botswana, the U.S. delegation announced
that **since the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December, the
Biden-Harris Administration has helped close 75 new deals between the
United States and African countries for a total estimated value of $5.7
billion in two-way trade and investment.  **Since 2021, the U.S.
Government has helped close more than 900 deals across 47 African
countries for a total estimated value of $22 billion in two-way trade
and investment. As the Administration’s flagship infrastructure
initiative, the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment
(PGII) is helping to advance and scale several of these public and
private investments across the continent.    
  
The U.S. delegation also marked significant progress in delivering on
the $15 billion in commitments made by business and government leaders
at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022, as well as the
additional $8 billion in private sector commitments and $1 billion in
U.S. Government commitments made in conjunction with Vice President
Kamala Harris’s visit to Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia in March 2023. 
These mutually beneficial partnerships advance shared priority areas,
including sustainable energy, health systems, food
security/agribusiness, digital connectivity, infrastructure, and
finance.    
  
Key achievements include the following:

-   Since December, the** Export-Import Bank of the United States
    (EXIM) **has authorized approximately $1.6 billion of transactions
    supporting exports to Africa.  During the Vice President’s recent
    trip to the region, EXIM and the Government of the United Republic
    of Tanzania announced an MOU to facilitate up to $500 million in
    U.S. export financing to Tanzania.  In June, EXIM approved an
    initial $900 million in financing for two solar projects to generate
    over 500 megawatts of renewable power and provide access to clean
    energy resources across Angola, estimated to support 1,600 jobs. 
-   Since December, the **U.S. Trade and Development Agency
    (USTDA)** has funded eight feasibility studies since the Summit to
    advance the implementation of over $1 billion in digital
    connectivity, clean energy, and healthcare infrastructure projects
    on the continent.  In addition, USTDA arranged reverse trade
    missions focused on airport infrastructure and last-minute
    connectivity, with the intent to connect African public and private
    sector representatives with the latest U.S. technologies, services,
    and financing solutions.
-   Since December, **the U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation (DFC) **has committed nearly $110 million in financing
    to projects across the continent.  This builds on DFC’s
    announcements from the Summit of $369 million in new active
    commitments across Africa, more than $2.4 billion in active
    commitments to support development projects across Africa since the
    beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, and a total portfolio
    in Africa of more than $11 billion as of December 2022.
-   **The Digital Transformation with Africa (DTA)
    Initiative **established the African Digital Policy Council to
    coordinate this signature $800 million initiative’s investment in
    the continent’s digital future.  Vice President Harris in April
    issued a “call to action” to the private sector and philanthropic
    community to make direct investments and social impact commitments
    to advance digital inclusion in Africa.  This work will directly
    support DTA’s aim to make sure that people across Africa can
    participate in the global digital economy. 
-   In April,** Prosper Africa, in partnership with the U.S. Agency for
    International Development (USAID)** launched the Africa Tech for
    Trade Alliance and seen the close of $274 million in long-term
    financing for affordable housing across West Africa.  With USAID,
    the Prosper Africa initiative has launched Buyer-Supplier
    Partnerships across the continent; rolled out a Catalytic Investment
    Facility in partnership with nine African funds; and launched
    Continental Services that support business in maximizing
    opportunities under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)
    and African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).  Today, the
    Administration announced British A. Robinson as the new Prosper
    Africa Coordinator.
-   **The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and USAID, in
    partnership with Prosper Africa, **closed a deal with Moroccan
    Government-owned financial institution La Société Nationale de
    Garantie et du Financement de l’Entreprise (commercially branded as
    Tamwilcom) to expand a green credit guarantee product in Morocco
    that will unlock commercial bank lending for small businesses to
    invest in climate-friendly projects in the country’s industrial
    zones, unlocking up to $100 million in guarantees, mobilizing up to
    $160 million in commercial loans, and catalyzing up to $200 million
    in private investment.
-   Since the launch of the **U.S.-Africa Clean-Tech Energy Network
    (CTEN)** in December, 24 U.S. clean-tech companies have joined the
    network, strengthening the cleantech ecosystem to improve energy
    access through power generation, newly established electricity
    connections, and spurring U.S. clean energy exports.  **Power
    Africa**‘s Health Electrification and Telecommunications Alliance
    (HETA), a public-private partnership, is investing $47 million to
    leverage more than $150 million of private sector resources to
    install reliable, renewable power and provide mobile network and
    internet access for at least 10,000 health facilities across
    sub-Saharan Africa.  CTEN**,** coordinated by **Power
    Africa** and **Prosper Africa**, launched at the U.S.-Africa Leaders
    Summit, links clean technology energy companies in the U.S. and
    Africa with the goal of closing $350 million of new clean energy
    deals over the next five years.  
-   Since December,** the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)**
    approved over $9 million in export loans to support U.S. small
    business exports to the continent.  These loans together supported
    nearly $20 million in U.S. small business goods and services sales
    to North and Sub-Saharan African customers.
