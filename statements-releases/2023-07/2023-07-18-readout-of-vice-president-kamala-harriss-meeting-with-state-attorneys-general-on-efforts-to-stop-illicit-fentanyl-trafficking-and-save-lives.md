  \ General on Efforts to Stop Illicit Fentanyl Trafficking and Save\_Lives"

Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened Attorneys General from
seven states and the District of Columbia for a conversation about
federal and state efforts to disrupt the illicit fentanyl supply chain
and expand access to care for individuals at risk of an overdose. White
House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Dr. Rahul
Gupta moderated the discussion and they were joined by White House
Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Tom Perez. The roundtable followed
actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to tackle the opioid
and overdose epidemic, including [releasing a National Response
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2023/07/11/in-continued-fight-against-overdose-epidemic-the-white-house-releases-national-response-plan-to-address-the-emerging-threat-of-fentanyl-combined-with-xylazine/)
to address the emerging threat of fentanyl combined with xylazine, a
non-opioid that is involved in 1 of 9 overdoses. The Vice President also
announced nearly $50 million in grants to help address different facets
of the nation’s overdose epidemic will be awarded by the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration tomorrow. 

  
The Vice President thanked the state Attorneys General for their
leadership and critical partnership in expanding substance use
prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery services in their
states. She spoke about the Administration’s historic investments to
drive down overdoses, and progress made over the past two years to crack
down on fentanyl trafficking and expand access to care.

  
The officials discussed key tools developed and supported by the
Administration that states can use right away to help save lives. Those
include the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program, the
xylazine National Response Plan, key state model laws to address
substance use disorder and overdoses, the [non-fatal opioid overdose
tracker](https://nemsis.org/opioid-overdose-tracker/), and key
announcements from the Bureau of Prisons and the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services aimed at expanding treatment for substance use
disorder for people who are incarcerated. These tools all support the
President’s [*National Drug Control
Strategy*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/21/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-2022-national-drug-control-strategy-that-outlines-comprehensive-path-forward-to-address-addiction-and-the-overdose-epidemic/#:~:text=The%20Strategy%20focuses%20on%20two,to%20guide%20all%20these%20efforts.).  
  
Together, the Vice President, Dr. Gupta, Director Perez, and the state
Attorneys General identified opportunities to enhance federal and state
collaboration to beat the fentanyl and opioid epidemic. The
Administration has encouraged state Attorneys General to coordinate with
regional HIDTA Programs to disrupt the commercial activities of
transnational criminal organizations and maximize federal, state, and
opioid settlement funds for evidence-based programs that save lives and
expand access to overdose reversal medications.
