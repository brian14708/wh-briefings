title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Secures Voluntary Commitments\
  \ from Leading Artificial Intelligence Companies to Manage the Risks Posed by\_\
  AI"

*Voluntary commitments – underscoring safety, security, and trust – mark
a critical step toward developing responsible AI*  
  
*Biden-Harris Administration will continue to take decisive action by
developing an Executive Order and pursuing bipartisan legislation to
keep Americans safe*

Since taking office, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the
entire Biden-Harris Administration have moved with urgency to seize the
tremendous promise and manage the risks posed by Artificial Intelligence
(AI) and to protect Americans’ rights and safety. As part of this
commitment, President Biden is convening seven leading AI companies at
the White House today – Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta,
Microsoft, and OpenAI – to announce that the Biden-Harris Administration
has [secured voluntary
commitments](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ensuring-Safe-Secure-and-Trustworthy-AI.pdf)
from these companies to help move toward safe, secure, and transparent
development of AI technology.     
  
Companies that are developing these emerging technologies have a
responsibility to ensure their products are safe. To make the most of
AI’s potential, the Biden-Harris Administration is encouraging this
industry to uphold the highest standards to ensure that innovation
doesn’t come at the expense of Americans’ rights and safety.  
  
These commitments, which the companies have chosen to undertake
immediately, underscore three principles that must be fundamental to the
future of AI – safety, security, and trust – and mark a critical step
toward developing responsible AI. As the pace of innovation continues to
accelerate, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to remind
these companies of their responsibilities and take decisive action to
keep Americans safe.  
  
There is much more work underway. The Biden-Harris Administration is
currently developing an executive order and will pursue bipartisan
legislation to help America lead the way in responsible innovation.  
  
Today, these seven leading AI companies are committing to:  
  
**<u>Ensuring Products are Safe Before Introducing Them to the
Public</u>**

-   **The companies commit to internal and external security testing of
    their AI systems before their release.** This testing, which will be
    carried out in part by independent experts, guards against some of
    the most significant sources of AI risks, such as biosecurity and
    cybersecurity, as well as its broader societal effects.
-   **The companies commit to sharing information across the industry
    and with governments, civil society, and academia on managing AI
    risks. **This includes best practices for safety, information on
    attempts to circumvent safeguards, and technical collaboration.

**<u>Building Systems that Put Security First</u>**

-   **The companies commit to investing in cybersecurity and insider
    threat safeguards to protect proprietary and unreleased model
    weights. **These model weights are the most essential part of an AI
    system, and the companies agree that it is vital that the model
    weights be released only when intended and when security risks are
    considered.
-   **The companies commit to facilitating third-party discovery and
    reporting of vulnerabilities in their AI systems. **Some issues may
    persist even after an AI system is released and a robust reporting
    mechanism enables them to be found and fixed quickly.

**<u>Earning the Public’s Trust</u>**

-   **The companies commit to developing robust technical mechanisms to
    ensure that users know when content is AI generated, such as a
    watermarking system. **This action enables creativity with AI to
    flourish but reduces the dangers of fraud and deception.
-   **The companies commit to publicly reporting their AI systems’
    capabilities, limitations, and areas of appropriate and
    inappropriate use. **This report will cover both security risks and
    societal risks, such as the effects on fairness and bias.
-   **The companies commit to prioritizing research on the societal
    risks that AI systems can pose, including on avoiding harmful bias
    and discrimination, and protecting privacy. **The track record of AI
    shows the insidiousness and prevalence of these dangers, and the
    companies commit to rolling out AI that mitigates them.   
-   **The companies commit to develop and deploy advanced AI systems to
    help address society’s greatest challenges. **From cancer prevention
    to mitigating climate change to so much in between, AI—if properly
    managed—can contribute enormously to the prosperity, equality, and
    security of all.

As we advance this agenda at home, the Administration will work with
allies and partners to establish a strong international framework to
govern the development and use of AI. It has already consulted on the
voluntary commitments with Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France,
Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, the UAE,
and the UK. The United States seeks to ensure that these commitments
support and complement Japan’s leadership of the G-7 Hiroshima
Process—as a critical forum for developing shared principles for the
governance of AI—as well as the United Kingdom’s leadership in hosting a
Summit on AI Safety, and India’s leadership as Chair of the Global
Partnership on AI. We also are discussing AI with the UN and Member
States in various UN fora.  
  
Today’s announcement is part of a broader commitment by the Biden-Harris
Administration to ensure AI is developed safely and responsibly, and to
protect Americans from harm and discrimination.
