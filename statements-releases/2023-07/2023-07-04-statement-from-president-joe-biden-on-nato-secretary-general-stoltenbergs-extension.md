  s\_Extension"

I welcome the announcement that NATO will extend Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg’s term for an additional year.  With his steady leadership,
experience, and judgment, Secretary General Stoltenberg has brought our
Alliance through the most significant challenges in European security
since World War II.  Today, our Alliance is stronger, more united and
purposeful than it has ever been. I look forward to continuing the work
with Secretary General Stoltenberg to further strengthen the Alliance
next week at the NATO Summit in Vilnius, and ahead of the 75th
Anniversary NATO Summit in Washington, D.C. next year.
