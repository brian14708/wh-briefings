title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Completing the Destruction of the United\_\
  States\u2019 Chemical Weapons\_Stockpile"
---
 
For more than 30 years, the United States has worked tirelessly to
eliminate our chemical weapons stockpile. Today, I am proud to announce
that the United States has safely destroyed the final munition in that
stockpile—bringing us one step closer to a world free from the horrors
of chemical weapons.  
   
Successive administrations have determined that these weapons should
never again be developed or deployed, and this accomplishment not only
makes good on our long-standing commitment under the Chemical Weapons
Convention, it marks the first time an international body has verified
destruction of an entire category of declared weapons of mass
destruction. I am grateful to the thousands of Americans who gave their
time and talents to this noble and challenging mission for more than
three decades.  
   
Today—as we mark this significant milestone—we must also renew our
commitment to forging a future free from chemical weapons. I continue to
encourage the remaining nations to join the Chemical Weapons Convention
so that the global ban on chemical weapons can reach its fullest
potential. Russia and Syria should return to compliance with the
Chemical Weapons Convention and admit their undeclared programs, which
have been used to commit brazen atrocities and attacks. We will continue
to stand with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
to prevent the stockpiling, production, and use of chemical weapons
around the world. And together with our partners, we will not stop until
we can finally and forever rid the world of this scourge.
