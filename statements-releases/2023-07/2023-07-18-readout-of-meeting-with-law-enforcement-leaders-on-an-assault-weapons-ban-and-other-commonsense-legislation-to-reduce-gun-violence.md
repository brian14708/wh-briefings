title: "Readout of Meeting with Law Enforcement Leaders on An Assault Weapons Ban\
  \ and Other Commonsense Legislation to Reduce Gun\_Violence"
---
 
Today, senior White House officials met with more than 20 law
enforcement leaders from across the country to discuss how to build
additional law enforcement support for an assault weapons and
high-capacity magazine ban and other commonsense legislation to reduce
gun violence. This meeting is the result of President Biden’s May 2023
*USA Today* op-ed, in which he outlined a roadmap for building on the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to enact additional gun safety
legislation. One part of that roadmap, President Biden explained, is
“build\[ing\] an even bigger, unrelenting coalition demanding that
Congress pass additional gun safety legislation.”  
   
Law enforcement leaders discussed how officers all across the country
are being outgunned by criminals armed with assault weapons and how
those weapons of war grievously injure our children, neighbors, and
community members. They provided substantive input on urgently needed
actions to reduce gun violence in their communities.  White House
officials discussed the importance of mobilizing additional law
enforcement voices – both leadership and rank and file officers – to
make clear to members of Congress that supporting our police and
improving the safety of American communities means banning assault
weapons and taking other practical steps to reduce gun violence and save
lives.  Participants agreed on the urgency of building a broad coalition
and an agenda for action informed by input from law enforcement.
Participants also agreed on the need to work together to support passage
of additional gun safety legislation.
