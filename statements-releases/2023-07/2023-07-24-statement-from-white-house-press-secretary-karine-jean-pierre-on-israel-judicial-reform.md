  Reform"

As a lifelong friend of Israel, President Biden has publicly and
privately expressed his views that major changes in a democracy to be
enduring must have as broad a consensus as possible.  It is unfortunate
that the vote today took place with the slimmest possible majority.  We
understand talks are ongoing and likely to continue over the coming
weeks and months to forge a broader compromise even with the Knesset in
recess.  The United States will continue to support the efforts of
President Herzog and other Israeli leaders as they seek to build a
broader consensus through political dialogue.
