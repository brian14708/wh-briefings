  \ Affordable Housing by Converting Commercial Properties to Residential\_Use"

*New resources will encourage zero emissions conversions and
transit-oriented development that increase housing supply and cut
climate pollution*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to
support the conversion of high-vacancy commercial buildings to
residential use, including through new financing, technical assistance,
and sale of federal properties. These announcements will create
much-needed housing that is affordable, energy efficient, near transit
and good jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, nearly 30 percent of
which comes from the building sector.  
  
Office and commercial vacancies across the country are affecting urban
downtowns and rural main streets. A [new
blog](https://www.whitehouse.gov/?post_type=eop_cea_post&p=86481) released
today by the Council of Economic Advisers finds that office vacancies
have reached a 30-year high from coast-to-coast, placing a strain on
commercial real estate and local economies. At the same time, the
country has struggled for decades with a shortage of affordable housing
units, which is driving up rental costs, and communities are seeking new
ways to cut emissions, especially from existing buildings and
transportation.  
  
The actions announced today build upon the initiatives in the [White
House Housing Supply Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/),
which is lowering housing costs, boosting housing supply, and promoting
fair housing, and the Administration’s actions to lower energy costs and
tackle the climate crisis. Lowering costs, increasing access to good
jobs, and building the clean energy economy are key tenants of
Bidenomics — the President’s agenda to grow the economy from the middle
out and the bottom up. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is
announcing the following actions:  
  
**Sparking Investment through New Federal Funding and Repurposing
Property**

-   The Department of Transportation (DOT) is [releasing new
    guidance](http://www.transportation.gov/buildamerica/TOD/faqs) to
    states, localities, and developers on how the Transportation
    Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) and Railroad
    Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing (RRIF) programs – which
    combined have over $35 billion in available lending capacity for
    transit-oriented development projects at below market interest
    rates, can be used to finance housing development near
    transportation, including conversion projects. In addition, DOT
    released [a policy
    statement](http://www.transportation.gov/buildamerica/about/resources-mode/tod-policy-statement) with
    principles for pursuing transportation projects with the dual goals
    of increasing affordable housing supply and decreasing emissions. By
    making low-cost financing available for conversions and housing
    projects near public transportation, this guidance and policy
    statement will increase housing supply, while encouraging state and
    local governments to improve their zoning, land use, and
    transit-oriented development policies.
-   DOT is releasing guidance that makes it easier for transit agencies
    to repurpose properties for transit-oriented development and
    affordable housing projects, including conversions near transit.
    Under the new guidance, transit agencies may transfer properties
    to local governments, non-profit, and for-profit developers of
    affordable housing at no cost. The new policy has the potential to
    turn property no longer needed for transit into affordable housing
    development particularly when combined with loans from TIFIA or RRIF
    programs.
-   [HUD is releasing an updated
    notice](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/2023-10cpdn.pdf) on
    how the Community Development Block Grant fund, $10 billion of which
    have been allocated during this Administration, can be used to boost
    housing supply – including the acquisition, rehabilitation, and
    conversion of commercial properties to residential uses and
    mixed-use development. HUD is also increasing outreach efforts to
    support municipalities and developers seeking to use HUD tools to
    finance conversions. States and localities can also access up to
    five times their annual CDBG allocation in low-cost loan guarantees
    to fund projects such as the conversion of properties to housing or
    mixed-use development. In addition, HUD will make awards through a
    research-related Notice of Funding Opportunity, which can be used to
    develop case studies that can serve as roadmaps for other localities
    interested in pursuing conversions. HUD is also accepting
    applications for the $85 million [Pathways to Removing Obstacles to
    Housing
    program](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/pro_housing),
    which includes the development of adaptive reuse strategies and the
    financing of conversions as eligible activities.
-   The General Services Administration (GSA) will expand on its Good
    Neighbor Program to promote the sale of surplus federal properties
    that buyers could potentially redevelop for residential use. To
    support this initiative, GSA will work with the Office of Management
    and Budget (OMB) to identify current and upcoming sale
    opportunities, maintain a public list of current opportunities, and
    affirmatively market resources available to support housing
    development in all targeted materials for applicable properties.

**Leveraging Federal Funding to Encourage Conversions**

-   The White House is releasing a [Commercial to Residential Federal
    Resources
    Guidebook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Commercial-to-Residential-Conversions-Guidebook.pdf) with
    over 20 federal programs across six federal agencies that can be
    used to support conversions. These programs include low-interest
    loans, loan guarantees, grants, and tax incentives, which, subject
    to the requirements of each program, may be used together to
    increase the economic viability of conversion projects.
-   To accompany the guidebook the White House is announcing training
    workshops this fall for local and state governments, real estate
    developers, owners, builders, and lenders on how to use federal
    programs for commercial to residential conversions and achieve
    additional goals including affordability and building zero emissions
    housing.
-   DOT will be announcing [new technical
    assistance](https://www.transportation.gov/buildamerica/innovativefinancegrants) through
    direct engagement with federal agencies and third-party
    intermediaries to support municipalities and developers seeking to
    use DOT tools to finance conversions.
-   Through the Better Buildings Initiative, DOE also [launched a
    commercial to zero emissions housing
    toolkit](https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/toolkit/supporting-commercial-to-zero-emissions-housing-toolkit) that
    includes technical and financial guidance on how to achieve zero
    emissions commercial to residential conversions. DOE’s toolkit
    highlights how the Inflation Reduction Act can bring more capital to
    conversions through the DOE Loan Program Office’s loans and
    guarantee programs and tax incentives, such as the new energy
    efficient home tax credit (45L), the energy efficient commercial
    buildings tax deduction (179D), and the clean energy investment tax
    credit (48).
-   And today, Treasury is [posting a
    blog](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-act-benefits-for-builders-of-multifamily-housing) that
    describes tax incentives for builders of multifamily housing.
    Through the Inflation Reduction Act, several tax incentives may
    support eligible builders of multifamily housing to lower the
    investment costs associated with energy efficiency upgrades, clean
    electricity generation projects, or even the new or substantial
    reconstruction and rehabilitation of homes meeting certain Energy
    Star or Zero Energy Ready Home Program energy efficiency standards.

**Working with States, Localities, and the Private Sector to Take
Action**  
A number of states and localities have taken steps to address the
challenge of high commercial and office building vacancies in their
downtowns. As [new
research](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/em/fall-23/index.html) from
HUD shows, developers commonly use combinations of federal, state and
local resources on individual conversion projects. The White House is
encouraging all state, local, tribal, and territorial entities to
identify all available public tools and land disposition opportunities
to facilitate conversions. The White House encourages the private
sector, including non-profit organizations and other stakeholders, to
engage in capacity building around conversions in support of this effort
today:

-   The National Association of Counties (NACo) is expanding its focus
    to support county capacity to convert commercial properties to
    residential use, including by leveraging available federal programs
    and technical assistance efforts. NACo will identify counties who
    are actively pursuing projects to participate and will hold a series
    of listening and informational sessions, culminating in a policy
    paper for county officials interested in pursuing commercial to
    residential conversion projects.
-   The American Planning Association, in collaboration with the Lincoln
    Institute of Land Policy and Harvard University Graduate School of
    Design, is expanding its existing work with the planning directors
    of the 30 largest U.S. cities to include new programs on commercial
    to residential conversions, with the first meeting already having
    occurred in October.
