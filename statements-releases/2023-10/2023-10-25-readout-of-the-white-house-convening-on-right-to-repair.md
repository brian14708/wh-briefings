title: "Readout of the White\_House Convening on Right to\_Repair"
---
 
Yesterday, the White House convened a roundtable with federal and state
officials, small business owners, and private sector leaders to discuss
the importance of the right to repair. In the simplest terms, the right
to repair is the right to fix something you own when it breaks—either by
yourself or by taking it to an independent repair shop. By giving
consumers more choices on where and how to get their devices fixed,
right to repair lowers costs, makes it easier to fix the things you own,
and increases competition—a key pillar of Bidenomics.  
  
National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard
[highlighted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/24/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-national-economic-council-director-lael-brainard-on-the-right-to-repair/)
the importance of right to repair to President Biden’s work on behalf of
consumers and a level playing field for small independent repair
businesses, and roundtable participants discussed on-the-ground progress
since President Biden endorsed the right to repair in his [Executive
Order on Promoting
Competition](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/).
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan explained the benefits of
competition in repair markets to lower costs and increase opportunities
for small businesses, and highlighted FTC’s bipartisan, unanimous
enforcement policy and successful cases that make it easier to repair
everything from grills to motorcycles. Janet McCabe, Deputy
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), explained
how the right to repair extends the lifecycle of products—reducing waste
and helping combat climate change—and the EPA’s efforts to promote the
repairability of farm equipment.  
  
The roundtable included a bipartisan group of state officials who spoke
about legislative successes of the last year, including the passage of
right to repair legislation in California, Colorado, Minnesota and New
York. A farmer from Colorado and an independent repair shop owner from
Minnesota explained how these legislative wins will save consumers and
farmers money and create opportunities for small businesses.  
  
The roundtable also included businesses that support the right to
repair. During the roundtable, Apple called for strong national right to
repair legislation, and announced it will honor the provisions of the
recently-enacted California right to repair law nationwide—benefitting
consumers in every state. California’s new law requires manufacturers to
make the parts, tools, and documentation needed to diagnose, maintain,
and repair consumer electronic devices and appliances available to
independent repair shops and consumers at fair and reasonable prices.
Allstate Insurance also spoke to how greater access to parts and
independent repair options for vehicle repair can save consumers
hundreds of dollars, and joined the call for federal legislation.

Since President Biden’s Executive Order, the Administration and states
have taken a number of actions to further the right to repair across
industries, including:

-   The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted
    [unanimously](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-ramp-law-enforcement-against-illegal-repair-restrictions)
    to ramp up law enforcement of right to repair restrictions that
    prevent small businesses, workers, consumers from fixing their own
    products. Since then, they’ve [announced
    settlements](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/07/ftc-announces-three-right-repair-cases-do-your-warranties-comply-law)
    in multiple right to repair cases.  
-   The [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wrote a
    letter](https://files.constantcontact.com/63400020701/bfa78700-0f65-4f17-bfc8-1a9c05916b6f.pdf?rdr=true)
    to the National Farmers Union affirming its support for the right to
    repair and clarifying that the right to repair is compatible with
    Clean Air Act provisions, illustrating how a right to repair goes
    hand in hand with environmental laws.  
-   The [EPA released a
    report](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-08/lithium-ion-battery-report-update-7.01_508.pdf)
    on how the improper disposal of lithium-ion batteries, commonly
    found in cellphones and laptops, can cause dangerous fires in waste
    handling and recycling facilities. When batteries in consumer
    devices are easy to remove, consumers benefit from devices with a
    longer life, waste is reduced, and batteries can more easily be
    removed and recycled safely.  
-   The [U.S. Copyright office](https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2021/)
    included expanded exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
    that support more access to diagnosis, maintenance, and repair
    capabilities.  
-   Over 30 states have introduced right to repair legislation covering
    a broad range of sectors, with new laws passed in Colorado,
    Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York in just the last three years.
