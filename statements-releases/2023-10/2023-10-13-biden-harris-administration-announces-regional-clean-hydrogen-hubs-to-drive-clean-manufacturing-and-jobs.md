*Investing in American Infrastructure and Manufacturing is a key part of
Bidenomics and the President’s Investing in America agenda  
*

Today, President Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm are
announcing seven regional clean hydrogen hubs that were selected to
receive $7 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to
accelerate the domestic market for low-cost, clean hydrogen.

Advancing clean hydrogen is essential to achieving the President’s
vision of a strong clean energy economy that strengthens energy
security, bolsters domestic manufacturing, creates healthier
communities, and delivers new jobs and economic opportunities across the
nation. The announcement is part of the third installment of the
Investing in America tour, during which President Biden will travel to
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to announce the historic investment in
manufacturing and jobs.

The seven selected regional clean hydrogen hubs will catalyze more than
$40 billion in private investment and create tens of thousands of
good-paying jobs – bringing the total public and private investment in
hydrogen hubs to nearly $50 billion. Roughly two-thirds of total project
investment are associated with green (electrolysis based) production,
within the hubs. Several of the hubs were developed in close
partnerships with unions, with three requiring project labor agreements
(PLAs). In addition to job creation and creating healthier air for
communities, the hydrogen selected hubs are committed to robust
Community Benefit Plans to ensure local priorities are at the forefront
and all communities share in the benefits of the clean energy
transition.  
  
Collectively, the hubs aim to produce more than three million metric
tons of clean hydrogen per year, thereby achieving nearly one third of
the 2030 U.S. clean hydrogen production goal. Together, the seven
Hydrogen Hubs will eliminate 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
emissions from end uses each year—an amount roughly equivalent to
combined annual emissions of over 5.5 million gasoline-powered cars. The
nearly $50 billion investment is one of the largest investments in clean
manufacturing and jobs in history.  
  
Clean hydrogen can reduce emissions in many sectors of the economy and
is especially important for hard-to-decarbonize sectors and industrial
processes, such as heavy-duty transportation and chemical, steel, and
cement manufacturing. Targeted investments in these areas can help
reduce costs, make new breakthroughs, and create jobs for American
engineers, manufacturing workers, construction workers, and others.   
  
In the fewer than three years since taking office, President Biden’s
leadership to reinvigorate the American economy and tackle the climate
crisis has boosted U.S. manufacturing and deployment of cost-cutting
clean energy technologies. The President is delivering on his day one
promise by positioning the United States to achieve our ambitious goals
of onshoring production of clean technologies and creating good-paying
union jobs.

**Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs  
**  
Today, the President is in Philadelphia to announce seven regional clean

**Investing in America, Investing in Clean Hydrogen  
**  
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $65 billion in
clean energy investments at the Department of Energy (DOE), including $8
billion for a Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program to support the
development of hubs for clean hydrogen production, delivery, and
end-use. Hydrogen can be produced from diverse domestic resources like
solar energy, wind, nuclear energy, biomass, and natural gas with safe
and responsible carbon capture, with the potential for near-zero
greenhouse gas emissions from production. Seven billion dollars of this
program is going towards the development of the regional clean hydrogen
hubs that will catalyze multistate hydrogen ecosystems that ultimately
will expand and connect to form a national hydrogen economy.  Up to $1
billion of the remaining funding will be used for demand-side support
for the hubs to drive innovative end-uses of clean hydrogen.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring safe hydrogen
deployment and mitigating potential social, economic, technical, and
environmental risks. The hubs are covered under the [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
which aims to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain
federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are
marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Hubs have
also submitted detailed Community Benefits Plans, including how the
project performers will transparently communicate, eliminate, mitigate,
and minimize risks.

Through investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the
Inflation Reduction Act, DOE is pursuing a suite of technologies to
produce clean energy across the board to invest in clean manufacturing,
tackle the climate crisis and enhance energy security. To further
support DOE’s Hydrogen Shot to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80%
to $1 per one kilogram in one decade, DOE has announced other resources
to support clean hydrogen research and development. DOE’s new Hydrogen
Hub Matchmaker resource is helping clean hydrogen producers, end-users,
and others find opportunities to develop networks of production,
storage, and transportation infrastructure. In addition to the hubs, the
DOE has launched other clean hydrogen programs:

-   $1 billion for a Clean Hydrogen Electrolysis Program: Electrolysis
    (using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen) allows
    for clean hydrogen production from carbon pollution-free power
    sources like wind, solar, and nuclear. This program will improve the
    efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these technologies by
    supporting the entire innovation chain—from research, development,
    and demonstration to commercialization and deployment.  
-   $500 million for Clean Hydrogen Manufacturing and Recycling RD&D
    Activities: DOE will also support American manufacturing of clean
    hydrogen equipment, including projects that improve efficiency and
    cost-effectiveness and support domestic supply chains for key
    components, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Clean
    Hydrogen Manufacturing Initiative. DOE has also announced funding,
    as part of the Clean Hydrogen Technology Recycling Research,
    Development, and Demonstration Program, for innovative approaches to
    increase the reuse and recycling of clean hydrogen technologies.  
-   In March 2023, DOE announced the first phase of funding for the
    Clean Hydrogen Electrolysis Program and the BIL’s manufacturing and
    recycling initiatives with a $750 million funding opportunity to
    dramatically reduce the cost of electrolyzers and other
    clean-hydrogen technologies. Even before project selections have
    been announced, these initiatives are already demonstrating payoffs
    by building investor confidence: [private sector
    commitments](https://www.weforum.org/first-movers-coalition/members) from
    the First Movers Coalition represent 1 million metric tons per year
    of clean hydrogen demand, and recently announced projects amount
    to 12 million metric tons per year of planned clean hydrogen
    production in the United States.  
-   The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office has also completed
    investments in clean hydrogen facilities.
