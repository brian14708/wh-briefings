  Israel"

This afternoon, President Biden and Vice President Harris spoke with
Prime Minister Netanyahu to provide an update on ongoing U.S. support
for Israel.  The President explained that he had just been briefed by
his national security team. He detailed the U.S. support that had
arrived or would soon be on its way to include ammunition, Iron Dome
interceptors, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, and other defense
materiel.  
  
The President underscored the need for all countries to unequivocally
condemn Hamas’s brutal atrocities, which are akin to the atrocities of
ISIS from many years ago.  The Prime Minister provided an update from
Israel and the spirit of the Israeli people as they unite to protect
their country and their people against Hamas and all other threats.   
  
The two leaders agreed to speak again in the next few days.
