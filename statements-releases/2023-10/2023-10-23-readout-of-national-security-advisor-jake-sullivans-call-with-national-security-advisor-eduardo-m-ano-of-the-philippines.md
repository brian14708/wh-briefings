---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke over the phone today with
Philippine National Security Advisor Eduardo M. Año.  Mr. Sullivan
reiterated U.S. support for our Philippine allies following the PRC
Coast Guard and maritime militia’s dangerous and unlawful actions on
October 22 obstructing a routine Philippine resupply to Second Thomas
Shoal.  Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Año reaffirmed the enduring alliance and
friendship between our nations and discussed upcoming U.S.-Philippine
engagements and ways to further strengthen our close partnership.  Mr.
Sullivan emphasized the ironclad U.S. alliance commitments to the
Philippines under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty, which
extends to armed attacks on Philippine public vessels, aircraft, and
armed forces—to include those of its Coast Guard—in the Pacific,
including in the South China Sea.
