Jill and I congratulate Speaker Johnson on his election.

As I said when this process began, whoever the Speaker is, I will seek
to work with them in good faith on behalf of the American people.

That’s a principle I have always held to, and that I’ve acted on –
delivering major bipartisan legislation on infrastructure, outcompeting
China, gun reform, and veterans care.

I restated my willingness to continue working across the aisle after
Republicans won the majority in the House last year. By the same token,
the American people have made clear that they expect House Republicans
to work with me and with Senate Democrats to govern across the aisle –
to protect our urgent national security interests and grow our economy
for the middle class.

While House Republicans spent the last 22 days determining who would
lead their conference, I have worked on those pressing issues, proposing
a historic supplemental funding package that advances our bipartisan
national security interests in Israel and Ukraine, secures our border,
and invests in the American people.  These priorities have been endorsed
by leaders in both parties.

We need to move swiftly to address our national security needs and to
avoid a shutdown in 22 days.

Even though we have real disagreements about important issues, there
should be mutual effort to find common ground wherever we can.

This is a time for all of us to act responsibly, and to put the good of
the American people and the everyday priorities of American families
above any partisanship.
