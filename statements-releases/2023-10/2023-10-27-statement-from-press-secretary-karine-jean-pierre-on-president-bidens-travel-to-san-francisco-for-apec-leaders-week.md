President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to San Francisco,
California, on November 14, 2023 to host representatives from the
21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member economies for
APEC Economic Leaders’ Week (AELW). President Biden will highlight the
strength and resilience of the U.S. economy, our longstanding economic
ties with the Asia-Pacific, the surge of job-creating investments from
APEC economies into the United States in recent years, and the role of
the U.S. economy in driving growth and innovation in the Asia-Pacific
and globally. He will also reaffirm our commitment to partnering with
APEC economies to chart the next chapter of sustainable,
inclusive regional growth, further strengthen the ties between our
economies and our populations, and support American families and
workers.
