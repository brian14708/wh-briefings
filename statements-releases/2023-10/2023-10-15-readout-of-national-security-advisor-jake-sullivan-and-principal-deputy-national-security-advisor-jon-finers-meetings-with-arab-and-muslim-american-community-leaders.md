On October 13, 2023, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and
Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer held sessions with
Arab and Muslim American community leaders in the wake of Hamas’s
abhorrent attack in Israel and the resulting conflict in Gaza.   
   
During the conversations, community leaders shared a range of
experiences, suggestions, and concerns. Sullivan and Finer briefed on
Administration efforts to assist Americans attempting to leave Gaza and
the West Bank and provided the latest updates on U.S. Government
coordination with the United Nations, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and others
in the region to facilitate humanitarian assistance and ensure civilians
have access to water, food, and medical care in Gaza.   
   
Sullivan and Finer reiterated President Biden’s remarks that there is no
place in America for hatred of any community, and they discussed with
participants how the federal government can support affected
communities.
