title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Third Quarter 2023 GDP\_Report"
---
 
I always say it is a mistake to bet against the American people, and
just today we learned the economy grew 4.9% in the third quarter.  I
never believed we would need a recession to bring inflation down – and
today we saw again that the American economy continues to grow even as
inflation has come down. It is a testament to the resilience of American
consumers and American workers, supported by Bidenomics—my plan to grow
the economy by growing the middle class.  The unemployment rate has been
below 4% for 20 months in a row, real wages are up over the last year,
and median wealth for American families has grown by a record amount
accounting for inflation. Just yesterday, the UAW and Ford reached a
historic tentative agreement that provides a record raise to auto
workers and is a testament to our strategy for a powerful manufacturing
future made in America, with good, union jobs.  I hope Republicans in
Congress will join me in working to build on this progress, rather than
putting our economy at risk with reckless threats of a shutdown or
proposals to cut taxes for the wealthy and large corporations, while
slashing programs that are essential for hard-working families and
seniors.
