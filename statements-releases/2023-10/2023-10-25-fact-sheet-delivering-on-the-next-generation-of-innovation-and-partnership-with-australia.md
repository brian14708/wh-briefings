President Biden of the United States is welcoming Prime Minister
Albanese of Australia on October 25, 2023 for an official visit and
state dinner.  The two leaders will reaffirm the strength of the
U.S.-Australia alliance and the evolution of its reach beyond defense
and security into a force for increased prosperity and innovation across
the Indo-Pacific region and around the world.   
  
The United States and Australia unequivocally condemn Hamas’s abhorrent
attack on Israel and reaffirm Israel’s right to defend itself.  We urge
regional de-escalation and do not want to see this conflict widen,
expand, or deepen.  We support ongoing efforts to secure the release of
hostages taken by Hamas.  In response to the conflict launched by Hamas,
we underscore the critical importance of operating consistent with
international humanitarian law to include the protection of civilians in
Gaza.  Together, the United States and Australia are delivering more
than $115 million in humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people
in Gaza and the West Bank.

        parts for a variety of armored platforms; demining equipment
        manufactured by Australian including countermine metal detectors
        used for the detection of mines, IEDs, unexploded ordnance, and
        cluster munitions; and Australian designed and built
        ultra-lightweight x-ray unit that provides high quality imaging
        at the point of care for patients.  
    -   In addition to support to Ukraine, Australia responded to a
        request from the United States to deploy a Royal Australian Air
        Force E-7A Wedgetail Aircraft to Germany.  The Australian
        deployment will bolster the multilayered protection of the flow
        of international support to Ukraine by providing early warning
        of a threat against the gateway of military assistance.  
-   **Enhancing Trilateral Defense Cooperation with Japan:**  The United
    States and Australia welcomed additional efforts to increase
    trilateral cooperation with Japan, including Australia’s future
    participation for the first time in the YAMA SAKURA exercise in 2023
    and KEEN EDGE exercise in 2024, both in Japan. Today, we announced
    our intention to explore trilateral cooperation with Japan on
    Unmanned Aerial Systems.  Our cooperation will enhance
    interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly
    emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy.    
-   **Collaborative Combat Aircraft Cooperation:** The United States and
    Australia are committed to bilateral cooperation on collaborative
    combat aircraft. Our cooperation will enhance interoperability and
    accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of
    Unmanned Aerial Systems. In addition, Australia welcomed the U.S.
    decision to acquire the E-7A Wedgetail, and continued U.S.
    cooperation with Australia to ensure we can jointly develop and
    operate advanced military capabilities.  
-   **Updating the Alliance to Meet Threats in New Domains:**  Today,
    President Biden and Prime Minister Albanese reaffirmed that
    international law applies in cyberspace and that a cyber attack on
    our nations could constitute an armed attack under Article IV of the
    ANZUS Treaty. A decision as to when such a cyber attack would lead
    to the invocation of Article IV would be made on a case-by-case
    basis through close consultations between Australia and the United
    States.   
-   **Enhancing Bilateral Defense Cooperation:**  Following the
    announcements made at AUSMIN 2023, the United States and Australia
    have made progress on the delivery of Enhanced Force Posture
    cooperation, including the rotation of U.S. Army Watercraft in
    Australia which started in July.  We also completed a new fuel
    facility at Royal Australian Air Force Base Darwin in support of
    Enhanced Air Cooperation between Australia and the United States.  
-   **Implementation of AUKUS Submarine Cooperation**: Following our
    trilateral announcement on March 13, 2023, the AUKUS nations are
    supporting Australia’s acquisition of a conventionally-armed,
    nuclear-powered submarine (SSN) capability at the earliest possible
    date while setting the highest non-proliferation standard.  In
    support of Australia’s commitment to responsible stewardship of
    naval nuclear propulsion technology and to support Australia’s
    development of infrastructure, technical capabilities industry and
    human capital, Australian military personnel have begun training in
    the United States, with the first Australian military personnel
    graduating from U.S. nuclear power school in July.  Additionally,
    the USS North Carolina completed the first SSN port visit to
    Australia as a part of AUKUS in August. We have also deepened our
    cooperation on advanced capabilities, including the first
    demonstration of AUKUS artificial intelligence and autonomous
    capabilities in the United Kingdom in April.  
-   **Streamlining Defense Trade Cooperation and Protecting
    Technology:**  Together, the United States and Australia are taking
    significant steps to streamline defense information and technology
    cooperation, including continuing to support AUKUS implementation
    while protecting critical technology.   
    -   The Biden Administration has proposed to Congress an ambitious
        proposal to transform U.S. export control laws. Australia is
        also examining its export control framework to streamline the
        flow of defense information and technology and is taking steps
        to realize this ambition.  Both nations are committed to
        strengthening their security standards to safeguard sensitive
        technology and information.  Collectively, these actions are
        designed to enhance and expedite collaboration between and among
        AUKUS partners to help us maintain our capability edge, while
        strengthening our ability to protect the sensitive technologies
        that underpin our security.   
    -   As we strengthen and integrate our innovation ecosystems, we
        have a shared interest in enhancing our technology protection
        toolkits to ensure sensitive advanced technologies critical to
        military modernization cannot be used to undermine international
        peace and security. Australia acknowledges the strategic
        rationale of the U.S. Executive Order to advance a targeted set
        of controls on outbound investments in sensitive technologies
        with a core national security nexus. Australia regularly reviews
        its investment settings to ensure they remain fit for purpose to
        deal with emerging risks. We intend to maintain close
        consultations and communicate clearly to the private sector
        regarding our joint resolve and shared objectives in this area,
        and will maintain our long-standing commitment to investment and
        to open and fair trade.

**Strengthening People-to-People Ties**  
Our Alliance is supported by our strong people-to-people ties,
democratic values, respect for human rights, and support for
marginalized groups.  

-   **Increasing Connectivity:**  The United States is pleased to begin
    initial discussions with its international partners, including
    Australia, to explore a U.S. Transportation Security Administration
    “One Stop Security” pilot program. “One Stop Security” would
    streamline security screening requirements and shorten transit times
    for covered passenger populations. We appreciate Australia’s
    interest in this pilot opportunity and look forward to continuing
    conversations based on security commensurability.  
-   **Strengthening Alliance and Regional Solidarity**: The United
    States is providing $500,000 for public diplomacy programming in
    Australia to increase understanding of the U.S.-Australia alliance
    both within Australia and the broader Indo-Pacific region. These
    engagements will forge new avenues for cooperation on climate
    change, economic security, and emerging technology while also
    promoting new ideas on strengthening the alliance and fortifying
    regional solidarity.  
-   **Growing Economic Opportunities for Indigenous Peoples:** 
    Australia and the U.S. have a shared interest in ensuring that our
    trade and investment agenda delivers inclusive economic growth and
    benefits for everyone. Today we have also committed to work
    together, and in genuine partnership with Indigenous businesses and
    stakeholders from both Australia and the United States, to grow
    opportunities for our Indigenous Peoples to enjoy the economic
    prosperity created by our two-way trade and investment.  Leaders
    welcomed the opportunities that will be created by the United States
    announcement of $250,000 in new funding that will work with
    Australian government programs to support ongoing dialogue,
    knowledge-sharing and increased business opportunities for our
    Indigenous Peoples over coming months and years.  
    -   This week Australia and the United States held a roundtable
        between Indigenous businesses and government leaders from both
        nations, including Supply Nation’s Australian Indigenous
        Business Delegation, who are travelling across the United States
        to grow important Indigenous commercial and cultural ties.

**Advancing Gender Equality and Human Rights**  

-   **Strengthening Bilateral Gender Equality Policy Coordination:** 
    The United States and Australia are reinforcing our already strong
    coordination to advance gender equality globally through an annual
    bilateral strategic dialogue.  Australia intends to host the next
    iteration of the bilateral strategic dialogue in 2024.  
-   **Investing in Women’s Economic Empowerment:**  Together we will
    serve as founding members of the Women in the Sustainable Economy
    initiative, working jointly and with government and private sector
    partners to increase women’s access to jobs, training, leadership
    opportunities, and finance in the green and blue sectors.  We intend
    to also continue to partner to advance access to digital
    technologies for all women and girls, including through the Women in
    the Digital Economy Initiative, and plan to work together to expand
    access to quality, affordable childcare through the World Bank’s
    Invest in Childcare initiative.  
-   **Addressing Gender-Based Violence Globally and Implementing the
    Women, Peace, and Security Agenda and the Sustainable Development
    Goals: ** Together we recommit to joint efforts to achieve SDG5,
    promote women’s leadership, and counter efforts to push back against
    women’s and girls’ human rights. The U.S. and Australia intend to
    continue working together and with partners to combat all forms of
    gender-based violence, online and offline, and fully implement the
    Women, Peace and Security agenda, especially in the Indo-Pacific
    region.  
-   **Combatting Online Child Sexual Exploitation:** We are officially
    launching the U.S.-Australia Joint Council on Combatting Online
    Child Sexual Exploitation, which will meet for the first time on
    November 16, ahead of the World Day for the Prevention of and
    Healing from Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Violence, on
    November 18. Co-chaired by Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas
    and Australian Attorney General Dreyfus, the Council will oversee
    and implement a trauma-informed and victim and survivor-centered
    multidisciplinary workplan bringing together experts across our
    governments, focused on:  cooperation in the Indo-Pacific; research
    and development; operational opportunities; policy; prevention,
    awareness, and outreach; and Safety by Design.  
-   **Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons:** Australia and the
    United States have committed to strengthening our work together to
    promote respect for the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons in the
    Indo-Pacific.  Australia contributed over $1 million this year to
    co-fund projects through the Global Equality Fund that will
    strengthen the capacity of local and regional organizations to
    advocate for legal protections and increase inclusion.  
-   **Promoting, Protecting and Fulfilling the Human Rights of Persons
    with Disabilities:** The United States and Australia are deepening
    cooperation to promote, protect and fulfil the human rights of
    persons with disabilities, and strengthen their inclusion. 
    Together, we have provided funding to support ASEAN, ASEAN Member
    State governments, and organizations of persons with disabilities to
    implement the *ASEAN Enabling Masterplan: Mainstreaming the Rights
    of Persons with Disabilities*.
