**See President Biden’s video announcing the news
[HERE](https://x.com/POTUS/status/1709177956285759844?s=20%20): “Today I
can announce that the manufacturers of ten drugs are coming to the
negotiating table to lower prices. They’re taking steps to participate
in the negotiating program so we can give seniors the best possible
deal.”**

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration took another major step towards
lower health care costs for seniors and families and announced that all
manufacturers of all ten drugs selected for negotiation have signed
agreements to participate in the Inflation Reduction Act’s Medicare Drug
Price Negotiation Program. For decades, Big Pharma fought to block
Medicare from directly negotiating lower drug prices for seniors and
other Medicare beneficiaries, while nearly [three in
ten](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-july-2023-the-publics-views-of-new-prescription-weight-loss-drugs-and-prescription-drug-costs/)
Americans struggle to afford their medications because of cost.
President Biden and Congressional Democrats finally beat Big Pharma and
allowed Medicare to directly negotiate lower drug prices by passing the
Inflation Reduction Act – despite zero Republicans voting in favor of
the bill. 

In total, the 10 drugs selected for negotiation accounted for $3.4
billion in out-of-pocket costs for an estimated 9 million Medicare
enrollees in 2022. These drugs are used to treat heart failure,
diabetes, arthritis, cancers, blood clots, and other conditions.

In August, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
announced the first ten drugs selected for Medicare drug price
negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act. The deadline for
manufacturers of these drugs to notify CMS whether they were
participating in the negotiation process was October 1<sup>st</sup>, and
the deadline to submit manufacturer-specific data to CMS was October
2<sup>nd</sup>.

Any prices negotiated for the first set of drugs participating in the
drug price negotiation program will go into effect in 2026. Over the
next 4 years, Medicare will negotiate prices for up to 60 drugs covered
under Medicare Part D and Part B, and up to an additional 20 drugs every
year after that.

**Continuing to Lower Prescription Drug Costs  
**  
Every day, millions of seniors are saving money on prescription drug
costs because of the Biden Administration’s actions. People with
Medicare are [saving an average of
$70](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/03/15/seniors-people-with-disabilities-likely-save-over-230-million-vaccines-thanks-inflation-reduction-act-according-new-hhs-report.html) in
out-of-pocket costs on vaccines like shingles and Tdap because President
Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act made recommended vaccines free for
beneficiaries starting this past January. Nearly four million seniors
and others on Medicare with diabetes had their insulin costs capped at
$35 per month this past January, [saving some seniors hundreds of
dollars](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/24/new-hhs-report-finds-major-savings-americans-who-use-insulin-thanks-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act.html) for
a month’s supply. And some seniors taking drugs covered under Part B for
which manufacturers have hiked prices faster than inflation are saving
up to
$[618](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/reduced-coinsurance-part-b-rebatable-drugs-oct-dec-2023.pdf)
in lower coinsurance this quarter thanks to the new Medicare inflation
rebates.

People with Medicare will continue to see their prescription drug costs
go down as more provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act go into effect
in the coming years. Medicare Part D enrollees will no longer pay 5%
co-insurance when they reach the catastrophic phase of their benefit
starting in 2024. Nearly 19 million seniors and other Medicare Part D
enrollees are [projected to save $400 per
year](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/07/07/hhs-announces-actions-protect-consumers-and-lower-health-care-costs.html) on
prescription drugs when the out-of-pocket cap drops to $2,000 in 2025,
and 1.9 million enrollees with the highest drug costs will save an
average of $2,500 per year. And, the prices negotiated for the
high-spend drugs selected in August will go into effect in 2026.
