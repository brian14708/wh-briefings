title: "Readout of White\_House Office of Public Engagement Stakeholder Call on Fall\
  \ Vaccination\_Campaign"
---
 
Yesterday, the Office of Public Engagement, Office of Pandemic
Preparedness and Response Policy and Centers for Disease Control
Prevention convened a stakeholder briefing to discuss ways to help
protect Americans this fall and winter respiratory virus season. The
Administration officials underscored that this is the first year we have
three vaccines to protect against flu, COVID-19 and RSV. During the
briefing, Administration officials recommended that people get
vaccinated in October ahead of the holiday season when people will be
gathering with family and friends, along with a reminder to order four
free tests per household on COVIDTests.gov. In addition, Administration
officials took questions from stakeholders on issues including the best
places to find information about where to get the new updated COVID-19
vaccine – vaccines.gov – and steps being taken to get vaccines into
nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  
  
Administration officials closed the meeting by thanking stakeholders for
their leadership in their communities, reminding them of their impact as
trusted messengers to help get the word out to Americans to get
vaccinated, get tested and get treated – actions that will truly save
lives and improve the quality of life across the country.
