title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Medicare Open\_Enrollment"
---
 
From day one, I vowed to strengthen Medicare for the millions of
Americans that have paid into this program from their very first
paycheck. Today, as Medicare open enrollment starts, seniors and their
families will be able to see the progress we’ve made in lowering health
care costs.  
   
Starting January 1, 2024, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act,
prescription drug costs will be more affordable. Seniors and other Part
D enrollees with high drug spending will have their out-of-pocket drug
costs capped at about $3,500 next year, and all enrollees will have
their costs capped at $2,000 in 2025. Low-income seniors and disabled
people will be able to get extra help paying for their premiums and
cost-sharing through the expanded Low Income Subsidy program. And, many
Medicare beneficiaries will continue to save hundreds of dollars on
their health care costs because Democrats capped the price of insulin at
$35 per month and made recommended vaccines free. I’m proud that
Congressional Democrats and I were able to deliver these cost savings
for millions of seniors and families, while every single Republican in
Congress voted to keep health care costs high, even for their own
constituents.  
   
Medicare is a lifeline for millions of seniors, and I will continue the
fight to lower health care costs and protect Medicare for generations to
come.
