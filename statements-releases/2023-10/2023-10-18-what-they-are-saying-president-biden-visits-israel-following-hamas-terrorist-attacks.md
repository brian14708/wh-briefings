title: "WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: President\_Biden Visits Israel Following Hamas Terrorist\_\
  Attacks"
---
 
Today, President Biden traveled to Israel to stand in solidarity with
the people of Israel in the wake of horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas
that killed more than 1,300 innocent civilians, including at least 31
U.S. citizens. As the President made clear during the trip, Israel is
not alone – and with U.S. support it will remain a safe, security,
Jewish, and Democratic state today, tomorrow, and forever.  
   
The President also addressed the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza,
and announced new humanitarian aid to alleviate the suffering of
innocent Palestinians, who are paying the price for Hamas’s terror and
barbaric tactics.   
   
On the heels of President Biden’s trip Israel today, a wide spectrum of
leaders and commentators are sharing reflections on the resonance of his
speech in Israel and across the globe. *See what they are

depth of your personal commitment to Israel.  It speaks to the depth of
your personal commitment to the future of the Jewish people and the one

when I say: Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you for standing with
Israel today, tomorrow, and always.”
