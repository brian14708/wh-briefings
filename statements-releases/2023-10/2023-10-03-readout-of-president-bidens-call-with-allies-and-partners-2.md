---
 
Today, President Biden convened a call with allies and partners to
coordinate our ongoing support for the people of Ukraine as they defend
their freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal invasion.
President Biden reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to supporting
Ukraine for as long as it takes as it defends its sovereignty and
territorial integrity, with fellow leaders echoing their commitments. 
The leaders discussed efforts to provide Ukraine with the ammunition and
weapons systems it needs to defend its territory against Russian
aggression, to strengthen Ukraine’s air defenses to protect its critical
infrastructure from Russia’s aerial assaults now and in the coming
months, and to repair and harden its energy infrastructure through this
winter.  They also discussed ongoing work to align and broaden donor
efforts to support Ukraine’s economic recovery, as well as to work
together with the global community to address the energy, economic and
food security challenges caused by Russia’s war of choice.  
  
Joining President Biden on the call was Prime Minister Trudeau of
Canada, President von der Leyen of the European Commission, President
Michel of the European Council, Chancellor Scholz of Germany, Prime
Minister Meloni of Italy, Prime Minister Kishida of Japan, NATO
Secretary General Stoltenberg, President Duda of Poland, President
Iohannis of Romania, Prime Minister Sunak of the United Kingdom, and
Foreign Minister Colonna of France.
