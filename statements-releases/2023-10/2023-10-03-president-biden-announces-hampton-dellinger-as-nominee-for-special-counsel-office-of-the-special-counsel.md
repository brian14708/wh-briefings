WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate
Hampton Dellinger to serve as Special Counsel, Office of the Special
Counsel. * *

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is an independent federal
investigative and prosecutorial agency. OSC’s basic authorities come
from four federal statutes: the Ci​vil Service Reform Act, the
Whistleblower Protection Act, the Hatch Act, and the Uniformed Services
Employment & Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).​

After being confirmed by the United States Senate with bipartisan
support in October 2021, Hampton Dellinger served in the U.S. Department
of Justice (DOJ) as an Assistant Attorney General overseeing the Office
of Legal Policy (OLP) until June 2023. He received an award in
appreciation for his work which included vetting potential nominees to
the federal judiciary, coordinating DOJ rule making, and handling policy
assignments at the direction of DOJ leaders. OLP policy projects during
his tenure included updating guidelines for the support of crime victims
and witnesses and making important contributions to the National
Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking. Under Dellinger’s leadership, OLP
also played a key coordinating role in the Department’s implementation
of the President’s Executive Order on Advancing Effective, Accountable
Policing and Criminal Justice Practices as well as the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act. In addition, Dellinger worked to enhance the
reliability of forensic science in investigations and prosecutions. 

Dellinger is a former Deputy Attorney General in the North Carolina
Department of Justice and served as Chief Legal Counsel in the Office of
the North Carolina Governor. In those roles, he assisted with
investigations and initiatives to reduce Medicaid fraud, fight political
corruption, and improve public services. As a partner at regional and
national law firms, he has represented whistleblowers and other clients
challenging government activities. His work has led to taxpayer savings
by overturning unnecessarily costly bid awards. His writings on a range
of topics include criticism of government actions and proposals for
public sector improvements. Dellinger received his college degree from
the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and his law degree from the Yale
Law School.
