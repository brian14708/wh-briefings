National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke on the phone today with
National Security Advisor Sydney Mufamadi of South Africa.  National
Security Advisor Sullivan appreciated the seriousness with which
President Ramaphosa had addressed the concerns about the *Lady R*’s
activities last year.  The two National Security Advisors reaffirmed the
strong partnership between South Africa and the United States, and
recommitted to advance shared priorities including trade and investment,
infrastructure, health, and climate.  With regards to Russia’s war in
Ukraine, they confirmed they would continue to confer on pathways toward
a just and lasting peace.  National Security Advisor Sullivan thanked
the South Africans for hosting the African Growth and Opportunity Act
(AGOA) Forum in early November, underscoring the importance of this
landmark legislation for U.S. relations with the region.  In addition,
he expressed his condolences on the passing of South African politician,
diplomat, and anti-apartheid activist Aziz Pahad who inspired both South
Africans and Americans for his unwavering commitment to peace, justice,
and racial equality.
