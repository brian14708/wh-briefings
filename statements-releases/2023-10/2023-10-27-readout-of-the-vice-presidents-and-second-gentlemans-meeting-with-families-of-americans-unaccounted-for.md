  \ Families of Americans Unaccounted\_For"

Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff
met with families of Americans still unaccounted for following the
horrific October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. The Vice President
and Second Gentleman joined a meeting led by Special Presidential Envoy
for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens at the State Department. They
listened to the families’ experiences over the past several weeks, which
has been an agonizing ordeal, and expressed their support. 

The Vice President relayed to the families that there is no higher
priority for her and President Biden than the safety of American
citizens. The Vice President emphasized that the Biden-Harris
Administration is doing everything possible to bring these Americans
home and secure the release of all hostages held by Hamas.  The Vice
President also underscored that securing the hostages remains front and
center in our diplomatic conversations and that we are working with
partners in the Middle East to ensure that any country with influence
over Hamas brings that influence to bear to help secure the release of
hostages.
