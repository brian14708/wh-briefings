---
 
Once again, our nation is in mourning after yet another senseless and
tragic mass shooting. Today, Jill and I are praying for the Americans
who’ve lost their lives, for those still in critical care, and for the
families, survivors, and community members enduring shock and grief.   
   
I also urge area residents to heed the warnings and guidance of local
officials. Numerous Federal law enforcement personnel are on the scene
and actively working with state and local partners. As I told Maine
Governor Janet Mills, Senators Collins and King, and Congressman Golden
last night, I have directed my administration to provide everything that
is needed to support the people of Maine. We will continue to be there
every step of the way.  
   
For countless Americans who have survived gun violence and been
traumatized by it, a shooting such as this reopens deep and painful
wounds. Far too many Americans have now had a family member killed or
injured as a result of gun violence. That is not normal, and we cannot
accept it.  
   
While we have made progress on gun safety through the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act, the two dozen executive actions I’ve taken, and the
establishment of the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
Prevention, it’s simply not enough.  
  
Today, in the wake of yet another tragedy, I urge Republican lawmakers
in Congress to fulfill their duty to protect the American people. Work
with us to pass a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity
magazines, to enact universal background checks, to require safe storage
of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. This is
the very least we owe every American who will now bear the scars —
physical and mental — of this latest attack.
