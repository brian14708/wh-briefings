title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Historic Tentative Agreement Between\
  \ Stellantis and\_UAW"
---
 
I applaud the UAW and Stellantis for coming together after hard fought,
good faith negotiations to reach a historic agreement that will
guarantee workers the pay, benefits, dignity and respect they deserve.
This groundbreaking contract rewards the autoworkers who sacrificed so
much to revive our auto industry with record raises, more paid leave,
greater retirement security, and more rights and respect at work. Â I
want to applaud the UAW and Stellantis for agreeing to immediately bring
back all of the Stellantis workers who have been walking the picket line
on behalf of their UAW brothers and sisters. This contract is a
testament to the power of unions and collective bargaining to build
strong middle-class jobs while helping our most iconic American
companies thrive. The final word on this tentative agreement will
ultimately come from UAW Stellantis members themselves in the days and
weeks to come.
