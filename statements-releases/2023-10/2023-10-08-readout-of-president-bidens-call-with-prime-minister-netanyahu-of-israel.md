President Biden spoke this morning with Prime Minister Netanyahu of
Israel.  The President again expressed deep sympathy for all those
missing, wounded, and killed, and pledged his full support for the
Government and people of Israel in the face of an unprecedented and
appalling assault by Hamas terrorists.  They discussed the taking of
hostages by Hamas terrorists, including entire families, the elderly,
and young children.  The President emphasized that there is no
justification whatsoever for terrorism, and all countries must stand
united in the face of such brutal atrocities.   

President Biden updated the Prime Minister on the intensive diplomatic
engagement undertaken by the United States over the last 24 hours in
support of Israel.  The President also conveyed that additional
assistance for the Israeli Defense Forces is now on its way to Israel
with more to follow over the coming days.  The leaders also discussed
ongoing efforts to ensure that no enemies of Israel believe they can or
should seek advantage from the current situation.  

The two leaders committed to stay in regular contact over the coming
days.
