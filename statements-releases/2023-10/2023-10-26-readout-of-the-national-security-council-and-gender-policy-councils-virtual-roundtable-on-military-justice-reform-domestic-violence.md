title: "Readout of the National Security Council and Gender Policy Council\u2019s\
  \ Virtual Roundtable on Military Justice Reform & Domestic\_Violence"
---
 
On October 25, 2023, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and
Director of the Gender Policy Council, and Cara Abercrombie, Deputy
Assistant to the President and Coordinator for Defense Policy and Arms
Control on the National Security Council, hosted a virtual roundtable on
domestic violence in the military in recognition of National Domestic
Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. In discussion with experts from
the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and victim
advocates working with civilian and military survivors, the White House
highlighted the ways in which new reforms to the military justice system
will impact survivors of domestic violence in the military. Recognizing
that domestic abuse and all forms of gender-based violence take a great
toll on individuals, are fundamentally incompatible with military
values, and degrade mission readiness, President Biden has prioritized
military justice reform since Day One of the Administration, and in
July, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-implementing-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms/) implementing
historic, bipartisan reforms that significantly strengthen how the
military handles sexual assault, domestic violence, murder, and other
serious offenses. The Executive Order transferred key decision-making
authorities from commanders to specialized, independent military
prosecutors who will assume full prosecutorial discretion for covered
offenses from commanders on December 27, 2023.
