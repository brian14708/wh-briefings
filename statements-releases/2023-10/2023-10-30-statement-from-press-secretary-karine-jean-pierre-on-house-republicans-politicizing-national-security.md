title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on House Republicans Politicizing\
  \ National\_Security"
---
 
Politicizing our national security interests is a nonstarter. Demanding
offsets for meeting core national security needs of the United
States—like supporting Israel and defending Ukraine from atrocities and
Russian imperialism—would be a break with the normal, bipartisan process
and could have devastating implications for our safety and alliances in
the years ahead.  
   
There is strong bipartisan agreement that humanitarian aid is critical
to stopping the suffering of innocent people in Gaza, which is in our
direct national security interest.  
   
There is strong bipartisan agreement that it is in our direct national
security interest to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty against
appalling crimes being committed by Russian forces against thousands of
innocent civilians—including attacking them with Iranian weapons. Those
atrocities include the hideous use of rape as a weapon and the
kidnapping and forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children.  
   
There is also strong bipartisan support for investing more in border
security—including technology to detect fentanyl and hiring more CBP
officers—as the President called for.  
   
Threatening to undermine American national security unless House
Republicans can help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their
taxes—which would increase the deficit—is the definition of backwards.  
   
Playing political games that threaten the source of funding for Israel’s
self-defense—now and into the future—would set an unacceptable precedent
that calls our commitment to one of our closest allies into question. We
cannot afford to jeopardize that commitment as Israel defends itself
from the evil unleashed by Hamas.
