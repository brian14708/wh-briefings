President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke today with Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Mohamed bin Salman about the situation in the Middle East
region.  The President affirmed that the United States fully supports
the defense of U.S. partners facing terrorist threats, whether from
state or non-state actors.  He discussed ongoing diplomatic and military
efforts to deter state and non-state actors from widening the conflict
between Israel and Hamas.  The two leaders agreed on pursuing broader
diplomatic efforts to maintain stability across the region and prevent
the conflict from expanding.  They welcomed the delivery of humanitarian
assistance from Egypt into Gaza and recognized that much more is needed
for civilians to have sustained access to food, water, and medical
assistance.  The President welcomed the Gulf Cooperation Council’s
contribution of $100 million to support these humanitarian efforts, and
discussed the disbursement of $100 million from the United States to
support the response.  Both leaders welcomed ongoing efforts to secure
the release of hostages held by Hamas and called for their immediate
release.  They also affirmed the importance of working towards a
sustainable peace between Israelis and Palestinians as soon as the
crisis subsides, building on the work that was already underway between
Saudi Arabia and the United States over recent months.  They agreed to
remain in close coordination directly and through their teams over the
coming period.
