title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration to Kick Off Third Investing\
  \ in America Tour, Tout Historic Investments Benefitting Communities Across the\_\
  Country"
---
 
On Friday, October 6, on National Manufacturing Day, the Biden-Harris
Administration will kick off another multi-week Administration-wide tour
highlighting how Bidenomics and President Biden’s Investing in America
agenda is benefitting communities across the country.

The tour will feature President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady
Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, Cabinet members, and Senior
Administration Officials making dozens of stops in the coming two weeks
to show how Bidenomics is growing the economy from the middle out and
bottom up. This comes as Republicans in Congress continue to try to
block President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, try to repeal
critical pieces of legislation that have created jobs and helped drive
over $500 billion in private sector investments since the beginning of
his Administration, and oppose investments that are creating jobs and
opportunities in their own districts. Throughout the tour, the
Biden-Harris Administration will highlight the split screen contrasting
how President Biden is delivering for the American people, while
Republicans in Congress try to push their extreme MAGAnomics agenda and
failed trickle-down policies of the past.

The tour will kick off on Friday, where First Lady Jill Biden will visit
Dutchess Community College in Fishkill, New York and attend the launch
of a new mechatronics training lab funded in part by President Biden’s
American Rescue Plan. On Friday, the Administration will also hold an
Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint convening at the White House –
officially kicking off an intensive drive to build a diverse, skilled
pipeline of workers for good jobs, including union jobs, in advanced
manufacturing.

Over the course of the tour, President Biden and Administration leaders
will make major announcements around infrastructure – made possible by
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, private sector investments driven by
the Inflation Reduction Act, and highlight historic actions by the Biden
Administration to combat climate change, advance environmental justice,
and create good-paying jobs in industries that will drive American
competitiveness. The tour will also underscore that President Biden’s
investments are leaving no community behind, and helping cities and
towns across America become centers of innovation, job creation, and
opportunity.
