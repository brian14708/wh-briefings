title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Update in Lewiston, Maine\_Shooting"
---
 
This has been a tragic two days – not just for Lewiston, Maine, but for
our entire country.

Once again, an American community and American families have been
devastated by gun violence. In all, at least eighteen souls brutally
slain, more injured, some critically, and scores of family and friends
praying and experiencing trauma no one ever wants to imagine.

Numerous brave law enforcement officers have worked around the clock to
find this suspect and prevent the loss of more innocent life – all while
risking their own. They are the best of us.

Tonight we’re grateful that Lewiston and surrounding communities are
safe after spending excruciating days hiding in their homes. I thank
Governor Janet Mills for her steady leadership during this time of
crisis, and continue to direct my administration to provide everything
that is needed to support the people of Maine.

Americans should not have to live like this. I once again call
on Republicans in Congress to fulfill their obligation to keep the
American people safe. Until that day comes, I will continue to do
everything in my power to end this gun violence epidemic. The Lewiston
community – and all Americans – deserve nothing less.
