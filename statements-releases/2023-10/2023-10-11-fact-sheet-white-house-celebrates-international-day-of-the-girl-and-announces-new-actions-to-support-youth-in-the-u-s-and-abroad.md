title: "FACT SHEET: White\_House Celebrates International Day of the Girl and Announces\
  \ New Actions to Support Youth in the U.S. and\_Abroad"
---
 
The White House is marking International Day of the Girl—a moment to
celebrate the leadership of girls around the world and to recognize the
barriers that continue to limit their full participation. The
Biden-Harris Administration is also announcing new actions that build on
our investment in young people and expand opportunity for girls both at
home and abroad.

This afternoon, First Lady Jill Biden will host the first-ever “Girls
Leading Change” celebration at the White House to recognize the profound
impact young women are having on their communities across the United
States. The event will honor [15 young women
leaders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/11/first-lady-jill-biden-announces-girls-leading-change-honorees/),
selected by the White House Gender Policy Council, who are leading
change and shaping a brighter future for generations to come.  

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring that girls can
pursue their dreams free from discrimination, violence, or intimidation
and to advancing the safety, education, health, and wellbeing of girls
everywhere. Investing in our children means investing in our future—and
every young person should have the opportunity and resources they need
to succeed.

That’s why, just in the last month, the Biden-Harris Administration
announced important actions, including:

-   **Accelerating Learning, Improving Student Achievement, and
    Canceling Student Debt. **The Department of Education (ED)
    announced [new
    actions](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-build-work-accelerate-learning-and-improve-student-achievement) to
    build on the Administration’s historic investment in K-12 public
    schools, including by investing in literacy interventions and
    supports and building a diverse educator workforce. In addition, the
    Biden-Harris Administration has so far approved [$127
    billion](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-9-billion-student-debt-relief) in
    student debt cancellation for nearly 3.6 million Americans, helping
    to make college more affordable and ensuring that student loans
    aren’t a barrier to opportunity for students and families.  
     
-   **Supporting Youth Mental Health. **The Administration is making
    historic investments to support youth mental health, including among
    teen girls. The Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS) [recently
    announced](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/09/25/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-than-200-million-support-youth-mental-health.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Health,awards%20towards%20youth%20mental%20health.) $206
    million in grant awards towards youth mental health, which together
    will help expand access to mental health services for students in
    schools and improve access to mental health prevention and treatment
    for children and youth in communities across the country.  
     
-   **Preventing Gun Violence. **Tragically, gun violence is the leading
    killer of children and teenagers in the United States. The
    Biden-Harris Administration believes this is unacceptable, and
    recently [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-awards-over-44-billion-support-community-safety#:~:text=Justice%20Department%20Awards%20Over%20%244.4%20Billion%20to%20Support%20Community%20Safety,-Thursday%2C%20September%2028&text=The%20Justice%20Department%20announced%20today,safety%20and%20community%20justice%20activities.) new
    action to support community safety, reduce violent crime, prevent
    gun violence, and keep our kids safe in and out of school with $4.4
    billion in Department of Justice grants. President Biden also
    recently announced the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
    Prevention.  
     
-   **Improving Child Nutrition and Expanding School Meals.** The U.S.
    Department of
    Agriculture [announced](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/09/26/usda-expands-access-school-breakfast-and-lunch-more-students) that
    it is giving an estimated 3,000 more school districts in high-need
    areas the option to serve breakfast and lunch to all students at no
    cost, by expanding the availability of the Community Eligibility
    Provision (CEP). CEP helps lower food costs for families, increases
    food and nutrition security, and eliminates school meal debt.  
     
-   **Launching the American Climate Corps. **Through the Investing in
    America agenda, President Biden launched the [American Climate
    Corps](http://www.whitehouse.gov/climatecorps)**,** which will
    mobilize a new, diverse generation of more than 20,000 Americans and
    create pathways for young people to access the skills-based training
    necessary for good-paying careers in the clean energy and climate
    resilient economy, where women and girls have historically been
    underrepresented.  
     
-   **Protecting Children from Air Pollution.** The Environmental
    Protection
    Agency [made](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-makes-500-million-available-fund-school-buses-reduce) at
    least $500 million in funding available through the Clean School Bus
    rebate competition, which is protecting children from air pollution
    by transforming school bus fleets across America and builds on the
    Administration’s previous nearly $1 billion investment to improve
    air quality in and around schools.  
     
-   **Supporting Military-Connected Public-School Districts. **Earlier
    this month, the Department of Defense announced over $73 million in
    funding to enhance and expand educational opportunities for
    military-connected students, the largest single-year Department of
    Defense Education Activity grant investment in over a decade, which
    will impact over 200,000 students.  
     
-   **Supporting Vulnerable Youth. **HHS issued a [landmark
    package](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2023/hhs-announces-historic-child-welfare-package-expand-support-and-equity-child) of
    new rules to enhance equity in the child welfare system and advance
    the safety and wellbeing of families across the country, including
    for LGBTQI+ children in foster care. Also last month, the Department
    of
    Labor [announced](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/odep/odep20230907) new
    cooperative agreements to support disabled youth employment
    initiatives and improve outcomes for youth with disabilities,
    especially those from underserved communities.  
     
-   **Accelerating Progress to Close the Gender Digital Divide.** To
    help fulfill the historic commitment of G20 Leaders to halve the
    digital gender gap by 2030, the U.S. Agency for International
    Development (USAID) launched the Women in the Digital Economy
    Initiative, which brings together governments, private sector
    companies, foundations, civil society, and multilateral
    organizations to accelerate progress towards the closure of the
    gender digital divide, with contributions totaling over $515
    million. This initiative will expand women and girls’ access to
    digital learning opportunities that address critical employment and
    educational skill gaps.

Today, **the Biden-Harris Administration is taking additional
steps** that build on our investment in young people and expand
opportunity for girls both at home and abroad.  
**We are expanding education and leadership opportunities by:**

-   **Advancing Girls’ Education Globally. **USAID supports programs in
    more than 50 countries to promote girls’ education. To expand and
    continue this work, USAID will invest $20.6 million in new education
    initiatives in Nepal and Comoros focused on improving equitable
    education outcomes for marginalized youth, supporting local
    governments to bring out-of-school children back into school, and

    women with education and workforce readiness skills; mitigating
    harmful effects of child marriage through education, health, legal,
    and economic support; and raising awareness of the risks and harms
    associated with child marriage. In addition, for the first time, the
    United States will contribute to the United Nations Children’s Fund
    (UNICEF)–United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Global Programme to
    End Child Marriage, which works in 12 countries in Africa and South
    Asia to promote the rights of adolescent girls.
