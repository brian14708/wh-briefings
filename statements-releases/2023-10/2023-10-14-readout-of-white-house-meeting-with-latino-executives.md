On Wednesday, Biden-Harris Administration officials convened over 40
members of the National Alliance of Latino Community Development
Financial Institutions (CDFI) from across the country to discuss
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to ensure economic
prosperity for Latino communities and advance equity through the
American Rescue Plan.

Administration officials and Latino CDFI executives applauded the
President’s Bidenomics plan and the investments in underserved Latino
communities through efforts that include reducing barriers for Latino
businesses to receive federal funding, providing services to support
rural communities, increasing capital investment and securing training
for CDFIs to better achieve their stated goals. Administration officials
reiterated their equity action plans that each agency will be producing
to best serve all Americans.
