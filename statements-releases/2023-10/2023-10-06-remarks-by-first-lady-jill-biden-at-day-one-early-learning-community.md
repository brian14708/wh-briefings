Poughkeepsie, NY

\*\*\*  
Thank you, Chanel. You are doing such amazing things for this community.
And I know your daughter must be very proud.   
   
Secretary Cardona – Miguel, we do a lot of these events together. But
it’s always incredible to see your commitment to our nation’s students –
from our youngest to our oldest.  
   
Congressman Ryan, this community is better for your leadership.  
   
Gerri, Dr. Jordan, Superintendent Rosser, and all the Day One leaders,
I’m so grateful for all the heart and hard work you’ve put into helping
this community’s children – and adults – thrive.  
   
Mayor Nelson, Executive O’Neil, and all the state and local leaders
joining us, thank you for helping make programs like this a reality.  
   
When children are born, we look into their eyes and see every
possibility, don’t we? Infinite dreams. Limitless bounds. Endless
horizons.  
   
As a grandmother and a mother, I know that feeling well. You feel like
they can do anything – because they can.  
   
Children are the smartest investment we can make in our nation’s future
– when they grow up, they will be the ones to cure cancer, to solve the
climate crisis, to launch the next revolutionary company, to keep us out
of future wars.  
   
And we know that the most important time in a child’s development is
within the first few years of their life.  
   
But despite all that we know, education and care during those earliest
years remains out of reach for too many.  
   
As some of you may know, I teach writing at a community college outside
of Washington, D.C. And one day, I had a student come in with her
4-year-old.  
  
The moment I locked eyes with that student, I could see her distress,
and I knew exactly what happened: Her child care had fallen through, but
she couldn’t afford to miss the class. She set up her son with a box of
crayons and some paper in the corner of the room, and I tried to give
her a smile when I saw her looking at him nervously – praying he’d make
it through the class.  
   
That same scene plays out every day across the country. Maybe some of
you have seen it. Maybe some of you have been that parent. Maybe your
work or school didn’t let you bring your child in at all and you had to
lose pay or miss class.   
   
For the last few years, in every city I visit and at nearly every event
– whether we were there to talk about military spouses, or cancer
programs, or community colleges – people have told me that one of their
biggest challenges is child care.  
   
I know you’ve seen that challenge here in Poughkeepsie too, but you met
the moment.  
   
So, you came together in classrooms, in boardrooms, and in churches like
this one to write a different story – one where we invest in our
children’s education long before primary school begins, one where
families have access to high-quality care without breaking the bank, one
where child care workers are paid a living wage and parents are
empowered to pursue their careers. And our economy grows in the
process.  
   
Now, I know all of you know Gerri. We just heard how passionately she
talks about this. And all of you know that when she believes in
something, nothing is going to stand in her way. So, when she came to me
earlier this year and told me about this amazing effort, I knew I had to
come see it.  
   
Gerri, I’m grateful for everything you’re doing here. What I just saw at
Day One is incredible and innovative.  
   
You’re changing the lives of this community’s youngest members, and of
the adults who love and teach them.  
   
My husband, President Biden, has made child care a top priority. That’s
why he made sure federal dollars from the American Rescue Plan could be
used by states like New York to establish new child care programs, to
raise wages for their workers, and support universal pre-K.  
   
And he’s called on Congress to make long-term investments to lower the
costs further for families.  
  
Because there’s a ripple effect when a mom is able to pursue a career
she loves because she doesn’t have to worry where her child will go.
When parents don’t have to choose between paying grocery bills and
paying the child care provider.  
   
When our children are set on a lifelong path of learning, so they can
succeed in school and in their careers.  
   
So thank you for making that possible in this community. And know that
you will always have a committed partner in Joe and his
Administration.  
   
Together, we will unlock those infinite possibilities that exist in
every child, and give their parents and their educators the chance to
keep reaching for a brighter future for us all.  
   
Thank you.
