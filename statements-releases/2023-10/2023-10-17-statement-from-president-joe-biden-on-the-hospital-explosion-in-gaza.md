title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Hospital Explosion in\_Gaza"
---
 
I am outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab
hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted.
Immediately upon hearing this news, I spoke with King Abdullah II of
Jordan, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my
national security team to continue gathering information about what
exactly happened. The United States stands unequivocally for the
protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients,
medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy.
