President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke this afternoon with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. The President welcomed the release of two
additional hostages from Gaza earlier today, and reaffirmed his
commitment to ongoing efforts to secure the release of all the remaining
hostages taken by Hamas – including Americans – and to provide for safe
passage for U.S. citizens and other civilians in Gaza.  The President
also underscored the need to sustain a continuous flow of urgently
needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza.  The President updated the
Prime Minister on U.S. support for Israel and ongoing efforts at
regional deterrence, to include new U.S. military deployments.  They
 agreed to speak again in the coming days.
