title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces New Efforts to Expand Capital\
  \ Access and Contracting Opportunities for Minority-Owned and Underserved Businesses\
  \ at the Freedman\u2019s Bank\_Forum"

*The Investing in America Agenda continues to deliver for small
businesses and provide economic opportunity throughout the United
States.  
*

Today, Vice President Harris is announcing new actions to help
historically under-resourced suppliers, small businesses, and
communities share in the economic opportunity created by the
Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda – a key pillar
of Bidenomics – that is building the economy from the bottom up and
middle out. 

**“To bridge the financial disparities that hold so many of our
communities back, we must continue to work together to combine the
capacity of the private sector with the reach and the scale that only
the government can provide. When we do, we create opportunity and
prosperity for millions of Americans,” said Vice President Kamala
Harris.  
**  
The historic Investing in America agenda has spurred a factory building
boom that will rely on diverse suppliers for continued success. The
construction of manufacturing facilities contributed more to real gross
domestic product in the first six months of this year than any other
six-month period on record. And, last year’s foreign direct investment
in new U.S. manufacturing facilities was almost double the pre-pandemic
average.

It is important that the benefits of this economic opportunity are
shared equitably. Diversification of suppliers—in manufacturing,
construction, and related services—ensures that the country’s supply
chain is more resilient and that the economy benefits from the talent
and potential across the country. Considering diverse suppliers are
often small- and medium-sized businesses, their equitable participation
in the Investing in America agenda will provide a path to economic
prosperity and intergenerational wealth for countless Americans in
underserved communities.

That is why the Administration has awarded a record-breaking nearly [$70
billion](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/07/18/biden-harris-administration-sets-record-breaking-163-billion-federal-procurement-opportunities-small)
in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022—a new record—on federal contracts awarded to
small, disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). And it has invested $12 billion
in community lenders—including Community Development Financial
Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) – to
expand access to capital and resources to too-often sidelined
entrepreneurs.

The U.S. Department of Treasury estimates that these investments in
community lenders will result in a $50 billion increase in lending to
Latino communities and a nearly $80 billion increase in lending to Black
communities over the next decade. One-third of new loans made by CDFIs
and MDIs that received investments under the Department of Treasury’s
Emergency Capital Investment Program were made to most in need
borrowers, such as individuals who are low-income or live on Tribal
lands. In parallel, the Small Business Administration has increased its
lending to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses,
which has helped to more than double the amount of loans to Black-owned
businesses and double the number of loans to Latino-owned businesses.
Now, Black and Latino entrepreneurs are starting new businesses at the
fastest rates in more than a decade while Black and Latino unemployment
rates are near historic lows.

Today’s announcements coincide with the annual Freedman’s Bank Forum,
hosted at the Department of Treasury. They represent commitments from
the private, public, and non-profit sectors that will continue to
accelerate wealth-building for underserved businesses, their
communities, and the American economy.

**<u>Private sector and philanthropic commitments to support underserved
communities:</u>**

-   **A call to action to bring underserved communities and businesses
    into domestic supply chains:** Vice President Harris is calling on
    companies in Investing in America sectors—semiconductor
    manufacturing, clean energy manufacturing, transportation, heavy
    industry, and biomanufacturing—to strengthen and diversify domestic
    supply chains by committing at least 15% of their U.S.-based
    contract spending on outside goods and services from small and
    underserved businesses by 2025. Alongside these increased
    contracting goals, the Administration is calling on companies to
    provide technical assistance for underserved entrepreneurs in these
    growing high value-added sectors, and commit to disaggregated data
    reporting of commitments. Micron, Xcel Energy, and Air Products have
    made commitments as first movers under the [Economic Opportunity
    Coalition
    (EOC)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/28/fact-sheet-vice-president-announces-new-private-and-public-sector-efforts-to-align-tens-of-billions-in-investments-in-underserved-communities/)
    – a coordinated set of companies aligning major investments in
    underserved communities with investments made by the Biden-Harris
    Administration. These companies represent billions of dollars in
    spending in these growing sectors, and additional companies are
    encouraged to step forward to join them.  
-   **A new $3 billion goal to increase corporate deposits into
    community finance institutions after surpassing $1 billion.** The
    EOC is announcing an ambitious goal to reach $3 billion in committed
    deposits to CDFIs and MDIs. In June, the EOC announced that it had
    reached a milestone of over $1 billion in deposit commitments by EOC
    members. With today’s announcement, the EOC is signaling its
    continued dedication to this work by raising an additional $2
    billion for community lenders by next Freedman’s Bank Forum, which
    would bring their total commitment to $3 billion.  
-   **$75 million committed to connect rural communities to
    opportunities in the Investing in America agenda.** Heartland Fund
    is launching Resource Rural (RR), a new program to ensure rural
    people and communities realize local benefits from federal funding
    for historic climate, energy and infrastructure investments.
    Resource Rural is an ambitious $75M, five-year program designed to
    build engagement, capacity and expertise, share success stories, and
    ensure rural voices are represented in national efforts focused on
    climate and energy progress, workforce development, and equitable
    community and economic development  
-   **Launch of $80 million investment fund to bridge small businesses
    to capital access programs.** The [Initiative for Inclusive
    Entrepreneurship
    (IIE)](https://www.hyphenpartnerships.org/initiative-for-inclusive-enterpreneurship),
    which was announced at the 2022 Freedman’s Bank Forum, is launching
    an investment fund to leverage $80 million in private and
    philanthropic capital to help the State Small Business Credit
    Initiative (SSBCI) expand access to capital for underserved small
    businesses. This investment strategy is led by Hyphen, Mission
    Driven Finance, and JumpStart. Others leading implementation of
    IIE’s capacity-building pilot include Founders First Capital
    Partners, Next Street, and Nowak Metro Finance Lab.  
-   **Catalyzing Partnerships for the Low-Income Communities to Access
    Inflation Reduction Act Credit Programs**: [Accelerating Community
    Investments](https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://www.lincolninst.edu/our-work/accelerating-community-investment-aci)
    (ACI), an initiative of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, is
    partnering with [What Works
    Plus](https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://whatworksplus.com/),
    to mobilize private and nonprofit leaders to support equitable
    implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As part of
    President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, Treasury’s
    [Low-Income Community Bonus Credit
    Program](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-low-income-communities-bonus-credit-program-our-approach-to-an-inclusive-clean-energy-economy)
    will drive thousands of cost-saving clean energy investments in
    low-income communities, on Indian land, as part of affordable
    housing developments, and benefit low-income households. The
    initiative will aim to maximize adoption of the program by public,
    nonprofit, and mission-driven private actors in clean energy,
    affordable housing, and community economic development. And in the
    process, increase the potential for inclusive local business
    development and job opportunities that future projects create.

**<u>Leveraging federal investments and purchasing power to expand
opportunity for underserved small businesses:</u>**

-   **New commitments to expand capital access to very small and
    historically underserved businesses.** Treasury is releasing a
    Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the new $75 million
    Investing in America Small Business Opportunity Program, a
    competitive grant program under the State Small Business Credit
    Initiative (SSBCI) to support technical assistance for very small
    and underserved businesses. Treasury is encouraging States,
    territories, D.C., and Tribal governments to apply for funding, with
    an emphasis on supporting businesses that need financing or other
    support to help them benefit from the historic investments made by
    the President’s Investing in America agenda, including public and
    private infrastructure project opportunities, and participation in
    critical manufacturing supply chains and the clean energy
    transition. This builds upon the $325 million in SSBCI funding
    previously announced to support technical assistance delivered
    through the [SSBCI Technical Assistance Grant
    program](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1674) and
    Minority Business Development Agency ([MBDA) Capital Readiness Grant
    program](https://www.mbda.gov/biden-harris-administration-announces-competition-winners-minority-business-development-agencys).  
-   **New federal goal to increase contract opportunities for SDBs.**
    Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will set, via an Office of
    Management and Budget memorandum to agencies, an interim goal of
    awarding 13% of federal contract spending to SDBs for FY 2024. This
    memo directs federal agencies to work with the Small Business
    Administration (SBA) on agency-specific goals in support of the
    federal government’s overall goal. MBDA’s Federal Procurement Center
    will support this goal through capacity building and information
    sharing to minority-owned businesses that want to access federal
    contracts. Shortly after taking office, President Biden [set a
    goal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-build-black-wealth-and-narrow-the-racial-wealth-gap/)
    of increasing the share of contracts with SDBs to 15% of all federal
    contracts by FY 2025, a 50% increase from spending levels when he
    first took office. The U.S. government buys about $650 billion in
    goods and services each year, making it the largest purchaser in the
    country. That spending power is a powerful tool for supporting small
    business growth.

**<u>These new capital announcements follow recent announcements across
the U.S. government to support equal opportunity and equitable access to
capital, investment, and quality jobs in the President’s Investing in
America agenda. These include:</u>**

-   **Over $20 million available to empower under-resourced communities
    to access historic infrastructure spending.** The Department of
    Transportation has announced its 2023 [Thriving Communities
    Program](https://www.transportation.gov/grants/thriving-communities),
    in which up to $22 million will be available to support communities
    that lack the staffing, technical expertise to scope, fund, and
    develop infrastructure projects that advance local development. The
    notice of funding opportunity closes on November 28, 2023. A Call
    for Letters of Interest (LOI) is also posted; the portal to submit a
    letter closes on November 15, 2023.  
-   **Historic funding for clean energy deployment and pollution
    reduction in disadvantaged communities.** On October 12, the
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) closed its application window
    for the historic $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF),
    which will mobilize financing and private capital for clean energy
    projects and build the capacity of community lenders working in
    low-income and disadvantaged communities. EPA will soon announce a
    $2 billion Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants
    competition, which will invest in projects that are led by
    community-based organizations to reduce pollution, build climate
    resilience, and support economic prosperity in communities
    overburdened by environmental justice challenges. In coordination
    with DOT’s Thriving Communities Program, and in partnership with the
    Department of Energy, EPA has awarded $177 million in funding to 16
    [Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance
    Centers](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/environmental-justice-thriving-communities-technical-assistance-centers)
    that will provide support to communities across the country to
    access federal resources.  
-   **Removing barriers to government-backed loans for
    entrepreneurs.** In September, the SBA [proposed a
    rule](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/09/14/returning-citizens-empowered-start-grow-businesses-under-proposed-rule)
    that would help expand access to SBA loan programs for people with
    certain criminal history records . One in three American adults has
    a criminal record, and these people identify employment as their
    most urgent need, but most significant obstacle. Once finalized, the
    proposed rule would expand access to capital for entrepreneurs with
    certain criminal records by expanding eligibility and removing
    barriers to SBA’s loan and surety bond programs.  
-   **Providing opportunities to easily increase lending to underserved
    businesses.** On May 12, 2023, SBA initiated a program to enable
    Community Advantage Pilot Program Lenders to become Small Business
    Lending Companies (SBLCs). The pilot loan program assists small
    business borrowers in underserved markets who have historically been
    excluded from conventional business financing due to systemic
    barriers, among other factors. SBA transitioned a total of 143 Pilot
    Lenders to SBLCs. The Community Advantage lenders that transitioned
    to SBLC status account for 99.8% of the total Community Advantage
    loan portfolio. In FY 23, Community Advantage lenders grew their SBA
    lending by 23% compared to FY22 for a total of $141.3 million for
    nearly 800 small businesses — demonstrating the impact of expanding
    capital access in underserved communities.  
-   **Awarding energy innovators in underserved communities.** The
    Department of Energy’s (DOE) Inclusive Energy Innovation Prize,
    which supports clean energy innovation efforts in underserved
    communities, made $1.5 million in awards to winning teams in Alaska,
    Louisiana, New York, Oregon, Puerto Rico, and Washington this year.
    The award winners received $250,000 respectively for workforce
    development efforts, entrepreneurship, and relevant efforts to
    support the clean energy transition. This program is a key part of
    the Department’s commitment to the Justice40 initiative, where 40%
    of overall benefits from federal investments in clean energy flow to
    disadvantaged communities.  
-   **Connecting minority-owned businesses to the federal innovation
    ecosystem.** The DOE and U.S. Patent and Trade Office (PTO)
    announced a new commitment to ensure minority-owned businesses can
    navigate the innovation ecosystem more effectively. Their work will
    promote technical assistance and education, and promote data-driven
    policies in support of improving the United States’ energy supply
    chain. The Department of Energy and U.S. PTO will share and leverage
    resources to improve minority businesses’ access to the energy
    industries and their subsectors.  
-   **Expanded federal coordination on community investments with
    climate and clean energy programs.** Community voices requested an
    expansion of the agencies participating in the [Interagency
    Community Investment Committee
    (ICIC)](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ICIC-Action-Plan-2023.pdf)
    to account for the Administration’s historic climate and
    environmental programs. Based on this feedback, the EPA and DOE
    joined the ICIC in July. Their representation on the Committee will
    improve coordination of federal community investment programs and
    increase the flow of resources to underserved communities under the
    Administration’s climate priorities. This will help guide successful
    implementation of historic programs such as the GGRF and maximize
    the positive impact for communities that have historically been left
    behind.
