Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff will
travel to London and Bletchley Park, the United Kingdom from October 31
to November 2. The Vice President’s trip will advance the Biden-Harris
Administration’s global leadership on Artificial Intelligence (AI). On
November 1 in London, the Vice President will deliver a major policy
speech on the Biden-Harris Administration’s vision for the future of AI
and steps we are taking, alongside our allies and partners, to achieve
that vision. On November 2, the Vice President will represent the United
States at the Global Summit on AI Safety at Bletchley Park.

This trip builds on the Vice President’s leadership on AI policy. She
will continue to advocate for: protecting human rights, civil rights,
labor rights, consumer rights, and privacy; international rules and
norms that reflect democratic values and interests; the inclusion of
civil society in AI policymaking; and accountability for the private
sector. Throughout her engagements, the Vice President will make clear
that the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to building a future
of AI where every person is safe from the harms of AI and where every
person can share equally in its benefits.

In London, the Second Gentleman will participate in a series of
engagements with civil society and young leaders. These engagements will
be focused on countering hate, promoting women in STEM, and gender
equity.
