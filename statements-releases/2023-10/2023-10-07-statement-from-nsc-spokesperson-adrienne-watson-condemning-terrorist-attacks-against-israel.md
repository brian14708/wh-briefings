The United States unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas

for terrorism. We stand firmly with the Government and people of Israel
and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks.Â

Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and we remain in close contact with our
Israeli partners.
