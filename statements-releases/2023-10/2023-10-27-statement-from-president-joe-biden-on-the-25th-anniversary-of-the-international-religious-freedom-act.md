  \ Religious Freedom\_Act"

25 years ago, as a United States Senator, I proudly supported the
International Religious Freedom Act—a landmark bipartisan law that
cemented America’s commitment to promoting religious freedom around the
world. This right to practice, pray, and preach our faiths peacefully
and openly is enshrined in our Constitution. And today, in a moment of
so much conflict and disagreement, we must renew our pledge to protect
that right. It’s more important than ever.  
   
Here at home, we are facing a rising tide of antisemitism, Islamophobia,
and other forms of discrimination that are fueling violence and hate
across our country. And, around the world, billions of people live in
countries where they are either persecuted or prevented from freely
choosing, practicing, teaching, or leaving their faith. That’s
especially true for members of religious minority communities too often
endure intimidation, violence, and unequal protection under the law,
while also facing restrictions on their movement, constraints on their
access to education and healthcare, and the fear that their children
will be taken and their faith erased. We have seen attacks on Christians
in some countries. And we also continue to see repressive governments
and violent extremists reach across borders and to target groups for
their beliefs—an abhorrent abuse of the human rights and dignity
entitled to all people.  
   
The United States will continue to defend religious freedom, today and
always. On day one of my Administration, we rescinded the discriminatory
travel ban against majority-Muslim countries—which betrayed our long
history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all. We
established a new government-wide group to counter Islamophobia,
antisemitism, and other forms of religious discrimination within the
United States, and released the first National Strategy to Counter
Antisemitism. Working together with Congress, we implemented the
largest-ever increase in funding for physical security of
nonprofits—including houses of worship. And, in the wake of Hamas’
brutal terrorist assault against Israel, we are working with community
partners to identify, prevent, and disrupt any threats that could harm
the Jewish, Muslim, Arab American, Palestinian American, or any other
communities.  
   
Around the world, we have provided more than $100 million to promote
religious freedom since the beginning of my Administration, and hundreds
of millions more to provide life-saving, humanitarian assistance to
victims fleeing religious repression, including genocide. We are also
denying the entry of goods into the United States that are made with
forced labor, too often associated with a genocide of religious
minorities. And, we have imposed sanctions, visa restrictions, and
export controls on actors and entities that are responsible for human
rights abuses—including religious persecution.    
   
Like so many others, faith has sustained me throughout my life—serving
as a reminder of both our collective purpose and our responsibilities to
one another. But for far too many people within our borders and beyond,
practicing their faith still means facing fear. Today—on this milestone
anniversary of the International Religious Freedom Act—we rededicate
ourselves to ensuring that people of all religions, and no religion,
feel safe to live out their deepest convictions of conscience with
dignity and respect.
