efforts to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the
civilian population of Gaza.  The two leaders committed to the
significant acceleration and increase of assistance flowing into Gaza
beginning today and then continuously.  They also discussed the
importance of protecting civilian lives, respect for international
humanitarian law, and ensuring that Palestinians in Gaza are not
displaced to Egypt or any other nation.  The President briefed President
Sisi on U.S. efforts to ensure that regional actors not expand the
conflict in Gaza and also on continuing efforts to secure the release of
hostages. President Biden and President Sisi affirmed their commitment
to work together to set the conditions for a durable and sustainable
peace in the Middle East to include the establishment of a Palestinian
state.
