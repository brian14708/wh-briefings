title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Tentative Agreement Between\
  \ Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente\_Unions"
---
 
Our nation’s health care workers tend to our loved ones with incredible
dedication, expertise, and compassion. I congratulate SEIU and Kaiser
Permanente for coming together to reach a tentative agreement that would
secure fair pay, good benefits, and a safer workplace for tens of
thousands of health care workers and support staff across the country.
The President and I strongly believe in the collective bargaining
process, and we know that when unions are strong, our nation is strong.
