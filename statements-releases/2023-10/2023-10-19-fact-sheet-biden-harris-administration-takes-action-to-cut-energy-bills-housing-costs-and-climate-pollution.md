title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Action to Cut Energy Bills,\
  \ Housing Costs and Climate\_Pollution"
---
 
*Administration invests over $100 million to renovate homes with zero
energy and climate resilient technology  
  
Announcement will help advance goal of cutting the cost of decarbonizing
housing in half within a decade while lowering energy bills and
increasing affordable housing supply  
*

Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has advanced the most
ambitious climate agenda in history, leading a whole-of-government
approach to reduce emissions across every sector of the economy,
including the buildings sector, and expand affordable clean energy to
every American. Last week, **the Biden-Harris Administration set a bold
target to reduce the cost to decarbonize new and existing housing by 50%
within a decade,** while delivering energy bill savings for Americans
and curbing greenhouse gas emissions that come from operating,
constructing, and renovating buildings.  
  
In the United States, more than a third of greenhouse gas emissions
comes from the buildings sector – with 20 percent from heating, cooling,
and operating our homes. By investing in solutions to cut pollution from
homes, the U.S. will help curb 37% of greenhouse gas emissions that come
from operating, constructing and renovating our buildings, while
protecting people’s health and lowering energy and housing costs for
hardworking families, a key pillar of Bidenomics.  
  
That’s why today, the Administration **announced awards of more than
$100 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
through the Inflation Reduction Act – the largest investment in clean
energy and climate action ever – to help renovate the homes of more than
1,500 low-income families to be zero energy and climate resilient.**
These energy-saving renovations will demonstrate the potential to
preserve quality, affordable housing in our communities by cutting
energy waste down to zero, increasing resiliency to extreme weather
events worsened by climate change, and lowering costs for families. All
the investments will be made in affordable housing communities serving
low-income families in alignment with President Biden’s [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/)
and the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to environmental
justice. These investments will also preserve the long-term viability
and affordability of our nation’s existing stock of affordable housing
and advance fair housing by increasing housing options for
communities.  
  
In addition, the **Department of the Treasury and the Department of
Energy today opened applications for the Low-Income Communities Bonus
Credit program**, which will spur up to 1.8 gigawatts of clean energy
investments annually in underserved communities. The program, also
created by the Inflation Reduction Act, provides a bonus credit amount
on top of the Investment Tax Credit for building clean energy projects,
which is up to 30% of qualifying investments. The Low-Income Communities
Bonus provides up to a 10 or 20- percentage point tax credit boost for
small solar and wind projects placed in service in low- income or Tribal
communities.  
  
Today’s announcements build on key actions taken by the Administration
to boost climate resilience in buildings and deliver lower home energy
costs for families across the country, while increasing investments in
housing supply and safer, healthier housing.

### Lowering Energy and Housing Costs for Families and Achieving a Zero Emissions Building Sector

-   Last week, the Department of Energy launched its eighth Energy
    Earthshot – the [**“Affordable Home Energy
    Shot”**](https://www.energy.gov/eere/affordable-home-energy-shot#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DThe%20Affordable%20Home%20Energy%20Shot%20directs%20DOE%E2%80%99s%20research%2Cthe%20area%20median%20income%E2%80%94will%20benefit%20from%20decarbonization%20solutions)
    **–** which sets a bold target to reduce the cost to decarbonize new
    and existing housing by 50%, save Americans money on their energy
    bills, and help address the persistent burdens faced by low-income
    households and communities of color. The initiative will advance the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s environmental justice and equity
    goals, including the President’s Justice40 Initiative, by lowering
    the cost of energy-efficient retrofits while reducing overall energy
    costs and carbon intensity of homes across the country. Reducing the
    cost of building will also contribute to the Administration’s
    efforts to increase the nation’s affordable housing supply through
    the [President’s Housing Supply Action
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/27/biden-harris-administration-announces-actions-to-lower-housing-costs-and-boost-supply/)
    by expanding the production of affordable housing and ensuring the
    long-term viability of existing units.  
-   The Biden-Harris Administration recently **announced a goal of
    making zero emissions, resilient new construction and retrofits
    common practice by 2030.** To achieve its goal, the Administration
    is developing a [standard
    national](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/28/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-hosts-first-ever-white-house-climate-resilience-summit-and-releases-national-climate-resilience-framework/)
    [definition for zero emissions
    buildings](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/28/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-hosts-first-ever-white-house-climate-resilience-summit-and-releases-national-climate-resilience-framework/)
    that will help establish a consistent, verifiable and measurable
    path to a zero-emissions building sector. With over 130 million
    existing buildings, which collectively cost over $400 billion a year
    to heat, cool, light and power, and 10 million new homes to be
    constructed by 2030, establishing a consistent uniform target will
    accelerate climate progress by driving investments into homes and
    buildings of the future.  
-   The Department of the Treasury recently issued guidance on [**the
    Inflation
    Reduction**](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1768)
    [**Act’s amendments to the 45L new energy efficient homes tax
    credit**](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1768) that
    now offers up to $5,000 per home to eligible contractors who
    construct, reconstruct, or rehabilitate energy efficient homes.  
-   Last week, the Department of Energy announced more than **$30
    million in awards through the** [**Energy Efficiency and
    Conservation Block Grant
    (EECBG)**](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-30-million-clean-energy-funding-28-state-local-and)
    [**Program**](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-30-million-clean-energy-funding-28-state-local-and)**<u>,</u>**
    providing clean energy funding to eight states, 19 local governments
    and one Tribe. The EECBG Program is designed to assist states, local
    governments, and Tribes in implementing strategies to reduce energy
    use, to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and to improve energy
    efficiency. DOE also awarded **more than $22 million in cash prizes
    and technical assistance through the** [**Buildings Upgrade Prize
    (Buildings**](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/doe-awards-22-million-advance-equitable-energy-efficiency-and-electrification#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DThe%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Energy%20today%20announced%2045%2Cwidespread%20energy%20efficiency%20and%20efficient%20electrification%20building%20upgrades)

    to teams across America with winning ideas to accelerate widespread,
    equitable energy efficiency and building electrification upgrades
    for homes and communities.  
-   In addition, last month, the Department of Energy [**opened
    applications for
    $400**](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-400-million-states-improve-building-energy)
    [**million**](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-400-million-states-improve-building-energy)
    **through the Inflation Reduction Act for states and territories to
    adopt and implement the latest building energy codes or zero
    building energy codes in order to** reduce utility bills, increase
    efficiency, lower greenhouse gas emissions that fuel the climate
    crisis, and make buildings more resilient to climate disaster.  
-   **FEMA last week announced the availability of** [**$1.8 billion for
    two

    **nationwide and prepare communities for more frequent and severe
    extreme weather events**. The [Building Resilient Infrastructure and
    Communities
    (BRIC)](https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation/building-resilient-infrastructure-communities/)
    annual grant program is making an additional $1 billion available to
    fund projects that protect people and infrastructure from natural
    hazards and the effects of climate change. The Flood Mitigation
    Assistance (FMA) program will provide a further $800 million to fund
    projects that mitigate flood risks facing homes and communities
    across the nation.

-   Today **Department of Housing and Urban Development released a
    Climate Resources for Housing Supply Framework** that describes key
    funding opportunities for a climate-focused housing supply strategy.
    This follows the launch of HUD’s Funding Navigator, a user-friendly
    searchable database of Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law incentives and other resources from across
    federal agencies to support efforts to enhance climate resiliency,
    energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, healthy housing,
    workforce development and environmental justice.  
-   Recently, HUD announced its [**Funding
    Navigator**](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/build-for-the-future/funding-navigator/),
    an interactive tool that allows users to browse and sort funding
    opportunities for billions of dollars in funding available under the
    Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    (BIL).  
-   Earlier this month, EPA closed its application window for the
    [**Greenhouse
    Gas**](https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund)
    [**Reduction
    Fund**](https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund)**.** For
    two of the competitions—the $14 billion National Clean Investment
    Fund and the $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator—EPA
    identified net-zero emissions buildings, including multi-family
    housing, as a priority project category.

Together, these actions further the Administration’s commitment to
reducing energy burdens, increasing housing supply and advancing fair
housing, cutting climate pollution, boosting climate resilience,
lowering household energy costs, and preserving the viability and
affordability of America’s housing stock.
