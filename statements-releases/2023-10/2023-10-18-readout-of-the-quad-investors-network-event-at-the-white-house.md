---
 
On Monday, the White House hosted the Quad Investor Network (QUIN) for
its inaugural Quad Investment and Technology Dialogue. Director of the
National Economic Council Lael Brainard, Secretary of Commerce Gina
Raimondo, and other senior administration officials addressed the group
of over 40 business executives from Quad countries, and discussed
strategies to help make private capital available for increased,
high-standard, cross-border investment between Australia, India, Japan,
and the United States. The event also included senior representatives
from the Embassies of Australia, India, and Japan. At today’s Dialogue,
public and private sector leaders discussed investment opportunities in
critical resources and emerging technologies to promote greater
prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific Region.

QUIN was launched in May of this year at the Quad Leaders’ Summit in
Hiroshima, and serves as a network of investors and executives across
Quad countries that seeks to foster co-investment in critical and
emerging technologies.
