title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Historic Tentative Agreement Between\
  \ Ford and\_UAW"
---
 
I applaud the UAW and Ford for coming together after a hard fought, good
faith negotiation and reaching a historic tentative agreement tonight.
This tentative agreement provides a record raise to auto workers who
have sacrificed so much to ensure our iconic Big Three companies can
still lead the world in quality and innovation. Ultimately, the final
word on this contract will be from the UAW members themselves in the
days and weeks to come. I’ve always believed the middle class built
America and unions built the middle class. That is especially the case
for UAW workers who built an iconic American industry. And critical to
building an economy from the middle out and bottom up, instead of from
the top down, is worker power. It’s showing how collective bargaining
works by providing workers a seat at the table and the opportunity to
improve their lives while contributing fully to their employer’s
success. This tentative agreement is a testament to the power of
employers and employees coming together to work out their differences at
the bargaining table in a manner that helps businesses succeed while
helping workers secure pay and benefits they can raise a family on and
retire with dignity and respect.
