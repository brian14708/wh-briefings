  Day"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. welcomed President Frank-Walter
Steinmeier of Germany to the White House on October 6, 2023, to
mark** **the occasion of German-American Day. The presidents underscored
the strong ties between our countries and our people, including the over
40 million Americans who claim German heritage and strengthen the
diverse fabric of the United States. 

The American dream lived in the hearts of German immigrants long before
the United States was founded. Since 1683, the story of German-Americans
has been inextricable from the story of America: German-Americans fought
in the Revolutionary War; members of the Continental Congress were known
to have gathered and debated in German coffeehouses; a local German
newspaper was the first to print the Declaration of Independence; and so
much more. Generations after these trailblazers, Americans came to help
Europe. They joined the Allies to free Europe from Nazi terror, gave
Germany a new chance for freedom and prosperity with the Marshall Plan,
and helped tear down the Berlin Wall. German-Americans continue to
strengthen the United States’ values and culture as leaders in every
sector and community. Today’s united and democratic Germany is
unthinkable without the courage of Americans.

Building on our shared history, common values, and work together as NATO
Allies, our partnership is essential to our efforts to address global
challenges, from climate change and food insecurity to the defense of
human rights and democracy. And our alliance is critical for our
continuing efforts to support the people of Ukraine and their courageous
defense of their country, their freedom, and their future.

On German-American Day, 340 years after German immigrants founded
Germantown in Pennsylvania, President Biden and President Steinmeier
celebrated the incredible legacy of millions of German-Americans and the
unbreakable bonds of friendship between our two countries.
