Today, the State Department announced the appointment of Ambassador
David Satterfield as the U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian
Issues, where he will focus on ensuring life-saving assistance can reach
vulnerable people throughout the Middle East. Ambassador Satterfield’s
diplomatic experience and decades of work navigating the some of the
world’s most challenging conflicts will be instrumental in our continued
effort to address humanitarian issues in the region – a top priority for
President Biden – including our efforts to bring urgently needed
humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people, particularly in Gaza,
in coordination with the U.N., Egypt, Jordan, Israel, and other regional
stakeholders.  

We thank Ambassador Satterfield for his willingness to serve in this new
capacity.
