title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 25th Anniversary of the Tragic\
  \ Death of Matthew\_Shepard"
---
 
Twenty-five years ago today, Matthew Shepard lost his life to a brutal
act of hate and violence that shocked our nation and the world. The week
prior, Matthew had been viciously attacked in a horrific anti-gay hate
crime and left to die – simply for being himself.

Matthew’s tragic and senseless murder shook the conscience of the
American people. And his courageous parents, Judy and Dennis Shepard,
turned Matthew’s memory into a movement, galvanizing millions of people
to combat the scourge of anti-LGBTQI+ hate and violence in America.  

As Vice President, I had the honor of helping to enact the Matthew
Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which extended
federal hate crimes laws to cover sexual orientation, gender identity,
and disability. This legislation is a lasting tribute to Matthew, a
testament to the relentless advocacy of Judy and Dennis, and an
important step forward for our country. I was proud to honor Judy and
Dennis as Uniters – Americans who stand against hate and heal our
divides – at the United We Stand Summit here at the White House last
year. Our charge is to continue the fight against hate, against
violence, and against bigotry in all its forms.

Today, as threats and violence targeting the LGBTQI+ community continue
to rise, our work is far from finished. No American should face hate or
violence for who they are or who they love. I once again call on
Congress to send the Equality Act to my desk so that we can ensure
LGBTQI+ Americans have full civil rights protections under our laws –
because every American is worthy of dignity, acceptance, and respect.

God bless Judy, Dennis, and all those who are grieving and remembering
Matthew today.
