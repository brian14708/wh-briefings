title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Issues Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy\
  \ Artificial\_Intelligence"
---
 
Today, President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order to ensure that
America leads the way in seizing the promise and managing the risks of
artificial intelligence (AI). The Executive Order establishes new
standards for AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy,
advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers,
promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around
the world, and more.  
  
As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive strategy for
responsible innovation, the Executive Order builds on previous actions
the President has taken, including work that led to voluntary
commitments from 15 leading companies to drive safe, secure, and
trustworthy development of AI.  
  
The Executive Order directs the following actions:  
  
**New Standards for AI Safety and Security**

As AI’s capabilities grow, so do its implications for Americans’ safety
and security. **With this Executive Order, the President directs
the most sweeping actions ever taken to protect Americans from the
potential risks of AI systems:**

-   **Require that developers of the most powerful AI systems share
    their safety test results and other critical information with the
    U.S. government. **In accordance with the Defense Production Act,
    the Order will require that companies developing any foundation
    model that poses a serious risk to national security, national
    economic security, or national public health and safety must notify
    the federal government when training the model, and must share the
    results of all red-team safety tests. These measures will ensure AI
    systems are safe, secure, and trustworthy before companies make them
    public. 
-   **Develop standards, tools, and tests to help ensure that AI systems
    are safe, secure, and trustworthy.** The National Institute of
    Standards and Technology will set the rigorous standards for
    extensive red-team testing to ensure safety before public release.
    The Department of Homeland Security will apply those standards to
    critical infrastructure sectors and establish the AI Safety and
    Security Board. The Departments of Energy and Homeland Security will
    also address AI systems’ threats to critical infrastructure, as well
    as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity
    risks. Together, these are the most significant actions ever taken
    by any government to advance the field of AI safety.
-   **Protect against the risks of using AI to engineer dangerous
    biological materials **by developing strong new standards for
    biological synthesis screening. Agencies that fund life-science
    projects will establish these standards as a condition of federal
    funding, creating powerful incentives to ensure appropriate
    screening and manage risks potentially made worse by AI.
-   **Protect Americans from AI-enabled fraud and deception by
    establishing standards and best practices for detecting AI-generated
    content and authenticating official content**. The Department of
    Commerce will develop guidance for content authentication and
    watermarking to clearly label AI-generated content. Federal agencies
    will use these tools to make it easy for Americans to know that the
    communications they receive from their government are authentic—and
    set an example for the private sector and governments around the
    world.
-   **Establish an advanced cybersecurity program to develop AI tools to
    find and fix vulnerabilities in critical software, **building on the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing AI Cyber Challenge. Together,
    these efforts will harness AI’s potentially game-changing cyber
    capabilities to make software and networks more secure.
-   **Order the development of a National Security Memorandum that
    directs further actions on AI and security, **to be developed by the
    National Security Council and White House Chief of Staff. This
    document will ensure that the United States military and
    intelligence community use AI safely, ethically, and effectively in
    their missions, and will direct actions to counter adversaries’
    military use of AI.

**Protecting Americans’ Privacy**

Without safeguards, AI can put Americans’ privacy further at risk. AI
not only makes it easier to extract, identify, and exploit personal
data, but it also heightens incentives to do so because companies use
data to train AI systems. **To better protect Americans’ privacy,
including from the risks posed by AI, the President calls on Congress to
pass bipartisan data privacy legislation to protect all Americans,
especially kids, and directs the following actions:**

-   **Protect Americans’ privacy by prioritizing federal support for
    accelerating the development and use of privacy-preserving
    techniques—**including ones that use cutting-edge AI and that let AI
    systems be trained while preserving the privacy of the training
    data.  
-   **Strengthen privacy-preserving research** **and
    technologies,** such as cryptographic tools that preserve
    individuals’ privacy, by funding a Research Coordination Network to
    advance rapid breakthroughs and development. The National Science
    Foundation will also work with this network to promote the adoption
    of leading-edge privacy-preserving technologies by federal agencies.
-   **Evaluate how agencies collect and use commercially available
    information**—including information they procure from data
    brokers—and** strengthen privacy guidance for federal agencies** to
    account for AI risks. This work will focus in particular on
    commercially available information containing personally
    identifiable data.
-   **Develop guidelines for federal agencies to evaluate the
    effectiveness of privacy-preserving techniques, **including those
    used in AI systems. These guidelines will advance agency efforts to
    protect Americans’ data.

**Advancing Equity and Civil Rights**

Irresponsible uses of AI can lead to and deepen discrimination, bias,
and other abuses in justice, healthcare, and housing. The Biden-Harris
Administration has already taken action by publishing the [Blueprint for
an AI Bill of
Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) and issuing
an [Executive Order directing agencies to combat algorithmic
discrimination](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/16/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-to-strengthen-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-across-the-federal-government/),
while enforcing existing authorities to protect people’s rights and
safety. **To ensure that AI advances equity and civil rights, the
President directs the following additional actions:**

-   **Provide clear guidance to landlords, Federal benefits programs,
    and federal contractors **to keep AI algorithms from being used to
    exacerbate discrimination.
-   **Address algorithmic discrimination **through training, technical
    assistance, and coordination between the Department of Justice and
    Federal civil rights offices on best practices for investigating and
    prosecuting civil rights violations related to AI.
-   **Ensure fairness throughout the criminal justice system **by
    developing best practices on the use of AI in sentencing, parole and
    probation, pretrial release and detention, risk assessments,
    surveillance, crime forecasting and predictive policing, and
    forensic analysis.

**Standing Up for Consumers, Patients, and Students**

AI can bring real benefits to consumers—for example, by making products
better, cheaper, and more widely available. But AI also raises the risk
of injuring, misleading, or otherwise harming Americans. **To protect
consumers while ensuring that AI can make Americans better off, the
President directs the following actions:**

-   **Advance the responsible use of AI **in healthcare and the
    development of affordable and life-saving drugs. The Department of
    Health and Human Services will also establish a safety program to
    receive reports of—and act to remedy – harms or unsafe healthcare
    practices involving AI. 
-   **Shape AI’s potential to transform education **by creating
    resources to support educators deploying AI-enabled educational
    tools, such as personalized tutoring in schools.

**Supporting Workers**

AI is changing America’s jobs and workplaces, offering both the promise
of improved productivity but also the dangers of increased workplace
surveillance, bias, and job displacement. **To mitigate these risks,
support workers’ ability to bargain collectively, and invest in
workforce training and development that is accessible to all, the
President directs the following actions:**

-   **Develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms and
    maximize the benefits of AI for workers **by addressing job
    displacement; labor standards; workplace equity, health, and safety;
    and data collection. These principles and best practices will
    benefit workers by providing guidance to prevent employers from
    undercompensating workers, evaluating job applications unfairly, or
    impinging on workers’ ability to organize.
-   **Produce a report on AI’s potential labor-market impacts**,
    and **study and identify options for strengthening federal support
    for workers facing labor disruptions**, including from AI.

**Promoting Innovation and Competition**

America already leads in AI innovation—more AI startups raised
first-time capital in the United States last year than in the next seven
countries combined. **The Executive Order ensures that we continue to
lead the way in innovation and competition through the following
actions:**

-   **Catalyze AI research across the United States **through a pilot of
    the National AI Research Resource—a tool that will provide AI
    researchers and students access to key AI resources and data—and
    expanded grants for AI research in vital areas like healthcare and
    climate change.
-   **Promote a fair, open, and competitive AI ecosystem **by providing
    small developers and entrepreneurs access to technical assistance
    and resources, helping small businesses commercialize AI
    breakthroughs, and encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to
    exercise its authorities.
-   **Use existing authorities to expand the ability of highly skilled
    immigrants and nonimmigrants with expertise in critical areas to
    study, stay, and work in the United States** by modernizing and
    streamlining visa criteria, interviews, and reviews.

**Advancing American Leadership Abroad**

AI’s challenges and opportunities are global. **The Biden-Harris
Administration will continue working with other nations to support safe,
secure, and trustworthy deployment and use of AI worldwide. To that end,
the President directs the following actions:**

-   **Expand bilateral, multilateral, and multistakeholder engagements
    to collaborate on AI**. The State Department, in collaboration, with
    the Commerce Department will lead an effort to establish robust
    international frameworks for harnessing AI’s benefits and managing
    its risks and ensuring safety. In addition, this week, Vice
    President Harris will speak at the UK Summit on AI Safety, hosted by
    Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
-   **Accelerate development and implementation of vital AI
    standards** with international partners and in standards
    organizations, ensuring that the technology is safe, secure,
    trustworthy, and interoperable.
-   **Promote the safe, responsible, and rights-affirming development
    and deployment of AI abroad to solve global challenges, **such as
    advancing sustainable development and mitigating dangers to critical
    infrastructure.

**Ensuring Responsible and Effective Government Use of AI**

AI can help government deliver better results for the American people.
It can expand agencies’ capacity to regulate, govern, and disburse
benefits, and it can cut costs and enhance the security of government
systems. However, use of AI can pose risks, such as discrimination and
unsafe decisions. **To ensure the responsible government deployment of
AI and modernize federal AI infrastructure, the President directs the
following actions:**

-   **Issue guidance for agencies’ use of AI, **including clear
    standards to protect rights and safety, improve AI procurement, and
    strengthen AI deployment.  
-   **Help agencies acquire specified AI products and services** faster,
    more cheaply, and more effectively through more rapid and efficient
    contracting.
-   **Accelerate the rapid hiring of AI professionals** as part of a
    government-wide AI talent surge led by the Office of Personnel
    Management, U.S. Digital Service, U.S. Digital Corps, and
    Presidential Innovation Fellowship. Agencies will provide AI
    training for employees at all levels in relevant fields.

As we advance this agenda at home, the Administration will work with
allies and partners abroad on a strong international framework to govern
the development and use of AI. The Administration has already consulted
widely on AI governance frameworks over the past several months—engaging
with Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the European Union, France,
Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, the UAE,
and the UK. The actions taken today support and complement Japan’s
leadership of the G-7 Hiroshima Process, the UK Summit on AI Safety,
India’s leadership as Chair of the Global Partnership on AI, and ongoing
discussions at the United Nations.  
  
The actions that President Biden directed today are vital steps forward
in the U.S.’s approach on safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. More action
will be required, and the Administration will continue to work with
Congress to pursue bipartisan legislation to help America lead the way
in responsible innovation.
