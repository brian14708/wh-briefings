This afternoon, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu to
reiterate unwavering U.S. support for Israel. President Biden updated
Prime Minister Netanyahu on U.S. military support and reiterated his
warning against anyone seeking to expand the conflict. 

President Biden discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu U.S.
coordination with the United Nations, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, and others
in the region to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food,
and medical care. President Biden affirmed his support for all efforts
to protect civilians.  

As more information comes to light about Hamas’s brutal atrocities
committed over the past week, President Biden reiterated the need for
all countries to unequivocally condemn Hamas as a terrorist organization
that does not represent the aspirations of the Palestinian people.
