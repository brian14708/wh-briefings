title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting on Increasing Contraception Access and Affordability"
---
 
Today, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
Gender Policy Council, and Neera Tanden, Assistant to the President and
Domestic Policy Advisor, convened private sector leaders to discuss
efforts to ensure access to affordable, high-quality contraception.
Directors Tanden and Klein were joined by Secretary of Health and Human
Services Xavier Becerra, Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su, and
Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy at the Department of the Treasury
Lily Batchelder.

During the meeting, Biden-Harris Administration leaders emphasized the
importance of continuing to build on the significant progress we have
already made under the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded access to
contraception and saved women billions of dollars in out-of-pocket
costs. This includes through robust implementation of the President’s
third Executive Order on reproductive health care access issued in June
2023, which focused specifically on actions to further bolster
contraception access.

Senior Administration officials also highlighted a recent [Request for
