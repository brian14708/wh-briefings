title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Securing the Release of Two Americans\
  \ Taken\_Hostage"
---
 
Today, we have secured the release of two Americans taken hostage by
Hamas during the horrific terrorist assault against Israel on October 7.
 Our fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days,
and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family,
who has been wracked with fear. These individuals and their family will
have the full support of the United States government as they recover
and heal, and we should all respect their privacy in this moment.  
   
From the earliest moments of this attack, we have been working
around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by
Hamas, and we have not ceased our efforts to secure the release of those
who are still being held.  I thank the government of Qatar and the
government of Israel for their partnership in this work.  Jill and I
have been holding close in our hearts all the families of unaccounted
for Americans. And, as I told those families when I spoke with them last
week—we will not stop until we get their loved ones home. As president,
I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans held hostage
around the world.
