title: "Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Broad New Actions to Protect Consumers\
  \ From Billions in Junk\_Fees"

*New proposals would crack down on junk fees across industries and ban
fees for essential bank services*

Today, President Biden will be joined by Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
Chair Lina Khan and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director
Rohit Chopra as they announce new efforts to crack down on junk fees and
bring down costs for American consumers. Junk fees are hidden, surprise
fees that companies sneak onto customer bills, increasing costs and
stifling competition in industries across the economy. Last year, as
part of his agenda to increase competition following his [Executive
Order on Promoting
Competition](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/),
President Biden called on [federal
agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/26/readout-of-the-third-meeting-of-the-white-house-competition-council/),
Congress, and private companies to crack down on junk fees and provide
consumers with the full price up front.  
  
Junk fees cost American families tens of billions of dollars each year
and inhibit competition, hurting consumers, workers, small businesses,
and
entrepreneurs. [Research ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2022/10/26/the-presidents-initiative-on-junk-fees-and-related-pricing-practices/)shows
that fees charged at the back-end of the buying process make it harder
to comparison shop for the best deal and lead to consumers paying upward
of [twenty percent more](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25186). Junk fees
also make it hard for honest businesses to compete, stifle innovation,
and hurt small businesses.  
  
**<u>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing bold, new
actions to crack down on junk fees and promote competition:</u>**

-   The [FTC is proposing a
    rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/10/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-junk-fees) that,
    if finalized as proposed, would ban businesses from charging hidden
    and misleading fees and require them to show the full price up
    front. The rule would also require companies disclose up front
    whether fees are refundable. This would mean no more surprise resort
    fees at check out or unexpected service fees to buy a live event
    ticket. The rule would apply to industries across the economy,
    including event tickets, hotels and lodging, apartment rentals, car
    rentals, and more. Under the proposed rule, companies that fail to
    comply could face monetary penalties and have to provide refunds to
    consumers.  
     
-   The [CFPB is taking
    action](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-to-halt-large-banks-from-charging-illegal-junk-fees-for-basic-customer-service/) to
    require large banks and credit unions to provide basic information
    to consumers without charging fees—meaning no more fees for basic
    services like checking bank account balances, obtaining a payoff
    amount for a loan, or getting account information needed for
    applications.  
     
-   Later this month, the CFPB will propose a rule that, if finalized,
    would require financial companies to allow customers to safely,
    securely, and reliably send their banking transaction data to other
    companies and banks. The proposal would make it easier for people to
    break up with their bank, switch to banks with better offerings, and
    to manage accounts from multiple providers. This reform will ensure
    financial companies compete based on service quality and up-front
    pricing, deterring junk fees.

**<u>In addition, CFPB is releasing new findings showing their crack
down on junk fees is already saving consumers billions of dollars:</u>**

-   [CFPB
    finds](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-uncovers-and-cracks-down-on-junk-fees-in-banking-auto-loans-and-remittances/) that
    bounced check fees are **down** **more than 86 percent since
    2021—saving consumers nearly $2 billion**—and that nearly two-thirds
    of large banks have eliminated these fees entirely. Previous CFPB
    studies have shown that bounced check fees, which can cost $30-40
    per transaction, hit low income and minority Americans the hardest.
    This new finding adds to the [$5.5 billion annual reduction in
    banking junk
    fees](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/data-spotlight-overdraft-nsf-revenue-in-q4-2022-down-nearly-50-versus-pre-pandemic-levels/full-report/) achieved
    by the Biden-Harris Administration, for a total of an average
    of **$170 in annual savings **for the 33 million households that pay
    these fees.  
     
-   [CFPB is also
    announcing](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-uncovers-and-cracks-down-on-junk-fees-in-banking-auto-loans-and-remittances/) that
    it secured an additional $140 million in consumer refunds from
    companies that charged illegal junk fees, such as surprise overdraft
    fees and multiple bounced check fees for the same transaction. Last
    October, the CFPB [issued
    guidance](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-to-help-banks-avoid-charging-illegal-junk-fees-on-deposit-accounts/) to
    financial institutions about these illegal junk fees.

**<u>Also today, the White House is reinforcing the Administration’s
all-of-government approach to competition:</u>**

-   The [Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
    (OIRA)](https://us19.admin.mailchimp.com/campaigns/Office%20of%20Information%20and%20Regulatory%20Affairs%20(OIRA)%20is%20publishing%20new%20guidance) is
    publishing new guidance to help agencies better develop and analyze
    regulations with competition in mind. Developed in collaboration
    with the National Economic Council, the Council of Economic
    Advisers, and other members of the [White House Competition
    Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/competition/), this guidance
    will help agencies design regulations that promote competition while
    achieving other important policy goals.

**<u>Today’s announcements build on important actions the Biden-Harris
Administration has already taken to address junk fees:</u>**

-   The Department of Transportation (DOT) has secured significant
    commitments by major airlines to improve service. Previously, none
    of the 10 largest U.S. airlines guaranteed meals or hotels when they
    caused a cancellation or significant delay and no airline guaranteed
    that parents can sit with their children for free. Now, thanks to
    DOT’s efforts, 9 of the 10 largest airlines guarantee hotels, 10
    airlines to guarantee meals, and 4 airlines guarantee fee-free
    family seating. Consumers can see what services airlines offer
    at [FlightRights.gov](https://flightrights.gov/).  
     
-   DOT has issued several proposals that, if finalized, would: (1)
    require airlines to [promptly
    refund](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/part-ongoing-airline-consumer-protections-efforts-usdot-announces-new-rulemaking) airline
    tickets when they cancel or significantly change a flight;
    (2) [require
    refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/notice-proposed-rulemaking-nprm-refunding-fees-delayed) for
    services not delivered (like broken Wi-Fi or delayed bags), and (3)
    require fees to be [disclosed
    up-front](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announce-new-effort-save-americans-money-and-spur) for
    checking a bag or changing or canceling a flight. DOT is also
    working on rule proposals that would [ban family seating junk
    fees](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/usdot-unveils-dashboard-highlights-progress-help-parents-avoid-family-seating-junk) and
    would require airlines to [compensate
    flyers](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/dot-propose-requirements-airlines-cover-expenses-and-compensate-stranded-passengers) when
    a flight is cancelled or delayed due to the airline’s fault.  
     
-   The [Department of Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD)](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_146) called
    on industry, housing providers, and state and local governments to
    adopt policies that promote greater fairness and transparency of
    fees faced by renters.  
     
-   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
    has [finalized](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-requires-broadband-providers-display-labels-help-consumers) a
    rule that will soon require broadband providers to display
    “Broadband Nutrition Labels” for consumers—clear labels that provide
    basic information about the costs and fees of internet service
    offerings, so people can compare options more easily.  
     
-   The FTC proposed a [“click to cancel”
    rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring) in
    March of 2023, that, if finalized as proposed, would require sellers
    to make it as easy for consumers to cancel their enrollment as it
    was to sign up. This rule would rescue consumers from seemingly
    never-ending struggles to cancel unwanted subscription payment plans
    for everything from cosmetics to gym memberships.  
     
-   The FCC has proposed a rule that, if finalized as proposed,
    would [require cable providers to display “all-in”
    prices](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-pricing-transparency-requirement-cable-and-satellite) clearly
    and prominently, so consumers know what they are getting and at what
    price.  
     
-   CFPB proposed a rule that, if finalized as proposed, would [lower
    credit card late
    fees](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/) from
    approximately $30 to $8, saving consumers up to $9 billion
    annually.  
     
-   The FTC proposed a rule that, if finalized as proposed, would [ban
    junk fees and bait-and-switch advertising by auto
    dealers](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/06/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-junk-fees-bait-switch-tactics-plaguing-car-buyers),
    including prohibiting deceptive advertising, requiring full upfront
    pricing, requiring consent for charges, and prohibiting the sale of
    add-ons that have no benefit.  
     
-   Following the President’s calls to action, private sector companies
    in the [live event ticketing,
    lodging](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/15/president-biden-recognizes-actions-by-private-sector-ticketing-and-travel-companies-to-eliminate-hidden-junk-fees-and-provide-millions-of-customers-with-transparent-pricing/),
    and [rental
    housing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-on-junk-fees-in-rental-housing-to-lower-costs-for-renters/) sectors
    have changed how they display prices so that the all-in price is
    more readily available to consumers.
