consistent with the law of war to include the protection of civilians in
Gaza caught in the conflict launched by Hamas.  The President and Prime
Minister discussed follow-up from the President’s visit to Israel
earlier this week, including plans to begin moving humanitarian

The leaders discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of hostages
taken by Hamas – including U.S. citizens –and to provide for safe
