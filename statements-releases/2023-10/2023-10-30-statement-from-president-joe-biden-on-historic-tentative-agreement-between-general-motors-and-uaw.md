title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Historic Tentative Agreement Between\
  \ General Motors and\_UAW"
---
 
I applaud the UAW and General Motors for coming together after hard
fought, good faith negotiations to reach a historic agreement to provide
workers with the pay, benefits, and respect they deserve. With this
landmark agreement with GM, the UAW has now reached historic tentative
agreements with all of the Big Three American automakers. This historic
tentative agreement rewards the autoworkers who have sacrificed so much
with the record raises, more paid leave, greater retirement security,
and more rights and respect at work. I want to applaud the UAW and GM
for agreeing to immediately bring back all of the GM workers who have
been walking the picket line on behalf of their UAW brothers and
sisters. 

This historic contract is a testament to the power of unions and
collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping
our most iconic American companies thrive. The final word on these
tentative agreements will ultimately come from UAW members themselves in
the days and weeks to come.
