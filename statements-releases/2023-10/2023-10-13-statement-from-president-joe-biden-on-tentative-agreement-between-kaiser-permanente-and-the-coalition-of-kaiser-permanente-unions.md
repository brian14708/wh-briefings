title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Tentative Agreement Between Kaiser\
  \ Permanente and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente\_Unions"
---
 
We owe a tremendous debt to health care workers and the hard-working men
and women who make their work possible. I’m grateful to Kaiser
Permanente and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions for coming
together in good faith to ensure these workers can continue caring for
our neighbors and loved ones. Health care workers and support staff kept
our hospitals – and our nation– going during the dark months of the
pandemic. They had our backs during one of our nation’s toughest times.
We must continue to have theirs.  
   
I’m also grateful for the role Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su played in
bringing these parties together.  This isn’t the first time Acting
Secretary Su has helped essential workers and their employers reach an
agreement. She continues to play an integral role helping my
administration and workers across this country build an economy that
works for everyone. I always say that collective bargaining works. It
works for UPS drivers and dock workers, writers, and millions of
American workers who exercise their right to participate in a union. I’m
heartened to see health care workers and their employers take this
critical step towards securing the pay, benefits, and working conditions
these heroes deserve.
