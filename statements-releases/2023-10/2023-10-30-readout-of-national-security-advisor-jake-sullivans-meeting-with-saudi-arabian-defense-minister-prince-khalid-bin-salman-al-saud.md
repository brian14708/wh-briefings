National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan welcomed Saudi Arabian Defense
Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud and his accompanying
delegation to the White House today.  Mr. Sullivan discussed ongoing
efforts to strengthen the defense partnership between the United States
and Saudi Arabia, which for decades has served as a cornerstone for
regional stability and deterrence.  He confirmed President Biden’s
commitment to support the defense of U.S. partners against threats from
state and non-state actors, including those backed by Iran.  On Yemen,
Mr. Sullivan welcomed the significant de-escalation of the conflict over
the past year and a half and endorsed Saudi-led efforts to bring the war
to a close altogether.  Mr. Sullivan and Minister bin Salman also
discussed the current situation in Gaza, following the recent phone call
between President Biden and Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman.  They affirmed the urgent need to increase humanitarian
assistance for the people of Gaza.  They further emphasized the
importance of working towards a sustainable peace between Israelis and
Palestinians, building on the work that was already underway between
Saudi Arabia and the United States over recent months.  They affirmed
the importance of deterring any state or non-state actor from seeking to
expand the conflict.
