title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Hurricane\_Otis"
---
 
I am deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation caused by
Hurricane Otis this week in Mexico. Our hearts are with all those
impacted by this terrible storm. I have directed my Administration to
work closely with our partners in the Government of Mexico to offer our
full support. We are also working to ensure the safety of American
citizens in and around Acapulco.  The United States stands by Mexico —
our neighbor and our friend — at this difficult time.
