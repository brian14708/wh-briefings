title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Georgia Supreme Court\
  \ Decision Upholding Abortion\_Ban"
---
 
Today, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld a devastating abortion ban that
has stripped away the reproductive freedom of millions of women in
Georgia and threatened physicians with jail time for providing
care. Since the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, we’ve seen the dangerous
impact bans like this have had on women across the country. Women
have been denied the medical care they desperately need to preserve
their health, including being turned away from emergency rooms, forced
to travel hundreds of miles for care, and faced complications that make
it more difficult to have children in the future.   
   
It doesn’t end there. Republican elected officials are doubling down and
calling for a national abortion ban that would criminalize reproductive
health care in every state. President Biden and Vice President
Harris won’t stop fighting until the protections of *Roe v. Wade *are
restored in federal law.
