title: "U.S.-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology Dialogue: Joint Vision\_Statement"
---
 
The United States and Singapore affirm the significant promise of
technology to spur inclusive economic growth and acknowledge its
potential to transform our societies and the future geopolitical
landscape.  Building on the March 2022 meeting between U.S. President
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore Lee
Hsien Loong, the United States and Singapore resolve to take bold new
steps forward—as friends and strategic partners—to foster open,
accessible, and secure technology ecosystems grounded in mutual trust,
confidence, and a steadfast commitment to the rules-based international
order.  
   
Today, following up on the leaders’ commitments, Singapore’s Deputy
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong delivered opening remarks at the inaugural
U.S.-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology (CET) Dialogue in
Washington, D.C., chaired by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan,
Acting Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technology Seth Center
(on behalf of Secretary of State Antony Blinken), Minister for Foreign
Affairs Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, and Minister for Communications and
Information and Minister-in-Charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity
Josephine Teo.  The United States and Singapore commit to upgrade our
bilateral partnership to ensure that our combined endeavours at the
frontiers of the scientific and technological enterprise continue to
serve the global good.  This includes our work at the forefront of
combatting the climate crisis through the U.S.-Singapore Climate
Partnership, established in 2021 and updated in 2023, to catalyze
innovation around low- and zero-emission technologies, including in
hard-to-abate sectors such as shipping and aviation, and drive broader
regional efforts to decarbonize and deploy renewable energy.  
   
The launch of the U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue marks the first of several
significant steps to build enduring collaboration across our business,
scientific, and national security communities with an eye toward
delivering benefits for the U.S. and Singaporean people and our partners
in ASEAN and across the Indo-Pacific region.  We will bolster scientific
and research ties across our governments, industries, and university
sectors grounded in a commitment to timely exchange of knowledge and
information and scientific quality and rigor.  We will also explore an
appropriate bilateral agreement to expand our science and technology
cooperation.  
   
Our collaboration in this new high-level forum will also complement and
accelerate key initiatives across a range of existing bilateral
engagements, such as the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and
Innovation and the U.S.-Singapore Cyber Dialogue.  It will support the
ambitious agenda we are jointly driving in multilateral economic
initiatives, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity
(IPEF), to facilitate two-way trade flows, build resilient supply
chains, facilitate the clean-energy transition, and combat corruption
and enhance the efficiency of tax administration.  Looking forward, the
United States and Singapore intend to anchor the CET Dialogue and
corollary lines of efforts in six main areas, each of which have
significant bearing on our shared security and prosperity:

-   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The United States and Singapore
    resolve to deepen information-sharing and consultations on
    international AI security, safety, trust, and standards development,
    while continuing to race ahead at the leading edge of responsible
    innovation.  Acknowledging alignment in our approaches and our
    combined influence in the field of AI, we intend to launch a
    bilateral AI Governance Group focused on advancing shared principles
    and deepening information exchanges for safe, trustworthy, and
    responsible AI innovation, to complement the United States’
    Voluntary AI Commitments and a potential multilateral AI Code of
    Conduct.  We welcome the completion of a mapping exercise between
    the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework and the Singapore
    Infocomm Media Development Authority’s AI Verify, and will build on
    our shared principles through the launch of an AI Governance Group
    to complement the United States’ Voluntary AI Commitments and
    potential multilateral AI Code of Conduct.  Furthermore, we look
    forward to expanding bilateral research collaboration – including
    between the U.S. National Science Foundation and AI Singapore – with
    a focus on AI safety and security and to enhance workforce
    development efforts.    
-   **Digital Economy and Data Governance:** The United States and
    Singapore will harness technology to promote inclusive and
    sustainable economic growth.  The two countries intend to develop a
    bilateral Roadmap for Digital Economic Cooperation that charts
    common principles and objectives on priority issues such as data
    governance, digital standards, digital inclusion, consumer
    protection, and ensuring small- and medium-enterprises can benefit
    from opportunities in the digital economy. We will also continue to
    work within the IPEF to make the digital economy more innovative and
    equitable. The United States and Singapore share an interest in
    facilitating trusted data flows with effective privacy protections. 
    Through the existing Partnership for Growth and Innovation, the two
    sides commit to continued collaboration to promote these goals,
    including through the expansion of the Global Cross-Border Privacy
    Rules Forum.  Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and
    the Monetary Authority of Singapore will convene a meeting with
    relevant officials across our governments on both sides to explore
    how to strengthen our bilateral collaboration on digital payments,
    sharing information on our respective approaches with a view toward
    working together to shape international best practices.  Finally,
    the United States and Singapore will seek to cooperate in a more
    concerted fashion in relevant regional and multilateral fora, and in
    international standards-setting bodies, to advance our shared
    digital economy objectives.  
-   **Biotechnology:** The United States is committed to building strong
    security, privacy, and ethical standards around DNA sequencing data,
    storage, and research to ensure the use of these data are consistent
    with our norms and secure against cyber intrusion and other malign
    activities.  The United States and Singapore recognize the vital
    importance of furthering the development of safe and secure
    biotechnologies, and their ethical use in line with internationally
    accepted principles and norms.  The two countries intend to convene
    our science agencies to advance shared research and development
    priorities, including in synthetic biology, cell and gene
    therapeutics, and genetic delivery systems.  We will also convene
    universities, research institutions, private sectors, and governance
    agencies to drive new talent exchanges and connect our start-up
    communities to exchange best practices around commercialization,
    scaling, and R&D translation efforts.  
-   **Critical Infrastructure and Technology Supply Chains:** The two
    countries commit to advance focused collaboration toward promoting
    secure and resilient information and communications technology
    infrastructure—including telecommunications networks, undersea
    cables, and cloud computing—in the United States, Singapore, and
    partner nations.  We intend to upgrade long-standing collaboration
    on smart cities with a focus on climate resilience, including under
    the U.S.-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership.  The United States and
    Singapore look forward to deeper knowledge-sharing on how our cities
    can harness technologies to meet urban challenges in ways that
    strengthen livability, sustainability, and resilience.  The two
    countries commit to establish a Smart Cities Program on AI through
    the U.S.-Singapore Third Country Training Program to deliver
    capacity-building to ASEAN and Pacific Islands Forum members. 
    Finally, the two sides underscore the importance of strengthening
    cooperation, including under the Partnership for Growth and
    Innovation Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chain Pillar, and of
    exchanging information on domestic strategies for strengthening
    semiconductor supply chain resilience.     
-   **Defense Innovation:** The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the
    Singapore Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) look forward to expanding
    collaboration on critical emerging technologies and defense
    innovation.  To wit, MINDEF and U.S. DoD’s Defense Innovation Unit
    (DIU) intend to formalize a partnership that accelerates the use of
    commercial and dual-use technologies such as autonomy, digital
    technologies, and AI, to solve operational challenges for our
    militaries.  This partnership will drive focused efforts toward
    better integrating our defense innovation ecosystems in service of
    stability in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.  
-   **Quantum Information Science and Technology:** The United States
    and Singapore welcome each other’s investments in our respective
    national quantum information sciences initiatives and intend to
    support our respective efforts to collaborate with trusted
    international partners.  Toward this end, the United States and
    Singapore commit to expand government, academic, and private sector
    engagement and talent exchanges—through the State Department’s
    International Visitor Leadership Program and/or other longer-term
    programs that enable more sustained exchanges between our technical
    experts—to lay the groundwork for deeper collaboration and mutual
    support in this crucial technology area.  They also intend to expand
    information-sharing on Post Quantum Cryptography migration between
    the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology and the
    Department of Homeland Security together with Singapore’s National
    Quantum Office and Ministry of Communications and Information.  In
    addition to bilateral exchanges, the two sides note the importance
    of coordinating on standards and pre-standardization work, including
    in relevant international bodies such as the International
    Telecommunication Union and the International Organization for
    Standardization.

Finally, as the United States and Singapore continue to lead in the
technologies of the future, we will advance close consultations on our
respective measures to build a robust innovation ecosystem ensure that
emerging technologies work for, and not against, our shared security and
prosperity.  We will leverage the U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue to promote
candid and sustained exchanges on risks, opportunities, and key national
security implications associated with the rapid advancement of
technologies across these six focus areas.  The United States and
Singapore will discuss our respective approaches to managing risks,
bolstering economic resilience, and building trusted technology
ecosystems while maintaining our long-standing and shared commitment to
open investment.  
   
The United States and Singapore look forward to holding the next CET
Dialogue in Singapore in 2024, co-chaired by the National Security
Council, Department of State, and Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Ministry of Communications and Information.  In the
intervening period, we plan to coordinate with key ministries,
departments and agencies, and external stakeholders to continue the
vital work of bridging our innovation ecosystems to deliver a brighter
future for our two peoples and for the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. 
Our combined commitment to excellence and shared respect for
international law, sovereignty, and peaceful resolution of disputes will
form the foundation of our national ties, even as we move with greater
ambition and ingenuity to propel our strategic partnership into the
future.
