title: "FACT SHEET: White\_House Calls on Congress to Advance Critical National Security\_\
  Priorities"
---
 
Today, the President is requesting [supplemental funding from
Congress](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/10/20/letter-regarding-critical-national-security-funding-needs-for-fy-2024/)
that advances our national security and supports our allies and
partners. Since the horrific terrorist attack by Hamas, President Biden
has surged security, intelligence, and diplomatic support to the people
of Israel. This supplemental request will continue to provide the
necessary security assistance to Israel, support Israeli efforts to
secure the release of hostages, and extend humanitarian assistance to
civilians impacted by the war in Israel and in Gaza.  
  
The United States’ support to Israel comes at the same time that
Vladimir Putin’s illegal war against the people of Ukraine passes its
600th day. The actions of the Biden-Harris Administration have enabled
the people of Ukraine to defend their nation against a brutal and
unprovoked invasion and recapture territory seized by Russian forces,
liberating Ukrainian civilians from Russian occupation. The
Administration’s supplemental request will provide the critical
training, equipment, and weapons necessary to help Ukraine defend and
recapture its sovereign territory and protect the Ukrainian people
against Russian aggression.  
  
The Administration’s supplemental invests in our military industrial
base to ensure our military readiness, including replenishing resources
to meet our defense needs as we support Israel and Ukraine, as well as
the growing security requirements in the Indo-Pacific. Resources for the
American defense industrial base will support American jobs, increase
our nation’s ability to produce critically important munitions and other
equipment, and ensure our Military continues to be the most ready,
capable, and best equipped fighting force the world has ever seen. The
Administration’s supplemental also requests increased support to allies
and partners in our strategic competition with the People’s Republic of
China (PRC). It will mobilize hundreds of billions from international
finance institutions to provide a sustainable source of financing to
developing countries as an alternative to the coercive lending practices
of the PRC.  
  
Additionally, we’ve been clear that the Congressional Republicans need
to stop playing political games with border security and provide the
resources our law enforcement personnel need to secure the southwest
border and stop the flow of fentanyl into our country. President Biden
continues to implement a regional migration strategy focused on
enforcement, deterrence, and diplomacy. While progress has been made,
President Biden has made clear that we need more funding to enhance our
enforcement measures.  
  
**To advance our critical national security interests, the Biden-Harris
Administration is calling on Congress to provide additional national
security resources that will:**

***<u>Support Israel’s Defense Against Terrorism</u>***  
  
Immediately following the brutal October 7 terrorist attack in Israel,
President Biden directed his Administration to take swift and decisive
action to ensure the government of Israel has everything it needs to
defend itself consistent with the rule of law and the law of war. To
build on that support, today the Administration is requesting funding to
aid Israel’s defense against these horrific terrorist attacks. **This
request includes funds to:**

-   **Strengthen Israel’s defense from vicious terrorist attacks** **and
    bolster the Israeli Defense Forces** through Department of Defense
    (DOD) assistance.
-   **Ensure Israel’s air and missile defense systems’ readiness** with
    support for the Government of Israel’s procurement of Iron Dome and
    David’s Sling missile defense systems and components, and
    development of Iron Beam.
-   **Replenish DOD stocks** that are being drawn down to support Israel
    in its time of need.
-   **Strengthen Israel’s military and enhance U.S. embassy security**
    with foreign military financing from the Department of State**.**

***<u>Defend Ukraine Against Russian Aggression</u>***

Previous supplemental appropriations for direct military aid, economic
and humanitarian assistance, and other support for Ukraine have been
committed or nearly committed. As Ukrainians wage a tough
counteroffensive and as winter approaches, the world is watching what
Congress does next. **The Administration’s request will provide funding
for:**

-   **Additional weapons and equipment to help Ukraine succeed on the
    battlefield and protect its people against Russian attacks**, as
    well as replenish DOD stocks provided to Ukraine via Presidential
    drawdown authority. The weapons and equipment the United States has
    provided to date include air defense systems, munitions, small arms,
    ground maneuver units, and other key capabilities that have made a
    significant difference on the battlefield, helping Ukraine save
    countless lives and win the battles for Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson.
-   **Continued military, intelligence, and other defense support**,
    including robust investments in the defense industrial base,
    transportation costs of U.S. personnel and equipment, and continuing
    an enhanced U.S. troop presence in Europe among other critical
    support activities, in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine.
-   **Critical economic and civilian security assistance**, including
    direct budget support to help Ukraine continue to provide critical
    services to its people and sustain its economy while under attack;
    assistance for investments in critical infrastructure; support for
    civilian law enforcement; and assistance for demining in territory
    recently liberated from Russian occupation.
-   **Support for Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s war** and provided
    safety and shelter in the United States through Uniting for Ukraine.
-   **Nuclear and radiological crisis management**, response, and
    partner capacity building in case of emergencies as part of our
    general contingency planning.

***<u>Provide Life-Saving Humanitarian Assistance</u>***  
  
In addition to funding for security assistance for Ukraine and Israel,
we are also requesting funding to address humanitarian needs of innocent
civilians, including those impacted by the war in Israel and in Gaza.
Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine also continues to have a global impact,
particularly on food security, given Ukraine’s role as the leading grain
producer in the world, and this humanitarian assistance will address
global needs. Our humanitarian assistance is critical to demonstrating
U.S. leadership amid unprecedented levels of humanitarian need,
geopolitical competition, and global challenges. **This request includes
funds to:**

-   **Provide life-saving humanitarian assistance and support for
    innocent civilians** devastated by Putin’s unjust war in Ukraine,
    Hamas’ attack on Israel, and the numerous other natural and man-made
    crises around the world. This includes life-saving humanitarian
    assistance in Gaza and support for Palestinian refugees in the West
    Bank and surrounding areas

***<u>Strengthen Security in the Indo-Pacific</u>***

It is critically important that we not lose our focus on the importance
of integrated deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. Our allies and partners in
the region need our support more than ever, and this request provides
resources to help them build the capabilities necessary to meet emerging
challenges. **This request will provide funding for:**

-   **Security assistance for capacity building to address ongoing and
    emerging threats** to critical allies and partners in the
    Indo-Pacific. This funding will bolster deterrence and support key
    allies and partners as they face an increasingly assertive PRC, and
    will support partners transitioning off of Russian military
    equipment.
-   **The United States’ Submarine Industrial Base**, through
    improvements and infrastructure work at the Navy’s four public
    shipyards and increasing production rates and submarine availability
    through initiatives in supplier development, shipbuilder and
    supplier infrastructure, workforce development, technology
    advancements, government oversight, and strategic sourcing. This
    funding will accelerate build and sustainment rates for attack
    submarines, one of our most effective capabilities for maintaining
    deterrence, in order to meet U.S. military requirements.  
-   **AUKUS**. While this funding for our submarine industrial base is
    necessary to meet U.S. national needs, these investments will also
    support U.S. commitments under AUKUS – our trilateral security
    partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom – the first major
    deliverable of which was our historic decision to support Australia
    acquiring conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines.
    Australia has also committed to provide a proportionate financial
    investment in the U.S. submarine industrial base to accelerate the
    delivery of Virginia class submarines.

***<u>Ensure Military Readiness</u>***  
  
As we support our partners in Israel, Ukraine, and across the
Indo-Pacific, the Administration’s request –including the items
described above – provides funding to ensure American military readiness
by **investing over $50 billionin the American defense industrial base
with** through replenishment funding and other forms of security
assistance, like foreign military financing and the Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative. Resources for the American defense industrial
base will support American jobs, increase our nation’s ability to
produce critically important munitions and other equipment, and ensure
our Military continues to be the most ready, capable, and best equipped
fighting force the world has ever seen. Without additional replenishment
funding, DOD will be unable to continue to backfill the Military
Services for equipment provided via drawdown to Ukraine and Israel,
thereby degrading U.S. readiness.  
  
***<u>Provide Alternatives to Coercive PRC Financing in Developing
Countries</u>***  
  
To provide a credible alternative to the People’s Republic of China’s
coercive and unsustainable financing for developing countries around the
world, the Administration’s request will advance high-leverage solutions
through the international financial institutions. This historic U.S.
action will support the mobilization of $200 billion of new financing
for developing countries backed by our partners and allies. **The
requested funding will:**

-   **Materially expand development finance to the countries hard hit by
    the spillovers of Russia’s war** through funding for the World Bank.
-   **Unlock up to $21 billion in new transparent lending** with no
    additional appropriations through the authorization to lend to two
    International Monetary Fund (IMF) trust funds.

**Additionally, we are seeking authorization to ensure** **the IMF can
respond quickly to future global financial shocks and restore stability
to both economies and markets, minimizing negative spillovers that could
affect the U.S. economy**, by providing the authority to extend our
participation in the IMF’s New Arrangements to Borrow mechanism.  
  
***<u>Strengthen Border Security and Enforcement</u>***  
  
The Administration is asking Congress to provide the resources our law
enforcement personnel need to secure the southwest border and stop the
flow of fentanyl into our country. President Biden continues to
implement a regional migration strategy focused on enforcement,
diplomacy, and legal pathways and work authorization. The plan has
resulted in the largest expansion of legal pathways in decades,
increased the number of law enforcement personnel along the border and
expedited removals of unlawful crossings thanks to historic diplomatic
agreements. Despite the progress made, President Biden has made clear
that we need more funding to execute on our three-part strategy,
including enhancing our enforcement measures. **The requested funding
supports:**

-   **An additional 1,300 border patrol agents** to work alongside the
    20,200 agents already funded in the FY2024 Budget.
-   **Funding to deploy over 100 cutting-edge inspection machines** to
    help detect fentanyl at our southwest border ports of entry.

<!-- -->

-   **Additional 1,000 law enforcement personnel and investigative
    capabilities** to prevent cartels from moving fentanyl into the
    country.
-   **1,600 additional asylum officers** to increase by 2.5 times the
    number of personnel that interview and adjudicate claims for asylum
    and facilitate timely decisions so that those who are ineligible can
    be quickly removed and those with valid claims can have faster
    resolution.
-   **375 new immigration judge teams,** the largest incremental request
    ever, to adjudicate and process immigration cases more quickly and
    help reduce the caseload backlog.
-   **Additional grants to local governments and non-profits** to
    support the provision of for temporary food, shelter, and other
    services for those recently released from DHS custody.
-   **Critical border management activities**, including additional
    temporary holding facilities and detention beds for fair and fast
    processing for recent arrivals.
-   **Expansion of lawful pathways**, including efforts to streamline
    the processing of eligible refugees and migrants through the Safe
    Mobility Offices Initiative.
-   **Support for eligible arrivals,** including services to
    successfully resettle in the United States and become
    self-sufficient.
-   **Funding to conduct robust child labor investigations and
    enforcement,** particularly to protect vulnerable migrant children
    entering the United States through the southern border.
-   **Reimbursement to the Department of Defense for its support**
    provided along the southwest border in FY 2024.

Finally, our nation faces additional urgent needs for millions of
hard-working Americans. In coming days, the Administration will also
submit a request for supplemental funds to address recent natural
disasters, avoid the risk that millions of Americans lose access to
affordable high-speed internet or child care, provide additional
resources for FEMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program, and avert a
funding cliff for wildland firefighter pay. Congress should also address
critical funding needs the Administration communicated earlier this
fall, including to protect critical nutrition assistance for millions of
pregnant women, infants, and children through the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).
