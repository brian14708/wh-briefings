title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Lt. Governors on Preventing Gun\_Violence"
---
 
Today, Tom Perez, Assistant to the President, Senior Advisor to the
President, and Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs,
Stefanie Feldman, Assistant to the President, Staff Secretary, and
Director of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and Gregory Jackson
and Rob Wilcox, Special Assistants to the President and Deputy Directors
of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention met with Lieutenant Governors
to discuss ways they can best work to address gun violence prevention.

Gun violence is a pervasive crisis in the United States, and states are
at the forefront of efforts to stem gun violence in their communities.
The meeting reaffirms the Biden-Harris Administrationâ€™s commitment to
reduce gun violence.

Last month, President Biden established the first ever White House
Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris, to
implement and expand upon key executive and legislative action which has
been taken to save lives. The Office of Gun Violence Prevention
continues to build on historic actions taken by President Biden
including signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most
significant legislative action on gun violence in nearly 30 years, and
taking more executive actions than any other president to make our
homes, schools, churches, grocery stores, and communities safer.

In the meeting, White House officials and Lieutenant Governors discussed
ways the Lieutenant Governors can be a partner to help enact policies to
prevent gun violence in their communities and what resources are
available at the federal level to address gun crimes and violent crimes
generally. Additionally, the meeting served as a way to strengthen
federal and state partnerships on gun violence.

Participating Lieutenant Governors included:  
Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis  
Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan  
Michigan Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II  
Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Sabina Matos  
Maryland Lieutenant Governor Aruna Miller  
Treasurer of Oregon Tobias Read  
Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Sara Rodriguez  
Vermont Lieutenant Governor David Zukerman
