  Israel"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke this afternoon with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.  The leaders discussed developments in
Gaza as well as ongoing efforts to locate and secure the release of
hostages to include American citizens we believe are held by Hamas. 
They also reviewed ongoing discussions to ensure safe passage for
foreign nationals wishing to depart Gaza as soon as possible.  The
President discussed ongoing U.S. support for the continuous flow of
humanitarian support to the civilian population in Gaza and welcomed
efforts to increase this support over the coming period.  The President
reiterated that Israel has every right and responsibility to defend its
citizens from terrorism and to do so in a manner consistent with
international humanitarian law.  He also noted the importance of
focusing on what comes after this crisis to include a pathway for a
permanent peace between Israelis and Palestinians, emphasizing that
Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate
aspirations.  They agreed to remain in regular consultation both
directly and through their respective national security teams.
