\*\*\*  
Posoh!  
   
Secretary Haaland – Deb, you’re such an extraordinary woman. You fight
tirelessly for native people and our public lands. Thank you for your
leadership and your partnership.   
   
Chairwoman Kakkak, it’s been incredible to spend the day with you and
the people of Menominee Nation.   
   
Thank you for welcoming me and for showing me some of the things that
make this community so special.  
   
President Caldwell, thank you for the warm welcome to the College
of Menominee Nation.  
   
Being surrounded by so many amazing women, it’s hard not to think of Ada
Deer.  
   
Born on this reservation. The first woman to lead the Menominee Nation.
A barrier breaker. And a fierce advocate for all native people.   
   
Her years-long battle to restore this tribe’s sovereignty changed the
course of history – and the law of the land.   
   
Ada learned that strength from someone whose name history may not
remember, but who changed it all the same: her mother, Connie.   
   
She told Ada that she was put on this earth for a purpose and that
purpose was to help her people.  
   
Most of our mothers aren’t in the history books, but they left pieces of
their spirits in all of us, didn’t they?  
   
My mother never asked me to follow in her footsteps – she only made sure
I knew I could find my own way and that she’d be there to root for me.  
   
And though she left before I was done needing her, I feel her strength
inside me. I see her fire in my daughter, Ashley. I know that she never
stopped cheering me on.  
   
We’re all here today because someone believed in us. Because someone
taught us to be brave.  Our mothers. Our aunts. Our nanas. Our teachers
and mentors.  
   
As I’ve traveled the country as First Lady, I’ve visited Tribal Nations
and Native communities. And I’ve seen that bravery in the incredible
women I’ve met who are leading change.   
   
In tribal health clinics and schools, I’ve met women and men who are
weaving their heritage with their dreams, expanding connections through
the reach of broadband, supporting revitalization of their native
languages, and fighting for clean water.  
   
And Joe’s Administration is proud to be a partner in those efforts.  
   
That’s why Joe’s made the largest-ever federal investment in Indian
Country. He’s honoring the nation-to-nation relationship – making sure
all parts of his administration are consulting with tribes. And he’s
begun an unprecedented collaboration with Tribal Nations to manage the
lands, waters, and natural wonders that are important to you, because
you know best what you need.   
   
Today, I saw how the Menominee people and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture are working together to bring federal resources here, so the
tribe can continue sustainably managing the forest using knowledge
passed down from generation to generation – harvesting lumber while
protecting the environment.  
   
Young Sugar Maples, Black Ashes, and White Pines grow in a ring with an
older tree at their center – like a mother watching over her circle of
daughters, as they grow from seed to sapling, to tall and strong in
their own time.  
   
That’s all any mother hopes for – that our daughters will take what we
know and make their own way, shape and shift the world after us – like
young trees stretching up to the sky.   
   
Because a piece of past generations lives on in each of us.  
   
Ada’s legacy lives on in all of you.  
   
She taught us how to run head first into a problem even if it seems
impossible to fix – because someone has to try. She showed us how to
never let a loss become a defeat. How to lead when there’s no one to
follow.  
   
I know your ancestors and mentors and teachers are proud of you and all
that you’ve accomplished – and their spirits live on in your work.  
   
The ideas and partnerships that you create here will ripple far beyond
this room. Your innovation and creativity, your leadership and your
wisdom, will inspire the girls who will inherit this earth.  
   
And they will know they belong in all places of power, that their
boldness is beautiful, that they can be anything they want to be as they
go on to lead and shape this world too.     
   
Joe and I stand with you and all of Indian Country, as we work to build
a brighter future together.  
   
It’s been an honor to spend time with your community today and see the
incredible work you’re doing.

Thank you for welcoming me to your nation.
