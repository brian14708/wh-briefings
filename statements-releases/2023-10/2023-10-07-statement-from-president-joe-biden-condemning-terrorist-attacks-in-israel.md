title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Condemning Terrorist Attacks in\_Israel"
---
 
This morning, I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu about the horrific
and ongoing attacks in Israel.  The United States unequivocally condemns
this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and
I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer
all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel.
Terrorism is never justified. Israel has a right to defend itself and
its people. The United States warns against any other party hostile to
Israel seeking advantage in this situation.  My Administration’s support
for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.  
   
Jill and I are keeping in our prayers all of the families who have been
hurt by this violence. We are heartbroken by the lives that have been
tragically cut short and hope for a swift recovery for all those who
have been wounded.  
   
My team and I are tracking this situation closely, and I will remain in
close touch with Prime Minister Netanyahu.
