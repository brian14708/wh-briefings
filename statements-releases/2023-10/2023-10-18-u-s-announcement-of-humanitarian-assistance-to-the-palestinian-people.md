title: "U.S. Announcement of Humanitarian Assistance to the Palestinian\_People"
---
 
President Biden announced today that the United States is providing $100
million in humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people in Gaza
and the West Bank. This funding will help support over a million
displaced and conflict-affected people with clean water, food, hygiene
support, medical care, and other essential needs. The United States
provides humanitarian assistance through trusted partners including UN
agencies and international NGOs.

Civilians are not to blame and should not suffer for Hamas’s horrific
terrorism. Civilian lives must be protected and assistance must urgently
reach those in need. We will continue to work closely with partners in
the region to stress the importance of upholding the law of war,
supporting those who are trying to get to safety or provide assistance,
and facilitating access to food, water, medical care, and shelter.
