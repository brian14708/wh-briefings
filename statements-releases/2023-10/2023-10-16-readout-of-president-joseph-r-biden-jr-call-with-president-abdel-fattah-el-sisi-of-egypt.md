President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Abdel Fattah
El-Sisi of Egypt.  They discussed ongoing efforts to alleviate the
worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in coordination with the UN,
Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and other regional partners,
and the need to preserve stability in the Middle East more broadly. 
President Biden condemned Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel and
reiterated that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right
to dignity and self-determination.  The two leaders agreed to continue
their close coordination to prevent the conflict from widening and
ensure humanitarian assistance reaches those in need.
