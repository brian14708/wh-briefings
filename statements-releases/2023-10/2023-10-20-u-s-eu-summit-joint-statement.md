title: "U.S.-EU Summit Joint\_Statement"
---
 
1.  The United States and the European Union and its Member States,
    representing nearly 800 million citizens, united by our values and
    bound together by the most dynamic economic relationship on earth,
    reaffirm our commitment to a transatlantic partnership that delivers
    for all our people.  Since the last U.S.-EU Summit in June 2021, the
    world has changed in unprecedented ways, and we have taken ambitious
    steps in response.  Together, we are working to secure peace,
    stability, and prosperity regionally and across the world, including
    in our steadfast support for Ukraine.  We are deepening our
    cooperation to reflect the pressing challenges and opportunities of
    our time—strengthening our economic security; advancing reliable,
    sustainable, affordable, and secure energy transitions in our
    economies and globally; reinforcing multilateralism and
    international cooperation; and harnessing digital technologies to
    work for, not against, our shared values of democracy and respect
    for human rights and the rule of law. We are more united than
    ever.  
      
    **<u>A. TOWARD A MORE SECURE AND STABLE WORLD</u>**  
      
    **Situation in the Middle East**  
     
2.  We condemn in the strongest possible terms Hamas and its brutal
    terrorist attacks across Israel.  There is no justification for
    terrorism.  We affirm Israel’s right to defend itself against these
    heinous attacks, in line with international law, including
    international humanitarian law.  We will work closely with partners
    in the region to stress the importance of protecting civilians,
    supporting those who are trying to get to safety or provide
    assistance, and facilitating access to food, water, medical care,
    and shelter.  We are concerned by the deteriorating humanitarian
    crisis in Gaza.  It is crucial to prevent regional escalation. We
    call for the immediate release of all hostages and emphasize our
    shared view that a two-state solution remains the viable path to
    lasting peace  
      
    **Russia’s War against Ukraine and Support for Regional
    Stability**  
     
3.  The United States and the European Union remain unwavering in our
    long-term political, financial, humanitarian, and military support
    to Ukraine and its people as they defend themselves against Russia’s
    illegal and unprovoked war of aggression.  We stand together in
    calling for Russia to end its brutal war and to withdraw its
    military forces and proxies and military equipment immediately,
    completely, and unconditionally from the entire internationally
    recognized territory of Ukraine.  We are committed to achieving the
    widest possible international support for the key principles and
    objectives of Ukraine’s Peace Formula.  Any initiative for a
    comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine must be based on
    full respect for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and
    territorial integrity, within its internationally recognized borders
    and uphold all the purposes and principles of the United Nations
    Charter.   
     
4.  We are committed to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes to
    defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.  We recognize the
    urgency of ensuring that Russia does not succeed in collapsing the
    Ukrainian economy and of intensifying our efforts to help ensure
    assistance meets Ukraine’s highest priority needs.  As co-chairs,
    along with Ukraine, of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform,
    we are working together with Ukraine as it develops its Ukraine
    Plan, embedded in its European path, to incorporate a common set of
    near-term priority economic, rule-of-law, and democratization
    reforms and a prioritized and well-coordinated approach to recovery
    and reconstruction assistance and investment.  The United States and
    the European Union, together with other international donors, will
    continue to provide Ukraine with financing to help achieve these
    objectives, including to defend, repair, and rebuild its energy
    sector aligned with EU standards.  We acknowledge Ukraine’s
    commitment and progress in their reform efforts, and underline the
    strategic importance of its EU accession process.  
     
5.  Russia must cease its aggression and must bear the legal
    consequences of all its internationally wrongful acts, including
    compensation for the damage caused to Ukraine.  We are united in our
    determination to ensure full accountability.  In light of the
    urgency of disrupting Russia’s attempts to destroy the Ukrainian
    economy and Russia’s continued failure to abide by its international
    law obligations, the United States and the European Union, together
    with our allies, are convening our experts to explore options to
    compensate Ukraine in a timely manner for the loss, injury, and
    damage resulting from Russia’s aggression.  We are exploring all
    possible avenues to aid Ukraine, consistent with our respective
    legal systems and international law.  We are also working together
    with the global community to address the energy, economic, and food
    security challenges caused by Russia’s war of choice, which are
    particularly acute in the most vulnerable developing countries.  We
    condemn Russia’s attempts to block food exports and its attacks on
    Ukraine’s grain storage and shipment facilities since its withdrawal
    from the Black Sea Grain Initiative.  The EU’s Solidarity Lanes
    remain instrumental in bolstering global food security.   
     
6.  As part of our efforts to aid Ukraine, in the short term, we will
    explore how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities
    stemming directly from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, where
    those extraordinary revenues are not required to meet obligations
    towards Russia under applicable laws, could be directed to support
    Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction in compliance with
    applicable laws.  
     
7.  We will deepen our joint work to undermine Russia’s ability to wage
    its war, and maintain and expand its defense industrial base and
    capacity.  Those who help Russia acquire items or equipment for its
    defense industrial base are supporting actions which undermine the
    territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. 
    This includes companies supplying certain critical raw materials and
    high-priority items to Russia, as well as the financial institutions
    and other entities facilitating such transfers.  We will target
    third-country actors who materially support Russia’s war.  We will
    continue to vigorously and jointly enforce our sanctions and export
    control measures to disrupt circumvention and backfill.  Our joint
    implementation of the G7+ price cap for seaborne Russian-origin
    crude oil and petroleum products supports energy market stability
    while diminishing Russia’s ability to finance its illegal war.  We
    intend to act, consistent with our respective legal authorities,
    where we have evidence indicating violations or deceptive practices
    related to the price cap policy.  
     
8.  We reaffirm our support for the Republic of Moldova’s territorial
    integrity and sovereignty.  The European Council decided in June to
    grant the status of candidate country to the Republic of Moldova. 
    We will continue to support Moldova in addressing the challenges it
    faces as a consequence of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and
    in reform efforts on its European path.  We remain fully committed
    to supporting Georgia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and
    its European perspective.  We reaffirm our shared commitment to
    stability in the Western Balkans and our support to the EU
    perspective of the region.  All partners should continue making the
    reforms required to progress on their European path.  We note the
    need for Kosovo and Serbia to urgently de-escalate tensions and to
    swiftly and unconditionally implement the agreement on the path to
    normalization of their relations and return to the EU-facilitated
    Dialogue.  We remain committed to advancing a lasting peace between
    Armenia and Azerbaijan based on mutual recognition of sovereignty,
    inviolability of borders and territorial integrity.  We urge
    Azerbaijan to ensure the rights and security of those who remain in
    Nagorno-Karabakh as well as for those who wish to return to their
    homes.  We also call for all parties to adhere to the principle of
    non-use of force and threat of use of force.  
      
    **Africa**  
     
9.  The United States and the European Union share a common interest in
    a thriving, peaceful, democratic, and resilient Africa, and welcome
    the accession of the African Union as a permanent member of the
    G20.  We will work together to continue to enhance synergies in our
    cooperation with all our African partners.  We are committed to
    promoting the security, stability and prosperity of North Africa. 
    We reaffirm our commitment to tackle common security challenges in
    the Sahel, including the fight against terrorism, in cooperation
    with ECOWAS.  
      
    **Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific**  
     
10. We reiterate our shared commitment to enhancing coordination and
    cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific with the aim
    of contributing to the stability, security, prosperity and
    sustainable development of the region, based on the promotion of
    democracy, rule of law, human rights and international law. 
    Consistent with our respective Indo-Pacific strategies, we will seek
    opportunities to enhance practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,
    including through the biannual U.S.-EU Indo-Pacific Consultations. 
    This includes expanding maritime domain awareness, encouraging
    cooperation on connectivity, responding to foreign information
    manipulation and interference, increasing coordination on cyber
    cooperation, and encouraging ongoing efforts to uphold fundamental
    freedoms and human rights.  We reaffirm our unwavering support for
    ASEAN centrality and unity and our commitment to promoting
    cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.  We
    also reaffirm our partnership with Pacific Island countries and
    reiterate the importance of supporting their priorities and needs in
    accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum’s 2050 Strategy for the
    Blue Pacific Continent.  
     
11. We reiterate our support for international law, in particular as
    reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
    (UNCLOS), and for the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance
    with international law, including under UNCLOS dispute settlement
    mechanisms.  
      
    **China**  
     
12. The United States and European Union recall our discussions in other
    fora, including the G7, on the principles that underpin our
    relations with China. We stand prepared to build constructive and
    stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging
    candidly with and expressing our concerns directly to China.  It is
    necessary to cooperate with China, given its role in the
    international community and the size of its economy, on global
    challenges as well as areas of common interest.  We call on China to
    engage with us, including in international fora, on areas such as
    the climate and biodiversity crisis, addressing vulnerable
    countries’ debt sustainability and financing needs, global health
    and pandemic preparedness, and macroeconomic stability.  
     
13. With a view to enabling sustainable economic relations with China,
    we will push for a level playing field for our firms and workers. 
    We are not decoupling or turning inwards. At the same time, we
    recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking and
    diversifying.  In this context, we will invest in our own economic
    vibrancy and reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities,
    including in our supply chains.  We also recognize the necessity of
    protecting certain advanced technologies that could be used to
    threaten global peace and security, without unduly limiting trade
    and investment.  We will foster resilience to economic coercion.  We
    will address challenges posed by non-market policies and
    practices.  
     
14. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and
    South China Seas and strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to
    change the status quo by force or coercion. We underscore the
    importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and
    encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is
    no change in the one China policy of the United States or of the
    European Union.  
     
15. We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights and forced
    labor in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang.  With respect to
    Hong Kong, we call on China to honor its previous commitments with
    respect to Hong Kong under the Sino-Joint Declaration and the Basic
    Law.  
     
16. We call on China to press Russia to stop its war of aggression, and
    immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from
    Ukraine. We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and
    lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and
    purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue
    with Ukraine.  
      
    **Strengthening Cooperation on Security and Defense**  
     
17. We will further strengthen and deepen EU-U.S. cooperation and
    engagement on security and defense.  This could include enhancing
    practical cooperation in operational theatres of mutual interest. 
    NATO remains the foundation of collective defense for its Allies and
    essential for Euro Atlantic security.  We recognize the value of a
    stronger and more capable European defense that contributes
    positively to global and transatlantic security and is complementary
    to, and interoperable with NATO.  We welcome the signature of the
    Administrative Arrangement between the United States Department of
    Defense and the European Defense Agency*<u>.</u>*  
      
    **Partnering with Emerging Economies and Developing Countries **  
     
18. The United States and the European Union are committed to
    accelerating progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and
    to mobilizing additional financing for development.  To this end, we
    are committed to advancing reforms for better, bigger, and more
    effective multilateral development banks to address global
    challenges and countries’ core development needs.  This includes the
    implementation of critical financial reforms and a review of the
    climate finance architecture to make it more effective and
    efficient.  We commit to raising the level of ambition to deliver
    more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank’s
    capacity to support low- and middle-income countries addressing
    global challenges, with a clear framework for the allocation of
    scarce concessional resources, and to provide strong support for the
    poorest countries. The United States and the European Union will
    step up efforts to deliver substantial contributions to this end.  
     
19. Given the massive scale of need, greater private capital
    mobilization must play a significant role in meeting our
    objectives.  We will continue to champion efforts to unlock private
    capital and will work with G7 partners through respective actions,
    to scale the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment,
    including the European Union’s Global Gateway strategy, and mobilize
    $600 billion in quality infrastructure investments in low- and
    middle-income countries by 2027.  Building on the discussions on
    U.S.-EU collaboration on the Trans-African Corridor and the
    India-Middle East-Europe Corridor, we are working towards
    identifying additional regional economic corridors to cooperate on
    to unlock inclusive and sustainable economic growth.  
     
20. The United States and the European Union will also continue their
    efforts to promote digital inclusion and trustworthy information and
    communication technology and services supply chains around the world
    and pursue cooperation to develop a common vision and industry
    roadmap on research and development for 6G wireless communication
    systems.  
      
    **<u>B. STRENGTHENED U.S.-EU ECONOMIC COOPERATION</u>**  
     
21. The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) is the key forum for
    our cooperation on trade and technology matters. We commend the
    progress made and encourage advancing joint work in the run up to
    the upcoming TTC ministerial meeting later in 2023.  
     
22. The United States and the European Union are committed to
    strengthening the transatlantic marketplace to support decent jobs
    and economic opportunities with an emphasis on mutually beneficial
    resilience and sustainability of our supply chains.  We will advance
    the implementation of the Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable
    Trade focusing on facilitating mutually beneficial trade across the
    Atlantic of products and technologies that underpin the transition
    to a climate-neutral economy.   
      
    **Building the Sustainable and Resilient Economies of the Future**  
     
23. The United States and the European Union are deepening our
    collaboration to address the urgent and interdependent crises of
    climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and urge ambitious
    action by all other major players.  We will work expeditiously to
    implement the Paris Agreement, halt and reverse the loss of
    biodiversity globally and protect the ocean. We will intensify our
    outreach to third countries, notably in view of the
    28<sup>th</sup> UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28),
    making every effort to keep a 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global
    temperature warming within reach.  We are committed to working
    together and with others for COP28 to reach bold commitments to
    dramatically increase global renewable energy capacity and energy
    efficiency while supporting a global shift away from unabated fossil
    fuels, including an end to new unabated coal fired power plants.  We
    will continue to lead efforts to cut methane to support achieving
    the Global Methane Pledge and look forward to a robust Methane
    Finance Sprint announcement at COP28.  
     
24. Together, we will work to build climate neutral, circular, resource
    efficient and resilient economies, to promote internationally
    recognized labor rights, and to improve the resilience and
    sustainability of critical supply chains. We will continue our work
    to advance the energy transition to climate neutrality and bolster
    energy security through the Joint Energy Security Task Force and
    U.S.-EU Energy Council.  
     
25. We are making bold public investments in our respective economies,
    and will continue to also expand research collaboration, to ignite a
    clean industrial revolution and, with it, good jobs, and make our
    industries more sustainable and competitive.  We will continue
    ongoing cooperation toward this end, and work openly and
    transparently against zero-sum competition to maximize clean energy
    deployment, including through our Clean Energy Incentives
    Dialogue.  
     
26. We have made progress toward a targeted critical minerals agreement
    for the purpose of expanding access to sustainable, secure, and
    diversified high-standard critical mineral and battery supply chains
    and enabling those minerals extracted or processed in the European
    Union to count toward requirements for clean vehicles in the Section
    30D clean vehicle tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act.  We
    look forward to continuing to make progress and consulting with our
    respective stakeholders on these negotiations in the coming weeks.  
      
    **Expanding Technology Cooperation and Exchanges**  
     
27. The United States and the European Union are stepping up our joint
    efforts to promote an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable,
    secure, innovative, and competitive digital ecosystem.  We are
    cooperating to manage the risks and harness the benefits of
    artificial intelligence (AI), working alongside our partners in the
    G7, OECD, and other multilateral fora.  We affirm our continued work
    through the TTC Joint Roadmap on Trustworthy AI and Risk Management
    to further guide the development of tools, methodologies, and
    approaches to AI risk management and trustworthy AI.  We confirm our
    joint intention to endorse a code of conduct for organizations
    developing advanced AI systems as part of the G7 Hiroshima process
    in the near term.  We confirm our commitment to use AI for Public
    Good, particularly in the areas of agriculture, extreme weather
    prediction, emergency management and response, electric grid
    optimization, and health and medical research.  As new and more
    advanced AI systems emerge, we plan to build on work done to promote
    responsible AI and work with industry, civil society, academia, and
    other stakeholders to enable trustworthy development and uptake of
    those technologies, and to advance our shared vision of responsible
    innovation in line with our shared democratic values.  We recognize
    the importance of expanding research collaboration between the
    European Union and the United States for critical and emerging
    technologies such as AI, quantum, renewable energy, and other key
    areas, including by enabling transatlantic research funding
    activities that allow for both U.S. and EU researcher leadership
    while considering reciprocity in access to respective U.S. and EU
    research programs and ensuring symmetry in managing intellectual
    property.  We commit to working together to finalize an agreement on
    quantum-related items for the upcoming TTC meetings.  
     
28. We aim to build a more secure cyberspace together. We endeavor to
    cooperate to promote high cybersecurity standards to protect
    consumers and business and decrease vulnerability to cyberattacks.
    To that end, we commit to work together on achieving mutual
    recognition for our government-backed cybersecurity labeling
    programs and regulations for Internet-of-things devices aiming at a
    Joint CyberSafe Products Action Plan.  We will work for consumers in
    Europe and the United States to have an easy and reliable way to
    assess whether devices they bring into their homes, offices, and
    schools are secure.  
      
    **Promoting Rules-Based Trade and Countering Unfair Competition**  
     
29. The United States and the European Union have a shared interest in
    reforming the WTO so that Members can better achieve the WTO’s
    foundational objectives and address modern-day imperatives.  We will
    work towards substantial WTO reform by MC13 in 2024 including by
    conducting discussions with the view to having a fully and
    well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all WTO
    Members by 2024.   
     
30. On 31 October 2021, we announced that we would negotiate within two
    years an arrangement—known as the Global Arrangement on Sustainable
    Steel and Aluminum (Global Arrangement)—to address non-market excess
    capacity and emissions intensity of the steel and aluminum
    industries, including to foster undistorted transatlantic trade. 
    Throughout these two years, we have made substantial progress to
    identify the sources of non-market excess capacity.  We have also
    achieved a better understanding of the tools to address the
    emissions intensity of the steel and aluminum industries.  We look
    forward to continuing to make progress on these important objectives
    in the next two months.  
      
    **Strengthening Economic Resilience and Economic Security**  
     
31. The United States and the European Union are continuing to cooperate
    to enhance the resilience of our economies and advance our economic
    security interests, underpinned by a rules-based system, while
    preserving an open economy and a global level playing field.  We
    will de-risk and diversify where we assess there are risks through
    proportionate, precise and targeted measures to address economic
    security challenges.  We will continue working together to reduce
    excessive dependencies in critical supply chains, in close
    cooperation with partner countries.  We share concerns about the
    challenges posed by, among other issues, economic coercion, the
    weaponization of economic dependencies, and non-market policies and
    practices.  We will continue this work through inter alia the TTC,
    and with the G7 and other partners to diversify our supply chains
    and increase our collective preparedness, assessment, deterrence,
    and response to economic coercion.  
     
32. We have a shared interest in protecting those advanced technologies
    that could be used to undermine global peace and security, and are
    developing our respective economic security toolkits to ensure our
    companies’ capital, expertise, and innovations will not be used to
    do so.  Recognizing that outbound investment measures are necessary
    to complement its existing economic security toolkit, the President
    of the United States has issued an Executive Order to address risks
    from outbound investment and is consulting stakeholders on the U.S.
    rules.  The European Union and its Member States are similarly
    exploring, based on a risk assessment, whether outbound investment
    measures could complement its existing toolkit.  Export control
    regimes are central to maintain international security and
    stability, and necessitate cooperation between actors—including in
    multilateral fora—to ensure our dual-use technology protection
    ecosystem is continuously improved upon and cannot be exploited.  We
    will cooperate and share lessons as we work to maximize the
    effectiveness of our economic security toolkit to achieve our shared
    interest.  
     
33. Foreign information manipulation and interference is a borderless
    threat that poses a risk to democratic values, processes, and
    stability.  We will expand collaboration based on common principles,
    such as dedicated strategies, internal organizational structures,
    capacity, civil society and multilateral engagement.  This
    cooperation should aim to support like-minded partners in countering
    foreign information manipulation and interference, including via
    U.S. and EU coordinated activities, while safeguarding freedom of
    expression together with partner countries.  
      
    **Expanding People-to-People Contacts**  
     
34. To preserve the strength and longevity of our transatlantic
    relationship, the United States and the European Union also
    endeavour to increase vital people-to-people exchanges.  We will
    work to achieve visa-free travel between all EU Member States and
    the United States.  Together, the United States and the European
    Union intend to provide additional resources to increase the number
    of transatlantic academic exchanges.  The European Union will
    increase its funding to the Erasmus+ programme, and will double EU
    support to the Fulbright-Schuman programme, and across all Fulbright
    Commissions in EU Member States. The United States plans to increase
    its funding to all Fulbright Commissions in EU Member States,
    including the Fulbright-Schuman programme. This collective support
    will significantly increase the number of transatlantic academic
    exchanges between our citizens over the next five years*.*
