title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Marking 5 Years Since the Tree of Life\
  \ Synagogue Attack in\_Pittsburgh"
---
 
Today marks five years since the deadly shooting at the Tree of Life
Synagogue in Pittsburgh – the deadliest act of Antisemitism in our
nation’s history. A gunman opened fire on Sabbath worshippers as they
prayed, murdering 11 precious souls, wounding many more – including
first responders. The hearts of Jewish communities were shattered,
leaving behind survivors and families who will never be the same.  
   
Deepening the wound, today’s remembrance comes on the heels of the
deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. On October
7<sup>th</sup>, a sacred Jewish holiday, the terrorist group Hamas
unleashed pure evil against the people of Israel, slaughtering 1,400
Jews and taking hostage hundreds more. This devastating atrocity has
brought to the surface painful memories left by millennia of
Antisemitism and the genocide of the Jewish people. The fear is
amplified by the alarming rise of Antisemitism abroad and at home.  
   
Under my presidency, we will continue to condemn Antisemitism at every
turn. We are increasing security around centers of Jewish life across
the country. The Justice Department has made combating hate crimes a top
priority. We passed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30
years. And we are implementing the first-ever national strategy to
counter Antisemitism. Because hate never goes away, it only hides until
it is given just a little oxygen. And as a nation, we must ensure hate
is never given any oxygen.  
    
During these difficult times, we must never lose hope or give up on a
better tomorrow. We must recommit to speaking out against bigotry and
hate in all its forms, whether it is racism, Antisemitism, or
Islamophobia. And we must come together as fellow Americans to heal the
soul of our nation.
