President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke with President William Ruto of
Kenya today to thank him for answering Haiti’s call to serve as the lead

welcomed the successful vote at the United Nations Security Council
yesterday authorizing the MSS to bring relief to the people of Haiti,
who have suffered for far too long at the hands of violent criminals.  
  
President Biden also congratulated President Ruto for hosting the
recently concluded Africa Climate Summit and expressed appreciation for
the U.S.-Kenya strategic partnership, which is founded on a pursuit of
shared solutions to global challenges.  Together, they discussed
additional opportunities to promote regional security and mutual
prosperity by spurring new investments, jobs, and sustainable growth.
