  \ to Spur American Innovation, Strengthen Manufacturing, and Create Good-Paying\
  \ Jobs in Every Region of the\_Country"

*Bidenomics and the President’s Investing in America Agenda are
Positioning Regions Across the Country to Lead the Industries of the
Future*

Today, President Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo will
announce the designation of 31 communities across the country as
Regional Innovation and Technology Hubs (Tech Hubs) through the
Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration. These Tech
Hubs will catalyze investment in technologies critical to economic
growth, national security, and job creation, and will help communities
across the country become centers of innovation critical to American
competitiveness. The Tech Hubs program was authorized by the CHIPS and
Science Act – signed by President Biden in August 2022 – and is part of
the President’s Bidenomics agenda to grow the economy from the middle
out and bottom up.

The 31 Tech Hubs focus on developing and growing innovative industries
in regions across the country, including semiconductors, clean energy,
critical minerals, biotechnology, precision medicine, artificial
intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Tech Hubs bring together
private industry, state and local governments, institutions of higher
education, labor unions, Tribal communities and nonprofit organizations
to compete for up to $75 million implementation grants to further
develop these fields and make transformative investments in innovation,
supply chain resilience, and job creation.

President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has used strategic public
investments to crowd-in private sector funding in key areas driving
American competitiveness. Since President Biden took office, private
companies have announced more than a half a trillion dollars in clean
energy and manufacturing investments, including $230 billion in
semiconductor manufacturing, nearly $140 billion in electric vehicle and
battery manufacturing, and $20 billion in biomanufacturing, all of which
are represented by the Tech Hubs announced today. These investments will
further position U.S. businesses and workers to outcompete the world in
the economy of tomorrow and strengthen our national and economic
security.

For too long, economic growth and opportunity has clustered in a few
cities on the coasts. Tech Hubs awardees were selected to represent the
full diversity of America, selected from more than 370 applications
spanning 49 states and four territories. The Tech Hubs will bring the
benefits and opportunities of scientific and technological innovation to
communities across the country, with nearly three-quarters significantly
benefitting small and rural areas and more than three-quarters directly
supporting historically underserved communities. The Tech Hubs all
include workforce organizations such as labor unions, helping create
good-paying, union jobs in the communities where workers live. And, in
addition to the 31 Tech Hubs, the Department of Commerce is awarding 18
coalitions Strategy Development Grants to build economic development
plans to compete for future rounds of the Tech Hub program.
