title: "President\_Biden Announces an Additional $9 Billion in Student Debt Relief\
  \ for 125,000\_Americans"
---
 
President Biden has long believed that college should be a ticket to the
middle class, not a burden that weighs on families. That’s why from day
one, his Administration has taken unprecedented steps to fix the broken
student loan system, make college more affordable, and bring the promise
of higher education in reach for more Americans.

Marking a key step forward in that effort, President Biden is announcing
that an additional 125,000 Americans have been approved for $9 billion
in debt relief through fixes his Administration has made to
income-driven repayment (IDR) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and
by cancelling debt for borrowers with total and permanent disabilities.
**Today’s announcement brings the total approved debt cancellation by
the Biden-Harris Administration to $127 billion for nearly 3.6 million
Americans.**

The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing it has approved:

-   **$5.2 billion** in additional debt relief for **53,000 borrowers**
    under Public Service Loan Forgiveness programs.  
-   Nearly **$2.8 billion** in new debt relief for nearly **51,000
    borrowers** through fixes to income-driven repayment. These are
    borrowers who made 20 years or more of payments but never got the
    relief they were entitled to.  
-   **$1.2 billion** for nearly **22,000 borrowers** who have a total or
    permanent disability who have been identified and approved for
    discharge through a data match with the Social Security
    Administration.

The Department of Education is also releasing state-by-state totals of
debt relief approved under the Biden-Harris Administration through fixes
to IDR and Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Visit [this

to see the state-by-state breakdown.

Today’s announcement builds on all that the Biden-Harris Administration
has done to make college more affordable and ensure that student loans
aren’t a barrier to opportunity for students and families. The
Biden-Harris Administration earlier this year launched the most
affordable student loan repayment plan –
[SAVE](http://www.studentaid.gov/SAVE) – which makes many borrowers’
monthly payments as low as $0 and prevents balances from growing because
of unpaid interest. The Administration secured the largest increase to
Pell Grants in a decade, and finalized new rules to protect borrowers
from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or
insufficient earnings. And, in the wake of the Supreme Court decision on
the Administration’s original student debt relief plan, President Biden
announced his Administration was pursuing an alternative path to debt
relief through negotiated rulemaking under the Higher Education Act.

The Administration took an important step forward in the negotiated
rulemaking process last week as the Department of Education announced
individuals who will serve on the negotiating committee and
[released](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-moves-forward-student-debt-relief-negotiated-rulemaking-deliver-support-many-borrowers-possible-quickly-possible)
an issue paper to guide the first negotiating session. The paper asks
the committee to consider how the Administration can help borrowers,
including borrowers whose balances are greater than what they originally
borrowed, those who would be eligible for relief under existing
repayment plans but have not applied, and borrowers who have experienced
financial hardship on their loans that the current loan system doesn’t
address.

To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved $127 billion in
debt cancellation for nearly 3.6 million borrowers, including:

-   Nearly $42 billion for almost 855,000 borrowers who are eligible for
    forgiveness through income-driven repayment by fixing historical
    inaccuracies in the count of payments that qualify toward
    forgiveness;  
-   Almost $51 billion for 715,000 public servants through Public
    Service Loan Forgiveness programs;  
-   $11.7 billion for almost 513,000 borrowers with a total and
    permanent disability; and  
-   $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated
    by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are
    covered by related court settlements.
