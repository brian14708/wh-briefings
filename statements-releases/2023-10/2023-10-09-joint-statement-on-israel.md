title: "Joint Statement on\_Israel"

*Today, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and
the United States of America released the following joint statement
following their call:* 

Today, we — President Macron of France, Chancellor Scholz of Germany,
Prime Minister Meloni of Italy, Prime Minister Sunak of the United
Kingdom, and President Biden of the United States — express our
steadfast and united support to the State of Israel, and our unequivocal
condemnation of Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism.  
   
We make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justification,
no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned. There is never any
justification for terrorism.  In recent days, the world has watched in
horror as Hamas terrorists massacred families in their homes,
slaughtered over 200 young people enjoying a music festival, and
kidnapped elderly women, children, and entire families, who are now
being held as hostages.  
   
Our countries will support Israel in its efforts to defend itself and
its people against such atrocities. We further emphasize that this is
not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to
seek advantage.  
   
All of us recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian
people, and support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis
and Palestinians alike. But make no mistake: Hamas does not represent
those aspirations, and it offers nothing for the Palestinian people
other than more terror and bloodshed.  
   
Over the coming days, we will remain united and coordinated, together as
allies, and as common friends of Israel, to ensure Israel is able to
defend itself, and to ultimately set the conditions for a peaceful and
integrated Middle East region.
