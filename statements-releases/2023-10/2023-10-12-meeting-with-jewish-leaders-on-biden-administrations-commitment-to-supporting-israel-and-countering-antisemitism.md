---
 
On Wednesday evening, President Biden spoke with leaders from the
American Jewish community at the White House to pledge his full and
continued support for the Government and people of Israel. In his
remarks, the President reiterated his deep sympathy for all those
missing, wounded, and killed in the unprecedented and appalling assault
by Hamas terrorists. President Biden emphasized that there is no
justification whatsoever for terrorism and that America cannot be silent
in the face of these unconscionable attacks. He reiterated the
Biden-Harris Administration’s unwavering commitment to supporting Israel
and its right to defend itself. The President reiterated his strong
commitment to pursuing every avenue to bring American hostages currently
held by Hamas terrorists home to their families.  
  
Following the President’s remarks, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff,
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Homeland Security Advisor Dr.
Liz Sherwood-Randall, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, and Director
of the Office of Public Engagement Stephen Benjamin held a roundtable
discussion with the Jewish community leaders. The participants discussed
the barbaric Hamas attack on Israel, the President’s multidimensional
commitment to support Israel’s security in the wake of the attack, and
the Administration’s enduring responsibility to protect Jewish
communities from antisemitic incidents in the U.S.  
  
The group addressed a number of topics, including the Administration’s
focus on ensuring that antisemitic incidents in the U.S. are identified,
condemned and, as appropriate, investigated. In addition, they discussed
the importance of vigilance against a rise in antisemitic
actions. Participants also discussed the importance of solidarity with
the Jewish community as it feels intense grief in the aftermath of the
horrific events in Israel.    
  
The roundtable also discussed a meeting held on Tuesday following the
terrorist attack on Israel with representatives of departments and
agencies across government who were involved in the development of the
President’s National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. The group, which
includes representatives of more than two dozen federal agencies, met to
share information and resources, detail outreach strategies, and discuss
ongoing efforts to prevent antisemitism and other forms of hate in the
United States in response to this weekend’s horrific events.
