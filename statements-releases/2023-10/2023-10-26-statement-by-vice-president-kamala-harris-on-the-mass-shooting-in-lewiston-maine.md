title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Mass Shooting in Lewiston,\_\
  Maine"
---
 
Yesterday, Lewiston, Maine became yet another community torn apart by
senseless gun violence. This time a bowling alley and a restaurant have
been turned into scenes of unimaginable carnage.

Doug and I join the President and Dr. Biden in mourning those who were
killed, praying for the many who were injured, and grieving for so many
more whose lives are forever changed.

The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to provide full support to
local authorities in Maine. I join President Biden in urging area
residents to follow the warnings and guidance of local officials as the
investigation proceeds.

Let us also continue to speak truth about the moment we are in. Gun
violence is the leading cause of death for children in our nation. It
does not have to be this way.

It is a false choice to suggest we must choose between either upholding
the Second Amendment or passing reasonable gun safety laws to save
lives. Congress can and must make background checks universal. Pass red
flag laws. Ban high-capacity magazines. And renew the assault weapons
ban.

In the meantime, President Biden and I are not waiting around. Through
the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, we will continue to
work to save lives.

We do not have a moment to spare, nor a life to spare.
