title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Delivery of Humanitarian Aid to\_\
  Gaza"
---
 
Today, the first convoy of humanitarian assistance since Hamas’s October
7 terrorist attack on Israel crossed the border into Gaza and reached
Palestinians in need.  The opening of this essential supply route was
the result of days of diplomatic engagement at the highest levels. I
made it clear from the outset of this crisis–in both my public
statements and private conversations–that humanitarian assistance was a
critical and urgent need that had to get moving, and I express my deep
personal appreciation for the leadership of President Al-Sisi of Egypt,
Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, and the United Nations to allow the
resumption of this assistance.  
   
The United States remains committed to ensuring that civilians in Gaza
will continue to have access to food, water, medical care, and other
assistance, without diversion by Hamas. We will continue to work with
all parties to keep the Rafah crossing in operation to enable the
continued movement of aid that is imperative to the welfare of the
people of Gaza, and to continue working to protect civilians, consistent
with obligations under international humanitarian law.  
   
We also continue to work around the clock, in partnership with Egypt and
Israel, to facilitate the ability of U.S. citizens and their immediate
family members to exit Gaza safely and travel via Egypt to their final
destinations.
