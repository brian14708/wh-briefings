Doug and I grieve with the family of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a six-year-old
Palestinian-American Muslim child who was stabbed to death on Saturday.
We also pray for the recovery of Wadea’s mother, Hanaan Shahin, who was
stabbed 12 times in the same attack. The Department of Justice has
announced a hate crimes investigation.  
  
Hate has no place in America. We unequivocally condemn hate and
Islamophobia and stand with the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim American
communities. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue working to
protect our communities against hate and senseless violence.
