title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Long-Term Care Leadership, Partners and\_\
  Experts"
---
 
On Wednesday, Biden-Harris Administration officials convened leadership
and experts from national associations and organizations charged with
protecting older adults and providing safe, high-quality care for our
nation’s long-term care facility residents.  
  
Administration officials underscored that this is the first fall and
winter season where vaccines are available for all three viruses – flu,
RSV, and COVID-19 – responsible for most hospitalizations and other
severe outcomes, and that vaccination remains our best protection
against these viruses.  
  
The dialogue focused on efforts to partner to increase vaccination
uptake in long-term care settings during the fall and winter respiratory
virus season, particularly given the shift of COVID-19 vaccines to the
commercial market.  
  
In the meeting, participants discussed operational challenges they are
facing, including workforce shortages and opportunities to improve
communication about access to Federal resources. They also highlighted
successes and challenges during the initial phase of the transition of
COVID-19 vaccines to the commercial market. Participants shared best
practices and challenges from past and current efforts from increasing
access to vaccines, to ensuring residents and staff have access to
tests, to building trust in vaccines, to tackling challenges of
administering the vaccine, to more education about the reimbursement
process, and more standardized education and training for front line
staff.  
  
Senior White House Administration and Agency Officials thanked the
leaders for their efforts to save lives and underscored our shared
commitment to leveraging best practices and solving problems now and in
the future as we continue our collective efforts to inform and protect
older adults and other vulnerable Americans. Administration officials
committed to an ongoing discussion with participants to track progress
and address new concerns as they arise.
