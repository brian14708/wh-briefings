title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Hate Crime\_Statistics"
---
 
Today, the FBI released their annual statistics on hate crimes.
Antisemitic hate crimes rose 25 percent from 2021 to 2022, and
Antisemitism accounted for over half of all reported religion-based hate
crimes. Anti-LGBTQI+ hate crimes rose 16 percent, and Muslim Americans
and African Americans continue to be overrepresented among victims.  
  
The data is a reminder that hate never goes away, it only hides. Any
hate crime is a stain on the soul of America.  
  
To those Americans worried about violence at home, as a result of the
evil acts of terror perpetrated by Hamas in Israel, we see you. We hear
you. And I have asked members of my team, including Homeland Security
Secretary Mayorkas and Attorney General Garland, to prioritize the
prevention and disruption of any emerging threats that could harm
Jewish, Muslim, Arab American, or any other communities during this
time. My Administration will continue to fight Antisemitism and
Islamophobia.    
  
Last year’s data also shows that overall hate crime levels remained
steady, and hate crimes targeting Asian Americans fell by 38 percent
after I signed legislation to combat anti-Asian hate. But there’s more
to do when it comes to ending hate-fueled violence. That means coming
together and speaking out against hate and bigotry in all its forms. All
Americans deserve to live their lives with dignity, respect, and safety.
