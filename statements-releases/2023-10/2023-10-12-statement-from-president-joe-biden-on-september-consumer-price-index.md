title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on September Consumer Price\_Index"
---
 
This morning’s report shows core inflation fell to its lowest level in
two years. Overall inflation is down by 60% from its peak at a time when
unemployment has remained below 4% for 20 months in a row and the share
of working-age Americans in the workforce is the highest in 20 years.
That’s Bidenomics in action. I’ll continue to fight to build an economy
from the middle out and bottom up—even as Republicans in Congress make
reckless threats to weaken our economy, prioritize tax cuts for the
wealthy and large corporations, and push for deep cuts to programs that
are essential for hardworking Americans and seniors.
