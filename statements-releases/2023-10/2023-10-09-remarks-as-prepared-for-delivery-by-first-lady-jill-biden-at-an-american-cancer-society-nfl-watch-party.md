  \ Cancer Society NFL Crucial Catch Watch\_Party"

Green Bay, WI

\*\*\*  
Thank you, Elisabeth. Green Bay and Wisconsin are better for your
work.  
   
Mayor, Chairman, Executive — thank you for welcoming me today.  
  
I also want to thank Secretary Deb Haaland for joining me here tonight.
Tomorrow, we are visiting the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. Deb,
thank you for your leadership.  
   
Hello, everyone! It’s great to be in Green Bay with all of you this
evening!  
  
Every October, the NFL shines a light on the importance of the cancer
prevention and early detection through its Crucial Catch initiative.   
   
Teams, from coaches to players to broadcasters, come together to help
Americans get the information they need to get screened for cancer.   
   
And right here in Green Bay, with the support of Crucial Catch, health
clinics are connecting more people to screening and helping more
patients navigate their cancer care. Brendon, thank you for leading this
important work.  
   
I’m glad to join the NFL in its Crucial Catch effort once again, and
look forward to doing so in years to come.   
   
Because, while we may come from different places, and cheer for
different teams—I was cheering on my Eagles last night—cancer touches us
all.   
   
That’s true for my family, and I know, for far too many of yours as
well.  
   
That’s why the President and I reignited the Biden Cancer Moonshot—our
White House initiative to build a world where cancer is not a death
sentence.  
   
Where we invest in innovative research and help patients and their
families navigate this journey.  
   
Where we stop cancer before it starts and make treatments more
affordable if it does.  
   
Where we catch it early and help people live longer, healthier, happier
lives.  
   
Of all the things cancer steals from us, time is the cruelest.  
  
The days spent in treatment or recovering from surgery. Anniversaries
and holidays missed. Pages of photo albums unfilled.  
   
We can’t afford to wait another minute for better solutions, better
treatments, better cures.  
   
That’s the reason we’re all here.  
   
And we all know that one of the best ways to fight cancer is to catch it
early.  
  
I know you’re so busy taking care of everyone else in your life. But I’m
asking you to put your health first.  
   
Take a moment to talk to your doctor about whether it’s time for your
mammogram or other cancer screenings. Because this is too important to
put off.  
   
Make an appointment, and encourage your loved ones to do the same. You
could save someone’s life—maybe even your own.  
  
Together, we can intercept cancer.   
   
Thank you.
