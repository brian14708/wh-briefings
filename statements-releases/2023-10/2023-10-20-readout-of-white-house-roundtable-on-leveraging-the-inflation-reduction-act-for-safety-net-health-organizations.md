title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable on Leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act\
  \ for Safety-Net Health Organizations"

Today, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and
Implementation John Podesta, Assistant to the President and Director of
the Domestic Policy Council Neera Tanden, Assistant Secretary for Health
Admiral Rachel Levine, and other Biden-Harris Administration officials
met with health care providers, professional societies and associations,
philanthropies, and financial institutions to discuss how health care
organizations can best take advantage of the opportunities in the
Inflation Reduction Act.

Administration officials noted that since safety-net health
organizations serve the populations on the frontlines of climate
change-related health threats, they must be able to support patients
affected by storms and heat waves and adapt to the changing needs of
their communities. Officials emphasized that supporting these
organizations is central to the Administration’s ongoing work to advance
health equity, increase access to affordable, quality health care, and
protect the health and well-being of every American. In a context where
safety-net health providers often face resource constraints and are
recovering from the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy
efficiency and renewable energy investments made possible by the
Inflation Reduction Act can decrease operating costs and free up
resources for essential patient services as well as make them more
resilient. The Charge Partnership, Valley Children’s Hospital, and the
National Academy of Medicine all presented on their efforts to make the
sector more resilient.

At the event, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
announced that its Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE)
will be leading a catalytic program in early 2024 to help safety-net
health care organizations take advantage of the transformative tax
credits and grant programs created by the Inflation Reduction Act. The
program will also involve safety-net provider member associations like
America’s Essential Hospitals, National Rural Health Association, and
the National Association of Community Health Centers. The three-month
program will feature national webinars as well as breakout sessions for
hospitals, health centers, and other provider types to help
organizations assess their needs and assets, learn about Inflation
Reduction Act tax credits and grant programs, and successfully utilize
these opportunities. Interested individuals and organizations can
receive information about the program by visiting [OCCHE’s

Many participants in today’s convening made new announcements,
including:

-   Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, **the CHARGE Partnership**
    set a goal of facilitating or building clean resilient microgrids on
    1,000 Community Health Centers across the US in the next 10 years.
    Approximately 70% of them, or 700 locations, will be in Justice40
    and/or low-income communities. These projects will offset at least
    75,000 tons of carbon per year, benefit almost two million patients,
    and save these health centers over $150 million dollars on project
    costs.
-   **The Commonwealth Fund** announced the release of important new
    resources to help healthcare organizations to both understand
    potential savings associated with investments in sustainability and
    take advantage of the IRA by offering technical assistance on
    project scoping and application development.
-   **Macquarie Capital** committed to support up to $300 million in
    renewable energy project developments for hospitals and hospital
    systems.
-   **Invest in Our Future** highlighted that its $180 million pooled
    fund is committed to strengthen communities across the country,
    reduce greenhouse gases and transform our economy including
    prioritizing grants supporting communities applying for federal
    funds by funding technical assistance providers and capacity
    building.
-   **Advocate Health** announced its plan to make the new Wake Forest
    University School of Medicine in Charlotte, North Carolina net zero
    – building what they hope will be the first medical school and
    medical research campus to meet LEED zero-carbon specifications.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to partnering with
safety-net health care organizations and the broader health sector as
they leverage the Inflation Reduction Act to protect the health and
well-being of their communities through resilience, protect the
environment through sustainability, and save on energy bills through
energy efficiency.
