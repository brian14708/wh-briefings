National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Special Presidential Advisor
Christopher Dodd, Deputy National Security Advisor to the Vice President
Dr. Rebecca Lissner, and National Security Council Senior Director for
the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez met today at the White House with
Guatemalan President-elect Bernardo Arévalo.  
  
National Security Advisor Sullivan and Special Presidential Advisor Dodd
expressed the U.S. Government’s support for President-elect Arévalo
following last week’s undemocratic efforts to undermine the will of the
Guatemalan people, intimidate election authorities, and prevent the
peaceful transition of power.  
  
During the meeting, participants discussed shared priorities, including
President-elect Arévalo’s vision for a more prosperous, democratic, and
secure Guatemala, and the work of the U.S. Government under the Root
Causes Strategy to tackle the drivers of migration in Central America,
by promoting economic development, combating corruption, strengthening
democratic governance, promoting respect for human rights and labor
rights, preventingviolence and countering organized crime, and combating
sexual and gender-based violence.  Participants also discussed the
importance of private sector investment in creating inclusive economic
growth, such as the Central America Forward initiative led by Vice
President Kamala Harris, and emphasized the impact of the Los Angeles
Declaration on Migration and Protection in creating the conditions for
safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.    
  
National Security Advisor Sullivan conveyed the U.S. government’s
commitment to continue to work with international partners to support
the smooth transition of power in Guatemala, and to use all available
tools to hold accountable those who undermine democracy in Guatemala.
