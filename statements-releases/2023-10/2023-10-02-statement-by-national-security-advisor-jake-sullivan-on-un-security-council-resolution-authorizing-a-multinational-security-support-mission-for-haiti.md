title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on UN Security Council\
  \ Resolution Authorizing a Multinational Security Support Mission for\_Haiti"
---
 
Today’s decision at the United Nations Security Council to authorize a
Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission for Haiti marks an
important milestone in bringing much-needed help to the people of Haiti
who have suffered for far too long at the hands of violent criminals. We
thank our partners at the council for moving swiftly to approve this
decision, which formally endorses the mission and lays the framework for
how the international community can best support Haiti at this critical
time.   
   
The global community owes a debt of gratitude to Kenya for answering
Haiti’s call to serve as the lead nation of the mission, and likewise to
the other nations that have pledged to join this mission alongside
Kenya, including Jamaica, The Bahamas, and Antigua and Barbuda. We thank
these nations for their leadership and willingness to bring relief to
Haiti.  
   
We have taken an important step today, but our work to support the
people of Haiti is not done. It is now crucial that we focus on making
progress in mobilizing the international support necessary to deploy
this mission swiftly, effectively, and safely. The people of Haiti
deserve to feel safe enough to leave their homes, restore their
livelihoods, and go to the polls to democratically elect a government
that represents their interests.
