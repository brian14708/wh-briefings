President Joe Biden looks forward to welcoming President Frank-Walter
Steinmeier to the White House on Friday, October 6, 2023 to commemorate
German-American Day.  As the presidents mark this occasion, they will
reaffirm the strong ties between the United States and Germany,
including our close coordination as NATO Allies on a range of important
issues such as defending democratic values and our shared commitment to
support Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia’s invasion.
