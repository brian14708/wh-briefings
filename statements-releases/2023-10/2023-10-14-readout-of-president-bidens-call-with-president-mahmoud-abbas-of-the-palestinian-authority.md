This afternoon, President Biden spoke with Palestinian Authority
President Abbas. President Biden condemned Hamas’ brutal attack on
Israel and reiterated that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian
people’s right to dignity and self-determination. President Abbas
briefed President Biden on his engagement in the region and his efforts
to bring urgently needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian people,
particularly in Gaza. President Biden offered President Abbas and the
Palestinian Authority his full support for these important and ongoing
efforts. 

President Biden discussed with President Abbas U.S. efforts to work with
the United Nations, Egypt, Jordan, Israel and others to ensure
humanitarian supplies reach civilians in Gaza.

Finally, President Biden detailed U.S. efforts to coordinate with
partners to prevent the conflict from widening, and the two leaders
discussed the need to preserve stability in the West Bank and the
broader region.
