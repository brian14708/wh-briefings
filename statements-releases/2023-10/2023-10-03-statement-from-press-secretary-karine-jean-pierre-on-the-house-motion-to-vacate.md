title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the House Motion to\_\
  Vacate"

President Biden has demonstrated that he is always eager to work with
both parties in Congress in good faith on behalf of the American people.
Because the urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait, he hopes
the House will quickly elect a Speaker. The American people deserve
leadership that puts the issues affecting their lives front and center,
as President Biden did today with more historic action to lower
prescription drug prices. Once the House has met their responsibility to
elect a Speaker, he looks forward to working together with them and with
the Senate to address the American peoples’ priorities.
