title: "President\_Biden Honors Leading American Scientists, Technologists, and\_\
  Innovators"
---
 
Today, President Biden is awarding the National Medal of Science and the
National Medal of Technology and Innovation to a number of Americans who
have made exemplary achievements in science, technology, and innovation
to strengthen our nation’s well-being.  
   
The National Medal of Science is the nation’s highest scientific honor.
Established by Congress in 1959 and administered by the U.S. National
Science Foundation, it is bestowed by the President of the United States
on individuals deserving of special recognition for their outstanding
contributions in biology, computer sciences, education sciences,
engineering, geosciences, mathematical and physical sciences, and
social, behavioral, and economic sciences, in service to the Nation.  
   
The National Medal of Technology and Innovation is the nation’s highest
award for technological achievement. It recognizes American innovators
whose vision, intellect, creativity, and determination have strengthened
America’s economy and improved our quality of life. Established by
Congress and administered by the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, the first Medal of Technology was presented in 1985.  
   
President Biden often says that America can be defined in a single word:
possibilities. Those who earn these awards embody the promise of America
by pushing the boundaries of what is possible. These trailblazers have
harnessed the power of science and technology to tackle challenging
problems and deliver innovative solutions for Americans, and for
communities around the world.  
   
These medalists have made discoveries that enable lifesaving medical
treatments, help fight the opioid epidemic, improve food security,
advance accessibility, protect our democracy, and much more. Their
accomplishments advance American leadership in science, technology, and
innovation, and their work inspires the next generation of American
minds.
