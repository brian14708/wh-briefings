President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Prime Minister Mohammed
Shia Al-Sudani of Iraq.  They discussed ongoing efforts to prevent an
expansion of the conflict in Gaza in the wake of Hamas’s abhorrent
attack in Israel. The two leaders discussed the importance of addressing
the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in coordination with the UN
and regional partners.  The President and the Prime Minister also
affirmed the importance of the bilateral partnership between Iraq and
the United States as outlined in the Strategic Framework Agreement
between our two countries.  They finally committed to regular
coordination between their teams to advance shared objectives and
preserve regional stability over the coming weeks.
