Jill and I were shocked and sickened to learn of the brutal murder of a
six-year-old child and the attempted murder of the child’s mother in
their home yesterday in Illinois.  
   
The child’s Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we
all seek—a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace.   
   
This horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against
our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we
believe, and who we are.    
   
As Americans, we must come together and reject Islamophobia and all
forms of bigotry and hatred.  I have said repeatedly that I will not be
silent in the face of hate.  We must be unequivocal. There is no place
in America for hate against anyone.  
   
We join everyone here at the White House in sending our condolences and
prayers to the family, including for the mother’s recovery, and to the
broader Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim American communities.
