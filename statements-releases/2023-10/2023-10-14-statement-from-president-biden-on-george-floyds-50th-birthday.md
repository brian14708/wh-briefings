George Floyd should be alive. He should be celebrating his 50th birthday
with his young daughter Gianna, family, and friends. He deserved so much
more.

Today, we join his family to honor his life and legacy. And we remember
the tragedy and injustice of his death that sparked one of the largest
civil rights movements in our nation’s history and inspired the world.

George Floyd’s murder exposed for many what Black and Brown communities
have long known and experienced — that our nation has never fully lived
up to its highest ideal of fair and impartial justice for all under the
law.

The day before her father’s funeral, Gianna told me, “Daddy changed the
world.” Three years after her father’s murder, my answer to Gianna
remains the same: he has.

A year and a half ago, Kamala and I stood with the family of George
Floyd, civil rights leaders, and law enforcement officials, and I signed
an executive order, which applies key elements of the George Floyd
Justice in Policing Act to federal law enforcement. This order bans
chokeholds, restricts no-knock warrants, establishes a database for
police misconduct, and directs other measures to advance effective and
accountable policing that increases public safety.  It is putting
federal law enforcement on the path to becoming the gold standard of
effectiveness and accountability.

My order also directs the use of federal tools to support similar
reforms in state and local agencies. Across our Administration, we have
made significant progress in fulfilling the requirements of my executive
order, making policing safer and rebuilding trust in American
communities.

But we know that implementing real and lasting change at the state and
local levels requires Congress to act. I will continue to do everything
in my power to fight for police accountability and urge Congress to pass
meaningful police reform and send it to my desk. I will sign it.

George Floyd’s memory reminds us that there is more work to do to redeem
the soul of America. Let us recommit to changing hearts and minds while
enacting policies and laws that ensure our nation lives up to its
founding idea: that we’re all created equal and deserve to be treated
equally throughout our lives.
