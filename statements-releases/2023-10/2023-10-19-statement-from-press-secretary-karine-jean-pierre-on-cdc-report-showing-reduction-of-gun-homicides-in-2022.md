title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on CDC Report Showing Reduction\
  \ of Gun Homicides in\_2022"
---
 
Today, the CDC released a new report showing that the firearm homicide
rate went down in 2022. This is meaningful progress for the American
people: gun homicides are declining for the first time since sharply
increasing from 2019 to 2020. It is also an encouraging sign that
President Biden’s historic actions to address our nation’s gun violence
epidemic are helping save lives. Yet, it’s not nearly enough at a time
when guns are the leading killer of kids and at epidemic levels.
President Biden continues to call on Congress to enact commonsense,
meaningful reforms including banning assault weapons and high capacity
magazines, and enacting universal background checks that save lives.  
   
Too many families have an empty seat at their dinner table and too many
communities have been torn apart because of gun violence. Though gun
violence impacts all communities, it does not do so equally. This report
makes clear that communities of color are especially at risk of facing
this senseless violence. Black Americans continue to be
disproportionately killed by gun homicides, with a rate more than four
times higher than that of the general population.  
   
President Biden has taken critical action to reduce gun violence in our
country, including by signing into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities
Act, the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years, and
taking more meaningful executive action than any other president. But he
has said that the progress we’ve made so far is not nearly enough.
That’s why, just last month, he established the first-ever White House
Office of Gun Violence Prevention to accelerate his work to reduce gun
crime and other forms of gun violence. Through this office, the
President will continue to reduce gun violence by implementing the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and already-announced executive actions
to reduce gun crime and other forms of gun violence, identifying new
executive actions, expanding the coalition of partners to advance more
state action, and improving support for communities and individuals
impacted by gun violence. Most recently, the Justice Department
announced $4.4 billion in funding to help communities reduce gun crime
and other forms of violent crime and make our communities safer.  
   
Our work is not done until every American is able to live free from the
threat of gun violence.
