title: "FACT SHEET: Release of the 2023 Women, Peace and Security Strategy and National\
  \ Action\_Plan"
---
 
Promoting women’s meaningful participation, leadership and engagement in
decision-making at all levels is both a moral and a strategic imperative
for U.S. foreign policy and national security.  Wherever the rights of
women and girls are under threat, so, too, is democracy, peace, and
stability.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is proud to release the [2023
Women, Peace, and Security Strategy (WPS) and National Action
Plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/U.S.-Strategy-and-National-Action-Plan-on-Women-Peace-and-Security.pdf). 
With this Strategy, we renew our commitment to United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1325, consistent with the Women, Peace, and Security
Act of 2017, which codified our decades-long, sustained commitment to
the principles of the WPS agenda.  This updated Strategy reflects
critical shifts in our global landscape—including geopolitical changes,
a rise in climate-related crises, and advancements in technology—and
maintains a strong focus on five core lines of effort:

**I. Participation** – Seek and support the preparation and meaningful
participation of women and girls in civic and political leadership, in
informal and formal decision-making processes, and in institutions
related to peace and security.  
**II. Protection** – Promote the protection of the human rights of women
and girls, and prevent and respond to all forms of gender-based violence
(GBV) across the continuum of peace, conflict, and crisis contexts,
including conflict-related sexual violence.  
**III. Relief, Response, and Recovery** – Prioritize gender-responsive
policies and programs to support the safety, participation, and
leadership of women and girls in U.S. government responses to conflict,
crises, and disasters, and provide safe, equitable access to
humanitarian assistance.  
**IV. Integration and Institutionalization** – Integrate WPS principles
across U.S. policies and programs to strengthen the institutionalization
of comprehensive gender analyses and improve gender equality outcomes.  
**V. Partnerships** – Encourage partners to mainstream WPS principles
across policies and strategies, and strengthen capacity to improve
gender equality in processes and institutions connected to peace and
security decision-making*. *

**The Biden-Harris Administration Commitment to Advancing Women, Peace
and Security**

The WPS agenda is a cornerstone of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
work to prevent conflict and promote the safety and security of women
and girls, bolstering the implementation of the [U.S. Strategy to
Prevent Conflict and Promote
Stability](https://www.state.gov/stability-strategy/), the [U.S.
Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent and Respond to
Atrocities](https://www.state.gov/atrocity-prevention/), and [the U.S
Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence
Globally](https://www.state.gov/reports/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gender-based-violence-globally-2022/). 
WPS is also a core priority in our [National Strategy on Gender Equity
and
Equality](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf),
which enshrines the advancement of gender equity and equality as a
strategic imperative across U.S. domestic and foreign policy.  Since the
start of the Biden-Harris Administration, the President and Vice
President have made historic advances in strengthening women’s
meaningful participation in national security, defense, and political
leadership—and with the 2023 Strategy, will continue to do so as a
national security priority. New and ongoing actions correspond with each
of the lines of effort guiding the 2023 Strategy, including:

**I. Advancing women’s meaningful participation in peace and security
decision-making, leadership and institutions. **To date, the
Biden-Harris Administration has:  

-   **Promoted women’s meaningful participation and protection in the
    U.S. military. **As Commander-in-Chief, President Biden has made it
    a top priority to eliminate obstacles to women’s military service
    through [unprecedented
    actions](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/12/fact-sheet-biden-administration-celebrates-the-75th-anniversary-of-womens-integration-in-to-the-armed-forces/) to
    promote their safety, inclusion, health and wellbeing, including by
    advancing [historic military justice
    reform](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-implementing-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms/) and
    expanding support for military survivors of gender-based violence as
    recommended by the [Independent Review
    Commission](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/02/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-results-of-the-independent-review-commission-on-military-sexual-assault/) on
    Sexual Assault in the Military. Under the Biden-Harris
    Administration, women commanders have risen to unprecedented ranks,
    including [Admiral Lisa
    Franchetti,](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-nomination-of-military-leaders) nominated
    to be the first woman to serve as the Chief of Naval Operations and
    on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and [Admiral Linda
    Fagan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/12/statement-from-president-biden-on-the-confirmation-of-admiral-linda-l-fagan-as-uscg-commandant/),
    Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, the Coast Guard’s first woman to
    hold the rank of four-star admiral and the first woman Service Chief
    of any U.S. military service.
-   **Supported women in law enforcement and homeland
    security. **Through the *Women in Law Enforcement Mentoring
    Program*, the Department of Homeland Security has facilitated
    mentorship and learning opportunities for women serving in federal
    law enforcement agencies, pairing those currently serving with
    retired and current senior level law enforcement executives who
    provide career advice and recommendations in order to improve 
    retention and advancement. The sixth cohort will deploy in January
    2024.
-   **Strengthened women’s meaningful participation in conflict
    prevention and resolution. **Through the *WPS Incentive Fund*, USAID
    invests in women’s leadership and empowerment to help break cycles
    of conflict and crisis, counter violent extremism, and build peace
    and stability. Since 2017, the *WPS Incentive Fund* has provided
    more than $70 million in economic support and development assistance
    in 17 countries. In Fiscal Year 2022, the program delivered $6.5
    million in Haiti, Burundi, Mauritania, Libya, and Armenia.
-   **Advanced women’s and girls’ civic and political leadership through
    the Summits for Democracy**.  Announced at the first Summit for
    Democracy hosted by President Biden in December 2021, the
    USAID-led *Advancing Women’s and Girls’ Civic and Political
    Leadership Initiative* dismantles barriers and builds the leadership
    pipeline to support women’s meaningful participation in political,
    peacebuilding and transition processes. USAID is providing more than
    $15 million to this initiative and is beginning program
    implementation in eight focus countries: Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria,
    Tanzania, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Kyrgyz Republic, and Yemen.
    At the [second Summit for
    Democracy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/28/the-status-of-women-is-the-status-of-democracy-advancing-womens-political-and-civic-participation-and-leadership-at-the-second-summit-for-democracy/),
    USAID also launched the *Transform Digital Spaces Initiative*, with
    investments of up to $6 million over three years, to prevent and
    address technology-facilitated gender-based violence, especially
    violence perpetrated against women in politics and public life.  The
    Department of State also announced investments in *SHE WINS (Support
    Her Empowerment: Women’s Inclusion for New Security),* a nearly $10
    million initiative that advances the leadership of local women and
    women-led civil society organizations to address peace and security
    challenges in their communities, with projects in Lebanon, Cameroon,
    the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
    Papua New Guinea, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.  
     

Alongside the release of the 2023 WPS Strategy, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing several actions to further strengthen
women’s participation in peace and security processes, including by:

-   **Ensuring women’s meaningful participation in Ukraine. **This fall,
    the Department of State’s Conflict and Stabilization Operations
    Bureau will launch a new program with $2 million in Ukraine
    supplemental funding to support priorities identified by the
    Government of Ukraine in their recently updated WPS National Action
    Plan. Recognizing women as vital actors in the war effort and at the
    center of future recovery, this initiative will amplify the
    contributions women have made in Ukraine’s national political
    leadership and local communities for years while addressing a gap in
    women’s meaningful participation in governance during wartime.
-   **Building the evidence-base on technology-facilitated gender-based
    violence.** Advancing the research objectives of the [Global
    Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and
    Abuse](https://www.state.gov/2023-roadmap-for-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/),
    this fall, USAID is contributing an additional $300,000 to the What
    Works Phase 2 Program with the Government of the UK’s Foreign,
    Commonwealth & Development Office to contribute to the Sexual
    Violence Research Initiative’s (SVRI) targeted call for proposals on
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV). This will
    support SVRI’s small grant funding pool for TFGBV research,
    including efforts to better understand the mental health impacts of
    online violence targeting women leaders, and women with
    disabilities, indigenous women, lesbian, bisexual, queer, and
    transgender women, among others. This research will improve
    understanding of actions needed to tackle TFGBV, which is a
    demonstrated tactic by state and non-state actors to silence,
    intimidate and discredit women political and public figures, thereby
    undermining their civic and political engagement and eroding
    democratic norms.  
     

**II. Promoting the protection of the human rights of women and girls,
and preventing and responding to all forms of GBV in conflict and
crisis**. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has:  

-   **Promoted accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. **In
    November 2022, President Biden signed the [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/28/presidential-memorandum-to-promote-accountability-for-conflict-related-sexual-violence/) on
    Promoting Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence,
    directing the U.S. government to use all existing tools to promote
    accountability for perpetrators of CRSV globally, including those
    pertaining to sanctions, visa eligibility, and security assistance.
    In June 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration
    imposed [sanctions](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/20/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-new-steps-against-perpetrators-of-sexual-violence-in-conflict/) targeting
    actors who perpetrate this abuse—marking the first time that a
    dedicated focus on conflict-related sexual violence in furtherance
    of the Presidential Memorandum has led to the imposition of U.S.
    sanctions. President Biden has further integrated a focus on
    accountability for conflict-related sexual violence and all acts of
    GBV through the [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/05/04/executive-order-on-imposing-sanctions-on-certain-persons-destabilizing-sudan-and-undermining-the-goal-of-a-democratic-transition/) on
    Imposing Sanctions on Certain Persons Destabilizing Sudan and
    Undermining the Goal of a Democratic Transition.  
     

Alongside the release of the 2023 WPS Strategy, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing several actions to further promote the
protection of women and girls in crisis and conflict, including by:

-   **Bolstering services for GBV and protection in Haiti.** In Fiscal
    Year 2023, USAID provided more than $12.8 million for protection
    activities in Haiti. These activities will continue though Fiscal
    Year 2024 and will support GBV prevention and response services for
    psychosocial support, case management, referrals to specialized
    services, health care, and community-based interventions, such as
    safe spaces for women and girls.
-   **Promoting stability by advancing efforts to end child marriage
    globally.** In addition to being a human rights abuse and practice
    that undermines sustainable development, child, early and forced
    marriage is associated with lower rates of economic productivity and
    national stability. On [International Day of the Girl
    2023](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/11/fact-sheet-white-house-celebrates-international-day-of-the-girl-and-announces-new-actions-to-support-youth-in-the-u-s-and-abroad/),
    the Biden-Harris Administration announced that for the first time,
    the United States will contribute to the United Nations Children’s
    Fund (UNICEF)–United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Global Program
    to End Child Marriage, which works in 12 countries in Africa and
    South Asia to promote the rights of adolescent girls by increasing
    access to education and reducing risk of early and forced marriage.

**III. Prioritizing women and girls in relief, response and
recovery.  **To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has:  

-   **Enhanced services and support for survivors of GBV in emergency
    and conflict settings. **In December 2022, the State Department and
    USAID revived and expanded *Safe from the Start ReVisioned*, a
    flagship program to provide lifesaving services and support to
    survivors of gender-based violence in emergency and conflict
    settings.  The initiative demonstrates the United States’ commitment
    to promoting women’s leadership, prioritizing support and advocacy
    for GBV prevention and response programming, and shifting funding,
    influence, and decision-making power to women and girls within
    humanitarian response systems. In Fiscal Year 2022, USAID dedicated
    $113 million to GBV programming through this initiative, supporting
    over 3.2 million people in 40 countries. In May 2023, the State
    Department awarded approximately $2 million in Ukraine supplemental
    funding to support survivors of conflict-related sexual violence and
    other forms of gender-based violence in Ukraine. This 30-month
    project advances survivor-centered approaches to justice and
    accountability by offering survivors and local GBV service providers
    a range of support services to help individuals and communities
    recover and thrive.

Alongside the release of the 2023 WPS Strategy, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing additional efforts to prioritize women and
girls throughout relief, response, and recovery efforts by:

-   **Investing in the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund.** In Fiscal
    Year 2023, USAID dedicated $10 million to the *Women’s Peace and
    Humanitarian Fund* in Ukraine, Haiti, and in support of addressing
    gender disparities in access to food assistance through the Global
    Food Security Response. Since 2014, the *Women’s Peace and
    Humanitarian Fund* has supported diverse local and grassroots
    leaders and their organizations (including women-led organizations,
    organizations of persons with disabilities and LGBTQI+-led
    organizations) in conflict and crisis settings worldwide.

**IV. Integrating WPS principles across U.S. policies and programs. **To
date, the Biden-Harris Administration has:  

-   **Institutionalized WPS expertise throughout the Department of
    Defense by investing in the Gender Advisory workforce. ** To guide
    the strategic integration of WPS across the Department of Defense
    (DoD), DoD is establishing a Gender Advisor workforce across the
    Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, Military
    Departments and Services and Combatant Commands to promote women’s
    meaningful participation in our own force and with partner nations.
-   **Incorporated WPS across Global Fragility Act implementation. **In
    selecting partner locations for implementation of the [Global
    Fragility Act and Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote
    Stability](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-submits-to-congress-10-year-plans-to-implement-the-u-s-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/) (GFA),
    the Biden-Harris Administration measured gender inequality as a key
    indicator of potential instability. Extensive stakeholder
    consultations were held with women leaders, women-led organizations,
    and women’s rights networks, to inform ten-year whole-of-government
    partner country and regional plans. From enhancing local
    gender-responsive early warning systems and community dialogue to
    strengthening human rights, GBV response, and economic empowerment
    for marginalized groups, GFA programming reflects an understanding
    that empowering women is critical to preventing conflict and
    building sustainable peace. 
-   **Linked WPS and climate security. **The Biden-Harris Administration
    is committed to addressing the gendered impacts of the climate
    crisis and elevating women as leaders in climate risk mitigation,
    adaptation and response. In September, the State Department released
    the [U.S. Strategy to Respond to the Effects of Climate Change on
    Women](https://www.state.gov/reports/united-states-strategy-to-respond-to-the-effects-of-climate-change-on-women-2023/),
    and since 2021, State and USAID have implemented an expanse of
    programs and initiatives to support women environmental defenders,
    promote gender-sensitive approaches to environmental justice, and
    elevate women’s participation in environmental policy development
    and decision-making. In the [President’s Emergency Plan for
    Adaptation and
    Resilience](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/PREPARE-Action-Plan.pdf),
    the U.S. government  creates adaptation programs with a focus on
    gender, inclusive development and conflict sensitivity
    considerations.

Alongside the release of the 2023 WPS Strategy, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing several actions to further institutionalize
WPS principles throughout our national security policies and processes,
including by:

-   **Embedding WPS in defense engagements. **DoD will take steps to
    further WPS in the Western Hemisphere through two Ministry of
    Defense-level efforts. Secretary Austin and Chilean Defense Minister
    Maya Fernandez committed to create a WPS Subcommittee to the Defense
    Consultative Committee. This Subcommittee, formally established in
    July 2023, will be the first dedicated working group on WPS for an
    OSD-led bilateral engagement and will enable a closer relationship
    with Chile through WPS. DoD will also host the fourth iteration of
    the Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas WPS Ad-Hoc
    Working Group in Spring 2024.
-   **Training U.S. government personnel on advancing women’s
    participation in peace processes through negotiation
    simulations***. *The State Department’s Negotiations Support Unit
    (NSU) within the Conflict and Stabilization Operations Bureau,
    advises and trains U.S. government personnel on effective strategies
    for peace and conflict negotiations. This month, the NSU is
    launching a negotiation simulation with the U.S. Institute of Peace
    on addressing resistance to women’s inclusion in negotiations and
    peace processes. The simulation will be used in training and
    capacity-building, and will be customized to implement with partner
    country diplomatic corps.

**V. Promoting partnerships to build capacity and elevate the WPS agenda
throughout our foreign policy and security cooperation and
assistance. **To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has:  

-   **Co-chaired the 2023 WPS-Focal Points Network.  **Throughout 2023,
    the United States co-chaired the UN Women WPS Focal Points Network
    (FPN) in partnership with Romania, coordinating a week-long Capital
    Level Conference in June 2023, which convened nearly 300
    representatives from among the 100 member states and regional
    organizations in the Network, states and organizations outside the
    Network, as well as civil society, legislative leaders, private
    sector and academia, to discuss the status of WPS and avenues for
    bridging the gap between policy and practice. Romania will host a
    follow-on Capital Level Conference in November 2023. The U.S.,
    Romania, and UN Women also convened a high-level Ministerial side
    event during the 78<sup>th</sup> UN General Assembly as part of the
    WPS-FPN, with over 20 countries. 
-   **Convened countries to combat online harassment and abuse against
    women leaders.** A commitment from the first Summit for Democracy
    and launched at the 66<sup>th</sup> United Nations Commission on the
    Status of Women, the Biden-Harris Administration co-founded
    the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment
    and Abuse, which currently has 14 participating governments, and
    brings together international organizations, civil society, and the
    private sector to prioritize, understand, prevent, and address the
    growing scourge of technology-facilitated gender-based
    violence, which disproportionately impacts women and
    LGBTQI+ [political and public
    figures](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-day-of-democracy-2023-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse-joint-statement),
    leaders[,
    journalists](https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-through-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse-on-world-press-freedom-day/) and
    activists.

Alongside the release of the 2023 WPS Strategy, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing recent action to further strengthen
partnerships that advance WPS by:

-   **Supporting regional WPS capacity building. **In September 2023,
    the State Department awarded approximately $500,000 for a project to
    provide technical assistance to WPS  Centers of Excellence,
    contributing to the development of standards for WPS Centers and
    expanding regional WPS expertise. The project will strengthen
    relationships and facilitate consultations between governments and
    civil society stakeholders to develop strategies, approaches and
    solutions to implementing WPS principles in practice. The project
    will also leverage networks of WPS experts and leaders to foster
    learning, deepen collaboration, and raise awareness of WPS issues
    through existing and future WPS Centers in Kosovo, Colombia, and
    Indonesia.
