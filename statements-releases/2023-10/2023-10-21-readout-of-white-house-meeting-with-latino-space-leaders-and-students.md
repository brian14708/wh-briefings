title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Latino Space Leaders and\_Students"
---
 
On Wednesday, in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, the White House
Office of Public Engagement and the National Space Council convened over
100 Latino science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
students and leaders from the space sector to discuss the Biden-Harris
Administration’s ongoing efforts to inspire, prepare, and employ the
current and future space workforce while ensuring opportunities reach
the Latino community.

Administration officials were joined by Latino leaders, such as Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Anna Gomez, the first
Latina-American to be confirmed to the FCC in over two decades, who gave
testament to the recent establishment of the FCC’s Space Bureau and the
role it plays in advancing space equity, accessibility, and innovation.
Other speakers discussed the inspirational experience of working in
science, opportunities available to young Latinos to advance
understanding of space, and the importance of an inclusive and
representative workforce.

Community leaders shared personal anecdotes that underscored the value
of community-based problem solving, pledging to continue collaborating
with the Biden-Harris Administration on the shared objective of
expanding Latino access and representation within the realms of space,
STEM, and beyond.
