East Room, The White House

\*\*\*  

Hello, everyone, and welcome to the White House!  
   
Ambassador Zappia, we’re honored to have you with us this evening. And
we’re grateful for Italy’s continued partnership on the world stage and
in supporting Ukraine against Putin’s unprovoked war.  
   
Every family has its own mythology – stories we tell again and again,
stories that help illuminate the forces that shaped us and the values
that continue to define us.  
   
When my father’s grandparents Gaetano and Conchetta Giacoppa came to
America, they became Gaetano and Conchetta Jacobs. They left behind
everything they knew to chase the hope of this country’s unlimited
promise.  
   
It wasn’t always easy, but they had faith that if they worked hard, they
could create a good life in America.  
   
And even though their names changed, the values they brought across the
Atlantic stayed the same: Loyalty. Generosity. Kindness. Faith.  
   
I brought those values with me to the White House. And it’s my honor to
serve as the first Italian American First Lady.  
   
I grew up in a Philly suburb, and on weekends we would go to my father’s
family home in Hammonton, New Jersey.  
   
Those weekends were filled with the smell of burnt Italian bread toast,
the musical way my grandmom cursed at my grandpop in Italian when he
left rockfish on the counters and back porch after his fishing trips,
and the sauce would be bubbling over on the stove. The comfort of a
well-worn sofa. The loving and frequent embraces from my grandmom when
just for a moment, everything felt right in the world.  
   
Maybe some of you grew up like that too. Surrounded by family and love
and laughter. Maybe your house was the one your friends always wanted to
go to, because everyone felt welcome there.  
   
I wanted to bring a little bit of that feeling to all of you tonight.
Because you deserve nothing less than what our grandmoms would have
created.   
   
But our heritage is much more than our hospitality and food, isn’t it?  
   
It’s the Sicilians who were dragged from their cells and killed in New
Orleans by an angry mob. It’s “Italians need not apply.” It’s people
like my dad who were never quite accepted by my mom’s family because he
was Italian.  
   
It’s a history of those who led movements, who wrote our laws and penned
our poetry. Of men and women who were courageous, even when they were
most afraid. Of people who worked hard and fought to give their children
the best future they could – who helped build the middle class here in
the United States.  
   
Children like Speaker Pelosi. Nancy, you’ve spent your entire career
living out the values that our ancestors passed on to us. You fight for
our future each day, making our country better one law after another,
one historic first after the next. Thank you for being with us.  
   
And those values also live on in all the members of Congress, elected
officials, and community leaders joining us who represent this community
and their constituents tirelessly. Thank you for being here.  
   
My husband, President Biden, is working to build on what this community
has accomplished – and help us, and all communities, keep reaching for
that bright future our ancestors were searching for.  
   
That’s why he’s growing our economy from the middle out and the bottom
up – so families like mine growing up, and maybe like yours too, can
carve out a good life.  
   
Because everyone deserves that chance.  
   
Our ancestors’ determination did not end when they came to this country.
It did not end when their names were rewritten by history. It did not
end when they found a nation that, at the time, was not as happy to see
them as they were to see it. It lives on in all of us.  
   
So, as you move through these halls this evening, I hope you feel
wrapped in the warmth of home, that you feel the power of your
ancestors’ legacies, that you rejoice in being with one another, eat
good food and end with a little something sweet.  
   
Now, it’s my pleasure to introduce the incredible Cecilia Sordoni.  
   
\*\*\*  
   
That was beautiful! Thank you, Cecilia.  
   
Now, please, get something to eat and drink, and enjoy your time here,
because this is your house too.  
   
So, let’s raise a glass: To continuing to shape this country we call
home – living out the hope of our ancestors, passing on their dreams and
values to our children, and weaving our bright, beautiful threads into
the rich tapestry of our nation.  
   
Salute!
