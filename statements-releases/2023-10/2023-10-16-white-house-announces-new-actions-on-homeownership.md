title: "White\_House Announces New Actions on Homeownership"
---
 
For millions of Americans homeownership is a foundation for so many
parts of their lives, and for many it is also their primary source of
wealth. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to expanding access
to homeownership, ensuring homeowners can afford to stay in their homes
and make the repairs they need, and that the wealth building potential
of homeownership works equally for everyone.

Today**, **the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing new data showing
major federal investment in homeownership, and announcing key new
actions to accelerate progress. These actions make important strides,
but given the lack of homes on the market and current interest rates, to
truly ensure homeownership is accessible to all households, we need
Congress to act. That is why President Biden proposed $16 billion for
the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, which would result in more than
400,000 homes built or rehabilitated, creating a pathway for more
families to buy a home and start building wealth.  The President has
also proposed a $10 billion down payment assistance program that would
ensure first-time homebuyers whose parents do not own a home can access
homeownership alongside a $100 million down payment assistance pilot to
expand homeownership opportunities for first-generation and/or low
wealth first-time homebuyers.

**New Data Shows Strong Investment in Homeownership**

The Treasury Department released data demonstrating how President
Biden’s Investing in America agenda is supporting existing homeowners
and helping more Americans access affordable homeownership through over
$12 billion in support. The American Rescue Plan’s [Homeowner Assistance
Fund](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/homeowner-assistance-fund) (HAF)
has assisted nearly 400,000 homeowners at risk of foreclosure. Through
Q2 2023, the state, territorial, and Tribal recipients of HAF have
expended over $5.5 billion to assist homeowners, a 32% increase from Q1
2023. In addition, through the [State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds
program](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds/recipient-compliance-and-reporting-responsibilities) local,
state, territorial, and Tribal governments are also supporting home
ownership, in part by dedicating more than $6.6 billion to support over
17,000 units of affordable housing, through June 30, 2023.

Federal agencies are also releasing data showing record support for
low-, middle-income, and first-time homebuyers:

-   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is
    announcing that the Federal Housing Administration’s (FHA)
    first-time homebuyer rate under the Biden-Harris Administration is
    the highest it has been since at least 2000. Since the start of the
    Administration, FHA has supported nearly 1.8 million homeowners with
    purchase mortgages, and 83.6 percent or 1.5 million of whom are
    first-time homebuyers.  
-   The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is announcing that in this
    past fiscal year it provided more than 7,100 direct housing loans,
    which subsidizes loan rates down to 1 percent for certain borrowers.
    This is the highest number of loans since 2010, serving homebuyers
    with an average income of $42,918. Roughly 55 percent of these
    borrowers were female-headed households and 22 percent identify as
    Black or African American.
-   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is announcing that in 2023
    it helped 145,480 Veterans retain homeownership and/or avoid
    foreclosure.

**New Actions to Support Homeownership**  
  
We know that despite these milestones and actions, homeownership is
still out of reach for too many, which is why the Administration is
committed to aggressively increasing homeownership opportunities, which
includes:

-   **Allow homebuyers to leverage income from accessory dwelling
    units:** Today, HUD, through FHA, published new policy allowing
    prospective borrowers to use a portion of the actual or prospective
    rental income from an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) to be added to
    the borrower’s effective income for purposes of qualifying for an
    FHA-insured mortgage. FHA’s new policies will increase the ability
    of homebuyers across the nation to obtain access to affordable
    mortgage credit when seeking to purchase properties with ADUs, add
    ADUs to existing structures, or construct new homes with ADUs. The
    flexibilities will help more first-time homebuyers, seniors, and
    inter-generational families leverage ADUs to build generational
    wealth through homeownership while creating new affordable housing
    in their communities.  
     
-   **Increase mortgage opportunities for Tribes:** USDA is awarding $9
    million in loans to nine Native American Community Development
    Institutions as a part of its efforts to increase access to
    homeownership for Native Americans on Tribal Lands through a
    relending demonstration program. The program provides capital to
    Native Community Development Financial Institutions (NCDFIs) to be
    relent to low- and very low-income people who live on tribal lands
    and are in need of affordable single-family homes.  
     
-   **Ensure innovative homeownership models can work:** Before the end
    of the year USDA will launch a pilot to test alternative eligibility
    criteria related to community representation for Community Land
    Trust Organizations through its Section 502 Direct Home Loan
    Program. Through this pilot, USDA will evaluate whether expanding
    eligibility criteria in this way increases access to affordable
    homeownership opportunities.  
     
-   **Make home repairs easier to finance:** HUD, through FHA, is
    continuing its work to update the 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage
    Insurance Program to help homebuyers and homeowners finance the
    purchase or refinance of homes in need of improvement. FHA is
    considering potential policy changes that could increase the funds
    available to borrowers to make renovations and repairs.  Other
    policies under review would permit more time for completion of those
    improvements. These and other program changes will increase the use
    of FHA-insured mortgages to finance renovations that will improve
    existing homes and restore them to viable use, adding to the supply
    of housing in communities across the country.  
     
-   **Help homeowners know their rights and remain in their homes: **The
    Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency, is
    working on reforms to existing rules to help homeowners when they
    have trouble making their mortgage payments. The reforms build on
    observations during the COVID-19 pandemic about places where the
    rules could be streamlined and simplified. The reforms will ensure
    homeowners can get the help they need without unnecessary delays or
    hurdles and are better able to not fall into foreclosure.  
     
-   **Assist homeowners behind on their mortgages:** In fiscal year
    2024, VA will deploy a new home retention option that provides a
    long-term solution to address our most severely impacted Veteran
    borrowers. The VA Servicing Purchase (VASP) program will help
    Veteran borrowers who are behind on their mortgage loan who do not
    qualify for traditional home retention options.

The announcement builds on prior work across the Administration,
including [a policy announced earlier this
year](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-action-to-save-homebuyers-and-homeowners-800-per-year/) that
reduced the mortgage insurance fees for borrowers receiving FHA loans,
saving them on average $800 per year on housing costs. HUD has also made
it easier for first-time homebuyers to qualify for FHA-insured mortgage
financing by permitting lenders to use positive rental history as a
factor in evaluating an applicant’s creditworthiness and by providing
more access to affordable single-family FHA-insured mortgage financing
for creditworthy individuals with student loan debt. Ginnie Mae
is [enhancing its security
disclosures](https://www.ginniemae.gov/about_us/what_we_do/Documents/GinnieMaeSocialImpactandSustainabilityFramework.pdf) so
that, for the first time, investors can measure their social impact in
driving first time homeownership. This policy can expand access to
capital for first time homebuyers.  And this work builds on efforts by
the Administration’s Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and
Valuation Equity (PAVE), which is making [critical
progress](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-tackles-racial-and-ethnic-bias-in-home-valuations/) toward
ensuring there is equity in the home appraisal process. The
Administration is committed to affirmatively furthering fair housing in
its work, because everyone should have fair housing choice and access to
housing opportunities. However, the White House calls on Congress to
pass the President’s proposals so that we can ensure homeownership is a
possibility for all Americans.
