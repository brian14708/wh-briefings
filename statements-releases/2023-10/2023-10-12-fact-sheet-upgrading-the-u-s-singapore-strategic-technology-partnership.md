On the occasion of Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s
visit to Washington, D.C., the United States and Singapore launched the
U.S.-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology (CET) Dialogue. 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Acting Special Envoy for
Critical and Emerging Technology Seth Center (on behalf of Secretary of
State Antony Blinken), Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Vivian
Balakrishnan, and Minister for Communications and Information and
Minister-in-Charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity Josephine Teo led
the inaugural U.S. Singapore CET Dialogue, with opening remarks by
Deputy Prime Minister Wong.   
  
They were joined on the U.S. side by the Deputy Secretary of Commerce,
the Deputy Secretary of Energy, the Director of the National Science
Foundation (NSF), the Director of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), the Deputy National Security Advisor for
International Economics, and senior officials from the U.S. Department

Economic Development Board and the Chief Executive of the Infocomm Media
Development Authority participated.    
  
The two sides discussed opportunities to bolster research, innovation,
and commercial ties to expand the frontiers of scientific knowledge,
promote prosperity, and deliver public goods to the Indo-Pacific region,
especially ASEAN partners.  The United States and Singapore also
discussed economic security and technology protection measures to manage
risks to national security while abiding by our long-standing commitment
to open investment.  The high-level discussions were followed by a
dialogue with industry hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce focused on
AI innovation and safety and co-chaired by U.S. Deputy Secretary of
Commerce Don Graves and Singapore Minister of Communications and
Information Teo.   
  
To expand and deepen our technology partnership, the United States and
Singapore committed to launch new bilateral initiatives and welcomed
enhanced cooperation between our governments, industry, and academia
across the following domains:  
  
**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**

-   Welcomed the completion of a mapping exercise between the U.S.
    Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework and the Singapore
    Infocomm Media Development Authority’s AI Verify  
-   Establishing a bilateral AI Governance Working Group focused on
    advancing shared principles for safe, trustworthy, and responsible
    AI innovation, to complement the United States’ Voluntary AI
    Commitments and a potential multilateral AI Code of Conduct.  
-   Expanding collaboration between the U.S. National Science Foundation
    and AI Singapore (AISG) through joint research and educational
    funding opportunities focused on trustworthy and safe AI systems.  
-   Exploring reciprocal certification programs for American and
    Singaporean AI professionals on the basis of shared standards,
    tests, and benchmarks.

**Digital Economy:**

-   Developing a Roadmap for Digital Economic Cooperation that charts
    common principles and objectives on priority issues such as data
    governance, digital standards, digital inclusion, consumer
    protection, and ensuring small- and medium-enterprises can benefit
    from opportunities in the digital economy.   
-   Exploring opportunities to strengthen bilateral collaboration on
    digital payments, including to shape international best
    practices.   
-   Collaborating to facilitate trusted data flows with effective
    privacy protections, including through work under the U.S.-Singapore
    Partnership for Growth and Innovation (PGI) and through supporting
    the expansion of the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules Forum.

**Biotechnology:**

-   Convening U.S. and Singapore universities, research institutions,
    private sector, and science agencies to advance shared research and
    development (R&D) priorities for biotechnology; talent exchanges;
    and sharing of best practices for startups around commercialization,
    scaling, and R&D translation efforts.   
-   Exploring opportunities for R&D collaboration in synthetic biology,
    cell and gene therapeutics, viral and viral delivery systems.

**Climate and Resilient Critical Infrastructure:**

-   Upgrading long-standing collaboration on smart cities, with a focus
    on climate resilience, under the auspices of the U.S.-ASEAN Smart
    Cities Partnership.   
-   Working to establish a Smart Cities Program on AI through the
    U.S.-Singapore Third Country Training Program to deliver
    capacity-building to ASEAN and Pacific Islands Forum states.  
-   Supporting regional efforts to decarbonize and deploy renewable
    energy, including through ongoing research efforts through the
    U.S.-Singapore Climate Partnership.  
-   Collaborating on standards, rules, and norms for promoting the
    protection, maintenance, and streamlined processes for subsea
    cables, including at international platforms such as the
    International Cable Protection Committee.

**Quantum Information Science and Technology:**

-   Expanding government, academic, and private sector exchanges through
    the State Department International Visitor Leadership Program and
    other potential longer-term programs including between university
    partners.  
-   Deepening information-sharing on Post Quantum Cryptography migration
    between the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of
    Standards and Technology and the Department of Homeland Security and
    Singapore’s National Quantum Office and Ministry of Communications
    and Information.

**Defense Innovation:**

-   Concluding a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Department
    of Defense’s Defense Innovation Unit and the Singapore Ministry of
    Defence to more deeply integrate our bilateral defense innovation

    and beyond.

The United States and Singapore look forward to institutionalizing the
CET Dialogue as a mechanism to accelerate collaboration—both bilaterally
and with like-minded partners—and pursue ambitious objectives for our
technology partnership in service of our shared vision for a secure,
peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.
