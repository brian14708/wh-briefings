  \ to Address Impact of Hurricane\_Ida"

As the President announced earlier today, the Biden Administration is
using a wide array of tools to keep gasoline flowing to the pumps and
reduce gas shortages. At the Presidentâ€™s direction, the Department of
Energy has authorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to conduct
an exchange of 1.5 million barrels of crude oil with ExxonMobil Baton
Rouge to address supply disruptions and enable refiners in the region to
access the crude they need to continue operations. This is the first
such exchange from the SPR in four years and demonstrates that the
President will use every authority available to him to support effective
response and recovery activities in the region.

This action is the latest step the President has taken to secure energy
supplies and relieve price pressures in the region. This week, the
Department of Transportation provided new flexibilities for truck
drivers to enable them to deliver fuel, the EPA issued waivers that
expand the supply of fuel, and the IRS waived the penalty for the use of
dyed-diesel fuel on highways in the affected region in order to expand
availability of diesel for use on Louisiana roads at a critical time for
response and recovery efforts. The President has also authorized a
series of actions to assist with urgent power restoration efforts to
restore electricity in the Gulf Coast, where a number of gas stations
remain without power. President Biden has made clear: the entire Federal
Government will do everything possible to help Americans facing acute
needs in the wake of a catastrophic storm.
