title: President Biden Names Eighth Round of Judicial Nominees
---
 
The President is announcing fourteen judicial nominees, including ten
new candidates for the federal bench. All of the nominees are
extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law
and our Constitution.  
   
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.  
   
For example, this slate includes:

-   A nominee who would be the second Black woman judge on the U.S.
    District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and the first
    former federal defender to become a district court judge in Georgia.
-   A nominee who would be the first AAPI man on the U.S. District Court
    for the Western District of Washington.
-   A nominee who would be the second active Black judge on the U.S.
    District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and the only judge
    on that court with experience as a public defender.
-   A nominee who would be the only active AAPI male judge on the U.S.
    District Court for the Southern District of New York.
-   A nominee who would be the only active Latina judge on the U.S.
    District Court for the Southern District of California.
-   A nominee who would be the first AAPI woman judge on the U.S.
    District Court for the Southern District of California.
-   A nominee who would be the first Hispanic district court judge in
    Ohio.
-   A nominee who would be the first AAPI judge on the D.C. Court of
    Appeals.

This is President Biden’s eighth round of nominees for federal judicial
positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to
53.  
  
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies.
