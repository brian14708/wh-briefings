title: "FACT SHEET: Targets for Global COVID- \u2060 19 Summit"
---
 
**We invite all Global COVID-19 Summit participants to join us in
aligning around the global targets and taking the associated required
actions to end the COVID-19 pandemic and build back better.** These
global targets and associated actions by governments, international
institutions, and the private sector are drawn from those targets set
out by the Multilateral Leaders Task Force on COVID-19, the Access to
COVID-19 Tools (ACT)-Accelerator, the G20, the G7, and members of
multiple expert commissions.  
   
**These targets and associated actions are ambitious** – but they are
what we need to get on course for ending this pandemic and with it, the
risk it imposes on our countries, communities, health and livelihoods.
**We must act now to vaccinate the world, save lives, and build back
better. Only by working together in pursuit of a shared vision can we
defeat the COVID-19 pandemic and help prepare the world for future
pandemics.**  
   
**We also invite all participants to join us in monitoring our
collective progress.** By aggregating information on what each of us is
doing we can measure our progress and take the steps that will be needed
so that we don’t fall behind.  
   
**<u>TARGETS: VACCINATE THE WORLD</u>**

-   **Vaccinate the world:** Support the WHO’s goal of at least 70
    percent of the population fully vaccinated with quality, safe, and
    effective vaccines in every country and income category by UNGA
    2022.  
-   **Deliver doses urgently:** Endorse the G20 target of, “in line with
    the World Health Organization (WHO), we support the goal to
    vaccinate at least 40 percent by the end of 2021 of the global
    population.”  
-   **Manufacture doses over the medium and long-term:** Additional
    doses and adequate supplies are available to all countries in 2022.
    As scientific evidence develops, make sufficient financing available
    for production of additional doses for future booster needs in
    LIC/LMICs.

**Asks for Governments & International Institutions with Relevant
Capabilities: Fall 2021**

-   **Close the financing and supply gap for low-income countries
    (LICs)/ low middle-income countries (LMICs) to reach 70 percent
    coverage** by providing funds, purchasing or donating 1 billion
    additional doses of quality, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines,
    including through COVAX to support global equitable distribution.  
-   **Accelerate vaccination in LIC/LMICs in 2021 by expediting delivery
    of** approximately 2.0 billion already committed doses of quality,
    safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, including by converting
    existing dose sharing pledges into near-term deliveries, swapping
    delivery dates to secure earlier delivery of doses to LIC/LMICs, and
    eliminating cross-border bottlenecks in the supply of vaccines and
    critical inputs.  
-   **Get shots into arms** by making available at least $3 billion in
    2021 and $7 billion in 2022 in financing for LIC/LMICs for vaccine
    readiness and effective deployment, including supporting the health
    workforce needed to deliver vaccines, combatting hesitancy,
    addressing legal and contractual requirements, and procuring
    ancillary supplies.  
-   **Make doses available for the medium and long-term** by supporting
    sufficient global and regional production, as well as financing for
    possible booster needs and future vaccine production; expanding
    mRNA, viral vector, and protein subunit vaccine manufacturing (if
    authorized) and technology transfer; and procuring up to 3 billion
    additional doses of quality, safe and effective vaccines for
    LIC/LMICs if boosters become recommended by WHO.  
-   **Enhance accountability and coordination** by establishing a robust
    vaccine, consumables, and ancillary supplies global dashboard in
    2021, taking into account existing efforts toward this goal.

**Proposed Private Sector Commitments: Fall 2021**

-   Launch COVID-19 Corps for vaccine readiness & delivery.  
-   Enhance transparency on the volume of actual and projected
    manufacture of vaccines; provide data on production projections and
    delivery sequencing for vaccine dashboard, in order to prioritize
    delivery for LIC/LMICs.  
-   Expand global and regional manufacturing for mRNA, viral vector,
    and/or protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines, with a plan for
    development and financing.

**TARGETS: SAVE LIVES NOW**

-   **Solve the oxygen crisis** by making oxygen readily accessible for
    inpatient health facilities in all countries in the near-term and no
    later than 2022.  
-   **Eliminate the testing gap** by achieving testing rates of one per
    1,000 people per day by the end of 2021, in all countries.  
-   **Enhance timely access for all countries to authorized quality,
    safe and effective therapeutics** by making them available to all
    LIC/LMICs in 2021, and effective new non-IV treatments are available
    in 2022.  
-   **Build surge PPE manufacturing capacity** and strengthen
    coordination of existing stocks to enhance access to PPE for all
    LIC/LMIC healthcare workers in 2021, with surge capacity available
    for every region in 2022.  
-   **Improve the detection, monitoring, and mitigation of new COVID-19
    variants** by enhancing genomic sequencing and data sharing efforts
    globally in 2021 and 2022.

**Asks for Governments & International Institutions with Relevant
