This morning, the [White House Competition
Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/competition/) held its inaugural
meeting. The Council’s members – including eight cabinet members and the
leaders of seven independent agencies – met to discuss the actions they
are taking to help lower prices for American families by boosting
competition and to plan the group’s priorities over the coming months.

The July 9 Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American
Economy established the Competition Council to drive forward the
Administration’s whole-of-government effort to promoting competition.
The Council’s mandate includes delivering on the 72 initiatives
identified in the Executive Order, collaborating on addressing pressing
competition problems across the economy, and finding new ways of
delivering concrete benefits to America’s consumers, workers, farmers,
and small businesses. As of today, agencies have met each deadline set
forth in the Executive Order.  
  
In the Council’s inaugural meeting, NEC Director Brian Deese (Council
Chair) emphasized that the President’s competition agenda is core to the
Administration’s plan to Build Back Better and critical to keeping
prices low for American consumers, spurring innovation, and allowing
small businesses to compete on a level playing field. He commended the
Council members on the over a dozen initiatives they have already taken
to promote competition and help lower costs for Americans in the two
months since the Order was signed. Middle-class Americans will feel the
impact at the grocery store, when they travel to see loved ones, when
they shop for internet plans, and when they purchase the medicine they
need to stay healthy.  
  
Council members received briefings from the Department of Health and
Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission,
and the Department of Agriculture on their recent efforts to bolster
competition across key industries. The Competition Council also welcomed
two new members – Chair Gary Gensler of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Acting Chair Rostin Behnam of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  
  
Director Deese closed the meeting by outlining how the Competition
Council will work together over the coming months and years to restore
competition to the heart of American capitalism and deliver concrete
benefits to American families. He also called on agencies to identify
new ways to promote competition beyond those outlined in the Executive
Order in advance of the Council’s next convening.
