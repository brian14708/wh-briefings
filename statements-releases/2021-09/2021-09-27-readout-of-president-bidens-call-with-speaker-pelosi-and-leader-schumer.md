title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with Speaker Pelosi and Leader\_Schumer"
---
 
This afternoon, before meetings of the House Democratic Caucus and
Senate Democratic Leadership, the President had a phone call with
Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer to discuss the path forward for the
Build Back Better Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.

They covered the outreach that each of the three are doing to Democratic
House and Senate members, and the progress that has been made at what
they agree is a key moment of opportunity to fulfill longtime promises
and ensure our economy delivers for middle-class families, not just
those at the top.

They also discussed the work being done by Democrats to avoid a breach
of the United States’ full faith and credit in the face of Republican
obstruction and irresponsibility—GOP actions that show a lack of concern
about our economic recovery.

Finally, they agreed on the need to continue work on advancing the two
pieces of legislation that represent the President’s vision for creating
jobs, growing the economy, and making investments in families—instead of
failed giveaways to the rich and big corporations. They will continue
their close coordination over the coming days.
