WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate
the following two individuals to serve in key roles:

-   Brad Crabtree, Nominee for Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy and
    Carbon Management, Department of Energy
-   Tristan Leavitt, Nominee for Member of the Merit Systems Protection
    Board

**<u>Brad Crabtree, Nominee for Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy
and Carbon Management, Department of Energy</u>**

Brad Crabtree serves as Vice President for Carbon Management at the
Great Plains Institute (GPI) and has nearly three decades experience in
energy and climate policy. Crabtree oversees GPI’s carbon management
portfolio; he helped launch the State Carbon Capture Work Group, a
16-state initiative first convened in 2015 to foster commercial
deployment of carbon capture and CO<sub>2</sub> transport
infrastructure. He also led efforts to establish the Industrial
Innovation Initiative last year in partnership with the World Resources
Institute, which brings together leading industrial companies, NGOs,
unions and state officials from Midwestern and Gulf Coast states to
advance policies aimed at decarbonizing key industries to achieve
net-zero emissions.

Crabtree previously coordinated energy policy advisory groups for the
Midwestern Governors Association and facilitated the Midwestern
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord Advisory Group for six governors and the
Manitoba premier. He also co-directed Powering the Plains, GPI’s
original flagship project that developed a comprehensive, 50-year
regional blueprint for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and advanced
coal technologies.  Crabtree has led multiple overseas delegations of
U.S. policymakers and private sector leaders to learn firsthand about
carbon management and renewable energy technologies and policy
experience in other countries.

A North Dakota native, Brad is a graduate of the Georgetown School of
Foreign Service and has an MA in history from Johns Hopkins University.

**<u>Tristan Leavitt, Nominee for Member of the Merit Systems Protection
Board</u>**

Tristan Leavitt is the general counsel of the U.S. Merit Systems
Protection Board; in the absence of Senate-confirmed Board members, he
has also led the agency since March 1, 2019 as its acting chief
executive and administrative officer. Before that, he served for a year
and a half at the Office of Special Counsel as the Principal Deputy
Special Counsel, including time as Acting Special Counsel. Prior to
serving in the executive branch, he worked for eight years on Capitol
Hill conducting congressional investigations and handling various
federal workforce policy issues. His time included service on the staff
of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary for Ranking Member Chuck
Grassley and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for
Chairman Jason Chaffetz.

An Idaho native, he received his B.A. from Brigham Young University and
his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center. He and his wife
Brittany, a native of West Virginia, are the proud parents of five
children.
