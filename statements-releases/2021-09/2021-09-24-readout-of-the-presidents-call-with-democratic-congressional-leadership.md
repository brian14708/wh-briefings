title: "Readout of the President\u2019s Call with Democratic Congressional\_Leadership"
---
 
The President had a call with both Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer
this afternoon to discuss their continuing work on the pathway forward
for the Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan infrastructure deal,
both of which are crucial priorities for their shared agenda to ensure
our economy grows and delivers for the American middle class, and not
just those at the top.  
   
They discussed the progress that has been made since Wednesday night’s
meetings and the announcement of a range of options to pay for the Build
Back Better Act by having the richest taxpayers and big corporations pay
their fair share. Having spoken with members representing a wide range
of views across the Democratic caucuses, they noted that there was broad
agreement on the principles of the reconciliation bill and a recognition
of the urgency to address the economic challenges families have been
facing since long before the pandemic.  
   
The three agreed to stay in touch about their outreach through the
weekend.
