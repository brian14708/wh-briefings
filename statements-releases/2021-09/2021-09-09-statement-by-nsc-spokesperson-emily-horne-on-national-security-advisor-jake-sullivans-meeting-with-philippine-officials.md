National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Secretary of
Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. and Secretary of National Defense
Delfin Lorenzana of the Philippines in Washington, D.C. to mark the
70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Mutual Defense Treaty and consider
opportunities to further strengthen the U.S.-Philippines Alliance. Mr.
Sullivan commended the Philippines for generously hosting Afghan
refugees. They also discussed U.S. support for the Philippines’ ongoing
response to COVID-19, ongoing cooperation on counterterrorism, and the
importance of respect for human rights.

On COVID-19, we are pleased to announce that the United States will
provide an additional $11.3 million in additional COVID-19 assistance to
the Philippines, bringing total U.S. COVID-19 assistance to the
Philippines since the start of the pandemic to $37 million, in addition
to the 6 million U.S. vaccine doses donated and delivered to the
Philippines through COVAX.

As the Philippines is the United States’ oldest treaty ally in the
region, Mr. Sullivan discussed the Biden-Harris Administration’s vision
for a free and open Indo-Pacific and our efforts to revitalize our
alliances.   Mr. Sullivan underscored our enduring commitment to
Southeast Asia and reiterated our support for ASEAN centrality. They
also discussed regional issues such as freedom of the seas and the coup
in Burma.
