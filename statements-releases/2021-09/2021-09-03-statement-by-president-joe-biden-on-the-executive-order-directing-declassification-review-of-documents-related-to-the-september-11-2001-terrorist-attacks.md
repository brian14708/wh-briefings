title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden  on the Executive Order Directing Declassification\
  \ Review of Documents Related to the September 11, 2001 Terrorist\_Attacks"
---
 
When I ran for president, I made a commitment to ensuring transparency
regarding the declassification of documents on the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks on America.

As we approach the 20th anniversary of that tragic day, I am honoring
that commitment. Today, I signed an [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/03/executive-order-on-declassification-review-of-certain-documents-concerning-the-terrorist-attacks-of-september-11-2001/)
directing the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to
oversee a declassification review of documents related to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation’s September 11th investigations. The executive
order requires the Attorney General to release the declassified
documents publicly over the next six months.

We must never forget the enduring pain of the families and loved ones of
the 2,977 innocent people who were killed during the worst terrorist
attack on America in our history. For them, it was not only a national
and international tragedy. It was a personal devastation. For 20 years,
children have grown up without parents and parents have suffered without
children. Husbands and wives have had to find a way forward without
their partners in life. Brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, loved
ones and friends have celebrated 20 years of birthdays, family
gatherings, and milestones looking at an empty chair at homes and with a
hole in their hearts.  
  
My heart continues to be with the 9/11 families who are suffering, and
my Administration will continue to engage respectfully with members of
this community. I welcome their voices and insight as we chart a way
forward.
