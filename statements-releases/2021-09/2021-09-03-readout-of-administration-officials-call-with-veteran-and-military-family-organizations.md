title: Readout of Administration Officials Call with Veteran and Military Family Organizations
---
 
Today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Veterans Affairs
Dennis McDonough, Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Josh Geltzer, Senior
Response Official at Operation Allies Welcome Bob Fenton, and White
House Director of Veterans Engagement in the Office of Public Engagement
Saki Ververis, hosted a virtual meeting with 75 veteran, military
family, caregiver and survivor organizations.   
  
The call was part of the Administration’s efforts to hear directly from
veteran and military family groups about the work they are engaged in to
support the community that has been active in or impacted by the
withdrawal, including veterans, servicemembers and Afghan allies.   
  
Secretary Blinken thanked the organizations represented on the call for
their commitment to supporting veterans and military families, as well
as the mission of helping our Afghan allies. The Secretary noted the
importance of their voice as leaders and of their continued work in the
days ahead, and committed to regular communication and coordination
between State and these groups.  
  
Secretary McDonough reiterated his commitment to ensuring the Department
of Veterans Affairs continues to coordinate with and support the work of
veterans organizations who have been at the forefront of advocating for
veterans, their families and our Afghan allies. The Secretary
highlighted the importance of these groups as part of the resettlement
infrastructure and noted that their work will fill gaps created by
underfunding of resettlement agencies in past years.  
  
Administration officials reiterated the President’s commitment to both
our allies and the brave men and women who have and currently serve our
nation, and committed to continued engagement and partnership with these
groups.
