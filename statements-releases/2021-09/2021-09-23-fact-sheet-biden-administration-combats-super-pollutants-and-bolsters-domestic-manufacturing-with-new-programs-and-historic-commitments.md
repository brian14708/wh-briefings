title: 'FACT SHEET: Biden Administration Combats Super-Pollutants and Bolsters Domestic
  Manufacturing with New Programs and Historic Commitments'

*Environmental Protection Agency Issues Final Rule to Reduce Emissions
of Hydrofluorocarbons by 85% over 15 Years*

*Administration Actions Strengthen Competitiveness of Domestic
Industries, Maintain and Create Good Jobs, and Reduce Climate Pollution*

Today, the Biden Administration is announcing a set of historic actions
to phase down super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), bolster the
competitiveness of American industries, and maintain and create hundreds
of thousands of good-paying, union jobs across the country. **The
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will release a new rule, alongside
other interagency actions, that together represent one of the most
impactful federal efforts to reduce climate pollution in decades.** HFCs
are potent greenhouse gases found in a range of appliances and
substances, including refrigerators, air conditioners and foams. These
harmful pollutants have an impact on warming our climate that is
hundreds to thousands of times greater than the same amount of carbon
dioxide. HFCs are exacerbating climate change and extreme weather events
– and the corresponding public health threats, physical damage, and
economic costs.

Today’s actions build on a foundation of widespread support from
Democrats and Republicans, industry leaders, and environmental
organizations, all of whom supported the bipartisan American Innovation
and Manufacturing (AIM) Act passed last year. These steps are expected
to result in reductions of more than 4.5 billion metric tons of carbon
dioxide-equivalent by 2050 — equal to nearly three years of U.S. power
sector emissions at 2019 levels — making today’s announcement one of the
most consequential climate actions taken by the federal government in
years. Today’s actions will make the U.S. domestic approach consistent
with key provisions contained in the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal
Protocol, an international agreement to reduce the consumption and
production of HFCs. That amendment, if implemented worldwide, can
prevent up to one half a degree Celsius of warming this century.

As directed in the AIM Act, the final rule from EPA will establish a
landmark climate protection program that will phase down the production
and consumption of HFCs by 85% below baseline levels within the next 15
years. The United States is already a leader in innovation and
manufacturing of HFC alternatives, and today’s actions will ensure that
American industries remain competitive in this expanding global market.
EPA’s rule establishes an allowance allocation and trading program to
reduce HFCs, and creates a robust compliance and enforcement system. In
addition, EPA is committing to addressing the use of HFCs in products,
and is currently reviewing more than a dozen petitions to restrict HFC
use in a wide range of applications. **Together, these actions will
ensure that American communities and workers reap the climate and
economic benefits of the phasedown of HFCs.** EPA estimates the
cumulative benefits of today’s rule — more than $272 billion through
2050 — will benefit populations that may be especially vulnerable to
damages from climate change, and will result in significant compliance
savings for industry.

Reflecting President Biden’s whole-of-government approach to tackling
the climate crisis, six agencies are today taking several steps to build
on this progress. Together, the new commitments will support U.S.
industries and workers and protect communities from climate pollution
and other impacts.

The Administration is taking coordinated steps across the federal
government to catalyze reductions in HFCs, through four main action
areas:

1.  **Preventing illegal trade, production, use, and sale of
    climate-damaging HFCs** by leveraging collaboration across the
    federal government, and preparing for enforcement actions to deter
    and punish violations of the law.
2.  **Supporting the development of HFC alternatives** in partnership
    with other federal departments and agencies, the private and public
    sector, states, and other key stakeholders.
3.  **Managing HFC stocks** to promote use of recovered HFCs from
    retired equipment to offset the need for newly manufactured HFCs,
    and leveraging the federal government’s purchasing power to support
    use of alternatives and reclaimed HFCs for federal facilities,
    equipment, and fleets.
4.  **Advancing research and testing** to identify HFC alternatives and
    technologies.

**<u>Preventing Illegal Trade, Production, Use, and Sale of
Climate-Damaging HFCs and Deterring and Punishing Violations</u>**

Illegal trade in HFCs poses a fundamental risk to America’s climate and
economic goals. If the United States were to see rates of noncompliance
similar to what has been observed in other countries, the result could
be as much as 43-90 million metric tons of additional carbon
dioxide-equivalent emissions in a single year, which is roughly equal to
the annual emissions from 22 coal-fired power plants. This high level of
non-compliance would put U.S. businesses at a competitive disadvantage
and discourage innovation in HFC alternatives. To address these issues,
the Administration is taking the following actions:

-   **Creating an Interagency Task Force on Illegal HFC Trade:** Today,
    the Administration is announcing a new, nimble interagency task
    force led by experts from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
    EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, and EPA’s Office of Enforcement
    and Compliance Assurance. In partnership with the Departments of
    Justice, State, and Defense, these agencies will execute a strategy
    to detect, deter, and disrupt any attempt to illegally import or
    produce HFCs in the United States. This coordination builds on the
    agencies’ long experience collaborating to prevent illegal imports,
    including imports of ozone-depleting substances and vehicles that
    fail to comply with Clean Air Act standards.
-   **Enforcing HFC Phasedown:** DHS, through its component agencies
    U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs
    Enforcement (ICE), is partnering with EPA to enforce the AIM Act’s
    phasedown of HFCs. AIM Act import enforcement is a priority that
    falls squarely within CBP’s mission to protect the American people,
    safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation’s economic prosperity,
    and ICE Homeland Security Investigations’ (HSI) mission to
    investigate, disrupt, and dismantle criminal organizations that
    threaten or seek to exploit U.S. customs laws.
-   **Deterring Illegal Activity**: EPA, in coordination with CBP and
    HSI, will deter illegal activity and pursue enforcement actions by
    implementing a comprehensive, innovative, and robust compliance and
    enforcement regime that includes, among other provisions:
    establishing a certification ID system to track the movement of HFCs
    in the United States in real time; establishing administrative
    consequences, such as revoking allowances, on top of, and not in
    lieu of, any potential enforcement action; and aggressively
    enforcing civil and criminal violations of the law.

<!-- -->

-   **Leveraging Enforcement through the Department of Justice:** The
    Department of Justice (DOJ) fully supports efforts to pursue the
    illicit trade in potent, climate-damaging HFCs, and will work in
    close collaboration to implement a multi-pronged enforcement
    strategy. DOJ will work with its law enforcement partners at EPA and
    DHS to support the development and prosecution of cases referred by
    these agencies. Vigorous and well-publicized enforcement of these
    rules is essential to holding violators to account as well as to
    deterring this illegal trade by others.
-   DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) has both
    civil and criminal enforcement tools that it can use to combat the
    illegal trade in HFCs. ENRD can bring civil judicial enforcement
    actions for violations of the law and applicable
    regulations, seeking civil penalties, orders to ensure future
    compliance with the law, and injunctive relief to mitigate the
    impact of prior violations. For the worst offenders, ENRD will
    aggressively pursue fines and imprisonment for criminal violations
    of the AIM Act (as well as for related crimes such as smuggling,
    false statements, and money laundering). ENRD also will collaborate
    with its law enforcement partners and other DOJ components to ensure
    that tariffs on HFCs are enforced fairly and help ensure that no one
    avoids HFC tariffs by disguise or artifice.

**<u>Supporting the Development and Use of HFC Alternatives</u>**

-   The Department of Defense (DoD) has established an AIM Act Working
    Group of the Military Services and the Coast Guard to coordinate the
    Armed Forces response to the AIM Act and the HFC phasedown. The
    Working Group encourages partnerships with other federal agencies
    and the defense industrial base to support characterization of all
    mission-critical military HFC uses and plan for future transition
    efforts.

**<u>Managing HFC Stocks and Leveraging the Power of Federal
Procurement</u>**

-   The General Services Administration (GSA) will review all “Best in
    Class” contracts to ensure the Federal Acquisition
    Regulation clauses that support the use of HFC alternatives and
    reclaimed HFCs have been correctly incorporated into all relevant
    contracts.
-   DoD will evaluate strategies to reuse HFCs recovered from DoD
    equipment to enhance resilience for future missions.
-   DoD will assess input gathered from interested parties on the recent
    Request for Information on climate-related disclosures to identify
    greenhouse gas reduction efforts in the supply chain, as well as
    opportunities to leverage DoD’s purchasing power for future
    acquisition of goods and services to support the phasedown of HFCs.
    DoD will update its procurement instructions to support the tenets
    of the AIM Act and maintain the mission of the Department.

**<u>Advancing Innovation and Testing to Identify HFC Alternatives and
Technologies</u>**

-   DoD will invest more than $8 million over the next five years to
    identify and qualify suitable low-global-warming-potential (GWP)
    alternatives to high-GWP HFCs in applications with military-unique
    performance requirements. These efforts include:
    -   Evaluation of low-GWP alternatives for refrigerants in ground
        vehicles, aviation systems, environmental control units (ECUs),
        fields kitchens and other military equipment;

    <!-- -->

    -   Evaluation of low-GWP fire suppressants in ground vehicles and
        aviation systems; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Research on low-GWP refrigerants to replace HFC refrigerants
        currently used in Naval systems.
-   DoD will seek proposals for Fiscal Year 2023 from both federal and
    private sector organizations to conduct research on HFC alternatives
    for use in air-conditioning systems of various military vehicles
    which have unique requirements for operation in a combat
    environment. This research could reduce DoD’s future needs for HFC
    production to support mission-critical military end uses and could
    also provide additional alternatives for non-military applications.
