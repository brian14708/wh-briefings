The President is grateful to Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer for their
extraordinary leadership, and to Members from across the Democratic
Caucus who have worked so hard the past few days to try to reach an
agreement on how to proceed on the Infrastructure Bill and the Build
Back Better plan. A great deal of progress has been made this week, and
we are closer to an agreement than ever. But we are not there yet, and
so, we will need some additional time to finish the work, starting
tomorrow morning first thing.

While Democrats do have some differences, we share common goals of
creating good union jobs, building a clean energy future, cutting taxes
for working families and small businesses, helping to give those
families breathing room on basic expensesâ€”and doing it without adding to
the deficit, by making those at the top pay their fair share.
