**September 29, 2021  
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania**

**Section 1.  Pittsburgh Statement**

1.  The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) met for the first
    time in Pittsburgh on 29 September 2021.  It was co-chaired by U.S.
    Secretary of State Antony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina
    Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, European
    Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, European
    Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis. The United
    States and the European Union reaffirm the TTC’s objectives to:
    coordinate approaches to key global technology, economic, and trade
    issues; and to deepen transatlantic trade and economic relations,
    basing policies on shared democratic values.
2.  We support the continued growth of the U.S.-EU technology, economic
    and trade relationship and cooperation in addressing global
    challenges. We intend to collaborate to promote shared economic
    growth that benefits workers on both sides of the Atlantic, grow the
    transatlantic trade and investment relationship, fight the climate
    crisis, protect the environment, promote workers’ rights, combat
    child and forced labor, expand resilient and sustainable supply
    chains, and expand cooperation on critical and emerging
    technologies. We stand together in continuing to protect our
    businesses, consumers, and workers from unfair trade practices, in
    particular those posed by non-market economies, that are undermining
    the world trading system.
3.  We share a strong desire to drive the digital transformation that
    spurs trade and investment, benefits workers, protects the
    environment and climate, strengthens our technological and
    industrial leadership, sets high standards globally, boosts
    innovation, and protects and promotes critical and emerging
    technologies and infrastructure. We intend to cooperate on the
    development and deployment of new technologies in ways that
    reinforce our shared democratic values, including respect for
    universal human rights, advance our respective efforts to address
    the climate change crisis, and encourage compatible standards and
    regulations. We intend to cooperate to effectively address the
    misuse of technology, to protect our societies from information
    manipulation and interference, promote secure and sustainable
    international digital connectivity, and support human rights
    defenders.
4.  We seek inclusive economic growth that benefits all of our people,
    and intend to make a particular focus on inclusive growth for middle
    class and lower income people on both sides of the Atlantic. We also
    have a particular focus on opportunities for small and medium-sized
    enterprises.
5.  The cooperation and exchanges of the TTC are without prejudice to
    the regulatory autonomy of the United States and the European Union
    and should respect the different legal systems in both
    jurisdictions. Cooperation within the TTC is intended to feed into
    coordination in multilateral bodies, including in the WTO, and wider
    efforts with like-minded partners, with the aim of promoting
    democratic and sustainable models of digital and economic
    governance.
6.  To strengthen our cooperation, we identified the following areas of
    joint work over the coming months, with the intent of achieving
    concrete outcomes on these issues by the time of our next meeting.

**Section 2.  Pittsburgh outcomes**

1.  As a demonstration of our shared commitment to make progress on the
    objectives of the TTC, the United States and European Union have
    identified the following outcomes in specific areas, the details of
    which are further reflected in Annexes I-V.

-   We believe that our openness to foreign investment is essential for
    economic growth and innovation. We also face common challenges in
    addressing related risks. We intend to maintain **investment
    screening** in order to address risks to national security and,
    within the European Union, public order. We recognize that our
    investment screening regimes should be accompanied by the
    appropriate enforcement mechanisms. Furthermore, investment
    screening regimes should be guided by the principles of
    nondiscrimination, transparency, predictability, proportionality,
    and accountability, as set forth in relevant OECD guidelines. We
    also intend to engage with partner countries and stakeholders on
    investment screening.
-   We recognize the importance of effective controls on trade in
    dual-use items. Such **export controls** are necessary to ensure
    compliance with our international obligations and commitments. We
    affirm that a multilateral approach to export controls is most
    effective for protecting international security and supporting a
    global level-playing field. We note that the potential applications
    of emerging technologies in the defense and security field raise
    important concerns, and recognize the need to address these risks.
    We have determined shared principles and areas for export control
    cooperation, including in export control capacity-building
    assistance to third countries, and recognize the importance, where
    appropriate and feasible, of prior consultations to ensure that the
    application of export controls is transparent and equitable for U.S.
    and EU exporters.
-   The United States and European Union consider that **artificial
    intelligence** (AI) technologies have the potential to bring
    significant benefits to our citizens, societies and economies. AI
    technologies can help tackle many significant challenges that we
    face, and they can improve the quality of our lives. The United
    States and European Union acknowledge that AI technologies yield
    powerful advances but also can threaten our shared values and
    fundamental freedoms if they are not developed and deployed
    responsibly or if they are misused. The United States and European
    Union affirm their willingness and intention to develop and
    implement AI systems that are innovative and trustworthy and that
    respect universal human rights and shared democratic values.
-   The United States and European Union reaffirm our commitment to
    building a partnership on the rebalancing of global supply chains in
    **semiconductors** with a view to enhancing respective security of
    supply as well as their respective capacity to design and produce
    semiconductors, especially, but not limited to, those with
    leading-edge capabilities.  This partnership should be balanced and
    of equal interest for both sides. We underline the importance of
    working together to identify gaps in the semiconductor value chain,
    and strengthening our domestic semiconductor ecosystems.
-   With respect to **global trade challenges**, we intend to work
    closely together to address non-market, trade-distortive policies
    and practices, improve the effectiveness of our respective domestic
    measures that address those policies and practices, and explore ways
    to combat the negative effects of such policies and practices in
    third countries. We also intend to work together to maintain
    competitive, free, and fair transatlantic commerce in new and
    emerging technologies, by avoiding new and unnecessary **barriers to
    trade** in these technologies, while always respecting the United
    States’ and the European Union’s regulatory autonomy and promoting
    openness and transparency. In these and other efforts, we intend to
    maintain a particular focus on using and coordinating the use of our
    trade policy tools. We aim to protect **workers and labor rights**,
    and combat forced and child labor. We intend to address relevant
    **trade, climate, and environmental** issues.

1.  We acknowledge the importance of and share a commitment to
    consulting closely with diverse **stakeholders** on both sides of
    the Atlantic as we undertake our work in the TTC.  Robust engagement
    with business, thought leaders, labor organizations, non-profit
    organizations, environmental constituencies, academics, and other
    stakeholders that form the civil society at large is essential to
    this work. We intend to separately make available points of contact,
    where stakeholders may submit their inputs, comments and views.
    Moreover, regular exchanges with the stakeholders are to be
    organized through diverse channels, both at the level of working
    groups and political principals, as well as by each of the
    respective parties or jointly. This is to encourage the
    transatlantic stakeholder community to provide common proposals on
    the work pursued by the TTC.

**Section 3.  Future scope of work**

  
The United States and the European Union ask that each of the **working

    and views regarding current and future regulations in both the
    United States and European Union with a goal of effectively
    addressing shared concerns, while respecting the full regulatory
    autonomy of the United States and European Union. We have identified
    common issues of concern around: illegal and harmful content and
    their algorithmic amplification, transparency, and access to
    platforms’ data for researchers as well as the democratic
    responsibility of online intermediaries. We have also identified a
    shared interest in using voluntary and multi-stakeholder initiatives
    to complement regulatory approaches in some areas. We are committed
    to transatlantic cooperation regarding platform policies that focus
    on disinformation, product safety, counterfeit products, and other
    harmful content. We plan to engage with platform companies to
    improve researchers’ access to data generated by platforms, in order
    to better understand and be able better to address systemic risks
    linked to how content spreads online.  We also plan to engage in a
    discussion on effective measures to appropriately address the power
    of online platforms and ensure effective competition and contestable
    markets. The working group is also tasked to discuss, alongside

**Annex I**

**<u>Statement on Investment Screening</u>**

1.  The United States and the European Union believe that openness to
    foreign investment is essential for economic growth and innovation.
    They take note of the very significant volume of investments,
    exceeding four trillion euros / dollars linking companies on both
    sides of the Atlantic, which illustrates the strength of the
    transatlantic partnership.
2.  The United States and the European Union intend to continue to
    protect themselves from risk arising from certain foreign investment
    through investment screening focused on addressing risks to national
    security and, within the European Union, public order as well.
3.  The United States and the European Union recognize that investment
    screening regimes should be based on legislative or regulatory
    frameworks accompanied by the appropriate enforcement mechanisms.
4.  Furthermore, drawing on best practices, investment screening regimes
    should be guided by the principles of non-discrimination,
    transparency of policies and predictability of outcomes,
    proportionality of measures, and accountability of implementing
    authorities, as set forth in the *Guidelines for Recipient Country
    Investment Policies Relating to National Security*, adopted by the
    OECD Council in May 2009
5.  The United States and the European Union envisage to meet
    periodically, through the TTC Investment Screening Working Group and
    other appropriate channels, to exchange information on investment
    trends and best practices related to effective investment screening
    implemented in line with the above principles, while respecting
    confidentiality limitations. In particular, the United States and
    the European Union intend to explore the following work-streams:

-   Exchanges on investment trends impacting security, including
    strategic trends with respect to industries concerned, origin of
    investments, and types of transactions;
-   Exchanges on best practices, i.e. risk analysis and the systems for
    risk mitigation measures, with a focus on sensitive technologies,
    issues related to access to sensitive data, which may include
    personal data; and
-   Holistic view of the policy tools addressing risks related to
    specific sensitive technologies;

1.  The United States and the European Union also intend to maintain
    lines of communication with stakeholders on these issues and engage
    with other partners globally on investment screening.
2.  The working group intends to conduct a joint virtual outreach event
    for stakeholders. 

**Annex II**

**<u>Statement on Export Control Cooperation</u>**

**Principles**

1.  The United States and the European Union recognize the importance of
    effective controls on trade in dual-use items, including transfers
    in sensitive technologies. Such controls are necessary to ensure
    compliance with our international obligations and commitments, in
    particular regarding non-proliferation of weapons of mass
    destruction and preventing destabilizing accumulations of
    conventional weapons, regional peace, security, stability and
    respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, as well
    as our joint security and foreign policy interests.
2.  The United States and European Union understand that a multilateral
    approach to export controls is most effective for protecting
    international security and supporting a global level-playing field.
    They reiterate their commitment to working with partners and allies,
    where appropriate, to coordinate and broaden the global response,
    promoting a multilateral rules-based trade and security system
    founded on transparency, reciprocity, and fairness.
3.  The United States and the European Union note that the potential
    applications of emerging technologies in the defense and security
    field raise important legal, ethical, and political concerns and
    recognize the need to address risks associated with the trade in
    emerging technologies.
4.  The United States and European Union share concerns that technology
    acquisition strategies, including economic coercive measures, and
    civil-military fusion policies of certain actors undermine security
    interests, and challenge the objective assessment of risks by the
    competent authorities and the effective implementation of
    rules-based controls in line with internationally-agreed standards.
5.  The United States and the European Union are of the view that export
    controls should not unduly disrupt strategic supply chains and
    should be consistent with the applicable exceptions of the General
    Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and the European
    Union recognize the importance, where appropriate and feasible, of
    consultations prior to the introduction of controls outside the
    multilateral regimes, in particular to ensure that the application
    of export controls is transparent and equitable for U.S. and EU
    exporters.
6.  The United States and European Union acknowledge the need for
    controls on trade in certain dual-use items, in particular
    technologies, including cyber-surveillance technologies that may be
    misused in ways that might lead to serious violations of human
    rights or international humanitarian law.
7.  The United States and European Union also recognize the
    responsibility of the private sector, as well as public R&D
    institutions, under export control rules as well as the importance
    of raising awareness in the private and the research sectors, and
    that promoting cooperation and self-regulation is integral to
    effective export controls. They are committed to working closely in
    partnership with the private sector and public R&D institutions in
    that regard.
8.  Against this backdrop the Export Control Working Group under the
    Trade and Technology Council, building on the on-going U.S.-EU
    Export Control Dialogue, provides a dedicated forum enabling the
    United States and the European Union to enhance cooperation on
    export controls in order to address evolving security risks and
    challenges associated with trade in strategic dual-use technologies
    to destinations warranting greater scrutiny, while ensuring that
    export controls are consistent with joint innovation and technology
    development.

**Cooperation areas**  
  
The United States and the European Union intend to enhance their
cooperation in the following areas:

-   **Technical consultations on current and upcoming legislative and
    regulatory developments** to promote the global convergence of
    controls and ensure legal security for U.S. and EU companies,
    including regular adjustments to control lists and specific license
    exceptions/General Export Authorizations, development of guidelines,
    as well as relevant regulatory developments in third countries;
-   **Technical consultations and development of convergent control
    approaches on sensitive dual-use technologies**, as appropriate;
-   **Information exchange** **on risks associated with**: 
    -   the export of sensitive technologies to destinations and
        entities of concern, exchange of good practice on the
        implementation and licensing for listed or non-listed sensitive
        items;
    -   technology transfers and dual-use research of concern and
        exchange of best practices to support the effective application
        of controls while facilitating research collaboration between
        U.S. and EU research organizations;
-   **Technical consultations on compliance and enforcement approaches**
    (i.e. legal and regulatory basis, institutional and administrative
    arrangements) and actions;
-   **Capacity building assistance to third countries** to develop
    appropriate capabilities to implement guidelines and lists of
    multilateral export control regimes, appropriate export control
    policies and practices, as well as relevant enforcement measures;
    and,  
-   **Technical consultations regarding multilateral and international
    cooperation**, including prior to the introduction of controls
    outside the multilateral regimes, as appropriate.

**Next Steps**  
  
To implement these Principles and initiate the Consultations, the Export
Control Working Group is tasked to:

-   Conduct a joint U.S.-EU virtual outreach event for stakeholders on
    October 27, 2021.  This event is expected to begin the process of
    soliciting input from stakeholders on steps to achieve the
    Principles and specific topics for the Working Group to address in
    the Cooperation areas, and
-   Meet to identify an initial set of specific topics to address in its
    Technical Consultations following the TTC.

**Annex III**

**<u>Statement on AI</u>**

1.  The United States and European Union believe that artificial
    intelligence (AI) technologies have the potential to bring
    substantial benefit to our citizens, societies and economies.  AI
    can help tackle significant challenges societies face, transform
    industries, and improve the quality of our lives.
2.  The United States and European Union acknowledge that AI-enabled
    technologies have risks associated with them if they are not
    developed and deployed responsibly or if they are misused.
3.  The United States and European Union affirm their willingness and
    intention to develop and implement trustworthy AI and their
    commitment to a human-centered approach that reinforces shared
    democratic values and respects universal human rights, which they
    have already demonstrated by endorsing the OECD Recommendation on
    AI.  Moreover, the United States and European Union are founding
    members of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, which
    brings together a coalition of like-minded partners seeking to
    support and guide the responsible development of AI that is grounded
    in human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation, economic growth,
    and societal benefit.
4.  The United States and European Union are committed to working
    together to ensure that AI serves our societies and economies and
    that it is used in ways consistent with our common democratic values
    and human rights. Accordingly, the United States and European Union
    are opposed to uses of AI that do not respect this requirement, such
    as rights-violating systems of social scoring.
5.  The United States and European Union have significant concerns that
    authoritarian governments are piloting social scoring systems with
    an aim to implement social control at scale. These systems pose
    threats to fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, including
    through silencing speech, punishing peaceful assembly and other
    expressive activities, and reinforcing arbitrary or unlawful
    surveillance systems.
6.  The United States and European Union underline that policy and
    regulatory measures should be based on, and proportionate to the
    risks posed by the different uses of AI.
7.  The United States notes the European Commission’s proposal for a
    risk-based regulatory framework for AI. The framework defines
    high-risk uses of AI, which are to be subject to a number of
    requirements. The EU also supports a number of research, innovation
    and testing projects on trustworthy AI as part of its AI strategy.
8.  The European Union notes the U.S. government’s development of an AI
    Risk Management Framework, as well as ongoing projects on
    trustworthy AI as part of the U.S. National AI Initiative.
9.  We are committed to working together to foster responsible
    stewardship of trustworthy AI that reflects our shared values and
    commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of all our
    citizens. We seek to provide scalable, research-based methods to
    advance trustworthy approaches to AI that serve all people in
    responsible, equitable, and beneficial ways.

**Areas of cooperation**  
  
The United States and the European Union want to translate our common
values into tangible action and cooperation for mutual benefit.

-   The United States and European Union are committed to the
    responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI and intend to continue to
    uphold and implement the OECD Recommendation on Artificial
    Intelligence. The United States and European Union seek to develop a
    mutual understanding on the principles underlining trustworthy and
    responsible AI.
-   The United States and European Union intend to discuss **measurement
    and evaluation tools** and activities to assess the technical
    requirements for trustworthy AI, concerning, for example, accuracy
    and bias mitigation.
-   The United States and the European Union intend to collaborate on
    projects furthering the development of trustworthy and responsible
    AI to explore better use of machine learning and other AI techniques
    towards desirable impacts. We intend to explore cooperation on AI
    technologies designed to enhance privacy protections, in full
    compliance with our respective rules, as well as additional areas of
    cooperation to be defined through dedicated exchanges.
-   The United States and European Union intend to jointly undertake an
    **economic study examining the impact of AI on the future of our
    workforces**, with attention to outcomes in employment, wages, and
    the dispersion of labor market opportunities. Through this
    collaborative effort, we intend to inform approaches to AI
    consistent with an inclusive economic policy that ensures the
    benefits of technological gains are broadly shared by workers across
    the wage scale.

**Annex IV**

**<u>Statement on Semiconductor Supply Chains</u>**

1.  The United States and European Union reaffirm their willingness to
    build a partnership on the rebalancing of global supply chains in
    semiconductors with a view to enhancing their respective security of
    supply as well as respective capacity to design and produce
    semiconductors, especially, but not limited to, those with
    leading-edge capabilities. This partnership should be balanced and
    of equal interest to both sides. It will initially focus on
    short-term supply chain issues. Cooperation on mid- and long-term
    strategic semiconductor issues will begin in the relevant TTC
    working groups ahead of the next TTC Meeting.
2.  We acknowledge that semiconductors are the material basis for
    integrated circuits that are essential to modern-day life and
    underpin our economies. As such, semiconductors power virtually
    every sector of the economy, including energy, healthcare,
    agriculture, consumer electronics, manufacturing, defense, and
    transportation. They determine the characteristics of the products
    into which they are embedded, including security, computing power,
    privacy, trust, energy performance and safety.
3.  The COVID-19 pandemic has further increased the importance of
    semiconductors. They have enabled remote health care, medical
    research, working and studying from home and electronic commerce.
    Through the pandemic, shortages of certain semiconductors have
    highlighted the importance of ensuring stable, resilient and robust
    supply chains for these vital products.
4.  We recognize that the semiconductor supply chain, from raw
    materials, design and manufacturing to assembly, testing and
    incorporation into end products, is extremely complex and
    geographically dispersed. The development and production of
    semiconductors include multiple countries, with some very
    concentrated segments. The United States and European Union have
    some important respective strengths as well as ongoing, significant
    mutual dependencies, and common external dependencies.
5.  We share the view that promoting supply chain transparency, in
    partnership with industry and all relevant stakeholders, is
    essential to strengthening investment and addressing the supply and
    demand imbalance in the semiconductor industry. With the goal of
    identifying bottlenecks pertaining to supply and demand across the
    various segments of the semiconductor supply chain, we intend to
    enhance cooperation on measures to advance transparency and
    communication in the semiconductor supply chain.  To this end, we
    intend to engage with our respective stakeholders in discussions of
    relevant measures.
6.  In the short-term, we underline the importance of jointly
    identifying gaps and vulnerabilities, mapping capacity in the
    semiconductor value chain, and strengthening our domestic
    semiconductor ecosystems, from, research, design to manufacturing,
    with a view to improving resilience, through consultation with
    stakeholders, and the right incentives.

1.  We share the aim of avoiding a subsidy race and the risk of crowding
    out private investments that would themselves contribute to our
    security and resilience.  
2.  Without prejudice to cooperation with our likeminded partners, we
    intend to focus on reducing existing strategic dependencies
    throughout the supply chain, especially through a diversification of
    the supply chain and increased investment.
3.  We intend to work jointly so that any investment made on our
    territories is done in full respect of our respective security of
    supply.

**Annex V**

**<u>Statement on Global Trade Challenges</u>**

The United States and the European Union intend to initially focus on
the following specific objectives in the Global Trade Challenges Working
Group.  
  
**Trade Policy Cooperation towards Non-Market Economies (NMEs)**  
  
In paragraph 22 of the Joint Statement issued following their June 15,
2021 summit meeting, President Biden, President Michel, and President
von der Leyen stated:  
 “We intend to work cooperatively on efforts to achieve meaningful World
Trade Organization (WTO) reform and help promote outcomes that benefit
our workers and companies…We intend to seek to update the WTO rulebook
with more effective disciplines on industrial subsidies, unfair behavior
of state-owned enterprises, and other trade and market distorting
practices.”   
As a complement to this cooperation, the United States and the European
Union intend to focus in the Global Trade Challenges Working Group on
responding to the challenges posed by non-market economies cited in the
June 15 Joint Statement.  
  
The United States and the European Union, as democratic market
economies, share a number of core values, including with respect to
human and labor rights, environmental protection, the rule of law,
non-discrimination, regulatory transparency, market-based commerce, and
the freedom to innovate and to have innovations protected.  
  
We intend to work together in the Global Trade Challenges Working Group
to ensure that our trade policies support these and other shared values,
including by promoting them internationally and by resisting challenges
to these values in global commerce arising from non-market distortive
policies and practices.  
  
Among the actions the United States and the European Union intend to
take in the Global Trade Challenges Working Group with respect to this
objective are the following:

1.  Share information on non-market distortive policies and practices
    that pose particular challenges for U.S. and EU workers and
    businesses, both across sectors and in relation to specific sectors
    in which we have identified certain risks, with the goal of
    developing strategies for mitigating or responding to those
    policies, practices, and challenges. Non-market practices that raise
    concerns include – but are not limited to – forced technology
    transfer; state-sponsored theft of intellectual property;
    market-distorting industrial subsidies, including support given to
    and through SOEs, and all other types of support offered by
    governments; the establishment of domestic and international market
    share targets; discriminatory treatment of foreign companies and
    their products and services in support of industrial policy
    objectives; and anti-competitive and non-market actions of SOEs.  
2.  The United States and the European Union recognize that domestic
    measures that each takes on its own can play a critical role in
    ensuring that trade policy supports market-based economies and the
    rule of law. This recognition is without prejudice to the views that
    either of them may have with respect to the appropriateness of any
    particular measure. 

To improve the use and effectiveness of such domestic measures, the
United States and the European Union intend to:

-   Make an inventory of the growing number of domestic measures that
    the United States and the European Union each already employ, and
    exchange information on the operation and effectiveness of those
    measures and on any plans for future measures; and,
-   To the extent practicable or deemed desirable by both the United
    States and the European Union, consult or coordinate on the use and
    development of such domestic measures, with a view to increasing
    their effectiveness and mitigating collateral consequences for
    either the United States or the European Union from any such measure
    developed.

1.  Exchange information on the impact of non-market, distortive
    policies and practices in third countries and explore ways of
    working together and with other partners with a view to addressing
    the negative effects of such policies and practices, which can
    undermine development goals and have a negative impact on U.S. and
    EU commerce in those countries. 

**Avoiding New and Unnecessary Barriers to Trade in New and Emerging
Technologies**  
  
The United States and the European Union recognize and respect the
importance of regulation of goods and services to achieve legitimate
policy objectives. They are also aware that such regulations may have
unintended consequences and result in barriers to trade between them and
that such barriers, once implemented, can be challenging to remove.
Consequently, the United States and the European Union intend to work to
identify and avoid potential new unnecessary barriers to trade in
products or services derived from new and emerging tech, while ensuring
that legitimate regulatory objectives are achieved.  
  
This work will fully respect each side’s regulatory autonomy and
regulatory system, and will promote the highest level of openness and
transparency and welcome input from all interested stakeholders.  
  
**Cooperation on Trade and Labor**  
  
The United States and the European Union intend to promote together and
in an inclusive way the protection of fundamental labor rights,
including by combatting the scourge of forced and child labor, with each
side using relevant trade policies and tools, including FTAs and
unilateral measures, such as preference and other programs, and
cooperating in the ILO, WTO, and other appropriate multilateral fora.
Both sides intend to promote responsible business conduct, with the aim
of enhancing the sustainability of global value chains. In pursuit of
these objectives, we intend to:

1.  Share information and best practices on trade measures related to
    the respect for fundamental labor rights and prevention of forced
    and child labor, including implementation and enforcement; new
    initiatives of each side, with a view to developing additional and
    joint ways to prevent forced labor; and the effectiveness of labor
    enforcement tools, with a view to improving them.
2.  Cooperate and jointly support work in multilateral fora to promote
    fundamental labor rights, including to combat child and forced
    labor, and including in the WTO fisheries subsidies negotiations.
3.  Discuss the impact of technology on labor markets, working
    conditions, and worker rights, including policy issues related to
    the “gig” economy, worker surveillance, and labor conditions
    throughout supply chains.
4.  Exchange information on the implementation of labor provisions in
    our respective trade agreements.

**Cooperation on Trade-Related Environmental and Climate Policies and
Measures**  
  
The United States and the European Union underline the positive role
that trade can play in addressing environmental challenges such as
climate change, achieving climate neutrality, and supporting the
transition to a more circular economy. The United States and the
European Union intend to consult on the inclusion of trade-related
climate and environment issues in the work plan of the Global Trade
Challenges Working Group.  
  
**Consultation with Stakeholders**  
  
The United States and the European Union welcome input from and dialogue
with business, trade unions, consumer organizations, and environmental
and other non-government organizations on the work of the Global Trade
Challenges Working Group, including joint input from transatlantic
groupings of stakeholders.
