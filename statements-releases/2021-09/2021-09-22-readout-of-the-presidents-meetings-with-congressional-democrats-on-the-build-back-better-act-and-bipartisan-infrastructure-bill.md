title: "Readout of the President\u2019s Meetings with Congressional Democrats on the\
  \ Build Back Better Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure\_Bill"
---
 
The President hosted three productive and candid meetings with
congressional Democrats, representing a wide range of views of the
caucuses in both Chambers, about the urgent need to deliver for the
American middle class through the Build Back Better Act and the
bipartisan infrastructure deal. This was an important opportunity for
the President to engage with Members and hear their perspectives, and
progress was made toward finding the pathway forward for lowering costs
for hardworking people and ensuring that our economic growth strategy is
based on investing in families, not more giveaways to big corporations
and the wealthiest taxpayers. There is more work ahead in the coming
days, and he and his team will have follow-up meetings, starting
tomorrow, to continue to advance the process of passing these critical
bills.
