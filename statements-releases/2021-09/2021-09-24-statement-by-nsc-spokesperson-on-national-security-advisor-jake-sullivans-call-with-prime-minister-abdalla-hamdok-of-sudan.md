National Security Advisor Sullivan spoke by phone on September 24 with
Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.  Mr. Sullivan expressed the
Biden Administration’s commitment to support the civilian-led transition
to democracy in Sudan and oppose any attempts to derail or disrupt the
will of the Sudanese people.  Mr. Sullivan underscored that any attempt
by military actors to undermine the spirit and agreed benchmarks of
Sudan’s constitutional declaration would have significant consequences
for the U.S.-Sudan bilateral relationship and planned assistance.  Mr.
Sullivan and Prime Minister Hamdok discussed the importance of the
transitional government making continued progress to stabilize the
economy, reform the security sector under civilian leadership, advance
Sudan’s peace process, and ensure justice and accountability for past
abuses.  Mr. Sullivan highlighted that U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn
of Africa Jeffrey Feltman will travel to Sudan next week to reaffirm
U.S. support for the civilian-led transition and discuss regional
security challenges.  Mr. Sullivan expressed the urgency of promoting a
peaceful resolution of the ongoing crisis in neighboring Ethiopia. 
Finally, Mr. Sullivan conveyed that President Biden looks forward to
hosting and meeting with Prime Minister Hamdok in the near future.
