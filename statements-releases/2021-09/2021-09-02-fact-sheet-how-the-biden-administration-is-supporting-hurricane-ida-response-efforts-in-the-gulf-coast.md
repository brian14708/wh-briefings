title: 'FACT SHEET: How the Biden Administration is Supporting Hurricane Ida Response
  Efforts in the Gulf Coast'
---
 
The President is closely monitoring recovery efforts in the wake of
Hurricane Ida.  He has directed that the Federal government take prompt
and specific actions to respond to the needs of Americans who are
suffering from the storm’s devastating impacts.  President Biden has
spoken twice with the Governors of Louisiana and Mississippi and with
mayors and parish leaders from areas most affected by Hurricane Ida.  He
made clear there will be a robust Federal response in support of state,
tribal, and local officials, and that the Federal government will
closely coordinate with local and private sector partners.  On Tuesday,
the President specifically authorized a series of actions to assist with
urgent power restoration efforts in the Gulf Coast.  He spoke with
national and regional electricity sector leaders to make clear that the
Administration will provide whatever support and resources are needed
for ongoing power restoration efforts.  The FEMA Administrator has
already traveled to Louisiana and Mississippi to survey storm damage and
discuss recovery efforts with state and local partners.  
  
Before Hurricane Ida made landfall, the President approved Emergency
Declarations for the States of Louisiana and Mississippi.  These
declarations authorized FEMA to provide assistance for emergency
measures to save lives and to protect property and public health and
safety in Louisiana and Mississippi and fund emergency protective
measures.  The Federal government also proactively pre-positioned
resources across the region before Hurricane Ida made landfall,
including search and rescue equipment, meals, water, generators,
equipment, and personnel to assist states with impacts from the storm.

Following the devastating landfall of Hurricane Ida, the Administration
has taken swift action to support response and recovery efforts:

**Approved a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Louisiana: **

-   On August 29, President Biden approved a Major Disaster Declaration
    for the State of Louisiana, authorizing Individual and Public
    Assistance for impacted parishes and hazard mitigation statewide. 
    It also authorized federal assistance to fully fund emergency debris
    removal and emergency protective measures for the first 30 days.

**Assistance to Disaster Survivors:**

-   **FEMA and the Small Business Administration (SBA) are providing
    assistance to disaster survivors** who have sustained losses from
    Hurricane Ida.  FEMA assistance may include grants to help pay for
    temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and
    underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental and
    funeral expenses caused by the disaster, together with other serious
    disaster-related expenses. 
-   **FEMA has also turned on Critical Needs Assistance, providing $500
    to applicants** who have immediate or critical needs because they
    are displaced from their homes as a result of the Major Disaster
    Declaration the President approved.  So far, more than 31,000
    households in Louisiana have received a one-time payment.
-   **The SBA has begun offering low-interest disaster loans** to
    qualified businesses of all sizes, nonprofits, homeowners and
    renters.
-   **The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is offering
    assistance to families living in impacted parishes** covered by the
    major disaster declaration, including providing immediate
    foreclosure relief; making mortgage insurance available; making
    insurance available for mortgages and home rehabilitation; sharing
    information on available providers; and offering additional
    flexibilities to communities in their administration of HUD
    programs.
-   **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is reviving its free Operation Blue
    Roof program to get as many houses into living condition as
    possible** in impacted Parishes in Louisiana during Hurricane Ida
    recovery. The program provides homeowners in disaster areas
    with fiber-reinforced sheeting to cover damaged roofs until
    permanent repairs are made.
-   **To help disaster survivors register for Federal assistance**,
    **Mobile Emergency Response Support assets including Emergency
    Operations Vehicles are deployed to support Louisiana and
    Mississippi.**  This includes an additional six FEMA Mobile
    Communications Operations Vehicle (MCOVs) equipped with satellite
    technology that are en route to Louisiana to serve as a mobile
    command center.  
-   **Individuals in affected areas can apply for disaster assistance**
    and get referrals to local, state and federal agencies and voluntary
    organizations.  The fastest way for anyone in impacted areas to
    apply for disaster assistance under the Major Disaster Declaration
    is through **DisasterAssistance.gov.**

**Providing Emergency Support:**

-   **FEMA has already delivered more than 4.5 million meals, 3.6
    million liters of water, more than 134,000 tarps, nearly 250
    generators to the region, and hundreds of additional ambulances**
    have been transported to Louisiana and Mississippi to assist with
    medical evacuations and transfer patients from health care
    facilities impacted by the storm.  The Defense Logistics Agency has
    been activated for leasing of additional generators.
-   **The Department of Agriculture issued a waiver allowing Louisiana
    Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants** to
    use their benefits to purchase **“hot” or prepared foods** through
    September 28<sup>th</sup>. 
-   **The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has
    approximately 100 personnel currently deployed for the Ida response
    –** including one Incident Management Team and two Disaster Medical
    Assistance Teams.  There are also two additional Disaster Medical
    Assistance Teams and one Joint Patient Movement Team preparing to
    deploy – bringing the total HHS personnel deployed to 173 by the end
    of the day.
-   **HHS is setting-up a 250-bed Federal Medical Station in New
    Orleans** and will provide staffing support via Disaster Medical
    Assistance Teams.
-   **HHS is also establishing a patient evacuation site at Louis
    Armstrong International Airport in New Orleans**, to be staffed with
    a Disaster Medical Assistance Team and Joint Patient Movement Team.
-   **HHS is also deploying a Disaster Medical Assistance Team to the
    Thibodaux Regional Health System Hospital in Thibodaux, Louisiana**
    to support a hospital decompression mission.  This hospital is one
    of the only fully operational medical facilities in Terrebonne and
    Lafourche Parishes.
-   **12 Urban Search and Rescue teams are currently operationa**l in
    Louisiana to support state and local efforts.  The teams have
    completed more than 8,900 structural evaluations.
-   **The Coast Guard and the Department of Defense are assisting with
    search and rescue efforts.** The Coast Guard had 34 aviation, 26
    rotary and 8 fixed-wing search and rescue assets prepositioned, and
    the Department of Defense has 60 high water vehicles and 14 rotary
    wing assets that were prepositioned to assist with search and rescue
    efforts. The National Guard Bureau has 195 high-water vehicles and
    23 rotary wing assets prepositioned to assist with search and rescue
    in Louisiana, and 680 high water vehicles and five rotary wing
    assets in Mississippi.
-   **More than 6,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen** from
    Louisiana and 10 other states are responding to the aftermath of
    Hurricane Ida to support recovery efforts.
-   **The Army Corps of Engineers activated planning and response
    teams** for debris removal, temporary roofing, and temporary housing
    in advance of the storm.

**Expediting Power Restoration to Impacted Communities: **

-   **The President convened a call with energy sector CEOs **to convey
    to them the specific actions he has directed in response to their
    requests for support to their power restoration efforts.  He
    emphasized that his Administration is ready to provide help and
    resources as needed to help expedite power restoration efforts in
    Louisiana and Mississippi.**  The Administration is closely
    coordinating with private electricity sector companies** to fully
    understand the challenges they are facing as a consequence of the
    storm and identify any means of supporting speedier restoration of
    power.
-   **The Federal government is sharing aerial imagery from
    reconnaissance flights and satellite imagery to support damage
    assessments** for energy infrastructure. 
-   **More than 25,000 linemen and clearance crews from 32 states and
    D.C are in the region racing to restore power.**
-   **A catastrophic responsive team from the Bonneville Power
    Administration with expertise in bulk power system transmission
    operations is on hand** under DOE’s coordinating authority to ensure
    energy companies are supported on behalf of the Federal government
    and have access to resources as appropriate. 
-   **FEMA personnel are supporting efforts by the State of Louisiana
    and the National Guard to remove debris and clear roads** so
    restoration workers and equipment can have easier passage and access
    to downed wires and poles.
-   DOE is working with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and
    the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to **expedite permitting for
    rerunning of transmission cable across the Mississippi River and for
    standing up transmission towers** to enable power to get back on
    line as quickly as possible.
-   While assessments are still ongoing to understand the full impact of
    the storm on transmission lines and towers**, FEMA has deployed
    nearly 250 generators in the region, and FEMA and DOE are working to
    deliver more generators to expand temporary power to emergency
    services while supporting efforts to restart Entergy’s Nuclear
    Waterford 3 plant**, where power has been restored.

**Increasing the Availability of Gasoline and Easing Price Pressures:**

-   **The Department of Transportation (DOT) has extended and amended an
    emergency declaration that offers temporary flexibility to how many
    hours a truck driver can drive**.  This applies nationally to goods
    that support the Covid-19 response, and will now include gasoline
    and other types of fuel and building materials in addition to
    medical supplies, and food.  Because this hurricane is hitting a
    region that is a key center of the nation’s oil production and
    refining infrastructure, **this waiver should help reduce the risk
    of gasoline shortages or price increases stemming from the
    hurricane**.  DOT’s top priority remains safety, and this waiver is
    accompanied by additional safety related reporting requirements to
    allow the department to monitor driver work hours. In addition, DOT
    has activated the Routing Assistance Hotline to assist first
    responders.
-   **The EPA has approved emergency fuel waivers for Louisiana and
    Mississippi,** effective immediately, which will expand the supply
    of gasoline that can be sold in these two states and increase
    availability at this critical time.  EPA and DOE are continuing to
    actively monitor the fuel supply situation, and will act
    expeditiously if extreme and unusual supply circumstances exist in
    other areas.
-   **EPA issued a waiver of the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) requirements
    in Louisiana and Mississippi to help improve the fuel supply
    circumstances** caused by Hurricane Ida.  The waiver begins August
    30, 2021, and ends September 16, 2021.
-   The Federal Railroad Administration activated an Emergency Relief
    Docket to offer railroads the ability to obtain temporarily waivers
    to **quickly speed up service recovery and restoration to move goods
    for emergency relief efforts**.
-   The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a
    waiver that gives the United States Coast Guard 8<sup>th</sup>
    District and the Environmental Protection Agency **flexibility to
    transport non-radioactive hazardous materials to help with relief
    efforts** in areas impacted by the Hurricane.
-   **The IRS has announced that it will not impose a penalty when dyed
    diesel fuel is used or sold for use on highways in a number of
    parishes in the state of Louisiana.  This action expands the
    availability of diesel for use on Louisiana roads at a critical time
    for response and recovery efforts.**  Dyed diesel is not taxed since
    it is intended for off-highway uses, such as farming equipment,
    construction vehicles, and home heating. For that reason, use of
    this fuel on the highways incurs an IRS penalty.  The IRS is waiving
    the penalty in affected parishes within Louisiana, and only the tax
    that is typically due on diesel will have to be paid by
    sellers/operators.  The waiver will be in effect between August 29,
    2021 and September 15, 2021.

**Restoring Critical Communications:**

-   The FCC is working directly with wireless carriers on their
    implementation of the Wireless Resiliency Cooperative Framework,
    which **allows customers to use any cellular provider to get a cell
    signal if their provider’s network is down** and fosters mutual aid
    among wireless providers during emergencies.  This has helped cell
    service come back online quicker.
-   The FCC **provided technical assistance to 911 call centers** that
    were impacted by the storm.
-   **FEMA is providing temporary cell and radio infrastructure to
    improve communications.**
-   **The FCC deployed staff to Louisiana in advance of the storm and is
    sending additional resources** to support spectrum management,
    identify impacts, and prioritize recovery efforts.  It is also
    engaged in daily coordination with industry on the transport of
    necessary equipment to help fill communications gaps.
