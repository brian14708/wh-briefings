Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et
seq.) (NEA), sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)), and section 301
of title 3, United States Code, I hereby report that I have issued an
Executive Order addressing the situation in and in relation to northern
Ethiopia, which has been marked by activities that threaten the peace,
security, and stability of Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa
region.  The widespread humanitarian crisis precipitated by the violent
conflict in northern Ethiopia has left millions of people in need of
humanitarian assistance and has placed an entire region on the brink of
famine.   
  
I have declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed by
this crisis and authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in
consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on
individuals and entities responsible for or complicit in, or who have
directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, actions or
policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Ethiopia, or
that have the purpose or effect of extending or expanding the crisis in
northern Ethiopia or obstructing a ceasefire or a peace process;
corruption or serious human rights violations; blocking the delivery or
distribution of, or access to, humanitarian supplies; targeting
civilians; planning, directing, or committing attacks against United
Nations, African Union, or associated personnel; or actions or policies
that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Ethiopia or its
territorial integrity.   
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

                               Sincerely,  
  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
