Yesterday, White House Public Engagement Director and Senior Advisor
Cedric Richmond and White House Office of Political Outreach and
Strategy Director Emmy Ruiz met with Latino leaders from across the
country to listen to their priorities and to discuss how the [Build Back
Better
agenda](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/13/fact-sheet-how-president-bidens-build-back-better-agenda-helps-latino-communities/)
and pathway to citizenship would benefit Latino families. White House
officials outlined how the President’s plan would lower healthcare costs
for families by lowering prescription drug costs and increasing access
to healthcare coverage, among other measures, and how two years of free
college would be a game-changer for families looking to get ahead. White
House officials also affirmed the President’s desire to see a pathway to
citizenship pass through reconciliation or other means.  
  
Latino leaders shared what their organizations have done over the course
of the pandemic to meet the needs of local communities and advocate for
additional resources. Leaders praised the administration for its work
thus far combatting the pandemic, and shared their concerns about how
much work remains to get communities vaccinated, including the
healthcare benefits to a pathway to citizenship. Leaders also spoke
about how the services they provide to local communities reflect many of
the components in the Build Back Better agenda and how monumental those
investments would be.  
  
The meeting was the latest in activity the White House has conducted
since the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month. Last week, the White
House hosted a [virtual discussion](https://fb.watch/88TMGSdnBp/) to
kick off National Hispanic Heritage Month and highlight the benefits of
the President’s Build Back Better Agenda for the Latino community. The
roundtable featured Isabel Guzman, Administrator of the Small Business
Administration, Xavier Becerra, Secretary of Health and Human Services,
Dr. Miguel Cardona, Secretary of Education and Alejandro Mayorkas,
Secretary of Homeland Security, who shared their experiences as Latino
leaders in the President’s historic Cabinet.
