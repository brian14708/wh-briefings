title: "President\_Biden Names Seventh Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing eight new candidates for the federal bench,
all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to
the rule of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.

For example, this slate includes:

-   Three new Latino judicial nominees with diverse professional
    experiences.  
-   A nominee who would be the first Korean-American woman to serve as a
    federal appellate judge and the second AAPI woman to serve on the
    Ninth Circuit from California.  
-   A nominee who would be the first Black woman to serve on the Ninth
    Circuit from California, as well as the second Black woman to ever
    serve on the Ninth Circuit.  
-   A nominee who would be the only active Black woman district court
    judge in any of California’s four federal district courts.

This is President Biden’s seventh round of nominees for federal judicial
positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to
43.

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies.
