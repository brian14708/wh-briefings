**The HLED Vision**  
  
United States President Joseph R. Biden and Mexican President Andrés
Manuel López Obrador agreed to relaunch the U.S.-Mexico High-Level
Economic Dialogue (HLED) in recognition of our broad strategic economic
relationship.  Established in 2013, the HLED advances strategic economic
and commercial priorities for both countries, with the shared goal of
fostering economic development and growth, job creation, global
competitiveness, and reduction of poverty and inequality.  The
Biden-Harris Administration recognizes the importance of the dynamic,
deep, and integrated commercial relationship with Mexico, currently our
largest trading partner in goods, including as a top market for U.S.
agricultural exports. As our countries face new challenges, the HLED
will allow us to rebuild and grow as dynamic partners.  
  
The relaunched HLED features four central pillars:

1.  Building Back Together
2.  Promoting Sustainable Economic and Social Development in Southern
    Mexico and Central America
3.  Securing the Tools for Future Prosperity
4.  Investing in Our People

Together, we will build back from the impact of the global pandemic,
promote inclusive trade and investment, prepare our workforces for the
future, and strengthen regional supply chains. As an ongoing forum to
address priority issues, the HLED’s agenda will be enhanced by regular
input and engagement with key stakeholders from civil society and
business.  
  
**The HLED Work Plan**  
  
**Pillar I: Building Back Together**  
The United States and Mexico will build back together in an environment
informed by the pandemic by improving the regional business environment
and strengthening the resilience of U.S.-Mexico supply chains. Work
under this pillar will include how to best facilitate economic recovery
and strengthen infrastructure, trade facilitation, and innovation.

-   **Strengthening Existing and New Supply Chains**
    -   Coordinate on critical industries to mitigate supply chain
        disruptions.
    -   Explore opportunities to complement supply chain needs in both
        countries, assessing prospects to increase competitiveness,
        attract investment, and reduce vulnerabilities in critical
        sectors.
    -   Promote environmental technologies through exchanges of
        information and trade missions.
-   **Trade Facilitation and Infrastructure**
    -   Build on the principles of co-responsibility and co-management
        of our shared border via the 21st Century Border Management
        Initiative.
    -   Promote U.S.-Mexico economic competitiveness through innovation
        and by improving land border-crossing and marine port
        infrastructure, and better understanding and expediting
        cross-border trade flows.
    -   Improve access to medical devices and supplies for public health
        emergencies.

**Pillar II: Promoting Sustainable Economic and Social Development in
Southern Mexico and Central America**  
The United States and Mexico will identify complementary and cooperative
opportunities to improve livelihoods through the creation of jobs and
opportunities in the short, medium, and long term in El Salvador,
Honduras, Guatemala, and southern Mexico, increasing its trade potential
and spurring investment.

-   Increased technical cooperation between U.S. and Mexican
    international development agencies, promotion of value chains, clean
    energy, and rural development.
-   Promote increased trade potential and spur investment in the region
    by mutually identifying projects of interest drawing on relevant
    research and analysis, including any present or future research or
    missions conducted by the two governments. 

**Pillar III: Securing the Tools for Future Prosperity**  
The United States and Mexico will support regulatory compatibility and
risk mitigation on issues related to information and communication
technologies, networks, cybersecurity, telecom and infrastructure, among
others. 

-   **Mitigating Threats and Enhancing Data Flows**
    -   Develop opportunities to strengthen cybersecurity protections in
        global supply chains. Facilitate collaboration and cooperation
        in tackling cybersecurity challenges through international
        industry practices and standards.
    -   Enhance cross-border data flows and interoperability between the
        United States and Mexico.

**Pillar IV: Investing in Our People**  
The United States and Mexico will foster cooperation towards a more
inclusive workforce that is better educated, more competitive, and
better trained with the necessary skills to meet the needs of the
21<sup>st</sup> Century economy.

-   Inclusiveness and Training
-   Coordinate joint efforts to promote an innovation ethos.
-   Promote initiatives to invest in entrepreneurs and small-and
    medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
-   Collaborate to enhance access to economic opportunity for women,
    youth, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ community.
-   Consider options for joint technical training and educational
    programs across priority sectors.

The HLED will strengthen our partnership to better ensure that the
United States and Mexico meet the challenges of our time and ensure that
our peoples can thrive.  Mexico and the United States will regularly
consult with civil society, private sector, academia, and other
non-governmental organizations to contribute to the HLED, fostering an
open dialogue that values inclusion and diverse viewpoints while
ensuring transparency in decision-making.
