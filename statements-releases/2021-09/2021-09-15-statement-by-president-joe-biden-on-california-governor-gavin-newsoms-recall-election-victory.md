Congratulations to Governor Gavin Newsom on defeating the recall vote.
This vote is a resounding win for the approach that he and I share to
beating the pandemic: strong vaccine requirements, strong steps to
reopen schools safely, and strong plans to distribute real medicines—not
fake treatments—to help those who get sick. The fact that voters in both
traditionally Democratic and traditionally Republican parts of the state
rejected the recall shows that Americans are unifying behind taking
these steps to get the pandemic behind us.
