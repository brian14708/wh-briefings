title: "Statement by Vice President Harris on Texas Law\_SB8"
---
 
Today, a new law takes effect in Texas that directly violates the
precedent established in the landmark case of *Roe v. Wade*. This
all-out assault on reproductive health effectively bans abortion for the
nearly 7 million Texans of reproductive age. Patients in Texas will now
be forced to travel out-of-state or carry their pregnancy to term
against their will. This law will dramatically reduce access to
reproductive care for women in Texas, particularly for women with low
incomes and women of color. It also includes a disturbing provision that
incentivizes private citizens to sue anyone who assists another person
in receiving an abortion.    
  
The Biden-Harris Administration will always fight to protect access to
healthcare and defend a woman’s right to make decisions about her body
and determine her future.
