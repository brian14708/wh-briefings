title: "Statement by President Joe Biden on the Tenth Anniversary of the Repeal of\
  \ Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell"
---
 
Ten years ago today, a great injustice was remedied and a tremendous
weight was finally lifted off the shoulders of tens of thousands of
dedicated American service members. The repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,
which formally barred gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members from
openly serving, helped move our nation closer to its foundational
promise of equality, dignity, and opportunity for all. It was the right
thing to do. And, it showed once again that America is at its best when
we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our
example.

Despite serving with extraordinary honor and courage throughout our
history, more than 100,000 American service members have been discharged
because of their sexual orientation or gender identity—including some
14,000 under Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. Many of these veterans received what
are known as “other than honorable” discharges, excluding them and their
families from the vitally important services and benefits they had
sacrificed so much to earn.

As a U.S. Senator, I supported allowing service members to serve openly,
and as Vice President, I was proud to champion the repeal of this policy
and to stand beside President Obama as he signed the Don’t Ask, Don’t
Tell Repeal Act into law. As President, I am honored to be
Commander-in-Chief of the strongest and most inclusive military in our
nation’s history. Today, our military doesn’t just welcome LGBTQ+
service members—it is led at the highest levels by brave LGBTQ+
veterans, including Under Secretary of the Air Force Gina Ortiz Jones
and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness Shawn Skelly, who
served under Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. I was gratified to appoint the first
openly gay Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a
lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve and Afghanistan veteran who joined
the military under the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy. And during my first
week in office, I proudly delivered on my pledge to repeal the
discriminatory ban on open service by patriotic transgender service
members.

On this day and every day, I am thankful for all of the LGBTQ+ service
members and veterans who strengthen our military and our nation. We must
honor their sacrifice by continuing the fight for full equality for
LGBTQ+ people, including by finally passing the Equality Act and living
up to our highest values of justice and equality for all.
