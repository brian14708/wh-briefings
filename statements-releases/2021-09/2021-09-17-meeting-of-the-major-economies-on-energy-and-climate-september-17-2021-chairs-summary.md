  s\_Summary"
---
 
On September 17, 2021, President Biden convened the Major Economies
Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF), as a follow-up to the convening of
that group during his Leaders Summit on Climate in April.  Participants
underscored the urgency of strengthening climate ambition ahead of the
UN Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP 26) in Glasgow and beyond,
and many announced their support for a Global Methane Pledge to be
launched at COP 26.    
  
At the Leaders Summit in April, the MEF leaders and other participants
stressed the importance of strengthening climate ambition on the road to
COP 26.  Some leaders made announcements at that time of higher
ambition, including new or updated nationally determined contributions
under the Paris Agreement.  Others indicated that announcements would be
made at a later date.     
  
President Biden was joined in the September 17 virtual, closed-door
gathering by leaders from Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, the European
Commission, the European Council, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Mexico, and the United Kingdom as well as the UN Secretary-General.
Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry chaired a ministerial
session with China, Germany, India, and Russia.  
  
U.S. Secretary of State Blinken opened the meeting by summarizing the
latest findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
which starkly underscored the rising prevalence of climate-driven
disasters and the strong prospect of far graver consequences in coming
decades absent urgent, strengthened action.  President
Biden characterized recent climate-related events as a “blinking code
red” and noted that the time to act is narrowing — “to the point of no
return.”     
  
Prime Minister Hasina of Bangladesh, representing the Climate Vulnerable
Forum, stressed the significant impacts facing vulnerable countries
and the importance of moving from “climate vulnerability to climate
resilience to climate prosperity.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
stressed that it is not too late to achieve a 1.5 degree Celsius limit
on warming, that countries need to step up before COP 26, and that more
ambition is needed with respect to mitigation, adaptation, and
finance.   
  
Participants then addressed four topics: 

-   Further commitments and actions to be undertaken in the remaining
    weeks before COP 26 in Glasgow.
-   Potential participation in the Global Methane Pledge to be launched
    at COP 26.
-   The importance of a forward-looking COP outcome that reflects the
    collective commitment of Parties to the Paris Agreement to continue
    strengthening their ambition and actions post-Glasgow.
-   Plans to leverage the MEF post-Glasgow as a launchpad for
    collective, concrete efforts to scale up climate action during the
    decisive decade of the 2020s. 

Concerning further commitments and actions, many stressed the critical
importance of keeping a 1.5 degree C limit within reach and achieving
global net zero emissions by mid-century.  Participants indicated a
variety of additional actions being taken, including domestic
implementing measures, the intention to increase Nationally Determined
Contribution (NDC) ambition by COP 26, domestic and international
efforts related to coal, and others.  Many also emphasized the
importance of support for developing countries in the climate
transition, including delivering on the developed countries’ goal of
mobilizing $100 billion annually. 

Recognizing that methane is a powerful, short-lived climate pollutant
that already accounts for about half of the 1.0 degrees C of net warming
to date, the Global Methane Pledge, an effort co-initiated by the United
States and the European Union, will involve a collective goal of
reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent below 2020
levels by 2030 and implementation of related domestic actions.  There
was broad recognition at the meeting of the importance of rapidly
reducing methane emissions, and many MEF members, including the European
Union, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the
United States, declared their intention to join. It was reported that
non-MEF countries, including Ghana and Iraq, have also signaled
intent to join the Global Methane Pledge.  These early supporters of the
Pledge include six of the top 15 methane emitters globally and
together account for over one-fifth of global methane emissions and
nearly half of the global economy. 

Concerning COP 26, there was broad agreement on the importance of
a successful COP that not only includes the completion of the Paris
“rulebook” and strong outcomes on adaptation and finance but also
acknowledges the decisive nature of the 2020s and reflects the
collective commitment of the Parties to the Paris Agreement to continue
strengthening ambition to keep a 1.5 degree C limit on warming within
reach.   

President Biden also laid out U.S. plans to use the MEF at both the
leader and ministerial levels to facilitate targeted endeavors similar
to the Global Methane Pledge.  Going forward, the MEF will continue to
serve as a high-level political forum to advance core climate-related
issues among the world’s major economies.  In light of the urgency
of taking addition climate action, President Biden explained that he
also plans to strengthen the MEF’s role as a platform for launching
cooperative efforts that accelerate concrete action.  Such action will
include multiple tracks focused on key spheres, including energy,
industry, land, and the ocean.  The United States plans to initiate
these efforts with a meeting of MEF ministers in January 2022 to discuss
clean energy goals in the power, transport, industry and buildings
sectors.  President Biden also said he plans to convene MEF leaders
again to take stock of progress. 

In closing remarks, Special Presidential Envoy Kerry cited the Global
Methane Pledge as an important contribution to addressing the climate
crisis and an example of practical approaches to transformative action. 
He stressed the urgency of action in the 2020s and called on countries
to use every opportunity, including the upcoming G20 Summit in Rome to
build further ambition ahead of COP 26 in Glasgow.
