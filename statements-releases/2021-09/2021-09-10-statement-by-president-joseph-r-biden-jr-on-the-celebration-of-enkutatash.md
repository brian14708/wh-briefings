title: Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on the Celebration of Enkutatash
---
 
Jill and I send our best wishes for a happy new year to all the people
of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and all those around the world celebrating
Enkutatash tomorrow, including hundreds of thousands of Americans with
Ethiopian or Eritrean heritage.

Ethiopian-Americans and Eritrean-Americans are vital to every aspect of
the life of our nation—enriching communities all across the United
States—and I know the past year has been difficult for many of you. In
addition to the pain and loss caused by COVID-19, the ongoing conflict
in Ethiopia may be directly affecting your families and loved ones. We
are all deeply concerned by the reports of violence against civilian
populations in Ethiopia, and my Administration is engaging in robust
diplomacy with our partners throughout the region to peacefully resolve
conflicts in the Horn of Africa. I also recognize and appreciate the
direct contributions many of you make to strengthen peace and prosperity
in the region as members of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Diaspora.

The United States has a deep and long-lasting commitment to the people
of the Horn of Africa. We will continue to speak out against violence
and the inhumane treatment of any group of people, and we will continue
our support for addressing humanitarian needs in the region. We believe
Ethiopia, a great and diverse nation, can overcome its current divisions
and resolve the ongoing conflict, beginning with a negotiated ceasefire.
Building peace will not be easy, but it can and must begin now with
dialogue and by seeking unity in our common humanity.

Melkam Addis Amet to all those celebrating. And I pray this New Year may
usher forth peace, reconciliation, and healing for families and
communities across Ethiopia, Eritrea, and worldwide.
