title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Bipartisan Policing Reform\_\
  Negotiations"

Every American should be treated with dignity and respect by law
enforcement.  Yet, that has not always been true for communities of
color, where cases of discriminatory policing and excessive force are
too often not met with accountability or justice.  
  
As a United States Senator, I introduced the Justice in Policing Act
along with Senator Cory Booker and Representative Karen Bass. This bill
would hold law enforcement accountable and provide greater transparency
when there is police misconduct and use of excessive force. It is part
of George Floyd’s legacy, Breonna Taylor’s legacy, and that of so many
others who were victims of police misconduct.  It is part of our
collective responsibility to one another. While legislation would not
have been a panacea, it would have been a step towards equal justice.  
  
Senator Booker and Representative Bass worked day and night to move the
legislation forward. They put both time and heart in to build support,
and they deserve our utmost gratitude.  
  
Today, however, we learned that Senate Republicans chose to reject even
the most modest reforms. Their refusal to act is unconscionable.
Millions of people marched in the streets to see reform and
accountability, not further inaction. Moving forward, we are committed
to exploring every available action at the executive level to advance
the cause of justice in our nation.
