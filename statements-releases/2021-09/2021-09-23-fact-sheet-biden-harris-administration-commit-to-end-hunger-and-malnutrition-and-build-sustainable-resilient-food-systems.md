*“At a time when nearly one in three people globally do not have access
to adequate food — the United States is committing to rallying our
partners to address immediate malnutrition and to ensure that we can
sustainably feed the world for decades to come. To that end, the United
States is making a $10 billion commitment to end hunger and invest in
food systems at home and abroad.”**– *** President Biden, UN General
Assembly Address September 21, 2021

The United States is committed to developing innovative, inclusive,
science-based, and creative solutions to food systems transformation. 
It is committed to leveraging the power of well-functioning markets at
the local and international levels to bolster food security and
sustainable food systems by expanding income opportunities, stabilizing
food supply and prices, reducing food loss and waste, and improving
dietary diversity and nutrition.  
  
Building sustainable food systems requires work in all three dimensions
of sustainable development – social, economic, and environmental.  More
efficient food systems are critical for alleviating poverty, meeting the
world’s food needs, and shrinking agriculture’s environmental impact. 
Helping all the components of food systems adapt to a warming planet and
reduce global emissions through climate-smart agricultural practices is
also critical to ensure long-term food and nutritional security.   
  
USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and USAID Administrator Samantha Power joined
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and global partners in the
September 23 UN Food Systems Summit to spur urgent action to end hunger
and malnutrition and build more sustainable, equitable, and resilient
food systems at home and abroad.  Demonstrating the U.S. commitment to
accelerating progress toward these goals, the United States announced a
planned multi-year investment of **more than $10 billion** to promote
food systems transformation through innovation and climate-smart
agriculture, improved infrastructure for food access and inclusive
market opportunities, programs prioritizing women’s and children’s
needs, improving nutrition, reducing food loss and waste, and climate
change mitigation and adaptation within our own country and worldwide.
The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to advance
these critical initiatives.  
  
Domestically, we are setting pathways forward for meeting these
challenges, including with historic investments to build back better in
the face of the climate crisis and economic disruptions from COVID-19. 
Out of our total $10 billion commitment, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack
announced we intend to invest $5 billion to strengthen food systems in
the United States, including through investments in systems and
infrastructure to ensure access to healthy diets for all Americans, and
investments in fair and efficient markets to improve the inclusivity and
resilience of our food systems.  Other domestic investments support the
expansion of climate smart agriculture and forestry.  
  
The United States is committed to not only addressing these challenges
domestically but also globally, in partnership with governments, local
actors, and the private sector.  Working with Congress, and building on
a long history as the largest provider of international agriculture,
economic development, and nutrition assistance as well as humanitarian
assistance, USAID Administrator and Feed the Future Coordinator Samantha
Power announced a $5 billion commitment over five years to Feed the
Future, the U.S. government’s global hunger and food security
initiative, and an expansion of Feed the Future target countries. 
Launched in 2010 to reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, Feed the
Future supports countries’ pathways to food system transformation,
drawing on U.S. expertise and experience in innovation, technology, and
research and development.   
  
International programs under the Feed the Future initiative and other
domestic initiatives that support the UN Food Systems Summit goals
include: 

-   **Financing for Food Security and Agricultural Projects:**  The U.S.
    International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) set a goal to
    finance $1 billion in food security and agriculture projects over
    five years.  DFC will provide debt and equity financing and
    political risk insurance to private sector projects in areas
    including agricultural production, irrigation, food processing, food
    storage, shipping and logistics, and fintech related to food
    systems.  
-   **Financing for Nutrition in Low- and Middle-Income Countries**: 
    The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is joining an
    existing collaboration with the DFC and the Eleanor Crook Foundation
    to mobilize $100 million of financing over five years to tackle the
    root causes of malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries,
    address the effects of COVID-19 on malnutrition and food insecurity,
    and leverage private sector solutions to reduce malnutrition
    globally.  Furthermore, this collaboration will address the
    financing gap for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) operating in
    the nutritious food space given that SMEs provide the majority of
    food consumed in Sub-Saharan Africa, but often lack access to the
    capital needed to improve and grow.  
-   **Food Fortification:** USAID also committed to invest $38 million
    over five years to expand large-scale food fortification to deliver
    essential vitamins and minerals to those who need them most. 
    USAID’s investment will support scaling up large-scale food
    fortification through global leadership, context-specific expertise,
    and partnerships with governments, private sector, and civil
    society. In addition, to the $38 million planned investment, USAID
    will launch a new large-scale food fortification partnership with
    the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and UNICEF to address widespread
    malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.  
-   **Food Loss and Waste Reduction:**  Globally, eight to ten percent
    of greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to food loss and waste. 
    USAID announced it intends to invest $60 million over five years in
    new research awards that will contribute critical solutions to
    reduce food loss and waste.  This includes a $25 million award with
    an additional $15 million in potential funding to Tufts University
    to lead the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Systems for
    Nutrition. The United States joined the global coalition on food
    loss and waste “Food is Never Waste” and affirmed and strengthened
    its ongoing commitments to reducing food loss and waste
    domestically.  
-   **School Meals Coalition:**  The United States joined the global
    coalition on “School Meals: Nutrition, Health and Education for
    Every Child” to help ensure that every child has access to
    nutritious meals in school by 2030.  The coalition will support
    comprehensive and effective school feeding programs worldwide by
    advocating for multi-sector coordination, stable funding sources,
    and ongoing research to improve program quality and efficiency.   
-   **Climate Smart Agriculture and Forestry (CSAF**):  With its goals
    of sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes;
    adapting and building resilience to climate change; and reducing
    and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions, CSAF can play an important
    role in meeting global goals on food security and climate change
    mitigation and adaptation.  At the Food Systems Summit, the United
    States and the United Arab Emirates continued to advance a global
    initiative – the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for
    Climate) – with the goal of dramatically increasing public and
    private investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems
    innovation.  The number of countries supporting AIM for Climate has
    more than tripled since President Biden previewed it at the Leaders’
    Summit on Climate in April.  In addition, the United States
    announced at the Food Systems Summit, the formation of a global
    coalition “Sustainable Productivity Growth for Food Security and
    Resource Conservation.” The objective of this coalition is to
    accelerate the transition to more sustainable food systems through
    agricultural productivity growth that optimizes agricultural
    sustainability across social, economic, and environmental
    dimensions. To further advance CSAF domestically, the U.S. released
    its CSAF strategy and is enacting a number of conservation programs
    in support of CSAF.     
-   **Gender Responsive Agricultural Systems Policy (GRASP):** A new
    USAID-funded three-and-a-half-year virtual fellowship program for
    female policymakers in Africa  catalyzes policy change that promotes
    gender equality and women’s empowerment in food systems. The GRASP
    Fellowship will support up to 100 female policy makers in Africa
    with networks, mentorship, and targeted leadership and professional
    development opportunities necessary to shape policy that removes
    obstacles to women’s full participation in creating food-secure
    communities.  
-   **Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP):** The United
    States continues to exercise leadership in GAFSP – a $1.7 billion
    multilateral financing mechanism that has helped the world’s poorest
    countries increase investments in agriculture and food security. The
    United States is calling for action by the GAFSP Coordination Unit
    to develop a strategy for systematically integrating climate-related
    considerations into its operations, including through thematic calls
    for proposals as well as robust standards for project design,
    implementation, and measurement of results. This effort will help to
    further strengthen the existing climate focus in the GAFSP
    portfolio.
