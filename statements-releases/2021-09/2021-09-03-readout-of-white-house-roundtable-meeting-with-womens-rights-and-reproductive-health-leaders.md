  \ Health\_Leaders"

Today, Gender Policy Council Co-Chairs Jennifer Klein and Julissa
Reynoso, White House Counsel Dana Remus and Deputy White House Counsel
Danielle Conley, Director of the Office of Political Strategy and
Outreach Emmy Ruiz, and Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council
Christen Linke Young hosted a roundtable with women’s rights
and reproductive health leaders to discuss the Supreme Court’s ruling on
Texas’ SB8.  The meeting followed the unprecedented assault on
constitutional rights under *Roe v. Wade* and underscored the
President’s commitment to ensuring that every person in this country has
access to reproductive health care.  President Biden made clear in [his
statement earlier this
week](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-texas-law-sb8/)
that this law will significantly impair access to care, particularly for
communities of color and individuals with low incomes and Vice President
Harris reiterated in [her
statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/02/statement-by-vice-president-kamala-harris-on-supreme-court-ruling-on-texas-law-sb8/)
the Administration’s commitment to use every lever to defend that right
to safe and legal abortion and to strengthen that right.

During the meeting, women’s rights leaders shared the impact of the
ruling—what Fatima Goss Graves, President and CEO of the National
Women’s Law Center, called “a legal and public health emergency”—on
those directly impacted in local communities across the state of Texas. 
Leaders shared recommendations for steps the federal government can take
to ensure that all people in the U.S., including in Texas, have access
to safe and legal abortions as protected by *Roe* and highlighted
connections to racial equity, gender-based violence, and the maternal
health crisis in the U.S.   

Senior White House officials expressed gratitude for the leadership and
advocacy of the reproductive health and rights community, especially
during a time where women’s health is under attack in states across the
country.  National leaders support an ecosystem of local affiliates,
providers, and community-based organizations—many led by women of
color—on the frontlines of protecting reproductive rights and health.

White House officials also underscored the Biden-Harris Administration’s
urgent commitment to protecting and advancing reproductive health and
rights, as exemplified by the launch of a whole-of-government effort—led
by the Gender Policy Council and Office of the White House Counsel—to
respond to the law.  Earlier this week, the President tasked the
Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department to
explore what steps the federal government can take to ensure access to
safe and legal abortion.  These efforts build on the President’s earlier
commitments to a [government-wide approach to advancing gender equity
and equality, including women’s reproductive health
care](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/).
