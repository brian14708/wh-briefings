Yesterday, Vice President Harris spoke to Department of Homeland
Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to receive an update about his
trip to Del Rio. During that call, the Vice President raised her grave
concerns about the mistreatment of Haitian migrants by border patrol
agents on horses, and the need of all CBP agents to treat people with
dignity, humanely and consistent with our laws and our values. Secretary
Mayorkas shared the Vice President’s concern and noted that he looks
forward to updating her on the investigation by the Office of
Professional Responsibility once it concludes. Secretary Mayorkas also
spoke with the Vice President about the efforts DHS has underway to
address the humanitarian needs of people at our border in Del Rio
through the provision of food, shelter, clothing, and medical care, as
well as engagement with non-governmental and international
organizations.  
   
The Vice President acknowledged the attention and concern Secretary
Mayorkas shared and looks forward to following up with him in the coming
days.
