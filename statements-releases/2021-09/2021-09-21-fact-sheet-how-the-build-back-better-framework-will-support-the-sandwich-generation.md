  Generation"

Too many Americans struggle with the high costs of raising children,
caring for a sick family member, providing long-term care for people
with disabilities or older adults, and addressing the myriad other
caregiving challenges.  These pressures are particularly acute for those
with multiple caregiving responsibilities.  As of 2018, [more than
one-in-ten
parents](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=5a83764d64&e=60572324a0)
([12
percent](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=9d5945f2ad&e=60572324a0),
or [over 8 million
parents](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=a1071cbc6c&e=60572324a0))
had a child under 18 in the home and were providing unpaid care to an
adult, making them part of the “sandwich generation.”  This work is
especially likely to fall on women, as 5 million mothers are part of the
sandwich generation, compared to 3.2 million fathers.  Three-quarters of
these mothers are employed, and more than half work full-time, making
their schedules especially hard-stretched.   
  
These millions of sandwich generation adults are caring for multiple
generations of family members with few or no formal support, leading
them to face difficult, if not impossible, decisions and high economic
costs.    
   
The price of child care has risen sharply, increasing faster than
incomes over the last several decades.  Child care prices increased by
210 percent from 1990 to 2019, while the median family income rose by
143 percent during the same period.  Research suggests that lower-income
families experience these cost pressures more than higher-income
families, which means that basic goods and services, including child
care, cut into family budgets more today than in the past. In turn, only
57 percent of children under six years old have parents who report that
there are good options for child care where they live. And the United
States is one of the only countries in the world that does not guarantee
paid leave – [95 percent of the lowest wage
workers](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=dffa7feb5a&e=60572324a0),
who are
[predominately women ](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=3775d66f30&e=60572324a0)and [workers

color](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=5e92f3c18b&e=60572324a0),
lack any access to paid family and medical leave. Still, the United
States invests fewer public dollars in early childhood education and
care relative to gross domestic product (GDP) than almost all developed
countries – ranking 35th out of 37 countries tracked by OECD.  
   
The need for high-quality, accessible, and affordable elder care is also
increasing. [By
2060](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=7303fa256b&e=60572324a0),
there will be nearly 95 million adults over the age of 65, which is
almost twice the number of adults over the age of 65 in 2016.  People
age 65 today are estimated to have an almost 70 percent chance of
needing some type of long-term care services in their remaining years,
and 20 percent will need care for five or more years.  
   
Meanwhile, there are not enough care workers to provide the care that is
needed, in part because care jobs are often not family-sustaining jobs,
making it challenging to recruit and retain a high-skilled workforce.
Child care workers are among the most underpaid workers – the average
pay is only $24,320 a year and nearly half of child care workers rely on
public assistance. With low pay, child care workers turn over frequently
– national estimates suggest that [26 to 40
percent](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=4c4964e1e1&e=60572324a0)
of the workforce leave their job each year.  Similarly, home care
workers are extremely underpaid and [40 to 60
percent](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=edc52c6ff2&e=60572324a0)
of home care workers turn over each year – high levels of churn even
relative to [other low-wage
jobs](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=6265a061ee&e=60572324a0).
An analysis conducted
in [2017](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=dce8e6be90&e=60572324a0) estimates
that there will be a national shortage of 151,000 direct care workers by
2030 and 355,000 workers by 2040.  
   
Limited access to high-quality care leaves many Americans to fill the
gap in professional caregiving by providing unpaid care to their loved
ones.  The disproportionate caregiving burden that women bear makes them
more likely to reduce working hours, choose lower-paying jobs, or leave
the labor force entirely, all of which contribute to the gender wage gap
and reduce family economic security.  
   
To keep the middle-class in reach for millions of Americans and
strengthen our economic security, we need to address our caregiving
crisis. President Biden’s Build Back Better plan will lower costs both
for families with young children and households with elderly members –
and for millions of sandwich generation adults.  
   
The President’s Build Back Better plan:  
 

-   **Expands Access to Long-Term Care Services under Medicaid.**
    Families feel the financial impact of caring for aging relatives and
    family members with disabilities, and there is a financial strain
    for people with disabilities living independently to ensure that
    they are getting care in their homes. At the same time, hundreds of
    thousands of people who need better care are unable to access it,
    even though they qualify under Medicaid. Aging relatives and people
    with disabilities deserve high-quality care that meets their unique
    needs and personal choices. President Biden is calling on Congress
    to invest billions toward expanding access to quality, affordable
    home- or community-based services (HCBS).
-   **Cuts costs of child care by more than half for most American
    families. ** The President’s plan also enables families to access
    more convenient, higher quality care where workers receive a better
    wage and benefits.  It fully covers the cost of high-quality child
    care for young children for the most hard-pressed working families,
    and ensures that families earning up to 1.5 times their state’s
    median income will pay no more than seven percent of their income
    for high-quality child care for all children under age five.  In
    addition to reducing the cost of child care and freeing up money for
    other spending, providing access to affordable, high-quality child
    care also increases parents’ incomes, as they continue working and
    earn more over time.
-   **Offers universal free preschool to all three- and four-year old
    children.** Only about one-fifth of all preschool aged children are
    enrolled in a preschool program, and free preschool will help offset
    the costs of child care that families face or help parents providing
    unpaid caregiving to go back to work. The President is calling for a
    national-state partnership that offers preschool to all families in
    the setting of their choice – whether in a school, Head Start, or
    child care setting. These investments will especially benefit
    low-income families and families of color, whose children are [less
    likely](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=5ef41c8ab8&e=60572324a0)
    to be enrolled in preschool.
-   **Lowers Seniors’ Health Care Costs.**  The Build Back Better plan
    would reduce health insurance premiums, saving 9 million people an
    average of $50 per person per month, and add dental, vision, and
    hearing coverage to Medicare.  By closing the Medicaid coverage gap
    for low-income Americans, the President’s plan would help 4 million
    people gain coverage. President Biden’s plan will lower prescription
    drug costs for Americans by letting Medicare negotiate drug prices,
    so consumers are no longer at the whim of pharmaceutical companies. 
    Lowering these costs will help reduce the burdens families face.
    Take, for example, a family in Arizona with two parents who together
    earn $85,000 per year and care for an elderly parent who needs
    arthritis medicine, which costs $5,500 per year out-of-pocket, and
    an eye exam to get a new pair of glasses.  Prescription drug reform
    like that outlined in the Build Back Better plan would cap
    out-of-pocket costs for the elderly parent’s prescription drugs,
    saving the family $2,400 per year, while new vision benefits under
    Medicare would pay for the elderly parent’s eye exam and new glasses
    and lenses.
-   **Creates a National Comprehensive Paid Family and Medical Leave
    Program. ** The program will ensure workers receive partial wage
    replacement to take time to bond with a new child; care for a
    seriously ill loved one; deal with a loved one’s military
    deployment; find safety from sexual assault, stalking, or domestic
    violence; heal from their own serious illness; or take time to deal
    with the death of a loved one.  This program guarantees twelve weeks
    of annual paid parental, family, and personal illness/safe leave,
    and also ensures workers get three days of bereavement leave per
    year, by year 10.  The program will provide workers up to $4,000 a
    month, with a minimum of two-thirds of average weekly wages
    replaced, rising to 80 percent for the lowest wage workers.  A study
    of California’s paid leave program, which began in 2004, indicated
    that paid leave also helped to reduce nursing-home utilization:
    About one in ten person-years spent in nursing homes were prevented
    by paid leave, likely because the policy gave workers sufficient
    flexibility to provide informal care to family members on the side.
-   **Boosts compensation of child care and home care workers.** The
    President’s plan would ensure child care and preschool teachers are
    paid a living wage, one that is comparable to kindergarten teachers
    if they have similar credentials. The President’s plan to expand
    HCBS under Medicaid will support well-paying caregiving jobs that
    include benefits and the ability to collectively bargain. Investment
    in higher labor standards for care workers improves these jobs and
    attracts more workers to the care industry.
-   **Significantly Expands the Child Tax Credit.**  The Build Back
    Better plan increases the amount of the credit from $2,000 per child
    to $3,000 per child six-years-old and above, and from $2000 to
    $3,600 per child for children under six.  It also makes 17-year-olds
    eligible for the first time, and makes the credit fully refundable
    on a permanent basis, so that low-income families—the families that
    need the credit the most—can benefit from the full tax credit.  For
    a family with two parents who earn a combined $100,000 per year and
    have two children under six, the Child Tax Credit expansion means
    the family’s credit would go from $4,000 total to $7,200 total, an
    additional $3,200 per year in tax relief.  For a family with two
    parents who earn a combined $24,000 per year and have two children
    under six, the expansion means even more; they would see roughly
    $4,400 in additional tax relief because the full credit was not
    previously available to them.

**Provides low- and middle-income families a tax cut based on care
expenses. ** Families would receive a tax credit for up to half of their
expenses related to caring for a child under age 13 or a loved one with
disabilities.  This would extend the dramatic expansion of the Child and
Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) enacted in the American Rescue Plan. 
With this expanded credit, families earning $125,000 can receive up to a
total of $4,000 for one dependent or $8,000 for two or more.  And
families earning up to $400,000 would get at least as generous of a
credit as they receive today.
