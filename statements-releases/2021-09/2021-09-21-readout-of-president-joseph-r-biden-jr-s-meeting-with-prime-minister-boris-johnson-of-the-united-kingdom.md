President Biden met today with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the
United Kingdom at the White House. This meeting reaffirmed the strong
bond between the United States and the United Kingdom, as the leaders
agreed to continue working together to fulfill the vision set forward in
the Atlantic Charter. President Biden and Prime Minister Johnson
reviewed our cooperation on shared global challenges, including building
consensus for action to address the climate crisis, promoting global
health security, supporting democracy and human rights, and developing a
more inclusive economic future for all countries. The leaders also
discussed our ongoing work on Afghanistan, as well as developments in
the Indo-Pacific and the critical role of European allies and partners,
including NATO and the EU, in the region. They also discussed Northern
Ireland, and President Biden reiterated his longstanding support for a
secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a
voice and enjoy the gains of the hard-won peace.
