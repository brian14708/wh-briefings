title: "Quad Principles on Technology Design, Development, Governance, and\_Use"
---
 
The Quad countries (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States of
America) affirm that the ways in which technology is designed,
developed, governed, and used should be shaped by our shared democratic
values and respect for universal human rights. Technology should make
the lives of our citizens more secure, prosperous, and rewarding,
addressing some of the world’s greatest shared challenges, like
equitable growth, climate change, energy security, and pandemic
diseases. We are committed to fostering an open, accessible, and secure
technology ecosystem, based on mutual trust and confidence, and we
welcome all nations to support the following principles:  
  
**Support** **universal values.**

-   We are committed to the development of critical and emerging
    technology that yields tangible benefits for society, developed
    through a multi-stakeholder approach that is adaptive, dynamic, and
    aligns with universal values, including respect for freedom of
    expression and privacy.  
-   We support approaches to technological design, development,
    governance, and usage that promote our shared values, including the
    autonomy, agency, and dignity of individuals.    
-   The design, development, governance, and use of technology should be
    an equitable and inclusive process that neither involves nor results
    in unfair discriminatory action.  
-   Technology should not be misused or abused for malicious activities
    such as authoritarian surveillance and oppression, for terrorist
    purposes, or to disseminate disinformation.

**Build trust, integrity, and resilience.**

-   Technology ecosystems built upon trust, integrity, and resilience
    foster innovation.  
-   We support openness and interoperability to enable collaboration and
    to welcome innovators who are both diverse in their gender, race,
    and ethnicity, as well as in the size, structure, and age of their
    organizations.  
-   We expect technology suppliers, vendors, and distributors to produce
    and maintain secure systems, and to be trustworthy, transparent, and
    accountable in their practices. Technology developers should also
    build in safety and security-by-design approaches so that robust
    safety and security practices are a part of the technology
    development process. Illicit transfer or theft of technology is a
    common challenge that undermines the very foundation of global
    technological development and should be addressed.  
-   Resilient, diverse, and secure technology supply chains – for
    hardware, software, and services – are vital to our shared national
    interests. Close cooperation on supply chains with allies and
    partners who share our values will enhance our security and
    prosperity, and strengthen our capacity to respond to international
    disasters and emergencies.

**Foster healthy competition and international collaboration to advance
the frontier of science and technology.**

-   A fair and open marketplace is a cornerstone of innovation and
    inclusive prosperity.  
-   We support free and fair market competition in which the best
    technical solutions succeed, including with the help of
    transparently-awarded state incentives.  
-   We encourage the development of competitive technology ecosystems
    that welcome new market entrants, including start-ups, and enhance
    innovation, resilience, and sustainability.  
-   We recognize and affirm the importance of industry-led,
    consensus-based multi-stakeholder approaches to international
    standards development that foster interoperability, compatibility,
    and inclusiveness.  
-   We are committed to reducing barriers to data and knowledge sharing
    for research projects and greater innovation, while protecting
    research security.  
-   We are also committed to facilitating the exchange of researchers
    and movement of highly skilled personnel to enhance science and
    technology collaboration.  
-   We are committed to developing shared research and development
    agendas, to include joint projects and joint capacity building where
    possible, that align with foundational scientific principles,
    further our common values, and promote workforce diversity and
    education.  
-   Together, we will continue to keep pace with changes in the global
    economy and innovation processes by monitoring future trends and
    harnessing the opportunities to advance technologies to address many
    of our shared objectives: security and resilience, sustainability,
    economic inclusion, and health and wellbeing.  
-   We are committed to fostering technology development that
    accelerates economic progress and serves the needs of all of our
    citizens.

We welcome all nations to join us in pursuit of this shared vision for
technologies, guided by these principles.
