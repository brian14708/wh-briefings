National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with Bogdan Aurescu,
Romanian Foreign Minister and National Security Advisor to the
President. Mr. Sullivan congratulated him on the 10<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the Joint Statement on the U.S.-Romania Strategic
Partnership and of our missile defense agreement. He also expressed
condolences for the Romanian sailor killed in the Iranian attack on the
commercial ship *MVMercer Street* on July 29. Mr. Sullivan underscored
how our cooperation bilaterally and through the Bucharest Nine (B9)
group of Eastern Flank NATO Allies contributes to regional and
Transatlantic security, strengthens NATO’s defense and deterrence
capabilities, and builds resilience against foreign provocations and
harmful influence from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea regions.  Mr.
Sullivan thanked Foreign Minister Aurescu for Romania’s leadership in
the digital and energy spheres, and looked forward to the
operationalization of our Intergovernmental Agreement on civil nuclear
cooperation.  He further noted that Romania’s efforts to protect its
critical infrastructure serve as an example for Central Europe and the
Black Sea region.
