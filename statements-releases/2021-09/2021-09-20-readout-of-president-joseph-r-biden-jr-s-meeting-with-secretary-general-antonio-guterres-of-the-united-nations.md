partnership between the United States and the United Nations which, in
particular, is based on common values that include respect for universal
human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law. They
discussed the importance of multilateralism and the defense of democracy
and the rules-based international order, which is anchored by the United
Nations, as critical to addressing today’s greatest challenges.
Specifically, they spoke of the urgency to work together, along with
Member States of the United Nations, to end the COVID-19 pandemic,
prepare for future health security threats, combat climate change,
strengthen food systems and food security, address humanitarian needs,
prevent and mitigate conflict, and promote and defend human rights
worldwide. The President reaffirmed that complex, global challenges can
only be addressed by genuinely global solutions, an approach reflected
in the President’s vision of building back better, and he emphasized the
unique role of the United Nations in delivering prosperity, peace and
security for everyone.
