title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Supreme Court Ruling on Texas\
  \ Law\_SB8"
---
 
Last night, the Supreme Court threatened nearly 50 years of legal
precedent, dealing a significant blow to *Roe v. Wade* and the right of
women to make decisions about their own bodies. Without a hearing or due
consideration, the majority of justices effectively allowed a bounty law
to go into effect in Texas, and an abortion ban after about six weeks of
pregnancy even in cases of rape or incest.

This decision is not the last word on *Roe v. Wade,* and we will not
stand by and allow our nation to go back to the days of back-alley
abortions. We will not abide by cash incentives for virtual vigilantes
and intimidation for patients. We will use every lever of our
Administration to defend the right to safe and legal abortionâ€”and to
strengthen that right.
