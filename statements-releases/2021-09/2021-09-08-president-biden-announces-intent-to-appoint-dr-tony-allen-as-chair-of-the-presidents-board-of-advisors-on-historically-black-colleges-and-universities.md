WASHINGTON — Today, President Biden announced his intent to appoint Dr.
Tony Allen as the Chair of the President’s Board of Advisors on
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  
   
The Board will advance the goal of the [HBCU
Initiative](https://thehilltoponline.com/2021/09/03/exclusive-biden-harris-administration-announces-white-house-initiative-targeting-hbcus/),
established by the Carter Administration, to increase the capacity of
HBCUs to provide the highest-quality education to its students and
continue serving as engines of opportunity.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting the vital
mission of HBCUs.  Through the American Rescue Plan and by forgiving
capital improvement debt of many these institutions, the Biden-Harris
Administration has already committed more than $4 billion in support. 
[Reestablishing the White House HBCU
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/03/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-through-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/)
– and placing strong leadership at the head of the Board – will allow
the administration to build on that financial commitment with continued
institutional support.

</span>   
Tony Allen became President of Delaware State University in January
2020, after serving as Provost and Executive Vice President since July
2017.   Prior to joining the university, he brought a diverse background
in the private and nonprofit sectors.   He was the Managing Director of
Corporate Reputation at Bank of America; co-founded the Metropolitan
Wilmington Urban League and Public Allies Delaware; and led Delaware’s
K12 public education reform effort from 2014 – 2019.  
   
Allen’s tenure has largely been through the pandemic, but he and his
team have built a strong portfolio of accomplishments focused on student
success.  The university has seen its elevation to the \#3 public HBCU
in America (US News), an R2 “high research activity” designation, and
the historic acquisition of nearby Wesley College. The university’s
“Together” COVID-19 plan has been touted as a national example of campus
safety strategy, and a year into the pandemic enrollment has shattered
all previous records.  
   
Allen has drawn national attention to Delaware State University through
successful fundraising ($40 million in 2020) and national appearances on
major media platforms including ABC World News Tonight, CNN, the Black
News Channel, and many others.  He also served as the chief executive
officer of the 59th Presidential Inaugural Ceremonies.  
   
He is Chairman Emeritus of the National Urban Fellows and a Whitney
Young Awardee for Advancing Racial Equality, the National Urban League’s
highest honor.  Currently, he serves on the boards of Graham Holdings
and Pepco Holdings and on the Economic and Community Advisory Council
for the Philadelphia Federal Reserve.  
   
Allen holds a Ph.D. in Public Policy from the University of Delaware.
