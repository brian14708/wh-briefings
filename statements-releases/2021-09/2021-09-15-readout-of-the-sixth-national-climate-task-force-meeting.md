*On the heels of the President’s recent travel, the National Climate
Task Force discussed delivering on President Biden’s Build Back Better
Agenda*

Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the sixth
National Climate Task Force meeting where she was joined by Cabinet
members and senior leadership from across the federal government. The
Climate Task Force discussed the President’s recent travel to New York,
New Jersey, Idaho, California, and Colorado, which demonstrates the
mounting costs of the climate crisis. The Task Force discussed the
widespread impact of the crisis — affecting 1 in 3 Americans across the
country in recent months. There was discussion about the President’s
continued focus on marshaling an all-of-government approach to helping
communities prepare, respond, and recover from disaster.  
  
This meeting follows a series of extreme weather disasters. From
hurricanes in the gulf coast, storms slamming the eastern seaboard,
wildfires tearing through the west, to droughts and heat waves
devastating farmers and ranchers, these disasters demonstrate the urgent
need for the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and Build Back
Better Agenda to help strengthen our nation’s resilience to climate
change, create good-paying, union jobs, and grow the economy. Today, the
Task Force advanced the President’s call by discussing additional ways
in which to align the President’s priorities across every federal agency
in a way that creates good jobs, lowers costs for consumers and
businesses, advances environmental justice, and makes America a leader
in new industries.  
  
As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 [Executive Order on Tackling
the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/),
