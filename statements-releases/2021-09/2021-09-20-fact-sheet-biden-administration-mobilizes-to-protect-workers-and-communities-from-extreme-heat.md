*New Initiatives at OSHA and Across Agencies Will Enhance Workplace
Safety, Build Local Resilience, and Address Disproportionate Heat
Impacts*

Today, President Biden is launching a coordinated, interagency effort to
respond to extreme heat that threatens the lives and livelihoods of
Americans, especially workers, children, and seniors. While
climate-related disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods produce
dramatic images of devastation, extreme heat often takes place out of
sight and out of the news. But heat is the nation’s leading
weather-related killer.  
   
The United States experienced a dangerously hot summer this year,
[breaking
records](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/national-climate-202108) last
set during the Dust Bowl. The climate crisis is making heat waves more
intense and frequent – endangering workers and communities. During the
June 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, states reported hundreds
of excess deaths and thousands of emergency room visits for heat-related
illness. Climate scientists have concluded that this heat wave would
have been [virtually
impossible](https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/)
without climate change. Millions of U.S. workers are exposed to heat in
their workplaces, and essential jobs with high exposure levels are
disproportionately held by Black and Brown workers. Heat also poses
higher risks in urban centers and to children, seniors, economically
disadvantaged groups, and those with underlying health conditions.   
   
Recognizing the seriousness of this threat, the Biden Administration is
taking immediate action on heat hazards to protect workers and
communities as part of a broader commitment to workplace safety, climate
resilience, and environmental justice. The Departments of Labor, Health
and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Agriculture; the
Environmental Protection Agency; and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration are announcing a set of actions that will
reduce heat-related illness, protect public health, and support the
economy:

-   The Department of Labor is launching a multi-prong initiative on
    occupational heat exposure to protect outdoor workers, including
    agricultural, construction, and delivery workers, as well as indoor
    workers, including those in warehouses, factories, and kitchens.  
-   Other new and recent agency actions will provide cooling assistance
    to households; use schools as cooling centers; launch a heat
    resilience innovation challenge; address social vulnerabilities and
    disproportionate impacts; reduce urban heat through tree cover; and
    improve local preparedness through data-sharing.  
-   The Biden Administration’s Interagency Working Group on Extreme Heat
    will continue to coordinate a holistic response.

These actions would also supplement President’s Build Back Better
Agenda, which includes historic funding levels to support resilient
communities and improve the assessment and mitigation of climate-related
impacts like extreme heat.  
  
Specifically, the Biden Administration is announcing a
whole-of-government approach to address extreme heat by:  
  
**Developing Workplace Heat Standards and Increasing Enforcement**  
The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) is responsible for setting and enforcing standards to ensure
safe, healthy working conditions. Heat is a growing workplace hazard,
with the climate crisis making extreme heat more frequent and severe.
Workers in agriculture and construction are often at highest risk, but
the problem affects all workers exposed to heat, including indoor
workers without climate-controlled environments. Too often, heat-induced
injuries and illnesses are misclassified or not reported, especially in
sectors that employ vulnerable and undocumented workers.  
  
To better protect heat-exposed workers, OSHA is:

-   **Launching a rulemaking process to develop a workplace heat
    standard:** OSHA is announcing today the issuance of an Advance
    Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on heat illness prevention in
    outdoor and indoor work settings. This is a significant step toward
    a federal heat standard to ensure protections in workplaces across
    the country. The ANPRM, which will be published next month in the
    Federal Register, will initiate a comment period allowing for OSHA
    to gather diverse perspectives and technical expertise on topics
    including heat stress thresholds, heat acclimatization planning, and
    exposure monitoring.   
-   **Implementing an enforcement initiative on heat-related hazards:**
    In parallel with beginning rulemaking on a heat-specific standard,
    OSHA can use existing tools to protect workers in hazardously hot
    indoor and outdoor settings. Through a new enforcement initiative,
    OSHA will prioritize heat-related interventions and workplace
    inspections on days when the heat index exceeds 80°F. On these days,
    OSHA Area Directors will dedicate additional resources in responding
    to heat-related complaints and expand the scope of programmed and
    unprogrammed inspections to address heat-related hazards. In
    addition to shaping the focus of OSHA field staff, this initiative
    also will expand on OSHA’s campaign to educate and assist employers
    on heat illness prevention.  
-   **Developing a National Emphasis Program on heat inspections:** OSHA
    is also working to formalize a National Emphasis Program (NEP) on
    heat hazard cases, which will target high-risk industries and focus
    OSHA resources and staff time on heat inspections. Establishing a
    new NEP requires extensive data review, which OSHA is working to
    complete in order for the NEP to take effect before the Summer 2022
    heat season. In doing so, OSHA will build on the existing Regional
    Emphasis Program for Heat Illnesses in Region VI, which covers
    Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.
-   **Forming a heat work group to engage stakeholders and inform
    ongoing efforts:** Within OSHA’s National Advisory Committee on
    Occupational Safety and Health (NACOSH), OSHA is forming a Heat
    Illness Prevention Work Group to provide better understanding of
    challenges and best practices in protecting workers from heat
    hazards. This group will include three members of the full NACOSH—a
    public representative, labor representative, and management
    representative—as well as new members from a range of sectors and
    industries. OSHA will convene periodic meetings of the work group to
    provide diverse perspectives on topics including identification,
    monitoring, and response to workplace heat hazards; heat emergency
    response plans; and worker training and engagement.

**Providing Cooling Assistance to Households and Communities**  
Beyond the workplace, extreme heat also threatens Americans in our homes
and neighborhoods.  For households that lack air conditioning
altogether, have inadequate equipment, or cannot afford the energy costs
of running their units, extreme heat conditions can pose severe risks of
health impacts. Greater access to in-home air conditioning and to public
cooling centers will address systemic injustices, improve quality of
life, and prevent illness and death.  
  
The Biden Administration is providing ongoing support to expand this
access, including by:

-   **Directing LIHEAP Resources to Cooling Programs:** The Department
    of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently issued
    [guidance](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-im-2021-01-heat-stress-flexibilities-and-resources)
    for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) that
    provides flexible options for states, territories, Tribes, and
    Tribal organizations to adjust their LIHEAP programs to address
    extreme heat. LIHEAP provides grants to these governments to assist
    low-income households with meeting their home energy needs. Through
    these flexibilities, grantees can expand their programs to allow for
    the purchase of air conditioning units; increase cooling assistance
    payments for electric bills; establish cooling centers; conduct
    targeted outreach to ensure at-risk households are in a safe
    temperature environment; and pursue a range of other options to
    respond to extreme heat.  
-   **Using Schools as Cooling Centers:** The Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) is leveraging American Rescue Plan funding to provide
    technical assistance for the development of neighborhood cooling
    centers within existing public school facilities. This specialized
    support will help align broader investments in healthy schools with
    needs for cooling centers in vulnerable communities. EPA has issued
    a call for letters of interest from state agencies, school
    districts, and community-based organizations, with recipients to be
    selected in October and projects to begin in early 2022. 

**Launching an Innovation Challenge on Heat Protection**  
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is launching a series of prize
competitions focused on strengthening our nation’s resilience to climate
change. The first competition in this series will focus on new ways to
protect people at risk of heat-related illness or death during extreme
heat events or in connection with other disasters. Through this
competition, DHS aims to motivate American talent and creativity toward
innovations that will save lives and make our nation fundamentally more
resilient to heat.  
  
**Identifying and Addressing Disproportionate Heat Impacts**  
Extreme heat poses threats to communities across the country—but some
communities are more at risk because of longstanding economic and racial
injustices and ongoing vulnerabilities. Black, Indigenous, and other
people of color, as well as people with low incomes, are more likely to
live in areas with intensifying heat impacts and often have less access
to air conditioning and other risk-reduction resources. Cities also face
higher impacts due to the [“urban heat island”
effect](https://www.epa.gov/heatislands), referring to elevated
temperatures from the prevalence of surfaces that retain heat. This
effect can be more severe in neighborhoods affected by redlining and
other forms of institutionalized discrimination, as these areas often
have lower tree cover and higher pavement concentration.   
  
The Biden Administration is working to develop better understandings of
disproportionate heat impacts and promote targeted solutions for
disadvantaged communities, including through two new resources:

-   **New EPA Analysis of Heat Impacts on Socially Vulnerable Groups:**
    This month, EPA released a report on “[Climate Change and Social
    Vulnerability in the United
    States](https://www.epa.gov/cira/social-vulnerability-report)” which
    confirms that climate-driven changes in extreme temperatures
    disproportionately impact groups that are socially vulnerable based
    on income, educational attainment, race and ethnicity, and age. In
    the 49 cities analyzed, increases in high-temperature days are
    projected to cause premature deaths, and Black individuals are
    40-59% more likely than non-Black individuals to currently live in
    high-impact areas. The report also includes projections of lost
    labor hours due to high temperatures, finding that people of color
    and low-income individuals are more likely to live in areas that
    will be most disrupted.  
-   **Forest Service Guide on Using Tree Cover to Address Urban Heat:**
    The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service recently issued
    a report on “[Climate Adaptation Actions for Urban Forests and Human
    Health](https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/gtr/gtr_nrs203.pdf),” which
    includes a menu of tangible, neighborhood-level options for using
    urban tree, forest, and greening projects to reduce extreme
    temperatures and heat exposure. In addition to addressing heat
    hazards, the actions presented can provide additional public health
    benefits by improving air quality, enhancing storm resilience, and
    promoting mental health and social cohesion. The guide also provides
    local governments with guidance on prioritizing the needs of
    disadvantaged communities and vulnerable populations. 

**Improving Local Preparedness through Data Sharing and Technical
Assistance**  
Responding to extreme heat requires action at all levels of government,
and demand for science-based information is growing. The Biden
Administration is committed to partnering with local officials to
provide and enhance data, research, and planning tools on extreme heat
and health impacts.  
  
New and ongoing data collaboration efforts of the Biden Administration
include:

-   **The National Integrated Heat Health Information System** (NIHHIS),
    jointly developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA), convenes federal agencies and local partners
    to develop science-based products and services to improve our
    national heat response. Today, the NIHHIS is announcing plans for an
    April 2022 National Meeting to bring together scientists and
    decision makers working to reduce the health risks of heat and
    enhance resilience of communities on multiple time scales.  
-   **The CDC’s Heat and Health Tracker**, which provides heat and
    health data to help communities better prepare for and respond to
    extreme heat events, will issue an update this week to provide a
    nationwide heat forecast for October 2021. The forecast will include
    the expected number of days at or above a dangerous level of heat,
    based on climatological norms. This county-level information will
    help health departments and emergency planners identify the needs of
    vulnerable populations and take appropriate public health action.
-   **The Interagency Working Group on Extreme Heat**, formed by the
    White House Climate Policy Office in July 2021 and co-led by HHS,
    NOAA, and EPA, will continue to regularly convene agencies to
    communicate, coordinate, and improve the federal response to extreme
    heat. These efforts will include facilitating the use of federal
    data sharing and mapping resources to help states, Tribes,
    territories, and local governments improve heat-related planning and
    decision-making. HHS co-leads this group through its recently
    established Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, which works
    to protect communities with disproportionate exposures and
    vulnerabilities to climate-related threats and will engage the
    health workforce in our climate response.

**Calling on Congress to Deliver Build Back Better Investments in
Resilience**  
President Biden will continue to work with Congress to protect
communities across the country from heat hazards. The President’s Build
Back Better Agenda provides historic funding levels to support resilient
communities and improve the assessment and mitigation of climate-related
impacts, including extreme heat. Related investments include $1 billion
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Building Resilient
Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, over $12 billion for
weatherization assistance and residential energy efficiency and
electrification, and $1.2 billion for NOAA research and forecasting.
