title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Supreme Court Ruling on Texas Law\_SB8"
---
 
The Supreme Court’s ruling overnight is an unprecedented assault on a
woman’s constitutional rights under *Roe v. Wade*, which has been the
law of the land for almost fifty years. By allowing a law to go into
effect that empowers private citizens in Texas to sue health care
providers, family members supporting a woman exercising her right to
choose after six weeks, or even a friend who drives her to a hospital or
clinic, it unleashes unconstitutional chaos and empowers self-anointed
enforcers to have devastating impacts. Complete strangers will now be
empowered to inject themselves in the most private and personal health
decisions faced by women. This law is so extreme it does not even allow
for exceptions in the case of rape or incest. And it not only empowers
complete strangers to inject themselves into the most private of
decisions made by a woman—it actually incentivizes them to do so with
the prospect of $10,000 if they win their case. For the majority to do
this without a hearing, without the benefit of an opinion from a court
below, and without due consideration of the issues, insults the rule of
law and the rights of all Americans to seek redress from our courts.
Rather than use its supreme authority to ensure justice could be fairly
sought, the highest Court of our land will allow millions of women in
Texas in need of critical reproductive care to suffer while courts sift
through procedural complexities. The dissents by Chief Justice Roberts,
and Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan all demonstrate the error of
the Court’s action here powerfully.

While the Chief Justice was clear to stress that the action by the
Supreme Court is not a final ruling on the future of *Roe*, the impact
of last night’s decision will be immediate and requires an immediate
response. One reason I became the first president in history to create a
Gender Policy Council was to be prepared to react to such assaults on
women’s rights. Hence, I am directing that Council and the Office of the
White House Counsel to launch a whole-of-government effort to respond to
this decision, looking specifically to the Department of Health and
Human Services and the Department of Justice to see what steps the
Federal Government can take to ensure that women in Texas have access to
safe and legal abortions as protected by *Roe*, and what legal tools we
have to insulate women and providers from the impact of Texas’ bizarre
scheme of outsourced enforcement to private parties.
