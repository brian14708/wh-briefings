***Launch of the joint COVID-19 Manufacturing and Supply Chain
Taskforce***

1.  **Ending the COVID-19 pandemic through global cooperation remains
    our first priority. That cooperation includes efforts toward smooth
    manufacturing and supply chains for COVID-19 vaccines and
    therapeutics.**  
2.  **U.S. and EU supply chains for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics
    are closely intertwined.**
    1.  Critical raw materials, drug substance and finished doses are
        shipped back and forth between the EU and U.S. to enable the
        production and supply of vaccines for the world.
    2.  Over the past months, the U.S. and EU have worked closely
        together to resolve supply chain bottlenecks as part of a
        regular COVID vaccine supply chain dialogue, led by Commissioner
        Thierry Breton and White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator
        Jeff Zients.
    3.  The U.S. the EU have both successfully scaled up production of
        their vaccine portfolios, becoming world leaders in the
        production of mRNA vaccines.
    4.  The U.S. and the EU have made major investments in the global
        production of the COVID-19 vaccine, notably in Africa in
        coordination with the Partnerships for African Vaccine
        Manufacturing (PAVM). The joint support for vaccine production
        in Senegal through the Fondation Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD)
        by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)
        and Team Europe, including the European Investment Bank (EIB)
        and development finance institutions in EU Member States, is an
        important first step to grow the region’s long-term capacity to
        produce vaccines.  
3.  **At the U.S.-EU Summit in June, the U.S. and the EU announced a
    joint COVID-19 Manufacturing and Supply Chain Taskforce to deepen
    cooperation and resolve issues around expanding vaccine and
    therapeutics production capacity.**
    1.  The objective of this Joint Taskforce is to deepen cooperation
        and identify and resolve issues around expanding vaccine and
        therapeutics production capacity, including by building new
        production facilities, maintaining open and secure supply
        chains, avoiding any unnecessary export restrictions, and
        encouraging voluntary sharing of know-how and technology on
        mutually-determined terms including through the ACT-A.  
4.  **This week, the Taskforce met in Washington, D.C., to finalize the
    Mission Statement of this Taskforce, which will focus on the
    following three priority work strands:**
    1.  Monitor global supply chains for COVID-19 vaccines and
        therapeutics through assessment of global demand and supply of
        these items and their production and ancillary supplies, and
        through identification of supply chain bottlenecks:
        1.  The Joint Taskforce intends to support efforts to analyze
            global vaccine and therapeutics demand and supply,
            particularly the joint production capacity for vaccines
            currently authorized in the U.S. and EU.
        2.  The Joint Taskforce intends to support Access to COVID-19
            Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) and COVAX supply chain efforts.
    2.  Address critical supply chain bottlenecks and other disruptive
        factors for global COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics production:
        1.  The Joint Taskforce intends to continue to work closely
            together on critical COVID-19 supply chain issues and
            bottlenecks, including regular status updates on any
            potential import–export issues between the U.S. and EU. 
        2.  The Joint Taskforce intends to engage vaccine and
            therapeutics manufacturers and suppliers to assess supply
            chain bottlenecks and develop a joint approach to supply
            chain monitoring for key vaccine inputs, notably disposables
            and consumables, which are especially constrained globally.
    3.  Coordinate initiatives to boost global production of COVID-19
        vaccines, therapeutics, and their production and ancillary
        supplies:
        1.  The Joint Taskforce intends to promote and align initiatives
            to support additional global manufacturing capacity for
            vaccines, therapeutics and ancillary supplies.
