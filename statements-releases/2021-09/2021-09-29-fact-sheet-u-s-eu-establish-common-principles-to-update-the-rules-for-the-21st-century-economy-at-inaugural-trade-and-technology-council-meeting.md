title: "FACT SHEET: U.S.-EU Establish Common Principles to Update the Rules for the\
  \ 21st Century Economy at Inaugural Trade and Technology Council\_Meeting"
---
 
Launched by President Joe Biden, European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen, and European Council President Charles Michel at the
U.S.-EU Summit in June 2021, the Trade and Technology Council held its
inaugural meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 29, 2021.
U.S. Co-Chairs, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce
Gina Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai,
were joined by EU Co-Chairs European Commission Executive Vice
Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis to establish common
principles to update the rules of the road for a 21st century economy
and deliver for our people.

The United States and the EU are home to 780 million people who share
democratic values and the largest economic relationship in the world. We
will work together to generate shared economic growth that benefits
working families, farmers and ranchers, and businesses with a particular
focus on opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the
meeting, the United States and European Union decided to closely
coordinate on an expansive set of critical economic and technology
issues over the coming months and achieve concrete outcomes by the next
meeting:  

-   **Global trade challenges and addressing non-market, trade
    distortive practices:** The United States and European Union seek to
    strengthen their competitiveness and technological leadership by
    developing common strategies to mitigate the impact of non-market
    practices at home and in third countries and by working to avoid new
    and unnecessary barriers to trade, especially in products and
    services derived from emerging technologies. We also intend to use
    our tools to protect workers and labor rights, combat forced and
    child labor, and consult on relevant trade, climate, and
    environmental issues.

-   **Semiconductor supply chains**: The United States and European
    Union intend to enhance cooperation on measures to advance
    transparency and communication in the semiconductor supply chain and
    identify gaps, shared vulnerabilities, and opportunities to
    strengthen our domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing
    ecosystems with a view to improving resilience in the semiconductor
    supply chain.  
-   **Investment screening:** The United States and European Union
    intend to exchange information on investment trends affecting
    security, including industry specific trends, origin of investments,
    and types of transactions, and on best practices with respect to
    analyzing and addressing risk, with a focus on sensitive
    technologies and related sensitive data.
-   **Export Controls:** The United States and European Union determined
    shared principles and areas for export control cooperation,
    including capacity building assistance to third countries to support
    multilateral export control regimes, prior consultations on current
    and upcoming legislative and regulatory developments, and developing
    convergent control approaches on sensitive dual-use technologies.  
-   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The United States and European
    Union will develop and implement AI systems that are innovative and
    trustworthy and that respect universal human rights and shared
    democratic values, explore cooperation on AI technologies designed
    to enhance privacy protections, and undertake an economic study
    examining the impact of AI on the future of our workforces.

The TTC co-chairs tasked the working groups with developing work plans
to strengthen our cooperation on additional critical areas. This
includes prompting small- and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) access to
digital tools, securing critical supply chains, cooperating on emerging
technology standards, advancing climate and clean tech objectives, data
governance and technology platforms, information and communications
technology security and competitiveness, and the misuse of technology
threatening security and human rights.

In addition, the inaugural TTC included a meeting with a broad range of
stakeholders and we intend to continue robust engagement with a diverse
range of stakeholders, including but not limited to industry, labor
organizations, think tanks, non-profit organizations, environmental
constituencies, academics, and other civil society members.
