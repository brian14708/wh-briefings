title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable Meeting with AA and NHPI Faith\_Leaders"
---
 
Yesterday, Erika Moritsugu, Deputy Assistant to the President and AA and
NHPI Senior Liaison at the White House, Sonal Shah, President of The
Asian American Foundation (TAAF), and the White House Office of Public
Engagement, hosted a virtual meeting with AA and NHPI faith leaders
on hate prevention and AA and NHPI inclusion in the lead up to the
20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of 9/11.

The meeting was part of the Administration’s efforts to hear directly
from leaders at the local and national levels about the work they are
engaged in to combat anti-AA and NHPI hate, pursue racial justice, and
create belonging and inclusion in the AA and NHPI community and
beyond. Representatives of the attending groups shared lessons they’ve
learned in the 20 years since 9/11 about how to prevent hate and bigotry
in their respective communities, and what faith leaders have found to be
effective when it comes to helping their communities heal from acts of
hate and violence. Participants also discussed the importance interfaith
dialogue continues to play in healing divides and bringing people
together during a rise in xenophobic violence and hate. 

Administration officials reiterated the President’s commitment to
fighting hate in all its forms, addressing racial equity gaps in AA and
NHPI and other communities, and working together on the Afghan refugee
resettlement effort and other humanitarian initiatives. The
Administration also committed to continued engagement and partnership
with these groups.
