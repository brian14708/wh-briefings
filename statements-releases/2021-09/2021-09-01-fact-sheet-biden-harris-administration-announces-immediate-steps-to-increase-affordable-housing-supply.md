*Immediate Steps Supplement the Biden-Harris Administration’s Push for
Historic, Long-Term Investments in New Housing as Part of the Build Back
Better Agenda*

Since President Biden took office, the economy has created more than 4
million jobs, with an average of more than 830,000 new jobs over the
last three months. In the first half of the year, the economy grew at
the fastest rate seen in nearly 40 years.

This economic progress has enabled millions of American homeowners and
renters to get back on track. In the second quarter of 2021, the
mortgage delinquency rate on single-family mortgages fell to below [5.5
percent](https://www.mba.org/2021-press-releases/august/mortgage-delinquencies-decrease-in-the-second-quarter-of-2021)
– from a pandemic high of more than 8 percent. The percentage of renter
households behind on rent has also fallen from 19.4 percent to 15.4
since the beginning of this year.

While the Administration continues to do everything in its power to
stabilize families who are at risk of losing their homes because of the
economic impact of the pandemic, we still have more work to do.
President Biden and Vice President Harris believe we need to do more
than build back to the way things were before. We need to build back
better.

While Congress works toward passing the Build Back Better Agenda, which
includes an historic investment in building new homes and making
existing housing safer, healthier, and more energy efficient, the
President knows that we can’t wait to take action. The large and
long-standing gap between the supply and demand of affordable homes for
both renters and homeowners makes it harder for families to buy their
first home and drives up the cost of rent. Higher housing costs also
crowd out other investments families can and should make to improve
their lives, such as investments in education.

As supply constraints have intensified, large investors have stepped up
their real estate purchases, including of single-family homes in urban
and suburban areas. [One out of every six
homes](https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-q2-2021/)
purchased in the second quarter of 2021 was acquired by investors, and
reports indicate that in some markets, that number is one in four.
Within investor purchases, typically [more than 35
percent](https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/special-report-investor-home-buying/)
of purchases are made by investors that own more than ten properties.
Large investor purchases of single-family homes and conversion into
rental properties speeds the transition of neighborhoods from
homeownership to rental and drives up home prices for lower cost homes,
making it harder for aspiring first-time and first-generation home
buyers, among others, to buy a home. At the same, these purchases are
unlikely to meaningfully boost supply in the lower-cost portions of the
rental market, as investors charge more for rent to recoup higher
purchase costs.

President Biden is committed to using every tool available in government
to produce more affordable housing supply as quickly as possible, and to
make supply available to families in need of affordable, quality housing
– rather than to large investors. **That’s why today the Administration
is announcing a number of steps that will create, preserve, and sell to
homeowners and non-profits nearly 100,000 additional affordable homes
for homeowners and renters over the next three years, with an emphasis
on the lower and middle segments of the market.**  

Specifically, federal agencies will:

-   **Boost the supply of quality, affordable rental units** by
    relaunching the partnership between the Department of Treasury’s
    (Treasury) Federal Financing Bank and the Department of Housing and
    Urban Development (HUD) Risk Sharing Program in order to enable
    eligible state housing finance agencies (HFAs) to provide low-cost
    capital for affordable housing development; raising Fannie Mae’s and
    Freddie Mac’s (the Enterprises) equity cap for the Low-Income
    Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), the largest federal program for the
    construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing; and
    making more funding available to Community Development Finance
    Institutions (CDFIs) and non-profit housing groups for affordable
    housing production under the Capital Magnet Fund.  
-   **Boost the supply of manufactured housing and 2-4 unit properties**
    by expanding financing through Freddie Mac. Along with Fannie Mae’s
    and the Federal Housing Administration’s (FHA) existing policies,
    these steps will enable more Americans to purchase homes, and
    increase the availability of rental units throughout the country.  
-   **Make more single-family homes available to individuals, families,
    and non-profit organizations – rather than large investors –** by
    prioritizing homeownership and limiting the sale to large investors
    of certain FHA-insured and HUD-owned properties, in addition to
    expanding and creating exclusivity periods in which only
    governmental entities, owner occupants, and qualified non-profit
    organizations are able to bid on certain FHA-insured and
    government-owned properties.  
-   **Work with state and local governments to boost housing supply** by
    leveraging existing federal funds to spur local action, exploring
    federal levers to help states and local governments reduce
    exclusionary zoning, and launching learning and listening sessions
    with local leaders.

***Boosting the Supply of Quality, Affordable Rental Units  
***  
Even before the pandemic, 11 million families – or nearly a quarter of
renters – paid more than half of their income on rent. President Biden
believes this is unacceptable. Rent should be affordable for working
families. That’s why the President’s Build Back Better Agenda calls for
the historic investments that will enable the construction and
rehabilitation of more than a million affordable housing units, reducing
the burden of rent on American families. From the expansion of the
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) to major investments in the HOME
Investment Partnerships program, the Housing Trust Fund, and the Capital
Magnet Fund, the Build Back Better Agenda will make it easier for more
Americans to find quality, affordable places to live.

But even before Congress passes the Build Back Better Agenda, agencies
across the federal government are taking action to boost the supply of
quality, affordable homes in a manner that will make rental homes more
available and more affordable over the next three years. Specifically,
agencies are announcing today that they are:

-   **<u>Relaunching the Federal Financing Bank and HUD Risk Sharing
    Program</u>:** To expand the supply of affordable multifamily rental
    housing, Treasury and HUD have finalized an agreement to restart the
    Federal Financing Bank’s support of HUD’s Risk Sharing program,
    which was suspended in 2019. The agreement will provide low-cost
    Ginnie Mae-comparable rates to HFAs that finance affordable housing
    development, enabling the development of new quality and affordable
    housing.  
-   **<u>Increasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s Low-Income Housing Tax
    Credit Investment Cap:</u>** LIHTC is the nation’s largest federal
    program for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental
    housing. Currently, the Enterprises are permitted to invest up to $1
    billion per year (or $500 million each) in affordable housing
    development and preservation supported by these tax credits. This
    targeted investment further reduces financing costs associated with
    affordable housing and spurs additional development. Today, FHFA is
    announcing that it is raising the Enterprises’ LIHTC cap to $1.7
    billion (or $850 million each). FHFA is also announcing that it will
    increase the Duty to Serve (DTS) rural/targeted investment
    requirement from 40% to 50% of each Enterprise’s total LIHTC
    investment capacity, or $425 million in targeted investment and $425
    million in unrestricted investment. By both raising the caps and
    targeting the investments at affordable rental housing, today’s
    actions will support the development and preservation of affordable
    units in areas most in need.  
-   **<u>Making Funding Available for Affordable Housing Production
    Under the Capital Magnet Fund:</u>** The Treasury Department is
    preparing to issue a notice of funding availability for the Capital
    Magnet Fund (CMF), including changes to strongly encourage
    affordable housing production. The CMF is a competitive grant
    program for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and
    non-profit housing groups funded by allocations made each year from
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Funds must be used to leverage housing
    and economic development investments at least ten times the size of
    the award amount. This year’s historic pool of $383 million in
    available funding will facilitate the production of affordable
    housing units throughout the country.

***Boosting the Supply of Manufactured Homes and 2-4 Unit Properties  
***  
Across the country, hundreds of thousands of families rely on
manufactured housing and 2-4 unit properties to afford homeownership.
Manufactured housing is constructed in factories and installed on site
without the additional costs associated with traditional homebuilding,
providing a vital affordable housing option. Owner-occupied 2-4-unit
properties, where the owner occupies one of the units and rents the
other units, are another source of additional rental housing,
particularly in low-to-moderate income communities and communities of
color. Limited financing for manufactured housing and 2-4-unit
properties—as well as other barriers—have restricted access to these
alternatives.

Today, the Administration is calling on state and local governments to
reduce zoning and financing barriers to these kinds of housing – housing
that allows families to achieve homeownership and build wealth. In
addition, federal agencies are taking the following steps to increase
financing options and boost availability, supply, and affordability for
these types of properties:

-   **<u>Making Financing More Available for Manufactured Housing:</u>**
    In 2020, FHFA authorized Fannie Mae to accept loan delivery on
    single-wide manufactured housing. An eligible single-wide, or
    single-section manufactured housing unit, is a factory-built
    rectangular structure placed on a permanent foundation and
    equivalent in quality and amenities to entry level stick-built
    housing. FHFA recently authorized Freddie Mac to accept eligible
    single-wide manufactured housing loan deliveries as well, which will
    make more financing available for such properties and facilitate the
    delivery of more manufactured homes. The Enterprises will continue
    performing industry-wide outreach and education about the
    eligibility of manufactured housing, modular, and factory-built
    homes. FHA also insures mortgages for single-wide manufactured homes
    that meet its programmatic requirements.  
-   **Making Financing More Available for 2-4 Unit Properties:** FHFA
    has authorized Freddie Mac to revisit certain mortgage eligibility
    requirements for 2-4 unit properties made in 2020 that reduced
    financing available by Freddie Mac for these kinds of properties,
    which are disproportionately held by Black and Brown homeowners. The
    updates to the 2-4 unit mortgage eligibility requirements will add
    to the availability of rental units in these properties. They will
    also provide additional wealth-building opportunities for new owners
    of 2-4 unit properties who benefit from the rental income associated
    with these units. FHA also insures mortgages for 2-4 unit properties
    that meet its programmatic requirements.

***Making More Single-Family Homes Available to Individuals, Families,
and Non-Profits Organizations – Rather Than Large Investors  
***  
The effect of investor purchases is felt across the country, even in
[smaller and less expensive
cities](https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/find-stories/special-report-investor-home-buying/)
where the influx of investor cash has resulted in fierce competition for
starter homes and pushed many qualified potential homebuyers towards
rentals. As the economy continues to recover, it is critical that owner
occupants and non-profit organizations are not priced out of
single-family housing markets by large investors.

That’s why President Biden calls on state and local governments to take
steps to make it easier for owner occupants and non-profit organizations
to purchase single-family homes, rather than large investors. It’s also
why today, federal agencies are taking steps to encourage the owner
occupant and non-profit purchase of government-insured and
government-owned properties. When combined with the new federal tax
credit that President Biden has proposed, based on the innovative,
bipartisan Neighborhood Homes Investment Act, these actions will lead to
the rehabilitation of more distressed properties, and boost
homeownership and wealth-building possibilities for more middle-class
families throughout the country. Specifically, federal agencies are
announcing today that they are:

-   **<u>Prioritizing Homeownership in the Sale of FHA-Insured
    Properties</u>**: Through Second Chance Claims Without Conveyance of
    Title (CWCOT) sales, servicers can sell their FHA-insured foreclosed
    properties directly to third parties – without conveying them to HUD
    – and still get their claim paid by FHA. These sales are a part of
    the CWCOT claim method, which is now the predominant way that
    FHA-insured foreclosed properties are sold. This sales method
    reduces costs for taxpayers but too often, properties are sold to
    large investors, who either flip them for profit or rent them out.
    Owner occupants and non-profits, who are more likely to need
    financing and are less aware of the CWCOT program, often don’t have
    a fair shot to purchase these properties. Consistent with the
    American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, HUD will develop
    guidelines over the next year that provides an exclusive listing
    period during which only governmental entities, non-profits, and
    owner occupant buyers may submit bids for these properties in the
    Second Chance sales. In addition, and also within a year, HUD is
    exploring setting a target of at least 50 percent of these
    properties each year being conveyed to governmental entities,
    non-profits, and owner occupant buyers.    
-   **<u>Promoting the Sale of Distressed HUD Properties to
    Non-Profits:</u>** The direct sale of defaulted FHA-insured mortgage
    notes allows HUD to make bulk sales to purchasers with affordable
    housing and community revitalization goals in specific geographic
    areas. HUD is planning a sale of distressed single family notes this
    fall. This upcoming sale is currently projected to include mortgage
    notes for more than 1,700 single family properties. For this sale,
    HUD is exploring offering 50% of those notes to non-profit and
    community organizations that commit to rehabilitating, and then
    selling, the related properties to owner occupants or creating other
    positive outcomes for the communities. This is a significant
    increase over previous sales, which had offered 10% of all auctioned
    notes to non-profit and community organizations. Earmarking half of
    these properties exclusively for resale to owner occupying
    borrowers, non-profits, and community organizations will expand the
    housing inventory available to potential homebuyers who otherwise
    would not have the opportunity to place a competitive offer on these
    homes.  
-   **<u>Expanding the Exclusivity Period for HUD and the Enterprise’s
    Real Estate Owned (REO) Sales:</u>** Currently, HUD and the
    Enterprises have a total of more than 12,000 single-family homes as
    part of their respective Real Estate Owned (REO) inventory. These
    homes were backed by FHA-insured mortgages, or Fannie Mae or Freddie
    Mac mortgages, and have since been foreclosed upon and were not sold
    at auction. Just like with the CWCOT program, larger investors,
    often experienced and without the need for financing, can execute
    transactions quickly. As a result, potential owner occupants don’t
    get a fair shot at purchasing the properties. In order to help more
    potential owner occupants purchase these properties, FHA, in
    addition to the Enterprises at the direction of FHFA, will extend
    their existing “first look” periods to 30 days for the sale of all
    available REO properties. Currently, these “first look” periods
    generally range from 10-20 days. During the “first look” periods,
    only potential owner occupants and qualified non-profit buyers will
    be permitted to make a purchase offer.  
-   **<u>Improving Outreach to Non-Profits for Real Estate Owned
    Sales:</u>** HUD will announce efforts to expand outreach to
    non-profit entities, local governments, and other interested
    community organizations to further educate them on the note sales
    process for distressed properties. This will include a virtual note
    sales educational seminar around HUD’s upcoming fall single family
    note sale. The Enterprises will continue to advance existing
    partnerships they have in place with non-profits focused on owner
    occupancy and neighborhood stabilization to complement the retail
    disposition of their REO properties.

***Working with State and Local Governments to Boost Housing Supply  
***  
While the federal government has a critical role to play in boosting the
supply of affordable homes, state and local governments often play the
primary role in setting policies that encourage – or in some cases,
discourage – boosting housing supply. One of the most persistent factors
depressing the supply of housing, especially entry-level and rental
units, is exclusionary zoning laws and practices, like minimum lot size
requirements, minimum square footage requirements, unnecessary parking
requirements, prohibitions on or differing treatment for multi-family
homes, accessory dwelling units, and manufactured housing, and limits on
the height of buildings.

That’s why today, in addition to the zoning reform incentives included
in the Build Back Better Agenda, the Administration is calling on state
and local governments to take action to address zoning policies that
have historically locked families out of communities and continue to
limit housing supply.

In order to partner with state and local governments in this critical
work, the Administration today is announcing the following actions:

-   **<u>Leveraging Federal Funding to Spur State and Local
    Action</u>:** To support state and local governments that receive
    flexible HUD block grant funding, HUD’s Office of Community Planning
    and Development will create a Housing Supply Toolkit that provides
    easy-to-implement strategies to deploy existing block grants and
    other resources to address supply and affordability challenges that
    have been deepened by the pandemic. In addition, HUD will form and
    support a cohort of communities working to address supply issues,
    helping accelerate their efforts to find solutions. In addition, the
    Interim Final Rule governing the American Rescue Plan’s $350 billion
    State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds explicitly allows recipients
    (states, territories, Tribal governments, and localities, including
    cities and counties) to invest these funds in development and
    preservation of affordable housing, as part of the response to the
    public health emergency and its disparate impacts on certain
    populations and geographies. Already, at least 42 cities and 33
    states have publicly proposed deploying resources on affordable
    housing investments of some type. Treasury will continue to engage
    with mayors, governors, and county executives to highlight this use,
    and encourage additional affordable housing production targeted to
    the households and communities struggling the most.  
-   **<u>Exploring Federal Levers to Partner with States and Local
    Governments to Reduce Exclusionary Zoning:</u>** FHFA is announcing
    that it will conduct a study on the degree to which the Enterprises’
    mortgage activity is concentrated in jurisdictions with exclusionary
    policies. The report will provide data on the demographic
    characteristics of homeowners whose loans are purchased by the
    Enterprises and the overall effect of these purchases in allowing
    localities to sustain restrictive zoning measures or helping to
    support localities enacting inclusionary zoning policies.

In addition, and in anticipation of the Build Back Better Agenda’s
community engagement and investment grants that will empower communities
to reach collective decisions on how to meet their housing needs, next
week HUD’s Office of Policy Development and Research will release its
latest research on actions that state and local governments have taken
to increase housing supply, providing useful examples for others to
follow. Lessons learned will be incorporated into HUD’s Regulatory
Barriers Clearinghouse, a searchable electronic database that contains
over 4,800 barriers and solutions spanning all 50 states and over 460
cities and counties.  
  
**<u>Launching Learning and Listening Sessions with Local Leaders</u>:**
The persistent imbalances in the U.S. housing market have formed over
many decades and it will take concerted effort and iterative
policymaking to correct them. To this end, the White House, HUD, and
FHFA will convene state and local officials and stakeholders for a
series of peer learning and listening sessions. These sessions will
allow for the exchange of best practices on locally led zoning reform to
address supply and affordability challenges, including a virtual session
on accessory dwelling units hosted by FHFA in September.  The sessions
will also identify the obstacles to implementation that remain, which
the President’s Build Back Better Agenda and potentially federal
administrative action, can help address.
