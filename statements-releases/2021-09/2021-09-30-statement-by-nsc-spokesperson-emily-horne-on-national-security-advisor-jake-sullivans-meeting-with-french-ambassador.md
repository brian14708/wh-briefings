National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan today met with Ambassador
Philippe Etienne of the Republic of France at the White House following
Ambassador Etienne’s return to Washington, D.C. This meeting was in line
with the shared commitment by President Biden and President Macron in
their September 22 phone call to begin a process of in-depth
consultations on a range of strategic matters, in order to create the
conditions for ensuring confidence and propose concrete measures toward
common objectives. Mr. Sullivan welcomed Ambassador Etienne’s plan to
engage with officials across the U.S. government to continue advancing
our shared agenda, in advance of President Biden and President Macron
meeting in Europe at the end of October.
