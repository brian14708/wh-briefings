Yesterday, September 5, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared
that a major disaster exists in the State of New York and ordered
Federal aid to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in
the areas affected by the remnants of Hurricane Ida from September 1 to
September 3, 2021.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Bronx, Kings, Queens, Richmond, and
Westchester.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Federal funding also is available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the remnants of Hurricane Ida in the counties of
Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, Richmond, and Westchester.  
  
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Lai Sun Yee as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.   
  
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.  
  
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
counties can begin applying for assistance tomorrow by registering
