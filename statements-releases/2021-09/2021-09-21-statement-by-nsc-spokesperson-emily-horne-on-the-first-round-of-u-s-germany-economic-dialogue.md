Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh met yesterday with
German counterparts Lars-Hendrik Röller, Chief Economic Advisor of
Chancellor Merkel, and Wolfgang Schmidt, State Secretary of the German
Ministry of Finance, to discuss our close cooperation on a range of
regional and global issues. This was the first round of talks under the
aegis of the U.S.-Germany Economic Dialogue announced by President Biden
and Chancellor Merkel in the July 15 Washington Declaration. Mr. Singh,
Mr. Röller, and Mr. Schmidt discussed our cooperation bilaterally and
through multilateral organizations such as the G-7, G-20, the EU, and
United Nations on global infrastructure development, COVID-19 vaccine
production and distribution, and climate finance. They also talked about
ways to further enhance U.S.-Germany cooperation on technology and
vocational training.
