Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of New Jersey and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by the
remnants of Hurricane Ida from September 1 to September 3, 2021.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Bergen, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex,
Passaic, and Somerset.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Federal funding also is available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the remnants of Hurricane Ida in the counties of
Bergen, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Passaic, and Somerset.  
  
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Patrick Cornbill as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.

counties may be designated for assistance after the assessments are
fully completed.
