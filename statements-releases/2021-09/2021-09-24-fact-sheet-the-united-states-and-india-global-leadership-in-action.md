President Biden hosted Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, forging
closer ties between two leading Indo-Pacific powers, the United States
and India. As the world’s oldest and largest democracies, the United
States and India are committed to values of freedom, pluralism,
openness, and respect for human rights.  
  
**Working Together on the World Stage**

-   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has reached
    more than 56 million Indians with COVID-related health training,
    risk mitigation and vaccine information, and essential equipment
    since the beginning of the pandemic.  
-   For more than a half-century, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention (CDC) has successfully collaborated with the Indian
    government to address India’s public health priorities. CDC
    has **allocated approximately $16 million** towards COVID-19
    response in India since March 2020, to support country-level
    coordination, epidemiology and surveillance, case management,
    infection prevention and control, laboratory and other technical
    areas, in collaboration with the World Health Organization, the
    United Nations Children’s Fund, and other partners.  
-   Under the **Quad**, the United States and India are working on
    COVID-19 response and pandemic preparedness, infrastructure, space,
    clean energy, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, cyber
    security, maritime security, resilient supply chains, approaches to
    5G infrastructure deployment that leverage open and interoperable
    network architectures, and critical and emerging technologies.  
-   The United States and India are committed to continued partnership
    on cybersecurity, to include efforts to promote critical
    infrastructure resilience, collaboration to counter cyber-enabled
    crime such as ransomware, and cooperation to address shared cyber
    threats, including through workforce development, and exploring
    common cyber standards and promoting secure software development.  
-   The United States looks forward to continued collaboration in the
    **Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure** (CDRI) and
    welcomes opportunities to work with India in leveraging the **Blue
    Dot Network** to catalyze investment in sustainable infrastructure
    in Africa, Southeast Asia, and beyond. USAID has committed over $9
    million towards supporting CDRI’s global leadership in this
    sector.  
-   Over the past year, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)
    funded nearly 200 research awards with collaborations involving
    Indian partners. In the past four years, the number of health
    research collaborations with India grew from 200 to nearly 330, and
    the number of Indian research organizations participating in
    NIH-funded research grew from nearly 100 to over 200.  
-   On October 28-29, 2021, the United States and India will co-host the
    fourth annual **Indo-Pacific Business Forum** (IPBF), which will
    bring together leaders in government, industry, media, and
    non-profits from across the Indo-Pacific. This marquee commercial
    diplomacy event underscores our joint commitment to a positive
    economic agenda for the Indo-Pacific region, advances policy
    developments, announces new investments, and builds relationships
    between the private sector and governments in the Indo-Pacific.

**Protecting the Planet and Powering the Future**

-   The United States and India are both committed to promoting a
    successful outcome at the 26<sup>th</sup> UN Climate Change
    Conference (COP26) in Glasgow later this year. Toward that end, the
    United States communicated an enhanced Nationally Determined
    Contribution to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by
    50-52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030.  
-   The United States is actively working with India to realize its
    ambitious goal of deploying 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by
    2030, including through the recently launched Climate Action and
    Finance Mobilization Dialogue , led by the U.S. Special Presidential

    five gigawatts of renewable energy across India, which reduced 30
    million tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2020, powered 3.3
    million households, and helped mobilize $1.1 billion in private
    sector clean energy investments.  
-   The U.S. Trade and Development Agency launched the **U.S.-India
    Climate Technologies Action Group (CTAG)**. The CTAG will integrate
    private and public-sector inputs on initiatives that can contribute
    to global action on climate, facilitate U.S. industry input on the
    latest climate resilient technologies, share U.S. business models
    with the Indian market to accelerate the development of the clean
    energy sector, and mobilize capital for climate-smart infrastructure
    projects in India.  
-   The United States invited India to participate in the **Agriculture
    Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate)**, which will be
    launched at COP26 in November. AIM for Climate has the goal of
    increasing and accelerating global innovation on agriculture and
    food systems in support of climate action.

    Westinghouse project will provide clean, reliable power to millions
    of Indians.  
-   U.S. firm First Solar has announced it will invest $684 million in a
    fully integrated solar module manufacturing facility in southern
    India, directly supporting India’s energy security and bilateral
    climate goals. This investment will involve exports of technology
    and expertise from the United States to eventually produce modules
    with 60 percent local value-added content, generating jobs in both
    countries.  
-   In September, U.S. firm 24M Technologies, Inc. announced the signing
    of a license and services agreement with Chennai-based Lucas TVS
    Ltd. to construct one of the first Giga factories in India using
    battery storage platform technology. The first plant will be set up
    near Chennai with additional plants expected to be built throughout
    India to support the growing market for energy storage solutions.

**Generating Jobs and Mutual Prosperity**

-   Under the upcoming **Trade Policy Forum**, the United States seeks
    to work with India to address trade concerns and enhance bilateral
    trade. The United States also looks forward to holding the next
    meeting of the **U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue and CEO Forum** to
    enhance business and commercial ties between our two countries.  
-   As of 2021, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation
    (DFC) has a portfolio in India valued at over $2.5 billion, covering
    projects across multiple sectors, including renewable energy,
    manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, private equity, housing, and
    insurance. An additional $900 million in new projects are expected
