title: Statement by Press Secretary Jen Psaki on the Quad Leaders Summit
---
 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will host the first-ever Quad Leaders
Summit at the White House on September 24. President Biden is looking
forward to welcoming to the White House Prime Minister Scott Morrison of
Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister
Yoshihide Suga of Japan.

The Biden-Harris Administration has made elevating the Quad a priority,
as seen through the first-ever Quad Leaders-level engagement in March,
which was virtual, and now this Summit, which will be in-person. Hosting
the leaders of the Quad demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administrationâ€™s
priority of engaging in the Indo-Pacific, including through new
multilateral configurations to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

The Quad Leaders will be focused on deepening our ties and advancing
practical cooperation on areas such as combatting COVID-19, addressing
the climate crisis, partnering on emerging technologies and cyberspace,
and promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific.
