title: "A U.S.-EU Agenda for Beating the Global Pandemic Vaccinating the World, Saving\
  \ Lives Now, and Building Back Better Health\_Security"
---
 
Vaccination is the most effective response to the COVID pandemic. The
United States and the EU are technological leaders in advanced vaccine
platforms, given decades of investments in research and development.  
  
It is vital that we aggressively pursue an agenda to vaccinate the
world.  Coordinated U.S. and EU leadership will help expand supply,
deliver in a more coordinated and efficient manner, and manage
constraints to supply chains. This will showcase the force of a
Transatlantic partnership in facilitating global vaccination while
enabling more progress by multilateral and regional initiatives.  
  
Building on the outcome of the May 2021 G20 Global Health Summit, the G7
and U.S.-EU Summits in June, and on the upcoming G20 Summit, U.S. and
the EU will expand cooperation for global action toward vaccinating the
world, saving lives now, and building better health security.  

-   **Pillar I: A Joint EU/US Vaccine Sharing Commitment**: the United
    States and the EU will share doses globally to enhance vaccination
    rates, with a priority on sharing through COVAX and improving
    vaccination rates urgently in low and lower-middle income
    countries.  The United States is donating over 1.1 billion doses,
    and the EU will donate over 500 million doses. This is in addition
    to the doses we have financed through COVAX.

***We call for nations that are able to vaccinate their populations to
double their dose-sharing commitments or to make meaningful
contributions to vaccine readiness. They will place a premium on
predictable and effective dose-sharing to maximize sustainability and
minimize waste.***

-   **Pillar II: A Joint EU/US Commitment to Vaccine Readiness**: the
    United States and the EU will both support and coordinate with
    relevant organizations for vaccine delivery, cold chain, logistics,
    and immunization programs to translate doses in vials into shots in
    arms. They will share lessons learned from dose sharing, including
    delivery via COVAX, and promote equitable distribution of vaccines.

-   **Pillar III: A Joint EU/US partnership on bolstering global vaccine
    supply and therapeutics:** the EU and the United States will
    leverage their newly launched [Joint COVID-19 Manufacturing and
    Supply Chain
    Taskforce ](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/22/united-stateseuropean-commission-joint-statement/)to
    support vaccine and therapeutic manufacturing and distribution and
    overcome supply chain challenges. Collaborative efforts, outlined
    below, will include monitoring global supply chains, assessing
    global demand against the supply of ingredients and production
    materials, and identifying and addressing in real time bottlenecks
    and other disruptive factors for global vaccine and therapeutics
    production, as well as coordinating potential solutions and
    initiatives to boost global production of vaccines, critical inputs,
    and ancillary supplies.  
-   **Pillar IV**: **A Joint EU/US Proposal to achieve Global Health
    Security**.  The United States and the EU will support the
    establishment of a Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) by the end of
    2021 and will support its sustainable capitalization.  The EU and
    United States will also support global pandemic surveillance,
    including the concept of a global pandemic radar. The EU and the
    United States, through the European Health Emergency preparedness
    and Response Authority, and the Department of Health and Human
    Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority,
    respectively, will cooperate in line with our G7 commitment to
    expedite the development of new vaccines and make recommendations on
    enhancing the world’s capacity to deliver these vaccines in real
    time. 

***We call on partners to join in establishing and financing the FIF
to support to prepare countries for COVID-19 and future
biological threats.***

-   **Pillar V: A Joint EU/US/Partners Roadmap for regional vaccine
    production**. The EU and the United States will coordinate
    investments in regional manufacturing capacity with low and
    lower-middle income countries, as well as targeted efforts to
    enhance capacity for medical countermeasures under the Build Back
    Better World infrastructure and the newly established Global Gateway
    partnership. The EU and the United States will align efforts to
    bolster local vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa and forge
    ahead on discussions on expanding the production of COVID-19
    vaccines and treatments and ensure their equitable access.

***We call on partners to join in supporting coordinated investments to
expand global and regional manufacturing, including for mRNA, viral
vector, and/or protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines.***
