President Biden met today with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of

agreed on the importance of working with allies and partners around the
world, including through historic partnerships and organizations and new
configurations, to defend against threats to the international rules
based order. They discussed the critical role European allies and
partners, including NATO and the EU, play in the Indo-Pacific and ways
to deepen that cooperation and joint work. The President and Prime
Minister Morrison committed to take steps to strengthen the resilience
of our respective economies and their mutual commitment to work through
the Quad. They also discussed the upcoming Quad Leaders Summit,
including efforts to expand access to vaccines in the Indo-Pacific and
to cooperate to address the climate crisis.
