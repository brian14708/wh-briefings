severe storm and flooding from July 29 to July 30, 2021.

Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe storm and flooding in the counties of Bennington and Windham.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.
