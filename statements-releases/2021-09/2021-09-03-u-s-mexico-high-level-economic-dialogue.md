title: "U.S.- Mexico High-Level Economic\_Dialogue"
---
 
On September 9, the Biden-Harris Administration will convene the first
U.S.- Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) since 2016 in
recognition of the broad, deep economic agenda that the United States
shares with Mexico.  Established in 2013, the HLED advances strategic
economic and commercial priorities for both countries, with the shared
goal of fostering economic development and growth, job creation, global
competitiveness, and reduction of poverty and inequality.  This year’s
Dialogue will focus on four central pillars: Building Back Together;
Promoting Sustainable Economic and Social Development in Southern Mexico
and Central America; Securing the Tools for Future Prosperity; and
Investing in Our People. The HLED complements and reinforces the full
range of issues of importance to the bilateral relationship, including
recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, building climate resilience,
addressing the root causes of migration, and cooperating on security.
