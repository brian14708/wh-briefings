*Agencies Respond to President Biden’s Call for All-of-Government Action
on Information on Voting and Opportunities to Register and Vote*

As President Biden has said, democracy doesn’t happen by accident. We
have to defend, strengthen, and renew it to ensure free and fair
elections that reflect the will of the American people. Too many
Americans face significant obstacles to exercising their sacred,
fundamental right to vote. For generations, discriminatory policies have
suppressed the votes of Black Americans and other voters of color.
Voters of color are more likely than white voters to face long lines at
the polls and are disproportionately burdened by overly restrictive
voter identification laws and limited opportunities to vote by mail.
Native Americans likewise face limited opportunities to vote by mail and
frequently lack sufficient polling places and voter registration
opportunities near their homes. Lack of access to language assistance is
an obstacle for many voters.  People with disabilities face longstanding
barriers to exercising their right to vote, especially when it comes to
legally required accommodations to vote privately and independently.
Members of our military also face unnecessary challenges to exercising
their right to vote.

While the President continues to call on Congress to restore the Voting
Rights Act and pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which includes bold reforms
to make it more equitable and accessible for all Americans to exercise
their fundamental right to vote, he also knows we can’t wait to act.
That is why on March 7, the 56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the
President signed an Executive Order to leverage the resources of the
federal government to increase access to voter registration services and
information about voting, helping deliver on the promise of Congressman
Lewis’ fight against these anti-voter burdens and the fight of so many
others seeking to protect the right to vote before and since. **Today,
more than a dozen agencies across the federal government are announcing
steps they are taking to respond to the President’s call for an
all-of-government action to promote voting access and to further the
ability of all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy.**

The Executive Order is only part of the President’s efforts to protect
the right to vote and ensure all eligible citizens can freely
participate in the electoral process. For months, Vice President Harris
has engaged the American people; civil and voting rights advocacy
groups; pollworkers; and other voting populations around the country
that have been historically marginalized to advance the Administration’s
efforts to protect the right to vote. The President has appointed strong
civil rights leadership at the Department of Justice. And he has
partnered with civil rights organizations, the business community, faith
leaders, young Americans, and others to activate an all-hands-on-deck
effort to protect this sacred right and uphold democratic values.

The Executive Order called for each agency to submit to Domestic Policy
Advisor Susan Rice a strategic plan outlining the ways that the agency
can promote nonpartisan voter registration and voter participation.
These strategic plans are just the beginning of each agency’s
commitments. In the weeks and months to come, agencies will further
build out their capacity to get relevant information out to the public,
help eligible voters better understand their opportunities for
engagement, and facilitate participation in the electoral process. 

New key early actions to implement the President’s Order include:

-   • The **Department of Agriculture**’s Rural Housing Service will
    encourage the provision of nonpartisan voter information through its
    borrowers and guaranteed lenders, who interface with thousands of
    residents in the process of changing their voting address every
    year. In addition, Rural Development agencies — which are spread
    throughout field offices across the country where rural Americans
    can apply for housing, facilities, or business assistance — will
    take steps to promote access to voter registration forms and other
    pertinent nonpartisan election information among their patrons.
-   The **Department of Defense** will support a comprehensive approach
    to information and voting awareness for servicemembers and civilian
    personnel voting at home, in addition to the structure currently
    assisting members of the military stationed away from home and
    citizens overseas.  The Department will develop materials in
    additional languages and send nonpartisan information at regular
    intervals before federal elections to ensure that eligible
    servicemembers and their families — particularly first-time voters —
    have opportunities to register and vote if they wish.
-   The **Department of Education** will prepare a tool kit of resources
    and strategies for increasing civic engagement at the elementary
    school, secondary school, and higher education level, helping more
    than 67 million students — and their families — learn about civic
    opportunities and responsibilities.  The Department will also remind
    educational institutions of their existing obligation and encourage
    institutions to identify further opportunities to assist eligible
    students with voter registration.
-   The **General Services Administration** will ensure
    **[vote.gov](https://vote.gov/)** is a user-friendly portal for
    Americans to find the information they need most to register and
    vote.  Available in over ten languages and in a format accessible
    for voters with disabilities, [vote.gov](https://vote.gov/) will
    make it easier for eligible users to register to vote or confirm
    their registration status.  Agencies across the federal government
    will link to [vote.gov](https://vote.gov/) to encourage Americans to
    participate in the electoral process. 
-   The **Department of Health and Human Services**’ Administration for
    Community Living will launch a new voting access hub to connect
    older adults and people with disabilities to information, tools and
    resources to help them understand and exercise their right to vote.
    The Indian Health Service will offer its patients assistance with
    voter registration.  The President’s Budget also requests a 25%
    increase in grants for the Administration for Community Living to
    distribute to state Protection and Advocacy systems, to provide a
    range of services that ensure that people with disabilities can
    fully participate in the electoral process.
-   The **Department of Homeland Security** will invite state and local
    governments and nonpartisan nonprofit organizations to register
    voters at the end of naturalization ceremonies for the hundreds of
    thousands of citizens naturalized each year, and will develop a new
    online resource on voting for recently naturalized citizens.  The
    Department will also provide information and resources for voters
    impacted by a disaster or emergency event through its training
    preparedness initiatives.
-   The **Department of Housing and Urban Development** will communicate
    with public housing authorities (PHAs) — more than 3000 authorities,
    managing approximately 1.2 million public housing units — through a
    letter to Executive Directors that provides useful information to
    PHAs about permissible ways to inform residents of non-partisan
    voter registration information and services. The Department will
    also assist relevant HUD-funded service providers by highlighting
    and sharing promising practices that improve non-partisan voting
    registration and voting access for people experiencing
    homelessness. 
-   The **Institute of Museum and Library Services** will create and
    distribute a toolkit of resources and strategies that libraries,
    museums, and heritage and cultural institutions can use to promote
    civic engagement and participation in the voting process.
-   The **Department of the Interior** will disseminate information on
    registering and voting, including through on-site events, at schools
    operated by the Bureau of Indian Education and Tribal Colleges and
    Universities, serving about 30,000 students.  The Department will
    also, where possible, offer Tribal College and University campuses
    for designation by states as voter registration agencies under the
    National Voter Registration Act.
-   The **Department of Justice** has created an online resource for the
    public that will provide links to state-specific information about
    registering and voting; detail the Department’s enforcement of
    federal voting rights laws and guidance it has issued to
    jurisdictions on the scope of those laws; and explain how to report
    potential violations.  The Department will also provide information
    about voting to individuals in federal custody, facilitate voting by
    those who remain eligible to do so while in federal custody, and
    educate individuals before reentry about voting rules and voting
    rights in their states.  And after the Census Bureau determines
    localities with specific responsibilities for language access, the
    Department will deliver guidance and conduct outreach to each
    covered jurisdiction to facilitate compliance.
-   The **Department of Labor** will issue guidance encouraging states
    to designate the more than 2,400 American Job Centers, which provide
    employment, training, and career services to workers in every state,
    as voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration
    Act. The Department of Labor will continue to require Job Corps
    centers to implement procedures for enrollees to vote, and where
    local law and leases permit, encourage Job Corps centers to serve as
    polling precincts.  The Department will also provide guidance that
    grantees can use federal workforce development funding, where
    consistent with program authority, to conduct nonpartisan voter
    registration efforts with participants.
-   The **Department of Transportation** will communicate guidance to
    transit systems — including more than 1,150 rural public transit
    systems and more than 1,000 urban public transit systems — to
    consider providing free and reduced fare service on election days
    and consider placing voter registration materials in high-transit
    stations.  The Department will also work with state and local
    entities seeking to mitigate traffic and construction impacts on
    routes to the polls, particularly in underserved communities. 
-   The **Department of the Treasury** will include information about
    registration and voter participation in its direct deposit campaigns
    for Americans who receive Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and
    other federal benefit payments.
-   The **Department of Veterans Affairs** will provide materials and
    assistance in registering and voting for tens of thousands of
    inpatients and residents, including VA Medical Center inpatients and
    residents of VA nursing homes and treatment centers for homeless
    veterans.  The Department will also facilitate assistance in
    registering and voting for homebound veterans and their caregivers
    through VA’s home-based and telehealth teams**. **
