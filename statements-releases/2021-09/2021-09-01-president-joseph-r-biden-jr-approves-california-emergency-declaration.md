Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that an emergency exists
in the State of California and ordered Federal assistance to supplement
State, tribal, and local response efforts due to the emergency
conditions resulting from the Caldor Fire beginning on August 14, 2021,
and continuing.  
  
The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to
protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe in the counties of Alpine, Amador, El
Dorado, and Placer.  
  
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures, limited to
direct Federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent Federal
funding.   
  
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Dolph A. Diemont as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.
