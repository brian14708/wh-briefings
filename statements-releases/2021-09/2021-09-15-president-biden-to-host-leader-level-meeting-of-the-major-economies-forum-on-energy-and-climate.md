title: President Biden to Host Leader-Level Meeting of the Major Economies Forum on
  Energy and Climate
---
 
President Biden will reconvene the Major Economies Forum on Energy and
Climate (MEF) on September 17 to galvanize efforts to confront the
global climate crisis.  
   
The virtual meeting builds on the Leaders Summit on Climate the
President hosted in April and comes six weeks before the United Nations
Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, which will set the course
for global climate efforts over the coming decade.  
   
President Biden has returned the United States to the Paris Agreement
and committed at the Leaders Summit to reduce U.S. emissions 50 to 52
percent below 2005 levels in 2030, in line with limiting warming to 1.5
degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Other countries also
announced steps at the Leaders Summit in line with the 1.5-degree limit.

The latest findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
released last month and an accelerating cycle of climate-driven
disasters around the world have underscored the urgency of dramatically
scaling up action this decade to keep the 1.5-degree goal within
reach.  
   
At the MEF meeting, the President will emphasize both the urgency and
the economic benefits of stronger climate action. He will call on
leaders to strengthen their climate ambition heading into COP 26 and in
the years beyond. The President also will outline plans to leverage the
MEF post-Glasgow as a launchpad for collective, concrete efforts scaling
up climate action through this decisive decade.
