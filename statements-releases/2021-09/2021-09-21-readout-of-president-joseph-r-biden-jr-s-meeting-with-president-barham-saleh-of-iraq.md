President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with the President Barham Saleh
of Iraq on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. Together
they discussed strengthening the bilateral relationship and deepening
cooperation on regional diplomatic initiatives.

President Biden stressed the U.S. commitment to Iraq’s long-term
stability and the leaders reaffirmed their respect for Iraq’s democracy,
rule of law, and efforts to hold credible and transparent elections this
October. He lauded recent initiatives such as the Baghdad Regional
Summit and the historic visit of Pope Francis to Iraq earlier this year
as an important symbol of Iraq’s contributions to regional stability and
interfaith tolerance.
