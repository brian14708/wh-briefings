title: Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on Qatar Airways Charter Flight from
  Kabul
---
 
Today, the United States government facilitated the departure of U.S
citizens and lawful permanent residents on a chartered Qatar Airways
flight from Hamid Karzai International Airport. We can confirm that
flight has safely landed in Qatar. We are deeply grateful to the
continued efforts of Qatar in facilitating operations at HKIA and
helping to ensure the safety of these charter flights. We have been
working intensely across the U.S. government to ensure the accuracy of
the manifest and the safe departure and transit of the aircraft, and
today’s safe flight is the result of careful and hard diplomacy and
engagement.

The Taliban have been cooperative in facilitating the departure of
American citizens and lawful permanent residents on charter flights from
HKIA. They have shown flexibility, and they have been businesslike and
professional in our dealings with them in this effort. This is a
positive first step.   
   
We will continue these efforts to facilitate the safe and orderly travel
of American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and Afghans who worked
for us and wish to leave Afghanistan. Because there is an ongoing
terrorist threat to operations of this nature, we will not be sharing
details of these efforts before people are safely out of the country.

We have brought more than 6,000 American citizens and lawful permanent
residents home to the United States under Operation Allies Welcome thus
far. As President Biden has said, if you are an American citizen who
wants to leave Afghanistan, there is no deadline. We remain committed to
get them out if they want to come out.
