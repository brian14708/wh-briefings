title: "Statement from the Vice President on New Texas Voting\_Restrictions"
---
 
Yesterday, the Texas legislature passed sweeping legislation with a
singular aim: making it harder for Texans to vote. The new law limits
the very options that allowed historic numbers of Texans, especially
citizens of color, to vote safely in our last election.

Earlier this summer I met twice with those Texas lawmakers who did
everything in their power to try to stop this bill from passing. They
raised the alarm bells on this assault on our democracy, and I commend
them for it.

Now, Congress must act to protect the voting rights of all Americans by
passing the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act.
