title: "Readout of President Biden\u2019s Meeting with Speaker Pelosi and Leaders\
  \ Schumer"
---
 
This evening, the President hosted Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer in
the Oval Office to discuss their robust work to pass the two bills that
form his vision for building an economy that delivers for the American
middle class, and not just those at the top: the Build Back Better Act
and the bipartisan infrastructure deal.  
  
The three underlined their commitment to the Build Back Better Act,
which will mean historic tax cuts for middle class families and small
businesses, make health care, child care, and caring for elderly
Americans more affordable, and take on climate changeâ€”with a price tag
of $0 because it will repeal special, wasteful tax giveaways to the rich
and big corporations.  
  
They also stressed their commitment to the bipartisan infrastructure
agreement, which will make historic, job-creating investments in our
roads and bridges, connect every American to high speed internet, stop
our children from drinking poisoned water, and make unprecedented gains
for our clean energy leadership.  
  
Both bills are must-pass priorities and are strongly supported by large
majorities of the American people, who know that for far too long the
wealthiest taxpayers and large companies have been able to write one set
of rules for themselves while everyone else is left more and more
behind.  
  
The President also spoke by phone today with additional lawmakers, has
led strategy sessions with his senior staff, and has been briefed by his
legislative affairs and economic teams. The engagement that he, his
Cabinet, and senior staff have been pursuing with Members of Congress
for months will continue going into tomorrow.
