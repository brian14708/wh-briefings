title: Vice President Harris Statement on Federal Agency Actions to Promote Voter
  Participation
---
 
“Our nation and democracy are stronger when everyone participates, and
weaker when anyone is left out.  Today, as we celebrate National Voter
Registration Day, we must continue the work
of protecting the fundamental right to vote. The Senate must pass the
Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. In
addition, the President and I continue to use all the tools available to
us to help advance that right. On the 56<sup>th</sup> anniversary of
Bloody Sunday in March 2021, President Biden issued the Executive Order
on Promoting Access to Voting.  That order instructs federal agencies
to deploy resources available to them to work to promote voting access. 
Agencies across the federal government have submitted strategic plans on
precisely how they plan to do that.  The President and I will help
ensure these plans are fully implemented, and we will continue to work
closely with these agencies to bring a whole-of-government approach to
making voting accessible for all Americans.”
