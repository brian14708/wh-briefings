title: President Biden Announces Nine New Nominees to Serve as U.S. Attorneys
---
 
President Biden is announcing nine new nominees to serve as U.S.
Attorneys across the country, officials who will be indispensable to
upholding the rule of law as the top federal law enforcement officials
for their districts.  
  
These individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law,
their professionalism, their experience and credentials in this field,
their dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment
to the independence of the Department of Justice.  
  
The President has launched a comprehensive effort to take on the uptick
in gun crime that has been taking place for the last 18 months—putting
more cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and
cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys as
the chief federal law enforcement officers in their district is
important for these efforts.

The President has now announced 25 nominees to serve as U.S.
Attorneys.
