title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on Further U.S. Citizen Departures\
  \ from\_Afghanistan"

Today the United States government facilitated the additional departures
of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents both on a chartered
Qatar Airways flight from Kabul and via overland passage to a
neighboring country. The Qatar Airways flight held 19 U.S. citizens and
the party traveling overland included two U.S. citizens and 11 lawful
permanent residents.

We are continuing intensive work across the U.S. government to
facilitate the safe transit of these individuals and other U.S.
citizens, LPRs, and Afghans who have worked for us who wish to leave
Afghanistan. Because there is an ongoing terrorist threat to operations
of this nature, we will not be sharing details of these efforts before
people are safely out of the country.

We are deeply grateful to the continued efforts of Qatar in facilitating
operations at the Kabul International Airport and continuing to help
ensure the safety of charter flights.

Todayâ€™s departures demonstrate how we are giving Americans clear and
safe options to leave Afghanistan from different locations. A number of
Americans have taken these options; some have decided not to, for a
variety of reasons. That is their right. We understand these are
difficult decisions. We will continue to provide proven options for
leaving. It is up to Americans who remain whether they choose to take
them.
