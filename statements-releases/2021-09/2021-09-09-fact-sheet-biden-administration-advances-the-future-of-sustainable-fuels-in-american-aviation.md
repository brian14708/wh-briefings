*New Actions Aim to Produce Three Billion Gallons of Sustainable Fuel,
Reduce Aviation Emissions by 20% by 2030, and Grow Good-Paying, Union
Jobs*

Today, President Biden is taking steps to coordinate leadership and
innovation across the federal government, aircraft manufacturers,
airlines, fuel producers, airports, and non-governmental organizations
to advance the use of cleaner and more sustainable fuels in American
aviation. These steps will help make progress toward our climate goals
for 2030 and are essential to unlocking the potential for a fully
zero-carbon aviation sector by 2050. Today’s executive actions across
the Departments of Energy, Transportation, Agriculture, Defense, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the General Services
Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency will result in
the production and use of billions of gallons of sustainable fuel that
will enable aviation emissions to drop 20% by 2030 when compared to
business as usual. Together with President Biden’s Build Back Better
Agenda, these new agency steps and industry partnerships will transform
the aviation sector, create good-paying jobs, support American
agriculture and manufacturing, and help us tackle the climate crisis.  
  
Today, aviation (including all non-military flights within and departing
from the United States) represents 11% of United States
transportation-related emissions. Without increased action, aviation’s
share of emissions is likely to increase as more people and goods fly.
That is why leadership and innovation in this sector is so essential if
we hope to put the aviation industry, and the economy, on track to
achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Achieving a
sustainable aviation industry requires energy efficiency improvements in
aircraft technology and better operations. In the future, electric and
hydrogen-powered aviation may unlock affordable and convenient local and
regional travel. But for today’s long-distance travel, we need bold
partnerships to spur the deployment of billions of gallons of
sustainable aviation fuels quickly.  
  
That is why President Biden proposed a Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax
credit as part of the Build Back Better Agenda. This credit will help
cut costs and rapidly scale domestic production of sustainable fuels for
aviation. The proposed tax credit requires at least a 50% reduction in
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and offers increased incentive for
greater reductions. Today’s announcements build upon this proposal
through a whole-of-government effort to advance cleaner aviation, as
well as work in concert with bold actions taken by the aviation-related
industries. Key federal actions include:

-   A new Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge to inspire the
    dramatic increase in the production of sustainable aviation fuels to
    at least 3 billion gallons per year by 2030;
-   New and ongoing funding opportunities to support sustainable
    aviation fuel projects and fuel producers totaling up to $4.3
    billion;
-   An increase in R&D activities to demonstrate new technologies that
    can achieve at least a 30% improvement in aircraft fuel efficiency;
-   Efforts to improve air traffic and airport efficiency to reduce fuel
    use, eliminate lead exposure, and ensure cleaner air in and around
    airports; and
-   The demonstration of U.S. leadership both internationally and
    through the federal example.

Building on today’s announcements, the Administration also plans to
release an aviation climate action plan in the coming months, which will
set forth a comprehensive plan for aviation.  
  
The Administration is committed to transforming the aviation sector in a
way that creates good-paying union jobs in manufacturing, improves the
environmental quality for airport and airline workers, and unlocks rural
economic opportunity for sustainable fuels from many different
feedstocks and pathways. Taking these and other steps in concert with
the aviation sector can drive innovation and support a growing market
for cleaner fuels, while reducing and eventually eliminating aviation’s
climate impact.  
  
This transformation to a zero-carbon aviation sector will require
coordinated innovation and leadership from the Federal government,
aircraft manufactures, airlines, fuel producers, and airports. The new
set of executive actions, federal programs, and private sector
commitments described below will help set the sector on a path to
net-zero emissions.

**Launching New Aviation Climate Actions Across the Federal
Government**  
Today, the Administration is launching a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel
Grand Challenge to inspire the dramatic increase in the production of
sustainable aviation fuels, and to complement a broad set of actions the
Administration intends to take to reduce aviation emissions in line with
President Biden’s commitment to achieve net-zero economy-wide emissions
no later than 2050. These actions include policy measures, technological
advancements, and executive actions that will reduce domestic aviation
carbon dioxide emissions and create good paying jobs within the decade.
These efforts include:  
  
*Scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production to at least 3 billion
gallons per year by 2030 by supporting producers*

-   Today the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation
    (DOT) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are launching a
    government-wide [*Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand
    Challenge*](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-09/S1-Signed-SAF-MOU-9-08-21.pdf)
    to meet the demand for sustainable aviation fuels by working with
    stakeholders to reduce costs, enhance sustainability, and expand
    production and use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) that achieves
    a minimum of a 50% reduction in life cycle GHGs compared to
    conventional fuel. In addition, the challenge will adopt the goal of
    supplying at least 3 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030 and, by
    2050, sufficient SAF to meet 100% of aviation fuel demand, which is
    currently projected to be around 35 billion gallons per year.
-   USDA will support U.S. farmers with climate-smart agriculture
    practices and research, including biomass feedstock genetic
    development, sustainable crop and forest management at scale, and
    post-harvest supply chain logistics. USDA will also support fuel
    producers with carbon modeling components of aviation biofuel
    feedstocks.
-   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOE will collaborate
    to identify data collection needs, assess technical information, and
    take other steps designed to expedite the regulatory approval
    process to support newly developed fuels and feedstocks that may be
    viable for inclusion as able to generate Renewable Identification
    Numbers (RINs) under renewable fuel in the Federal Renewable Fuel
    Standard (RFS) program.
-   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will make 14 grant awards
    with FY21 funds to the Aviation Sustainability CENTer (ASCENT)
    university center of excellence totaling more than $3.6M. This will
    support the sustainable aviation fuel approval clearing house in
    conducting evaluation testing to ensure that new fuels are safe for
    use.
-   DOE Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) recently announced $35
    million for 11 projects developing feedstock and algae technologies
    for advancing the domestic bioeconomy and today announced additional
    selections totaling over $61M to advance biofuels and support
    reduced cost of SAF pathways, including 11 projects that are scaling
    up promising technologies to produce SAF.
-   DOE Loan Programs Office (LPO) is offering up to $3 billion in loan
    guarantees. Commercial-scale SAF projects that utilize innovative
    technology and avoid, reduce, or sequester greenhouse gas emissions
    and meet other program requirements may be eligible for loan
    guarantees under LPO’s Title 17 Innovative Energy Loan Guarantee
    Program.
-   DOD funding, subject to appropriations, to certify the use of up to
    four additional SAF pathways already approved in the commercial
    market, as well as additional SAF pathways in the ASTM approval
    pipeline for warfighters.

*Increasing R&D activities to demonstrate new technologies to achieve at
least a 30% improvement in aircraft fuel efficiency*

-   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has
    launched the Sustainable Flight National Partnership to collaborate
    with the FAA and industry to accelerate the maturation of aircraft
    and engine technologies that enable a step-change reduction in fuel
    burn and carbon dioxide emissions.
-   The FAA is launching the third phase of its Continuous Lower Energy,
    Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) Program by awarding more than $100
    million for aircraft and engine companies to develop and demonstrate
    aircraft technologies that reduce fuel use, emissions, and noise.
-   Department of Defense (DoD) is investing in a range of initiatives
    to improve the efficiency of legacy aircraft and develop more energy
    efficient new aircraft. Some examples, subject to appropriations,
    include almost $900M for Air Force B-52 Commercial Engine
    Replacement Program, Army Improved Engine Turbine Program, Adaptive
    Engine Transition Program and Next-Generation Adaptive Propulsion
    Program, and Air Force Legacy Aircraft Drag Reduction Program.
-   DOE, working collaboratively with NASA, is investing $115M to
    develop battery technologies that can achieve the energy density
    needed for both near term electric vertical take-off and landing and
    short-range consumer aircraft use cases, and may potentially achieve
    the energy density needed for long term longer range electric
    aircraft as well.
-   DOE ARPA-E announced $16.5 million in funding for six projects as
    part of the Systems for Monitoring and Analytics for Renewable
    Transportation Fuels from Agricultural Resources and Management
    (SMARTFARM) program. These projects will develop technologies that
    bridge the data gap in the biofuel supply chain by quantifying
    feedstock-related GHG emissions and soil carbon dynamics at the
    field-level.

*Improving air traffic and airport efficiency to reduce fuel use,
eliminate lead exposure, and ensure cleaner air in and around airports*

-   Recently, FAA awarded $20.4 million in grants to reduce emissions
    and improve air quality at airports across the country. The awards
    will fund zero-emission airport vehicles, including their electric
    charging infrastructure, and will electrify the ramp equipment used
    to service planes at the gate.
-   FAA introduced the Aviation Climate Research (ACR) program in the
    FY22 Presidential Budget Request for the FAA at a proposed $50M.
    Subject to appropriations, the ACR program will invest in research
    that has transformative impact potential to reduce greenhouse gas
    emissions from aviation in support of the U.S. climate change goals.
-   FAA is launching a new research project to develop a contrail
    avoidance tool to evaluate and optimize the benefits, costs, and
    practicality of contrail avoidance to minimize aviation climate
    impacts.
-   To address local environmental impacts of aviation, including lead
    emissions from piston-engine aircraft, the FAA and the EPA will be
    working together to identify ways to reduce exposure to lead
    emissions and to reduce or eliminate lead from aviation gasoline.

*Strengthening aviation leadership internationally*

-   With today’s announcements and the forthcoming aviation climate
    action plan, the United States is committed to asserting positive
    international leadership on aviation and climate change. As a
    country, we will re-establish U.S. credibility through ambitious
    domestic commitments and realistic action plans for implementing
    those commitments, demonstrate leadership on aviation ambition at
    the International Civil Aviation Organization by showing the world
    by implementing CORSIA transparently and effectively, and supporting
    adoption of a long-term aspirational goal for reducing aviation
    emissions. We will also engage with bilateral and regional partners
    to forge a diverse coalition of States committed to greater ambition
    and action on aviation.

*Leading through Federal example*

-   The government as a whole has procurement power that can be used to
    support the sustainable aviation industry as federal employees
    return to travel. The General Services Administration is publishing
    a Request for Information on the Options to Increase Sustainability
    of Future Federal Air Travel. In this RFI the agency is seeking
    market research information about airlines’ commercial
    sustainability capabilities and offerings to inform the Government’s
    efforts to reduce the sustainability impacts of employee travel. The
    RFI will be released in October with responses due in November.

**  
Commitments from Across the Aviation Sector**  
Industry collaboration is necessary to achieve a sustainable,
decarbonized aviation sector. The engagement of the full ecosystem of
aviation stakeholders will be critical to advance technological
innovation, create new job opportunities, and contribute to the
Administration’s economy wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050. New
and recent commitments by airlines, aircraft manufacturers, fuel
providers, and airports—in concert with government investment—will
significantly reduce emissions by 2030 and put us on the pathway to a
zero-carbon aviation sector.  
  
*Passenger Airlines Will Accelerate Adoption of Sustainable Aviation
Fuel*  
  
Today, members of Airlines for America have pledged to work with the
federal government and other stakeholders toward a rapid expansion of
the production and deployment of commercially viable SAF to make three
billion gallons of SAF available to U.S. aircraft operators in 2030.
This new commitment will ensure progress this decade towards the
industry’s overall goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Today’s
announcement builds off the near-term commitment across the industry of
carbon-neutral growth relative to 2019.

In support of Airlines for America’s new 2030 goal, several airlines
have made specific pledges to ramp up use of SAF and advance
sustainability across their operations:

-   United Airlines announced a new goal to reduce its carbon emissions
    intensity 50% compared to 2019 in by 2035. United Airlines and
    Honeywell also announced a new multi-million-dollar investment in
    Alder Fuels to produce carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel at
    scale. Under the agreement, Honeywell and Alder Fuels will jointly
    commercialize the technology that could demonstrate greater than
    100% lifecycle GHG emissions reductions for aviation fuel. United
    Airlines has committed to purchasing 1.5 billion gallons of this new
    SAF over the next 20 years.
-   Delta Airlines is committed to replace 10% of current jet fuel use
    with SAFs by 2030 and has agreements with three SAF producers,
    Neste, Gevo, and Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels. Delta also recently
    announced a new SAF emissions pilot project with Chevron and Google
    to increase industry SAF transparency. 
-   American Airlines plans to procure 10 million gallons of SAF from
    Prometheus Fuels by 2025 through a process that produces fuels from
    captured CO<sub>2</sub> and renewable electricity.
-   Alaska Airlines offers purchase of SAF to offset corporate travel on
    key routes and has agreements in place with SAF producers including
    SkyNRG Americas and Neste.
-   Southwest Airlines is partnering with the National Renewable Energy
    Lab to develop and commercialize SAF.
-   JetBlue is committed to electric and hydrogen aircraft development
    in partnership with Joby Aviation and Universal Hydrogen.

*Cargo Airlines Will Invest in Innovation and Efficiency*  
  
In air freight, the Cargo Airline Association (CAA) members are
advancing sustainability by purchasing new, fuel efficient aircraft,
electrifying ground equipment, promoting and using SAF, and pioneering
the use of electric short-haul cargo aircraft. Each company is
incorporating climate considerations across their business, with
specific actions including:

-   FedEx is conserving fuel and improving the efficiency of aircrafts
    through their FedEx Fuel Sense® program while continuing to invest
    in the development of SAF.
-   Atlas Air is driving operating efficiencies with their FuelWise
    program, which works in conjunction with flight planning software to
    optimize speeds, altitudes, routes, and flight path segments.
-   Amazon AIR is investing in electrofuels, hydrogen fuel cell
    aircraft, and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft
    development. Amazon Air has purchased 6 million gallons of SAF
-   DHL Express has pledged to use 30% SAF by 2030 and is partnering
    with other stakeholders on a demonstration project in Northern
    Kentucky to produce and supply SAF to the region.
-   UPS is investing in efficient, electric vertical take-off and
    landing aircrafts for moving smaller loads.

*Partnerships Will Promote Transparent Airline Targets and Progress*  
  
Today, United and Delta Airlines are announcing their participation in
the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), joining American Airlines,
international airlines, and a wide range of companies across other
sectors. SBTi works with companies to set rigorous, science-based
emissions reduction targets and empower suppliers and customers to
follow suit on climate action. Participating airlines have committed to
make meaningful and measurable progress on ambitious targets. American
Airlines became the first U.S. airline to commit to develop a
science-based target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2035,
supporting its existing commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
   
To support increased market demand for SAFs, RMI and Environmental
Defense Fund (EDF), launched the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance
(SABA) in April 2021 with founding companies Bank of America, Boston
Consulting Group, Boeing, Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Netflix
and Salesforce.  
  
*Fuel Providers Will Scale Up SAF Production*  
  
Current levels of domestic SAF production are approximately 4.5 million
gallons per year, with the industry poised to grow rapidly. To meet the
challenge of scaling up to billions of gallons over a decade, both
policy support and producer commitments will be critical to driving
domestic innovation and deployment. Scaling up domestic SAF production
will involve a wide variety of different feedstocks and pathways, and
the industry will continue to explore a diverse set of options,
including the potential to convert biofuels such as ethanol into jet
fuel. To help achieve our 2030 goals, several fuel providers have
announced domestic SAF production targets:

-   LanzaJet plans to produce 1 billion gallons of SAF per year 2030
    from ethanol derived from waste sources by Alcohol-to-Jet
    processing.
-   World Energy plans to produce 150 million gallons of SAF per year by
    2024 from fats, oils, and greases by hydroprocessing.
-   Gevo plans to produce over 150 million gallons of SAF per year by
    2025 from crop residue to ethanol by Alcohol-to-jet processing.
-   Fulcrum plans to produce more than 33 million gallons of SAF per
    year by 2022 from MSW processed by Fischer-Tropsch processing.
-   Velocys plans to produce 300 million gallons of blended SAF per year
    from waste woody biomass and MSW processed by Fischer-Tropsch
    processing.
-   Additional recent and new announcements of potential SAF production
    scale-up include those from BP, Virent, Honeywell, Shell, Neste,
    Marquis, Green Plains Inc., ADM, Prometheus, Aemetis, and members of
    the Renewable Fuels Association and members of Growth Energy.

*Airports Will Improve Operational Efficiency and Support SAF Fueling*  
  
Many airports have committed to sustainable operations. The members of
Airports Council International- North America (ACI-NA) have joined in
the commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, an
industry-wide goal announced in May. Progress toward this goal will not
only mitigate the aviation sector’s climate impact by reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, but also improve the local environment for
airport workers, nearby residents, and the broader region that utilizes
air transport for passenger and cargo travel.  
SAF is already commercially available and regularly used on passenger
flights at Los Angeles, CA (LAX) and San Francisco, CA (SFO); and
several airports are pursuing the infrastructure required to enable SAF
deliveries in the future. Many airports are pursuing operational
efficiency and emissions reduction efforts. Industry-leading examples
include: 

-   Indianapolis, IN (IND) has one of the largest solar farms on any
    airport property in the world, in addition to being a leader in
    electric airport shuttle bus fleets.
-   Philadelphia, PA (PHL) has established comprehensive air quality
    initiatives and launched a series of energy efficiency and
    benchmarking initiatives that include terminal facilities and ground
    support equipment.
-   Salt Lake City, UT (SLC) generates 7 percent of its energy from
    renewable sources, including on-site solar.
-   San Diego, CA (SAN) is the first U.S. airport to establish a regular
    sustainability report in order to measure progress on a range of
    environmental goals.
-   Dallas-Fort Worth, TX (DFW) has set a goal of achieving Net Zero
    Carbon by 2030.
-   A number of U.S. airports have individual road maps to achieve net
    zero emissions and are actively participating in the Airport Carbon
    Accreditation certification program.
