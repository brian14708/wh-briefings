  \ Trade and Technology Council\_Meeting"

At the U.S.-EU Summit, President Joe Biden, European Commission
President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles
Michel established the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) to
expand and deepen trade and transatlantic investment ties and update the
rules of the road for the 21<sup>st</sup> century economy. Building on
our shared democratic values and economic relationship — the world’s
largest — we look forward to working together to ensure trade and
technology policies deliver for our people.

President Biden’s delegated co-chairs for the TTC, Secretary of State
Antony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and United States
Trade Representative Katherine Tai, will host European Commission
Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis for
the inaugural TTC meeting on September 29<sup>th</sup> in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh has reinvented itself as a hub for technology
and cutting-edge industry by investing in itself and in its workers,
including by building ties with European partners.

The TTC’s ten working groups will tackle a diverse set of challenges,
including technology standards cooperation, supply chain security,
climate and green technology, ICT security and competitiveness, data
governance and technology platforms, the misuse of technology
threatening security and human rights, export controls, investment
screening, global trade challenges, and access to, and use of, digital
technologies by small and medium enterprises. In conjunction with the
TTC, both governments are committed to robust and ongoing engagement
with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure that the outcomes from this
cooperation support broad-based growth in both economies and are
consistent with our shared values.
