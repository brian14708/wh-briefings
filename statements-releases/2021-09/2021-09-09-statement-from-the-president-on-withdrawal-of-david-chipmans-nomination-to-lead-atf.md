title: "Statement from the President on Withdrawal of David Chipman\u2019s Nomination\
  \ to Lead\_ATF"

David Chipman spent 25 years in distinguished service to our country as
an ATF agent. He’s a gun owner himself, and someone who has the backing
of law enforcement groups. And, he’s spent most of last decade as a
leading voice for commonsense gun violence prevention legislation that
will save lives. He would have been an exemplary Director of the ATF and
would have redoubled its efforts to crack down on illegal firearms
traffickers and help keep our communities safe from gun violence.  
  
Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress have made clear that they intend
to use gun crime as a political talking point instead of taking serious
steps to address it. That’s why they’ve moved in lockstep to block David
Chipman’s confirmation, and it’s why they side with gun manufacturers
over the overwhelming majority of the American people in opposing
commonsense measures like universal background checks.  
  
They even unanimously opposed the Rescue Plan, which has given cities
and states $350 billion that they can use to put more cops on the beat
so that they can really know the neighborhoods they patrol, and invest
in proven community anti-violence programs – among other uses. While my
administration has worked to strengthen law enforcement and crack down
on gun crime, Republicans have opposed us at every turn.  
  
We knew this wouldn’t be easy – there’s only been one Senate-confirmed
ATF Director in the Bureau’s history – but I have spent my entire career
working to combat the scourge of gun violence, and I remain deeply
committed to that work. Since taking office, my Administration has taken
numerous steps to combat gun violence, and we’ll continue to use every
tool at our disposal to fight gun violence and keep Americans safe. I am
grateful for Mr. Chipman’s service and for his work.
