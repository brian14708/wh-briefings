WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate
Willie L. Phillips, Jr. as a Commissioner of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). FERC is an independent agency that
regulates the interstate transmission of natural gas, oil, electricity,
and other energy projects, ensuring that consumers can access
affordable, efficient, safe, reliable, and secure energy services. As
the Biden Administration works to tackle the climate crisis, advance
environmental justice, and create a clean electricity grid by 2035, FERC
will maintain an important role regulating the transmission of
carbon-free energy across the country.
