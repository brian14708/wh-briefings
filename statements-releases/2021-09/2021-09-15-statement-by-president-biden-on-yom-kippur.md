title: Statement by President Biden on Yom Kippur
---
 
For millennia, Jewish communities have marked Yom Kippur as an occasion
to reflect and pray; fast and seek forgiveness; account for past
transgressions, and commit to future change.

At its core, this sacred and solemn day reaffirms a universal principle
at the essence of our humanity: that, through word and deed, we each
have the ability to right wrongs, mend rifts, and heal wounds. That
every place where we have fallen short provides an opportunity for
growth, and that by acknowledging shortcomings with honesty and
humility, before our Creator and to one another, we can forge a more
promising future – for ourselves, for our communities, and for our
country.  

In that spirit, Jill and I extend our very best wishes for an easy and
meaningful fast to all who observe Yom Kippur in the United States,
Israel, and around the world. May we each be sealed in the Book of Life.

*G’mar Chatimah Tovah.*
