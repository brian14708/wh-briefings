title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Whole-of-Government Effort to\
  \ Ensure Child Tax Credit Reaches All Eligible\_Families"
---
 
The Child Tax Credit (CTC) is one of the most important tax cuts for
working families in more than a generation. The American Rescue Plan
increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child
for children over the age of six and from $2,000 to $3,600 for children
under the age of six, and raised the age limit from 16 to 17. Just four
months after the passage of the American Rescue Plan, families of **60
million children started to receive monthly payments,** on the same day
of every month, providing relief in every corner of the country.
Moreover, families of **26 million lower-income children are now
receiving the full credit for the first time** – previously these
families would have received less than the full credit because their
incomes were too low. The number of Black and Hispanic families eligible
for the full CTC also has doubled.

Most families are automatically enrolled in the Child Tax Credit, but
those who weren’t required to file a tax return in the last two years,
and who didn’t sign up for stimulus payments from the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) during the pandemic, need to sign up to receive payments.

Before the first payments went out, **the Biden-Harris Administration
<u>automatically enrolled</u> non-filer families with roughly 729,000
children** in monthly Child Tax Credit payments based on information
they provided to the IRS last year to sign up for Economic Impact
Payments.

The Administration is determined to build on this progress and ensure
this crucial relief gets to all eligible families. That’s why the White
House launched a whole-of-government effort to drive awareness of and
sign-ups for the Child Tax Credit. Agencies across the federal
government have heeded the call to reach as many children and families
as possible.

**Whole of Government Effort to Drive Enrollment in the Child Tax
Credit**

**<u>Department of the Treasury</u>**

-   **Training thousands of people to serve as Child Tax Credit
    navigators.** To facilitate new enrollments, the White House and
    Treasury Department collaborated with a non-profit, Code for
    America, to create a [non-filer sign-up
    tool](https://www.getctc.org/en) that is easy to use on a mobile
    phone and [available in Spanish](https://www.getctc.org/es). The
    White House and Treasury are partnering with federal agencies, state
    and local governments, national organizations, and community groups
    to train thousands of people across the country to serve as
    navigators who can walk families through the Code for America
    non-filer sign-up tool to enroll in the Child Tax Credit. The
    navigators are trusted messengers within their communities,
    providing approachable, hands-on expertise to non-filers. The White
    House and Treasury have arranged over 40 navigator trainings, with
    more to come in the weeks ahead.
-   **Aggressive outreach on the ground and online to reach families.**
    The IRS also embarked on an extensive communications and education
    effort to reach people who may be eligible for the advance CTC
    payments, with a special focus on reaching out to underserved
    communities across the country, as well as non-English speaking
    communities. As part of this ongoing effort, the IRS hosted free tax
    preparation days in nearly 30 cities across the country in June and
    July, has participated in more than 250 partner events on CTC,
    developed [online materials and
    toolkits](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/2021-child-tax-credit-and-advance-child-tax-credit-payments-resources-and-guidance),
    and more.  

**<u>AmeriCorps</u>**

-   **Launching a new partnership with Head Start to provide direct
    sign-up assistance in 16 cities.** AmeriCorps Seniors is partnering
    with the Administration for Children and Families, the Office of
    Head Start, and the National Head Start Association to provide
    targeted support to non-filers in 16 cities across the country. The
    partnership will bring Head Start staff and AmeriCorps Seniors
    volunteers to help families sign-up during the fall. Through this
    partnership, AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers will be able to serve
    onsite at designated Head Start centers for an agreed upon length of
    time. Head Start Center Family Services Staff will conduct
    individual screenings to identify prospective non-filers, who will
    in turn work with AmeriCorps Seniors RSVP volunteers to walk through
    the details of CTC, determine eligibility, and support their
    navigation through the non-filer portal, resulting in the enrollment
    of eligible non-filers.
-   **Extended program flexibility to facilitate Child Tax Credit
    outreach and enrollment efforts to more than 4,000 full-time
    AmeriCorps VISTA members.** The guidance provides temporary program
    flexibility related to Child Tax Credit activities to all currently
    serving AmeriCorps VISTA members and sponsors. This opportunity is
    available to 4,000+ currently serving VISTA members in all 50 states
    and territories. The flexibility allows interested sponsors and
    members to include Child Tax Credit outreach, education, and
    individualized navigation into their current VISTA project
    assignments.
-   **Launching partnership with HUD for CTC enrollment.** AmeriCorps
    VISTA is entering into a partnership with HUD, working to mobilize
    over 200 HUD-VISTA members to enroll HUD-assisted families for CTC.

**<u>Social Security Administration</u>**

-   **Published instructions for Educating the Public About the Impact
    of Child Tax Credit and Advanced Child Tax Credit on Supplemental
    Security Income (SSI). **The instructions, which are publicly
    available, provide guidance to 27,000 employees in over 1,200 local
    offices nationwide on how to educate individuals with children who
    are applying for or receiving SSI about the CTC and the advanced CTC
    payments and how the CTC should not affect their SSI benefits. This
    includes instructions to employees for providing guidance to SSI
    applicants and recipients about the Code for America online tool and
    reminds employees about existing policies regarding the impact of
    federal tax credits on SSI.
-   **Conducting five-week national marketing campaign** to reach
    low-income individuals, including people who receive SSI and Social
    Security benefits, directing individuals to visit
    [www.ssa.gov/eip](http://www.ssa.gov/eip) to learn how to claim the
    advanced CTC payments and missing EIP by using the Non-Filer Sign-up
    Tool developed by Code for America. This effort is estimated to
    generate 1.5 billion viewing and listening impressions.

**<u>Department of Health and Human Services</u>**

-   ****Embedding**** **Child Tax Credit training and outreach into
    dozens of HHS programs.** These programs fund community resource
    centers, referral networks, and direct services. This effort is
    focused on reaching people in areas of greatest needed, as well as
    serving the most under-resourced and disconnected families including
    runaway and homeless youth, victims of domestic violence, victims of
    trafficking, child welfare-involved, refugee families, Native
    American families, and low-income families with young children.
-   **Launching an innovative parent-led CTC enrollment pilot in New
    England.** Parents are often the best trusted messengers within a
    community. ACF is launching a pilot to test whether parent-led
    messaging and trusted navigators in safe civic locales such as
    schools, libraries, parks, and community agencies can increase
    sign-ups. As part of the Whole Family Approach to Jobs Initiative,
    parents will be messengers for other parents. Parents who have not
    yet signed up will then be matched with safe navigators in familiar
    settings. The parent messengers will meet regularly to share
    outreach lessons. This parent peer-to-peer learning exchange will
    occur within and across participating states to reach as many
    parents as possible. If successful, this model may be replicable.
-   **Launching partnership with HUD to reach individuals and families
    who experience domestic, sexual and dating violence.** ACF’s Family
    Violence and Prevention Services Program is partnering with HUD’s
    Office of Special Needs Assistance Programs to conduct navigator
    training for grantees and providers that serve individuals and
    families who experience domestic, sexual, and dating violence, as
    well individuals that participate in HUD’s Housing Opportunities for
    Persons With AIDS Program. Building on these efforts, ACF and HUD
    will also explore ways to reach families served by additional of our
    programs**.**
-   **Connecting with parents of young children in partnership with the
    Department of Education.** With the Department of Education, ACF
    will host a joint webinar in Spanish for parents of young children.
    ACF will also work with national parent organizations to host
    webinars in their communities, scheduled during non-traditional work
    hours, including weekend and evening hours to accommodate working
    families.
-   **Launching a new Head Start/AmeriCorps partnership in 16 cities
    across the countries,** as outlined above.
-   **HHS staff in regional offices across the country collaborate on
    outreach.** Regional Operations offices are meeting to share
    tactics, strategies, and messaging with a focus on community and
    state strategies to reach those who have not yet signed up for the
    Child Tax Credit.

**<u>The Department of Education</u>**

-   **Promoting CTC in back-to-school efforts,** including incorporating
    CTC enrollment in the Return to School Roadmap parent checklist
    provided to families and organizations (in English and Spanish) and
    sharing CTC materials with membership of the National PTA,
    Superintendents Association, Council of Great City Schools,
    Elementary and Secondary Schools Principals Associations, school
    public relations association, Unidos, National Urban, and
    faith-based organizations.
-   **Training school and out-of-school staff as CTC enrollment
    navigators for families,** including staff from community schools,
    promise neighborhoods, 21<sup>st</sup> century community learning
    centers, Salvation Army, YMCA, National Urban League, Communities in
    Schools, and Unidos.

**<u>The Department of Housing and Urban Development</u>**

-   ****Mobilizing thousands of on-the-ground staff to reach 3.3 million
    children who live in HUD-assisted households, including 897,000
    children under the age of six.**** HUD is working with public
    housing authorities, multifamily housing property managers, resident
    services providers, housing counselors, Continuums of Care, victim
    service providers and tribal organizations to conduct **10** CTC
    navigator trainings in September in an effort to reach the 1.6
    million HUD-assisted households with children and thousands of
    families experiencing homelessness. These trainings will target the
    staff at the over 3,000 Public Housing Authorities (PHA), the nearly
    2,000 PHA-based service providers, 2,000 tribal housing partners,
    and nearly 400 Continuums of Care. Other trainings will target the
    roughly 16,000 housing counselors, as well as thousands of property
    managers and resident service providers.
-   **Driving CTC enrollment through interagency partnerships.** HUD and
    HHS are partnering to provide navigator trainings to victim service
    providers to reach survivors of domestic violence, dating violence,
    sexual assault, and human trafficking. HUD is also working with
    AmeriCorps to mobilize over 200 HUD-VISTA members to enroll
    HUD-assisted families for CTC.
-   **Releasing a digital bilingual toolkit.** HUD has developed a
    digital toolkit to reach the 1.6. million HUD-assisted households
    with children. Content was created in English and Spanish and
    connects families to the new, mobile-friendly, bilingual Code for
    America non-filer portal. The toolkit makes clear that other
    benefits will not be affected by the CTC in any way and is being
    disseminated by the Office of Field Policy and Management (FPM)
    through social media, navigator trainings, and the creation of a new
    site on HUD.gov to house CTC resources.

**<u>Department of Labor</u>**

-   **Issuing guidance to encourage sign-up activity at the more than
    2,400 American Jobs Centers across the country.** The Employment and
    Training Administration (ETA) is issuing guidance this fall in the
    form of a Training and Employment Notice to state workforce
    agencies, state workforce development boards, local workforce
    development boards, and staff across roughly 2,400 American Jobs
    Centers (AJCs), making them aware of the CTC and encouraging AJCs to
    help enroll workers in financial supports such as the Child Tax
    Credit. A navigator training will be shared with all AJC staff and
    will be available on DOL’s WorkforceGPS website. In July, the ETA
    sent materials on the Child Tax Credit to over 2,500recipients that
    represent the public workforce system with a request for them to
    share with customers of the AJCs, partner organizations, and other
    constituents.
-   **The Women’s Bureau has coordinated roundtables with working
    parents**, **community-based organizations, and civic and policy
    leaders** on the Child Tax Credit and has disseminated information
    on CTC to over 140,000 stakeholders. The Women’s Bureau will also
    include CTC as a focus in their new Fostering Access Rights and
    Equity (FARE) grant program which aims to help low-income women
    workers learn about and access their rights and benefits, as well as
    create and co-create print, video and other informational content to
    share across its regional offices and network of community
    stakeholders.

**<u>Department of the Interior</u>**

    state directors** encouraging their engagement in enrolling SNAP
    households in the Child Tax Credit and reminding them that CTC does
    not count as income for SNAP purposes.
-   **Issued a policy memorandum to all Special Supplemental Nutrition
    Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) state agencies**
    highlighting the Child Tax Credit and the exclusion of it when
    calculating income for WIC eligibility.
-   **Promoting navigator trainings for thousands of front-line benefits
    staff.** USDA is publicizing trainings directly to state and local
    WIC and SNAP program staff, and through the American Public Human
    Services Association, National WIC Association, and the National
    Indian and Native American WIC Coalition.

**<u>The Department of Transportation</u>**

-   **Shared Child Tax Credit information with more than 40,000 people**
    in a newsletter, including most transit agencies in the nation,
    encouraging transit agencies to help amplify the CTC to customers of
    their public transit systems that may benefit from the credit.

**An Unprecedented Impact on Millions of Families**

In just three months, the Child Tax Credit’s impact on children and
families is unprecedented and consistent. According to the [Census Pulse
survey](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/economic-hardship-declined-in-households-with-children-as-child-tax-credit-payments-arrived.html),
food instability among all families with children fell by 24%
immediately after the first payments went out. A [Columbia University
analysis](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/monthly-poverty-july-2021)
found that low-income families with children who received the first
monthly payment experienced a 43% decline in food insufficiency. The
analysis also found that ​​the share of parents who missed mortgage or
rent payments and who reported having difficulty with expenses fell with
the delivery of the first payment.

The American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 per
child to $3,000 per child for children over the age of six and from
$2,000 to $3,600 for children under the age of six, and raised the age
limit from 16 to 17. All working families will get the full credit if
they make up to $150,000 for a couple or $112,500 for a family with a
single parent (also called Head of Household) – providing parents with
extra help to cover the costs of raising their kids.

For the first time, people will receive the Child Tax Credit in monthly
payments. For every child 6-17 years old, families are getting up to
$250 each month, and for every child under 6 years old, families are
getting up to $300 each month. As of September 2021, the Child Tax
Credit is already reaching families of roughly 60 million children, with
nearly 9 in 10 families receiving it as an automatic direct deposit on
the 15<sup>th</sup> of every month. People who don’t use direct deposit
will receive their payment by mail around the same time.

Almost any family with one or more dependent children under 18 is
eligible. Signing up for Child Tax Credit payments does not affect other
benefits and may also allow families to get previous stimulus payments
they have not collected.
