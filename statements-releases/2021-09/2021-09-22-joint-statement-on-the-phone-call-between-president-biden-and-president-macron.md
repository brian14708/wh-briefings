  Macron"
---
 
President Emmanuel Macron of the French Republic and President Joe Biden
of the United States of America spoke on September 22, at the request of
the latter, in order to discuss the implications of the announcement on
September 15. The two leaders agreed that the situation would have
benefited from open consultations among allies on matters of strategic
interest to France and our European partners. President Biden conveyed
his ongoing commitment in that regard.  
  
The two leaders have decided to open a process of in-depth
consultations, aimed at creating the conditions for ensuring confidence
and proposing concrete measures toward common objectives. They will meet
in Europe at the end of October in order to reach shared understandings
and maintain momentum in this process. President Emmanuel Macron has
decided that the French Ambassador will return to Washington next week.
He will then start intensive work with senior US officials.  
  
President Biden reaffirms the strategic importance of French and
European engagement in the Indo-Pacific region, including in the
framework of the European Unionâ€™s recently published strategy for the
Indo-Pacific. The United States also recognizes the importance of a
stronger and more capable European defense, that contributes positively
to transatlantic and global security and is complementary to NATO.  
  
In the framework of their joint fight against terrorism, the United
States commits to reinforcing its support to counter-terrorism
operations in the Sahel conducted by European states.
