title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Continuing Resolution
---
 
Tonight, I signed into law the continuing resolution to fund the
government through early December. I want to thank both houses of
Congress—especially Senators Leahy and Shelby and Representatives
DeLauro and Granger—for this bipartisan agreement, and for avoiding a
government shutdown as we have seen so often in the past.

It meets critical and urgent needs of the nation, including disaster
relief for both red and blue states hit hard by Hurricane Ida and other
devastating natural disasters, and funding to help us resettle Afghan
allies in the United States following the end of the 20-year war in
Afghanistan. This funding will also keep up our fight against COVID-19
and—on this International Recovery Day—it will continue our battle
against the opioid crisis.

There’s so much more to do. But the passage of this bill reminds us that
bipartisan work is possible and it gives us time to pass longer-term
funding to keep our government running and delivering for the American
people.
