title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on the Executive Order Regarding\
  \ the Crisis in\_Ethiopia"
---
 
The ongoing conflict in northern Ethiopia is a tragedy causing immense
human suffering and threatens the unity of the Ethiopian state.  Nearly
one million people are living in famine-like conditions, and millions
more face acute food insecurity as a direct consequence of the
violence.  Humanitarian workers have been blocked, harassed, and
killed.  I am appalled by the reports of mass murder, rape, and other
sexual violence to terrorize civilian populations.   
   
The United States is determined to push for a peaceful resolution of
this conflict, and we will provide full support to those leading
mediation efforts, including the African Union High Representative for
the Horn of Africa Olusegun Obasanjo.  We fully agree with United
Nations and African Union leaders: there is no military solution to this
crisis.  
   
I join leaders from across Africa and around the world in urging the
parties to the conflict to halt their military campaigns respect human
rights, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and come to the
negotiating table without preconditions.  Eritrean forces must withdraw
from Ethiopia. A different path is possible but leaders must make the
choice to pursue it.  
   
My Administration will continue to press for a negotiated ceasefire, an
end to abuses of innocent civilians, and humanitarian access to those in
need.  The Executive Order I signed today establishes a new sanctions
regime that will allow us to target those responsible for, or complicit
in, prolonging the conflict in Ethiopia, obstructing humanitarian
access, or preventing a ceasefire.  It provides the Department of the
Treasury with the necessary authority to hold accountable those in the
Government of Ethiopia, Government of Eritrea, the Tigray People’s
Liberation Front, and Amhara regional government, among others, that
continue to pursue conflict over negotiations to the detriment of the
Ethiopian people.  
   
The United States remains committed to supporting the people of Ethiopia
and to strengthening the historic ties between our countries.  
   
These sanctions are not directed at the people of Ethiopia or Eritrea,
but rather the individuals and entities perpetrating the violence and
driving a humanitarian disaster. We provide Ethiopia with more
humanitarian and development assistance than does any other country 
<s> </s> benefitting all of its regions. We will continue to work with
our partners to address basic needs of at-risk populations in Ethiopia
and the greater Horn of Africa.
