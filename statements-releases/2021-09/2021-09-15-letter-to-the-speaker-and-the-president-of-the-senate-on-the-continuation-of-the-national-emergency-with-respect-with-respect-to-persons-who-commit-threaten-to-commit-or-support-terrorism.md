Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to persons who commit,
threaten to commit, or support terrorism declared in Executive Order
13224 of September 23, 2001, as amended, is to continue in effect beyond
September 23, 2021.  
  
The crisis constituted by the grave acts of terrorism and threats of
terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, including the terrorist
attacks on September 11, 2001, in New York and Pennsylvania and against
the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks
on United States nationals or the United States that led to the
declaration of a national emergency on September 23, 2001, has not been
resolved.  This crisis continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States.  For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary
to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13224, as
amended, with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or
support terrorism.  
                            

 Sincerely,  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
