*Interagency Working Group is Leading Whole of Government Effort to
Invest in Coal, Oil and Gas, and Power Plant Communities*

Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and National Economic
Council Director Brian Deese convened the Interagency Working Group on
Coal and Power Plant Communities, where they were joined by Cabinet
members and senior leadership from across the federal government. They
discussed the Administration’s efforts to-date that support economic
revitalization in energy communities and how President Biden’s Build
Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will further
deliver for these communities.  
  
The Interagency Working Group discussed recent senior administration
official travel to energy communities in West Virginia, Pennsylvania,
North Dakota, Colorado, and Arizona’s Navajo and Hopi energy
communities. Collectively, since release of the [initial report of the
Interagency Working Group](https://netl.doe.gov/IWGInitialReport) in
April, senior administration officials have held nearly a dozen
in-person and virtual listening sessions in key energy communities,
which have been attended by thousands of state, local, and Tribal
officials, labor unions, business leaders, environmental justice
organizations, and community groups. This extensive engagement informs
the working group’s efforts to further coordinate federal resources,
reduce barriers to access for energy communities, and grow the economy
for everybody – including those who have been left behind for far too
long.  
  
The Interagency Working Group also discussed recent agency funding
announcements that have prioritized energy communities, including the
Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) [$300
million Coal Communities
Commitment](https://energycommunities.netl.doe.gov/u-s-secretary-of-commerce-gina-raimondo-announces-3-billion-investment-in-americas-communities/)
to support economic revitalization, infrastructure investments, and
quality jobs in coal communities, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
investment of [$167 million in priority energy
communities](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/09/09/usda-invests-464-million-renewable-energy-infrastructure-help-rural)
through the Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP) and the Electric
Loan Program, and the Appalachian Regional Commission’s announcement of
its [largest ever package of $46.4
million](https://www.arc.gov/news/appalachian-regional-commission-announces-nearly-46-4-million-to-continue-economic-transformation-in-regions-coal-impacted-communities/)
in grant awards to coal communities through the Partnerships for
Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) program.  
  
Senior officials also discussed how the President’s Build Back Better
Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will deliver necessary clean
energy and manufacturing investments to coal and power plant communities
to spur economic revitalization. Historic investments in environmental
remediation will also create good-paying, union jobs in hard-hit energy
communities – cleaning up superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming
abandoned mine lands, and capping orphaned gas wells.  
  
Pursuant to President Biden’s January 27<sup>th</sup> Executive Order
14008*,*[Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/)*,*
