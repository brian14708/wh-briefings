diplomatic staff from the United States and several partner nations, and
vulnerable Afghan nationals.  The President and Emir underscored the
longstanding partnership between the United States and Kuwait and agreed
on the importance of continuing to work together to address regional
challenges.  The President thanked the Emir for his personal commitment
to diplomacy and de-escalating tensions in the Middle East region.  The
two leaders welcomed ongoing efforts to expand cooperation among
neighboring states, exemplified most recently by the regional summit for
cooperation and partnership held in Baghdad.
