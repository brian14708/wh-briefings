title: Readout of Meeting Between Senior White House Officials and Congressional Black
  Caucus Members on the Situation in Del Rio, TX
---
 
Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, Director of Public Engagement
and Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond, Chief of Staff to the Vice President
Tina Flournoy, and National Security Council Senior Director for the
Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez met with members of the Congressional
Black Caucus to discuss the ongoing efforts to address irregular
migration in Del Rio, TX and ensure Haitian migrants are treated with
dignity and respect.

During the meeting, the Congressional Black Caucus members emphasized
the importance of supporting the Haitian people and Haitian diaspora in
an equitable manner.

White House officials highlighted the President’s commitment to
implementing a safe, humane, and orderly immigration process. Officials
also emphasized the Administration’s commitment to providing aid to the
Haitian people as the largest humanitarian donor in Haiti. 

U.S. agencies, led by USAID, recently provided $32 million in new
assistance to support earthquake response efforts. In January 2021, the
Biden-Harris Administration also announced $75.5 million in bilateral
development and health assistance for a wide range of issues for Haiti.
Since the 2010 earthquake, the United States has made available over
$5.1 billion for assistance to Haiti to support life-saving,
post-disaster relief as well as longer-term recovery, reconstruction,
and development programs.

Congressional Black Caucus members and White House officials pledged to
continue an open dialogue on the situation.

*Participants included:*

-   Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Chair of the Congressional Black
    Caucus

and community leaders.
