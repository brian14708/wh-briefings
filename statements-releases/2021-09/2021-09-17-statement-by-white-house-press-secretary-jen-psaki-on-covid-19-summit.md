On Wednesday September 22 President Biden will convene a virtual COVID
Summit on the margins of the UN General Assembly.  
  
This meeting is about expanding and enhancing our shared efforts to
defeat COVID-19, building out from previous gatherings of world leaders
and ministers in fora like the G7, G20, and Act Accelerator to rally
civil society, NGOs, philanthropists, and industry along with world
leaders and align on a common vision for defeating COVID-19 together.  
  
We will be asking participants to commit to of a higher level of
ambition across four themes:

-   **Vaccinate the World** by enhancing equitable access to vaccines
    and getting shots in arms.
-   **Save Lives Now** by solving the oxygen crisis, and making tests,
    therapeutics and PPE more available.
-   **Build Back Better** by establishing a sustainable health security
    financing mechanism, and global leadership for emerging threats.
-   **Calling the World to Account** by aligning around targets,
    tracking progress, and supporting one another in fulfilling our
    commitments.  
      
    We will have more to share on the COVID Summit in the coming days.
