title: "Readout of Senior White\_House Meeting with Faith Leaders on Efforts to Relocate\
  \ Afghan\_Allies"
---
 
Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, Department of Homeland
Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, White House Coordinator for
Operation Allies Welcome Jack Markell, and staff from the White House
Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships met with a diverse
group of faith leaders who are welcoming and helping relocate Afghan
evacuees across the country. These Afghans include people who worked as
staff of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and their families, those who served
as translators and interpreters for our government, and other Afghans at
risk, including members of persecuted faiths, human rights defenders,
journalists, and women and girls.  
  
The religious leaders described steps they are taking to encourage their
congregations and communities to get involved in this effort, such as by
providing donations or volunteer support for refugee resettlement
agencies—many of which are faith-based—and by contacting their state and
local representatives to encourage them to welcome Afghan arrivals. They
shared personal stories about meeting the new arrivals, as well as
details of how the faith community is organizing to receive them in both
single-faith and multi-faith initiatives. Clergy stressed the need to
recognize that we are all connected and that everyone should be treated
with dignity and respect. They also noted that this effort provides an
opportunity for Americans to come together across our differences and
offer a compassionate response.  
  
Administration officials highlighted President Biden’s commitment to
ensuring not just a whole-of-government effort, but a whole-of-America
effort, through the recent appointment of Operation Allies Welcome White
House Coordinator, Governor Jack Markell. Leaders also discussed the
recent launch of the new Welcome.US website, a hub for organizations,
private sector companies, and Americans who are eager to welcome Afghans
and offer support. The religious leaders offered suggestions for new
ways to collaborate and expand engagement on this effort.   
  
Administration officials expressed deep gratitude for the work and
voices of these congregational leaders, noting that the faith community
has long been at the forefront of efforts to welcome refugees, asylees,
and other newcomers. The group pledged to collaborate further on the
shared aim of welcoming Afghan arrivals and helping them to thrive here
in the United States.
