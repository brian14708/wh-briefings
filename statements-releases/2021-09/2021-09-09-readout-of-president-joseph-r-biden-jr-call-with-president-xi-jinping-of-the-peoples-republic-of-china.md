title: "Readout of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Call with President Xi Jinping of\
  \ the People\u2019s Republic of\_China"
---
 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Xi Jinping of
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The two leaders had a broad,
strategic discussion in which they discussed areas where our interests
converge, and areas where our interests, values, and perspectives
diverge. They agreed to engage on both sets of issues openly and
straightforwardly. This discussion, as President Biden made clear, was
part of the United States’ ongoing effort to responsibly manage the
competition between the United States and the PRC. President Biden
underscored the United States’ enduring interest in peace, stability,
and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and the world and the two leaders
discussed the responsibility of both nations to ensure competition does
not veer into conflict.
