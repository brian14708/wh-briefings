Congratulations to my friend, Governor Gavin Newsom. The pandemic has
reminded us who we can count on, and Californians know they can count on
Governor Newsom. He is focused on beating back COVID-19, and helping the
state make a big comeback. In resoundingly rejecting this recall
attempt, California’s voters made it clear that the American people want
leaders who stand for women’s rights, voting rights, and workers’
rights.
