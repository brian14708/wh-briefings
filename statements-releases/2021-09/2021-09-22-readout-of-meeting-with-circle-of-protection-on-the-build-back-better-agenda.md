title: Readout of Meeting with Circle of Protection on the Build Back Better Agenda
---
 
Today, Cedric Richmond, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of
the White House Office of Public Engagement, hosted a meeting with the
Circle of Protection, a diverse coalition of Christian denominations
with close to 100 million members, to discuss President Biden’s Build
Back Better agenda and its historic investments in anti-poverty
initiatives and programs that support children and families. Melissa
Rogers, Executive Director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and
Neighborhood Partnerships, Josh Dickson, Deputy Director of the White
House Partnerships Office, and Trey Baker, White House Senior Advisor
for Public Engagement, also joined the meeting.

The meeting was part of the Administration’s efforts to hear directly
from Americans of all backgrounds about the impact the Build Back Better
agenda would have on their communities. The faith leaders stressed the
importance of including the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit,
and housing support in the bill. The group also discussed the need to
pass legislation that serves the common good, promotes racial equity,
and supports economic mobility and opportunity for children and families
of all backgrounds, especially the most vulnerable.

Administration officials reiterated the President’s commitment to
creating jobs, lifting children out of poverty, cutting taxes, and
lowering costs for working families in the Build Back Better agenda—all
paid for by making the tax code fairer and making the wealthiest and
large corporations pay their fair share. The Administration
also reiterated President Biden’s desire to ensure racial equity and
economic opportunity are foundational components of the bill, and
committed to continued engagement and partnership with these groups.
