title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Texas Law\_SB8"
---
 
Today, Texas law SB8 went into effect. This extreme Texas law blatantly
violates the constitutional right established under *Roe v. Wade *and
upheld as precedent for nearly half a century.  
  
The Texas law will significantly impair women’s access to the health
care they need, particularly for communities of color and individuals
with low incomes. And, outrageously, it deputizes private citizens to
bring lawsuits against anyone who they believe has helped another person
get an abortion, which might even include family members, health care
workers, front desk staff at a health care clinic, or strangers with no
connection to the individual.  
  
My administration is deeply committed to the constitutional right
established in *Roe v. Wade* nearly five decades ago and will protect
and defend that right.
