title: "Statement By President Joe\_Biden On Police Reform\_Negotiations"
---
 
The murder of George Floyd is a stain on the soul of America. It spurred
the nation to collectively demand justice, and we will be remembered for
how we responded to the call.  That is why I strongly supported the
House-passed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and have long urged
the Senate to join in passing meaningful police reform legislation that
includes accountability when law enforcement officers violate their
oaths.  I am deeply grateful to Senator Cory Booker and Congresswoman
Karen Bass for working tirelessly with the White House, the civil rights
community, and leading law enforcement groups, and for their relentless
efforts to negotiate a bipartisan bill in the Senate that is worthy of
George Floyd’s legacy.  Regrettably, Senate Republicans rejected
enacting modest reforms, which even the previous president had
supported, while refusing to take action on key issues that many in law
enforcement were willing to address.

I still hope to sign into law a comprehensive and meaningful police
reform bill that honors the name and memory of George Floyd, because we
need legislation to ensure lasting and meaningful change. But this
moment demands action, and we cannot allow those who stand in the way of
progress to prevent us from answering the call.  That is why my
Administration has already taken important steps, with the Justice
Department announcing new policies on chokeholds, no-knock warrants, and
body cameras.  In the coming weeks, we will continue to work with
Senator Booker, Congresswoman Bass, and other members of Congress who
are serious about meaningful police reform.  The White House will
continue to consult with the civil rights and law enforcement
communities, as well as victims’ families to define a path forward,
including through potential further executive actions I can take to
advance our efforts to live up to the American ideal of equal justice
under law.
