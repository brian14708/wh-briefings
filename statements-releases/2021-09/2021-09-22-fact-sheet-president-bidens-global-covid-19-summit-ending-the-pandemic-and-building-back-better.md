title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Global COVID-\u206019 Summit: Ending the\
  \ Pandemic and Building Back\_Better"
---
 
*September 22, 2021*

Today, President Biden convened heads of state and leaders from
international organizations, the private sector, philanthropies,
non-government organizations, and other partners for the Global COVID-19
Summit: Ending the Pandemic and Building Back Better, a virtual summit
on the margins of the UN General Assembly.  
  
The President called on leaders to elevate global ambition to end the
COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and to build back better global health
security to prevent and prepare for future pandemics.  As emerging
variants have set back global response efforts, President Biden
challenged the world to advance this agenda with new, focused urgency
and to cooperate to rapidly advance our collective response to this
crisis to secure our future.  
  
**<u>Conquering COVID-19: Measuring Progress, Collective Action, Common
Targets</u>**  
  
Throughout the Summit, world leaders answered the President’s call and
embraced a set of ambitious global targets across four themes:

-   **Vaccinate the World** by enhancing equitable access to vaccines
    and getting shots in arms;
-   **Save Lives Now** by solving the oxygen crisis and making tests,
    therapeutics, and personal protective equipment (PPE) widely
    available;
-   **Build Back Better** by preparing in all countries, establishing a
    sustainable health security financing mechanism, and demonstrating
    political leadership for emerging threats to prepare for and prevent
    future pandemics; and
-   **Calling the World to Account** by aligning around common global
    targets, tracking progress, and supporting one another in fulfilling
    our commitments.

The full set of targets is
available [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/22/fact-sheet-targets-for-global-covid-19-summit/).  
  
**<u>New U.S. Commitments toward Ending the Pandemic and Building Back
Better</u>**  
  
President Biden has prioritized  ending the COVID-19 pandemic since day
one, when he launched the [National Strategy on
COVID](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/National-Strategy-for-the-COVID-19-Response-and-Pandemic-Preparedness.pdf)-19

pandemic preparedness and response as a top national security priority. 
The United States has donated more vaccines than all other countries
combined, and earlier this year, launched a comprehensive [U.S. COVID-19
Global Response and Recovery
Framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/01/u-s-covid-19-global-response-and-recovery-framework/).  
  
The United States is leading the way toward ending the pandemic.  During
his remarks, the President called the world to action and announced
several bold new U.S. commitments to accelerate progress toward these
targets, including:  
  
**Vaccinating the World**

-   **Donate an Additional Half-Billion Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccines to the
    World:** Today, President Biden will announce that the U.S. is
    donating an additional half a billion Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
    vaccines to low and lower-middle income countries around the globe,
    with shipments starting in January 2022. This monumental commitment
    brings the total number of vaccines donated by the U.S. to over 1.1
    billion doses, including the 500 million Pfizer-BioNTech doses the
    U.S. already purchased in June and began shipping in August. With
    today’s announcement, the U.S. is donating three doses to the world
    for every one shot it has administered at home. To date, the U.S.
    has already shipped nearly 160 million doses to 100 countries –
    donating more vaccines than all other countries combined – for free
    and with zero strings attached, with millions more shipping each
    day.
-   **Getting Shots into Arms:** The U.S. Agency for International
    Development (USAID) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) plan to provide an additional $370 million for
    global vaccine readiness and capacity to get shots in arms where
    they are most needed. The U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation (DFC) will provide more than $383 million in political
    risk insurance to Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance to facilitate shipments
    of vaccines to nine countries across three continents, accelerating
    vaccine delivery to regions in greatest need.
-   **Expanding Local Production:** DFC, with support from our partners
    and the International Finance Corporation, has invested in several
    vaccine manufacturing facilities across Africa and India, which will
    collectively have the capacity to produce 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine
    doses for developing countries by 2022.
-   **Expanding Regional Capacity:** The United States calls on
    countries, vaccine manufacturers, and other partners to expand
    global and regional production of mRNA, viral vector, and/or protein
    subunit COVID-19 vaccines for low- and lower-middle income countries
    and to enhance transparency for data on production, availability,
    and projections for dose manufacturing.*.*
-   **Enhancing Transparency for Delivered Doses:** The United States
    urges vaccine manufacturers to make information on the supply and
    distribution of vaccines publicly available, so that countries and
    global partners can plan how to fill gaps and prioritize vaccine
    deliveries where they are needed most urgently.
-   **Support for a COVID-19 TRIPS Waiver**: Extraordinary times call
    for extraordinary measures. The United States supports a waiver of
    intellectual property protections in the WTO TRIPS Agreement for
    COVID-19 vaccines in service of ending this pandemic.

**Saving Lives Now**

-   **Reducing Disease and Deaths, and Responding Rapidly:** USAID and
    CDC are providing nearly $1.4 billion to reduce morbidity and
    mortality from COVID-19, mitigate transmission, and strengthen
    health systems, including to prevent, detect, and respond to
    pandemic threats. Within this total, USAID is providing $100 million
    to prioritize rapid response interventions. 
-   **Making Oxygen Available:** USAID plans to provide $50 million to
    expand access to oxygen, with a focus on bulk liquid oxygen. 
-   **Enhancing Testing:** CDC will provide $56 million in COVID-19
    testing support.
-   **Strengthening Health Systems to Fight COVID-19:** The President’s
    Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) will provide $250 million to
    support response efforts by leveraging its existing investments in
    health systems, infrastructure, and workforce to support screening,
    testing, PPE, and vaccine readiness and administration, while also
    combating HIV/AIDS.
-   **Enhancing the Global Fund:** The U.S. is providing $3.5 billion to
    the Global Fund for its COVID-19 response mechanism.
-   **Improve the detection, monitoring and mitigation of new COVID-19
    variants: **The United States will stand up the Center for
    Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics to support enhanced global
    variant tracking and analyses capabilities, including
    through cooperation with those developing the concept of a global
    pandemic radar, the World Health Organization (WHO)’s Global Hub for
    Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence and additional centers through
    this network.

**Building Back Better**

-   **Financing Global Health Security:** The United States calls on
    countries to design and establish a Global Health Security Financial
    Intermediary Fund (FIF), as recommended by the G20 Presidency’s High
    Level Independent Panel and other international experts.  Working
    with Congress, we will commit $250 million now in seed funding
    towards a FIF to combat this pandemic, which will also help prevent
    the next.  We have also requested an additional $850 million for the
    FIF from Congress.  Taking action this year will help us further
    build capacity so that all countries, everywhere, are able to
    prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats and mitigate
    outbreaks in their communities.  This commitment will build on, and
    not replace, the $630 million in health security funding and Global
    Health Security Agenda support in Fiscal Year 2021.
-   **Catalyze political leadership and attention for biological**
    crises, including by establishing a leader-level entity, such as the
    Global Health Threats Council (GHTC) in 2021.
-   **Special Drawing Rights (SDRs):** The United States strongly
    supported the new $650 billion allocation of SDRs to help countries
    boost reserves and fund critical spending to protect public health
    and minimize economic scarring.  To amplify the benefits of the
    allocation, we call on countries who can afford to do so to channel
    some of their SDRs to poor and vulnerable countries through the
    International Monetary Fund’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and
    through a new Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST). We
    encourage other members of the International Monetary Fund to
    endorse establishing an RST focused on helping countries pursue
    long-term structural reforms to improve pandemic preparedness and
    prevention and facilitate investments in a green economy.
-   **Bringing Health and Finance Leaders Together:** The United States
    supports the G20 Presidency’s call-to-action to establish a
    ministerial health and finance board to strengthen coordination
    between health and economic policymakers.

**<u>Accounting for Action: All Countries and Organizations must play
their part</u>**  
  
All countries and public and private organizations must commit to urgent
actions this fall.  The United States will lead by convening others so
that, collectively, we take the action necessary to end the pandemic. 
This is necessary to save lives now, and for all of us—including the
private sector—to make a down payment on the resilience of our economic
future.  Going forward, the United States will champion accountability,
in partnership with multilateral mechanisms.  The President stressed
that a critical element of success in ending the pandemic and building
back better will be to hold ourselves and the world accountable by
making those investments today.  To this end, he announced a new effort
to measure progress against our shared targets and maintain global
momentum to end the pandemic.   
  
**The Secretary of State will convene foreign ministers at the end of
the year to update on our collective progress and maintain global
urgency to cross the finish line and end the pandemic in 2022.**  
  
The United States will champion accountability so that the world can
measure our progress and meeting our commitments.  
  
Specifically:

-   The United States will work with a range of key partners in tracking
    results, including partner governments,  the United Nations
    Secretary-General, the Multilateral Leaders’ Task Force on COVID-19
    Vaccines, Therapeutics and Diagnostics for Developing Countries
    established by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World
    Trade Organization (WTO) and WHO, the private sector and the
    philanthropic community.
-   In early October 2021, we will bring together the Task Force,
    members of the private sector, the philanthropic community, and
    other key partners to analyze data that will enable us to evaluate
    our collective progress in advance of the G20 Summit, at other
    international gatherings, and on a regular basis.
-   We will work with governments, the international financial
    institutions and multilateral development banks, companies,
    foundations, and advocates to track and transparently report
    progress towards ending the pandemic.
-   We will work with global vaccine manufacturers to expand global and
    regional manufacturing for mRNA, viral vector, and/or protein
    subunit COVID-19 vaccines and to enhance transparency for data on
    production and projections for dose manufacturing.
