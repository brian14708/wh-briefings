title: "Joint Statement on the U.S.-Ukraine Strategic\_Partnership"
---
 
Thirty years after the restoration of Ukraine’s independence, the bonds
between the United States and Ukraine are stronger than ever.  Our
shared values and commitment to a Europe that is whole, free,
democratic, and at peace provide the basis for our strategic
partnership. We are working together to address shared global
challenges, including energy security and diversification, climate
change, and the COVID-19 pandemic.    
  
Our relationship serves as a cornerstone for security, democracy, and
human rights in Ukraine and the broader region. We are committed to
Ukraine’s implementation of the deep and comprehensive reforms necessary
to fulfill its European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.  We are also
united in our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity in the face of continued Russian aggression.  
  
Ukraine’s success is central to the global struggle between democracy
and autocracy.  As we face this challenge together, we stand
shoulder-to-shoulder, optimistic about our ambitious common goals to
advance democracy, deliver justice, enhance prosperity, and bolster
security for Ukraine.  Ukraine has achieved progress in building
institutions with integrity and intends, with U.S. support, to continue
to counter corruption, ensure accountability, safeguard human rights,
realize the aspirations of its citizens, and create favorable conditions
for attracting foreign direct investment and driving growth.   
  
The United States and Ukraine are reinvigorating the Strategic
Partnership Commission (SPC), reoriented and resourced to meet
21<sup>st</sup> century challenges.  To memorialize the elevated status
of our partnership, the U.S. Secretary of State and the Ukrainian
Foreign Minister intend to approve a new Charter at the SPC’s meeting in
Washington this fall.

**I. Security and Defense**  
*In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, nations cannot be allowed to redraw
borders by force.Russia violated this ground rule in Ukraine.Sovereign
states have the right to make their own decisions and choose their own
alliances. The United States stands with Ukraine and will continue to
work to hold Russia accountable for its aggression.* *America’s support
for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering.*

-   **Standing up to Russian Aggression**:   Russia’s aggression,
    including the war in eastern Ukraine and its seizure of Crimea, has
    claimed more than 14,000 Ukrainian lives, destabilized Europe and
    the Black Sea region, and threatened the global rules-based order. 
    The United States does not and will never recognize Russia’s
    purported annexation of Crimea and reaffirms its full support for
    international efforts, including in the Normandy Format, aimed at
    negotiating a diplomatic resolution to the Russian-led conflict in
    eastern Ukraine on the basis of international law, including the UN
    Charter. The United States supports Ukraine’s efforts to use the
    Crimea Platform to focus international attention and action on the
    humanitarian and security costs of Russia’s occupation of Crimea
    with the aim of peacefully restoring Ukraine’s control over this
    territory in accordance with international law.  Together, we call
    on Russia to recommit to the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and engage
    genuinely in conflict resolution efforts to end the war.   
-   **Deepening Strategic Defense Cooperation**:  The United States and
    Ukraine have finalized a Strategic Defense Framework that creates a
    foundation for the enhancement of U.S.-Ukraine strategic defense and
    security cooperation and the advancement of shared priorities,
    including implementing defense and defense industry reforms,
    deepening cooperation in areas such as Black Sea security, cyber
    defense, and intelligence sharing, and countering Russian
    aggression.  
-   **Supporting Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic Aspirations:**  As the United
    States and Allies reaffirmed in the June 2021 NATO Summit
    Communique, the United States supports Ukraine’s right to decide its
    own future foreign policy course free from outside interference,
    including with respect to Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO.  We
    also remain committed to assisting Ukraine with ongoing reforms. 
       
-   **Providing Ukraine with Security Assistance**: The United States is
    announcing a new $60 million security assistance package, including
    additional Javelin anti-armor systems and other defensive lethal and
    non-lethal capabilities, to enable Ukraine to more effectively
    defend itself against Russian aggression. The United States has
    committed $2.5 billion in support of Ukraine’s forces since 2014,
    including more than $400 million this year alone.  
-   **Cooperating on R&D**:  The United States and Ukraine have
    finalized a Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Agreement
    that provides a framework for pursuing bilateral armaments and
    military-technical cooperation.  
-   **Enacting Defense and Security Sector Reforms**:  The United States
    welcomes Ukraine’s continued progress on defense and defense
    industry reforms, including the adoption of a new defense industry
    strategy.  We intend to continue our robust training and exercise
    program in keeping with Ukraine’s status as a NATO Enhanced
    Opportunities Partner.  Ukraine plans to continue taking steps to
    enhance democratic civilian control of the military, reform the
    security services, and modernize its defense acquisition process to
    advance its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. The United States supports
    Ukraine’s plan to reform the Security Service of Ukraine by
    streamlining and clearly defining its authorities and strengthening
    regulations that protect human rights and provide for effective
    public oversight.  
-   **Collaborating on Cybersecurity:** The United States and Ukraine
    prioritize cybersecurity issues at the leadership level. In October,
    the U.S. and Ukrainian governments plan to hold the 4<sup>th</sup>
    U.S.-Ukraine Bilateral Cyber Dialogue in Kyiv to bolster bilateral
    cybersecurity cooperation, information sharing, and U.S. support for
    Ukraine’s cybersecurity capacity building, including in Ukraine’s
    financial sector.  
-   **Increasing Situational Awareness in Space**: The United States and
    Ukraine have signed a Space Situational Awareness MOU that enables
    more effective information sharing on space objects detected by
    satellites and ground sensors to facilitate space flight safety.  
-   **Enhancing Risk and Cooperative Threat Reduction**:  The United
    States and Ukraine have reached agreement on maintaining a secure
    24/7 communications link through the National and Nuclear Risk
    Reduction Center.  We have also agreed to a seven-year extension of
    the Agreement Regarding Assistance to Ukraine in the Elimination of
    Strategic Nuclear Arms, and the Prevention of Proliferation of
    Weapons of Mass Destruction, signed in 1993, to support mutual
    nonproliferation objectives and bolster regional and international
    security.  

**II. Democracy, Justice, and Human Rights**  
*The United States and Ukraine are bound by the universal values that
unite the free people of the world: democracy, human rights, the rule of
law. We also recognize that living up to these values at home is
essential to defending and advancing them around the world. Despite
Russia’s continuing aggression, Ukraine has made progress in
implementing comprehensive democratic and human rights reforms. With
U.S. support,* *Ukraine is pursuing a reform agenda to transform the
country in line with European and Euro-Atlantic principles and
practices.*

-   **Reforming the Judiciary and Combatting Corruption:** Building upon
    the passage of judicial reform legislation, Ukraine plans to
    overhaul its judicial sector in line with international best
    practices.  At the same time, Ukraine intends to build on the
    successful establishment of its independent anti-corruption
    infrastructure to implement critical initiatives that protect the
    independence and improve the effectiveness of these institutions in
    rooting out corruption and holding corrupt actors accountable. 
    These steps include promptly selecting a new Specialized
    Anti-Corruption Prosecutor consistent with international best
    practices, and passing legislation to safeguard the authority of the
    National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine director as well as
    ensure a transparent and credible process for selecting a
    successor.  United States’ assistance and advisory programs support
    these strategic reform initiatives.  
-   **Advancing Human Rights**:  With U.S. support, Ukraine will
    continue to advance respect for human rights, civil liberties, and
    fundamental freedoms in accordance with international standards and
    obligations, as well as to fight racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism,
    and discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community.  Ukraine plans to
    strengthen accountability for violence against all persons
    regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation,
    or political views, including through legislation.  Ukraine and the
    United States intend to continue holding Russia accountable for
    ongoing systemic abuses in the territories of Ukraine controlled or
    occupied by Russia and to seek the release of political prisoners
    and hostages held in these territories.   
-   **Investing in Ukraine’s Reform Agenda:** Governance reform is
    critical to ensuring democracy delivers for the people.  Ukraine has
    committed to prioritizing reforms that strengthen its democratic
    institutions, bolster human rights, and deliver justice. To that
    end, Ukraine is developing an ambitious and comprehensive *Plan of
    Transformation*, which will be considered at the next SPC meeting. 
    In support of Ukraine’s reform efforts, the U.S. government has
    provided Ukraine with nearly $2 billion in development assistance
    since 2014 and plans to allocate over $463 million in assistance
    this year, including for programs focused on democracy, human
    rights, local governance and decentralization, privatization, and
    judicial reform.   

**III. Energy Security and Climate**  
*The climate crisis has reached a critical point that demands urgent
action, which we are both addressing. The United States and Ukraine are
advancing Ukraine’s energy security through sustainable, effective, and
long-lasting policy solutions backed up by ongoing corporate governance
reform.*

-   **Establishing a Strategic Energy and Climate Dialogue:** The United
    States and Ukraine intend to bolster collaboration on shared energy
    and climate goals through a reinvigorated Strategic Energy and
    Climate Dialogue, which will provide a strong platform to advance
    energy security objectives, enhance economic ties, and achieve
    ambitious climate targets.  
-   **Attracting Energy Sector Investment Through Reform:** Ukraine and
    the United States intend to utilize their strategic energy dialogue
    to address systemic imbalances in the Ukrainian energy system,
    expand corporate governance reform at state-owned energy companies,
    increase the attractiveness of Ukraine’s energy industry, and
    attract the foreign investment needed to achieve energy
    independence, decarbonization, and clean energy goals.  
-   **Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Promoting Innovation:**
    Ukraine and the United States have both reaffirmed their intent to
    achieve ambitious reductions in their national greenhouse gas
    emissions by 2030 as communicated through our respective Nationally
    Determined Contributions (NDCs).  Ukraine has joined the
    Agricultural Innovation Mission (AIM) for Climate and intends to
    develop renewable energy in a financially responsible manner.  
-   **Addressing the Impact of Nord Stream 2**:  The United States and
    Ukraine continue to oppose Nord Stream 2, which we view as a threat
    to European energy security. The United States intends to continue
    using measures envisaged in legislation and energy diplomacy,
    including through the recent appointment of a senior advisor for
    energy security, to maintain Ukraine’s transit role and security of
    supply during this period of energy transition and to prevent the
    Kremlin’s use of energy as a geopolitical weapon.  The U.S. and
    Ukrainian governments support efforts to increase capacity for gas
    supplies to Ukraine from diversified sources.  

**IV. Economic Growth and Prosperity**  
*Ukraine must be strong enough economically to choose its own future and
to bend the arc of its national history toward greater justice and
opportunity for the Ukrainian people.  Ukraine’s continued adoption and
implementation of reforms are critical to ensuring that its economy
delivers for the people.*

-   **Implementing Key Reforms:** In alignment with Ukraine’s
    International Monetary Fund program, Ukraine intends to reform
    state-owned enterprises, protect central bank independence,
    strengthen financial sector supervision, and create a fair business
    and investment environment. The United States intends to continue
    working with Ukraine to support these efforts and promote robust and
    inclusive economic growth in both the U.S. and Ukrainian
    economies**.  
    **
-   **Expanding Commercial Cooperation:** The United States and Ukraine
    have finalized a Memorandum of Understanding on commercial
    cooperation, designed to promote commercial participation by U.S
    companies across the Ukrainian economy and by Ukrainian companies
    across the U.S. economy.

-   **Providing Sufficient Funding for Growth**: The United States and
    Ukraine have signed an MOU, which may support future transactions in
    identified sectors, including several key projects under discussion.
    The initial amount of $3 billion in support from the Export-Import
    Bank (EXIM) of the United States for these potential transactions
    may be increased as the pipeline of projects in agribusiness,
    infrastructure, climate, and energy develops.  
-   **Growing Trade and Investment:** The U.S.-Ukraine Trade and
    Investment Council is holding its 10<sup>th</sup> meeting this fall
    to confirm work plans to avoid regulatory barriers, eliminate the
    use of unlicensed software by Ukrainian government agencies, address
    other intellectual property issues, and cooperate on labor issues.
    Ukraine is also committed to passing legislation establishing a
    robust investment screening process. Ukraine and the United States
    plan to review the operation of the Trade and Investment Cooperation
    Agreement at the fall meeting of the Council.

**V. Pandemic Response and Humanitarian Assistance**  
*The United States has been a steadfast supporter of the Ukrainian
people in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and humanitarian needs
resulting from the war in eastern Ukraine.*

-   **Fighting COVID-19**:  The United States has provided approximately
    $55 million in COVID-19 related assistance and donated nearly 2.2
    million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Ukraine. The United States
    intends to provide additional assistance to Ukraine, to include cold
    chain storage support and an additional $12.8 million in
    COVID-related assistance drawn from the America Rescue Plan Act.  
-   **Humanitarian Assistance:** The ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine
    has left 3.4 million people in need of humanitarian aid. Since 2014,
    the United States has provided over $306 million in life-saving
    assistance to help Ukrainians in need, spanning food, shelter, safe
    drinking water, and protection for the most vulnerable, including
    the elderly. The U.S. government will provide an additional $45
    million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine this year.
