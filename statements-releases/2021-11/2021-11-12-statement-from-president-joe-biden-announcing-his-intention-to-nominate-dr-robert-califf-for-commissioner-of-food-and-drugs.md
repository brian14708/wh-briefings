title: Statement from President Joe Biden Announcing His Intention to Nominate Dr.
  Robert Califf for Commissioner of Food and Drugs
---
 
I first want to thank Dr. Janet Woodcock for her leadership over the
last year. She has done an incredible job leading the agency during what
has been a busy and challenging time, and both she and the FDA career
staff have worked hard and followed the science to ensure the American
public can trust the decisions being made by the FDA.  
  
Dr. Robert Califf is one of the most experienced clinical trialists in
the country, and has the experience and expertise to lead the Food and
Drug Administration during a critical time in our nationâ€™s fight to put
an end to the coronavirus pandemic. As the FDA considers many
consequential decisions around vaccine approvals and more, it is mission
critical that we have a steady, independent hand to guide the FDA. I am
confident Dr. Califf will ensure that the FDA continues its science and
data driven decision-making. Dr. Califf had strong bipartisan support in
the Senate in 2016, and I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Dr. Califf
so he can continue the important work being done at this critical
moment.  
  
**<u>Dr. Robert Califf, Nominee for Commissioner of Food and
Drugs</u>**  
  
Dr. Califf is an internationally recognized expert in clinical trial
research, health disparities, healthcare quality, and cardiovascular
medicine. He brings nearly four decades of experience as a doctor,
researcher, leader, and public servant, including previous service as
FDA Commissioner from 2016-2017, for which he was confirmed by the
Senate 89-4 with broad bi-partisan support. Currently, Califf is a
professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine, where
he previously served as Vice Chancellor and founded the Duke Clinical
Research Institute, and also works as Head of Clinical Policy at Verily
Life Sciences, a life sciences research organization. Dr. Califf has led
many landmark clinical trials and is one of the most frequently cited
authors in biomedical science, with more than 1,200 publications in the
peer-reviewed literature.
