title: Statement by NEC Director Brian Deese and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
  on Samsung Announcement of New Semiconductor Facility in Texas
---
 
Securing America’s supply chains is a top priority for President Biden
and his Administration. We welcome Samsung’s announcement today that it
will build a new semiconductor facility in Texas, helping protect our
supply chains, revitalizing our manufacturing base, and creating good
jobs right here at home. The Biden-Harris Administration has been
working around the clock with Congress, our allies and partners, and the
private sector to generate additional semiconductor manufacturing
capacity and make sure we never again face shortages. Today’s
announcement is the result of sustained work by the administration,
including engagement with Samsung and the President’s meeting
with President Moon of the Republic of Korea in May where the two
leaders announced they would facilitate mutual and complementary
investments in semiconductors. More work remains to be done to ensure
America remains the most innovative and productive nation on Earth. We
will continue to use every tool and pursue every avenue to invest in our
sources of strength like manufacturing and technology so we can grow our
economy, bolster the middle class, and strengthen our long-term
competitiveness.
