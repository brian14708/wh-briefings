title: Statement of President Joe Biden on Vaccinations for Children Age Five to 11
---
 
Today, we have reached a turning point in our battle against COVID-19: 
authorization of a safe, effective vaccine for children age 5 to 11.  It
will allow parents to end months of anxious worrying about their kids,
and reduce the extent to which children spread the virus to others.  It
is a major step forward for our nation in our fight to defeat the
virus.  
  
Over the last several weeks, my Administration has been working hard to
be prepared for this moment: we are ready to act. We have already
secured enough vaccine supply for every child in America, and over the
past weekend, we began the process of packing and shipping out millions
of pediatric vaccine doses. These doses — specially designed for these
younger children — have started to arrive at thousands of locations
across the country.  
  
The program will ramp up over the coming days, and be fully up and
running during the week of November 8. Parents will be able to bring
their children to thousands of pharmacies, pediatrician’s offices,
schools, and other sites to get vaccinated. Because of the groundwork
we’ve laid, we can be confident that vaccinations for kids will be
available, easy, and convenient.  
  
A vaccine for children age 5 to 11 will allow us to build on the
extraordinary progress we’ve made over the last nine months. Already,
more than 78 percent of Americans age 12 and older have gotten at least
one shot, including millions of teenagers — and the vaccines have proven
to be incredibly safe and effective.
