title: Statement from President Joe Biden
---
 
Ahmaud Arbery’s killing – witnessed by the world on video – is a
devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial
justice in this country. Mr. Arbery should be here today, celebrating
the holidays with his mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, and his father,
Marcus Arbery. Nothing can bring Mr. Arbery back to his family and to
his community, but the verdict ensures that those who committed this
horrible crime will be punished.

While the guilty verdicts reflect our justice system doing its job, that
alone is not enough. Instead, we must recommit ourselves to building a
future of unity and shared strength, where no one fears violence because
of the color of their skin. My administration will continue to do the
hard work to ensure that equal justice under law is not just a phrase
emblazoned in stone above the Supreme Court, but a reality for all
Americans.
