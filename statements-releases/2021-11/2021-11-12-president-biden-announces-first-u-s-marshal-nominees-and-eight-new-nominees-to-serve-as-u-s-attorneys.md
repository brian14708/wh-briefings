President Biden is announcing his first U.S. Marshal nominees, as well
as eight new nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys across the country –
officials who will be indispensable to upholding the rule of law.  
  
These individuals, many of whom would make history if confirmed, were
chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law, their professionalism,
their experience and credentials in their fields, their dedication to
pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to the independence
of the Department of Justice.  
  
These are the first two nominees the President has chosen to serve as
U.S. Marshals, and he has now announced 37 nominees to serve as U.S.
Attorneys.
