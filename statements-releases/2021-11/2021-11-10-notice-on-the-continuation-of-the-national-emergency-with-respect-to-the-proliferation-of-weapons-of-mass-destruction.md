title: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to the Proliferation
  of Weapons of Mass Destruction
---
 
On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical
weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such
weapons.  On July 28, 1998, by Executive Order 13094, the President
amended Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the
worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation
activities.  On June 28, 2005, by Executive Order 13382, the President,
among other things, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our
ability to combat proliferation.  The proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States.  For this reason, the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994, with
respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the
means of delivering such weapons must continue beyond November 14, 2021.
 Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.  

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
November 10, 2021.
