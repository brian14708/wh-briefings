  \ For Service Workers On Federal\_Contracts"

**FACT SHEET:**

*Biden-Harris Administration will make federal procurement more
economical and efficient by ensuring a stable, skilled, and experienced
workforce for service contracts, even when contracts change hands*

Today, the President signed an Executive Order to ensure there will be a
reliable supply of experienced and skilled employees working on federal
service contracts. Service work supporting federal government functions
occurs all over the country, from federal building maintenance to
services provided on military bases to skilled technicians operating and
maintaining federal equipment. Under this newly signed Executive Order,
when a federal service contract transitions from one contractor to
another, the new contractor will be required to offer jobs to qualified
employees who worked for the previous contractor and performed their
jobs well. This prevents disruptions in federal services, makes it
easier for employers to find workers who are already trained for the
job, and saves taxpayer dollars.

This Executive Order is just one of many steps the Biden-Harris
Administration is taking to improve the efficiency of federal
procurement and make sure taxpayer dollars are used to strengthen
good-quality, union jobs in America. Earlier this year, the President
fulfilled his commitments to strengthen Buy American rules and to raise
the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 an hour. This Executive
Order will support service sector workers and the work they do for the
American people. The Executive Order builds on a policy set in E.O.
13495 during the Obama-Biden Administration.

The Executive Order will benefit taxpayers, contractors and service
contract workers by:

-   **Making federal procurement more efficient by reducing worker
    turnover.** The Executive Order extends the right of first refusal
    to qualified workers when a service contract changes hands and the
    jobs on the new contract are similar. Turnover can be costly. It
    takes time to advertise and hire new workers for a job. It also
    takes time and money for workers to be trained for a new job and to
    learn the particular ways in which that job is performed for the
    federal government. Maintaining the existing workforce reduces the
    disruption in the delivery of services during the period of
    transition between contractors and maintains physical and
    information security. It also ensures that taxpayer-funded services
    benefit from an experienced workforce that is already familiar with
    federal facilities, personnel and other requirements of the job.
    Finally, this Order will provide firms that secure new federal
    contracts with a ready, skilled pool of workers.
-   **Keeping skilled workers in their jobs.** There are about 2 million
    service contract workers, covering a range of jobs and
    responsibilities – from maintenance on military bases to call
    centers to transportation to research and development. They
    contribute in important ways to important federal functions.
     Sustaining a quality pool of workers amounts to good and careful
    stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Service contract workers are also
    disproportionately women and workers of color. For example, the
    [building services
    industry](https://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/economy/reports/2020/11/19/179390/federal-contracting-doesnt-go-far-enough-protect-american-workers/)
    is 41 percent Hispanic or Latino, 13 percent Black or African
    American, and 56 percent women. The [security services
    industry](https://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/economy/reports/2020/11/19/179390/federal-contracting-doesnt-go-far-enough-protect-american-workers/)
    is 26 percent Black or African American, 18 percent Hispanic or
    Latino, and 23 percent women. By creating job continuity for this
    pool of workers, the Administration is also advancing its equity
    goals. This Executive Order will also remove the requirement that
    the new contract remain in the same location in order for the job
    continuity policy to take effect. This change in policy updates the
    Administration’s approach to account for the flexible nature of
    service sector work in today’s economy.
