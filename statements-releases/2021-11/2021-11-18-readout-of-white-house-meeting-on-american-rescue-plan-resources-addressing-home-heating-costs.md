Today the White House [hosted a meeting](https://youtu.be/iiH6Ph0au0s)
of governors and federal and state officials on the frontlines of
helping families address home heating costs this winter. The discussion
focused on [deploying unprecedented
resources](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/18/fact-sheet-biden-administration-deploys-american-rescue-plan-funds-to-protect-americans-from-rising-home-heating-costs-calls-on-utility-companies-to-prevent-shut-offs-this-winter/)
provided by the American Rescue Plan (ARP), including $4.5 billion in
funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) as
well as Emergency Rental Assistance that can be used for utility
bills.  
  
Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie
Chavez Rodriguez emphasized the importance of partnerships between
federal, state, territorial and tribal leaders to deliver critical
benefits to Americans. White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene
Sperling provided an overview of the historic ARP resources available to
help families this winter.  
  
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, Secretary of Health and Human
Services Xavier Becerra, Treasury Department Chief Recovery Officer
Jacob Leibenluft, and Dr. Lanikque Howard, Director of HHS’s Office of
Community Services, explained the Administration’s comprehensive
strategy to address energy costs and new tools to help states and
localities swiftly deliver utility assistance to hard pressed
families.  
  
Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Governor Janet Mills of Maine,
Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut and Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota
highlighted innovative ways their states are coordinating and expediting
benefits from the American Rescue Plan in order to reach vulnerable
families quickly.  
  
As part of this event, the White House challenged utility companies
across the country to step up and do their part as well. In response,
seven major utilities companies as well as a trade association
representing distributors of liquid fuels like propane and heating oil
have already agreed to a specific set of commitments including avoiding
shutting off heat this winter to eligible customers who have applied for
benefits like LIHEAP and doing more to get relief to households that
need it.  
  
**Participating Governors and Industry Stakeholders issued the following
statements:**  
  
Governor Whitmer of Michigan:  
“In Michigan, we know how critical it is to have access to affordable
heating options, especially with winter just a few weeks around the
corner and temperatures already starting to drop below freezing,” said
Governor Gretchen Whitmer. “Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we have
an historic influx of resources to help families keep the heat on this
winter. I am grateful to our federal partners for working to ensure that
every family that needs assistance with heating bills this winter can
get the help they need to stay warm and safe.”  
  
Governor Mills of Maine:  
“Maine is putting to good use the American Rescue Plan’s unprecedented
resources to keep Maine people warm this winter,” said Governor Janet
Mills. “We are leading new initiatives to make accessing LIHEAP easier
than ever, forging partnerships with fuel providers to get fuel in tanks
early and often, and making once-in-a-generation investments to cut
energy costs for Maine families, reduce carbon emissions, and strengthen
our clean energy workforce. I am grateful for the efforts of the
Biden-Harris Administration that made this progress possible – and I
look forward to our continued partnership on behalf of the people of
Maine.”  
  
Governor Lamont of Connecticut:  
“It can’t be overstated what a lifeline the American Rescue Plan Act has
been to millions of people across this country. The pandemic knocked us
down and ARPA is helping us get back on our feet. In CT, we’re using
emergency rental assistance funds provided through ARPA to help
struggling households with their past-due electric bills. This is a
unique and innovative approach to assist households with arrearages
dating back to April 2020. Working with the US Department of the
Treasury – which has been a great partner in implementing, UniteCT,
which is our Emergency Rental Assistance Program – we’ve allowed
households in Qualified Census Tracts to self-certify they are
income-eligible for the program. And working with our major utilities,
we’ve established a data sharing agreement to identify renter customers
with arrearages, who were not yet receiving any kind of rental or
utility assistance. We are contacting them by email and robocall and
connecting them with our assistance programs. So far, we’ve helped
thousands of eligible individuals who otherwise would be at risk of
utility shutoffs during the cold winter months to come.”  
  
Governor Walz of Minnesota:  
“Every Minnesotan deserves a warm and safe home, and as we prepare for
our harsh winter months, I am grateful for the unprecedented level of
partnership from the federal government to help Minnesotans afford their
heating bills,” said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. “This year, President
Biden’s American Rescue Plan is delivering direct financial support to
help Minnesotans save money in the face of rising heating fuel prices. I
encourage all Minnesotans to find out if they’re eligible for
Minnesota’s Energy Assistance Program. Help is available.”       
  
DTE Energy President and CEO Jerry Norcia:  
“DTE Energy is working closely with the State of Michigan to deliver
help to our customers in need,” said Jerry Norcia, DTE Energy president
and CEO. “We partnered with the state in extraordinary ways during an
extraordinary time to directly apply financial aid to the accounts of
customers we knew qualified for it. This lifeline has been essential in
keeping the light and heat on for our most vulnerable customers. We
support the administration’s call to action and will continue our work
in meeting this commitment.”  
  
Eversource President and CEO Joe Nolan:  
“We’ve worked collaboratively with the State of Connecticut to find
creative ways to help as many renters as possible during the pandemic —
leveraging our resources and using the collective data we have to
prequalify and contact customers. Governor Lamont’s leadership and the
Department of Housing’s support enabled Connecticut to be a model to
follow,” said Eversource President and CEO Joe Nolan. “We have an
important role to play and we’re proud to share this model with others
to give the most relief to vulnerable customers as fast as possible as
we head into this winter heating season.”  
  
National Grid President Badar Khan:  
“National Grid recognizes that all of our customers will be impacted
this winter due to higher energy supply costs, and that some of our
customers will be more adversely impacted than others. Helping these
families in the communities we serve goes to the core of our values, and
we wholeheartedly support the Administration’s call to action. We also
offer a number of programs to assist our customers in paying their bills
and have consumer advocates on staff to provide additional support to
ensure that our most vulnerable customers have affordable heat this
winter.”  
  
NEFI President and CEO Sean Cota:  
 “On behalf of the nation’s home heating fuel distributors, NEFI
commends the President for acknowledging the hardships they see daily.
Our Main Street family businesses care deeply about their customers and
local communities and remain committed to ensure that no one is ‘left
out in the cold.’ We look forward to working with the administration,
state and local agencies, and other stakeholders to ensure all resources
are brought to bear to support American families this winter,
particularly those experiencing the greatest need.”  
  
Vermont Gas President and CEO Neale F. Lunderville  
“As Vermont’s largest thermal energy provider, we strongly support this
initiative and commend federal and state leaders for their swift action
ahead of the heating season. We are fully committed to the well-being of
the communities we serve and will prioritize our resources to help
Vermonters stay safe, warm, and secure this winter.”
