National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with
Romanian Presidential Security Advisor Ion Oprisor to reinforce the
strong cooperation between our countries on defense, resilience, and
cybersecurity issues. They agreed on the importance of close
coordination bilaterally and through NATO on Black Sea security.  They
also exchanged views on Russian military activities near Ukraine and
committed to continued consultation.  Mr. Sullivan conveyed his support
for Romania’s efforts to enhance energy security in Europe, including
through its commitment to bring a “first of a kind” U.S.-built small
modular reactor to Romania.  He also welcomed Romania’s participation
within the U.S.-led Counter-Ransomware Initiative.
