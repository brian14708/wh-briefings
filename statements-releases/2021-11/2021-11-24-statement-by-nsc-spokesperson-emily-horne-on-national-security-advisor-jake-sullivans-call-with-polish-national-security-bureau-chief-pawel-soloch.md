National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with
Poland’s National Security Bureau Chief Pawel Soloch. Mr Sullivan
underscored our strong bilateral cooperation on defense issues and
welcomed ongoing efforts to strengthen NATO’s deterrence posture. He
conveyed strong support for Poland in the face of the Lukashenka
regime’s actions that created a migration crisis on Poland’s border with
Belarus. They also exchanged views on Russian military activities near
Ukraine and committed to continued close consultation.
