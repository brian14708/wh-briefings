title: "President\_Biden Names Ninth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing ten judicial nominees, including nine new
candidates for the federal bench. All of the nominees are
extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law
and our Constitution.  
   
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.  
   
For example, this slate includes: 

-   A nominee who is President Biden’s second Latina nominee to the
    Southern District of California; California currently has only one
    active Latina federal district court judge out of sixty-one federal
    district court seats.
-   A nominee who would be the second Latina federal judge on the United
    States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
-   A nominee who would be the second Latina federal judge on the United
    States District Court for the District of Nevada and only the third
    Hispanic judge to ever serve on that court.
-   A nominee who would be the only active Black woman federal district
    court judge in the Northern District of California, and who is
    President Biden’s second Black woman federal district court nominee
    in California—a state which currently has no active Black women
    federal district court judges out of sixty-one seats. 

This is President Biden’s ninth round of nominees for federal judicial
positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to
62.

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies.
