title: "President\_Biden to Sign Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\_\
  Monday"
---
 
On Monday, the President will host a bipartisan bill signing ceremony
for his Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act. The President will be joined by Members of Congress who
helped write this landmark economic growth bill and by a diverse group
of leaders who fought for its passage across the country, ranging from
Governors and Mayors of both parties to labor union and business
leaders.  
  
At the signing ceremony, the President will highlight how he is
following through on his commitment to rebuild the middle class and the
historic benefits the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will deliver for
American families: millions of good-paying, union jobs for working
people, improvements in our ports and transportation systems that
strengthen supply chains, high-speed internet for every American, clean
water for all children and families, the biggest investments in our
roads and bridges in generations, the most significant investment in
mass transit ever, and unprecedented investments in clean energy
infrastructure.    
  
In the coming weeks, the President, Vice President, and Cabinet will
continue to travel the country to communicate how the law will help
communities, grow the economy, and position America to compete in the
21<sup>st</sup> century.  
  
 Background to be given from a White House official:

-   In addition to being joined by members of Congress from both sides
    of the aisle who negotiated the original framework with him and
    fought to make the bill a reality, the President will also be
    hosting representatives of the incredibly diverse coalition that
    pushed for the bill across the country.
-   Coming after his visit to the Port of Baltimore, the President will
    also emphasize the array of steps he and his administration are
    taking thanks to the bipartisan deal to build on the hard work he
    and his team have been doing to strengthen supply chains and address
    bottlenecks in moving goods across the country.
-   And he will reiterate that a large body of experts have shown that
    these infrastructure investments will help to act against
    inflationary pressures by making it easier to receive the
    unparalleled volume of goods that need to be moved after we achieved
    the re-opening of the economy this summer.
