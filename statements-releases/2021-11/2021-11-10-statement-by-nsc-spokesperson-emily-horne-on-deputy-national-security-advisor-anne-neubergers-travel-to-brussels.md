title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on Deputy National Security Advisor\
  \ Anne Neuberger\u2019s Travel to\_Brussels"
---
 
From November 8-10, Deputy National Security Advisory for Cyber and
Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger was in Brussels to continue the
Biden Administration’s work with allies and international partners to
advance cybersecurity on both sides of the Atlantic, to promote
responsible state behavior in cyberspace, and to work together to chart
a 21<sup>st</sup> century course for cyberspace and emerging technology.

On Monday, Neuberger met with a range of EU officials and members of EU
parliament to discuss cybersecurity and emerging technology policies. On
Tuesday, Neuberger consulted with the North Atlantic Council at NATO on
ways to enhance national and Alliance resilience in cyberspace. On
behalf of the U.S., Neuberger recommended areas where NATO Allies can
work, both independently and collectively, to defend against, deter, and
respond to the full spectrum of cyber threats. The discussions follow
NATO’s adoption of a new Cyber Defense Policy, its first in seven years,
strongly supported by the United States, that provides NATO Allies the
strategic direction to advance a shared deterrence and defense posture
in cyberspace. 

Neuberger’s trip builds on the Biden Administration’s ongoing work to
build international cooperation to tackle cyber threats. The
Administration’s efforts have included rallying G7 countries to hold
nations who harbor ransomware criminals accountable; working with allies
and partners to impose costs on nation-states for malicious cyber
activity, and disrupt the ransomware ecosystem; and hosting an
international counter-ransomware initiative at the White House in
October with over 30 countries and the European Union, to [accelerate
cooperation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/14/joint-statement-of-the-ministers-and-representatives-from-the-counter-ransomware-initiative-meeting-october-2021/)
to counter ransomware.
