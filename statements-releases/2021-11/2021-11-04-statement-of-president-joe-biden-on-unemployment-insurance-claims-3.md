title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on Unemployment Insurance\_Claims"
---
 
Today we learned that, for the fifth consecutive week, initial
unemployment claims are down.  The number of people newly filing for
unemployment has now fallen to the lowest level since the pandemic
started — dropping from an average of 833,000 Americans in the week
before I took office to fewer than 285,000 Americans today, for a
decline of nearly 70 percent.

As COVID-19 cases and unemployment claims continue to decline — and as
jobs and wages continue to rise — it is clear that America is in the
midst of an historic economic recovery, unique across the world.  We
still have much left to do to finish that recovery and build back
better, but today’s news is further evidence that we are making strong
and steady progress.
