title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to the Threat\
  \ from Securities Investments that Finance Certain Companies of the People\u2019\
  s Republic of\_China"

On November 12, 2020, by Executive Order 13959, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the threat from securities
investments that finance certain companies of the People’s Republic of
China (PRC).

The President found that the PRC is increasingly exploiting United
States capital to resource and enable the development and modernization
of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which
continues to allow the PRC to directly threaten the United States
homeland and United States forces overseas.  Through the national
strategy of Military‑Civil Fusion, the PRC increases the size of the
country’s military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese
companies to support its military and intelligence activities.  Those
companies, though remaining ostensibly private and civilian, directly
support the PRC’s military, intelligence, and security apparatuses and
aid in their development and modernization.  At the same time, those
companies raise capital by selling securities to United States investors
that trade on public exchanges both here and abroad, lobbying United
States index providers and funds to include these securities in market
offerings, and engaging in other acts to ensure access to United States
capital.

The President further found that the PRC’s military-industrial complex,
by directly supporting the efforts of the PRC’s military, intelligence,
and other security apparatuses, constituted an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States.  
On January 13, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 13974 amending
Executive Order 13959.  
On June 3, 2021, I signed Executive Order 14032, which expanded the
scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959.  I
found that additional steps are necessary to address that national
emergency, including the threat posed by the military-industrial complex
of the PRC and its involvement in military, intelligence, and security
research and development programs, and weapons and related equipment
production under the PRC’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy.  In addition,
I found that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC
and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to
facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constituted unusual
and extraordinary threats to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States, and I expanded the national emergency to
address these threats.  Executive Order 14032 amended Executive
Order 13959 and revoked Executive Order 13974 in its entirety.

The threat from securities investments that finance certain companies of
the PRC and certain uses and development of Chinese surveillance
technology continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  
For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13959 of November 12, 2020, expanded in scope by Executive Order 14032
of June 3, 2021, must continue in effect beyond November 12, 2021. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 13959 with respect to the threat
from securities investments that finance certain companies of the PRC
and expanded in Executive Order 14032.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
