title: Statement by the President on Remembering Holodomor
---
 
Each November we solemnly honor and pay tribute to the millions of
innocent Ukrainians who suffered and perished during the Holodomor –
“death by hunger” – in 1932 and 1933.  The men, women, and children who
lost their lives during this famine were victims of the brutal policies
and deliberate acts of the regime of Joseph Stalin.  This month, as we
commemorate those whose lives were taken, let us also recommit ourselves
to the constant work of preventing such tragedies in the future and
lifting up those who are suffering under the yoke of tyranny today.  
  
The Ukrainian people overcame the horror of the Holodomor, demonstrating
their spirit and resilience, and eventually creating a free and
democratic society.  As we remember the pain and the victims of the
Holodomor, the United States also reaffirms our commitment to the people
of Ukraine today and our unwavering support for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Ukraine.
