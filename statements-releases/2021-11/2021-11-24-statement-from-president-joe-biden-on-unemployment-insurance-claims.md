title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Unemployment Insurance\_Claims"
---
 
This morning, we received two pieces of economic news which underscore
that our recovery is continuing to progress at a historic pace.

Last year, there were 21 million unemployment insurance claims before
the Thanksgiving holiday. Today, there were 2.4 million. This is a
historic jobs recovery:  5.6 million jobs created since I took office
and an unemployment rate of 4.6% — two full years earlier than experts
predicted was possible. More Americans are getting back to work and more
Americans have money in their pockets, thanks to the American Rescue
Plan and the vaccination campaign.

And, the U.S. economy grew at a faster rate in the first three quarters
of the year than in any year in nearly 40 years. In fact, according to
the OECD, the U.S. is the only major economy that has exceeded its
pre-pandemic level of gross domestic product.

We have more work to do before our economy is back to normal, including
addressing prices increases that hurt Americans’ pocketbooks and
undermine gains in wages and disposable income. That’s why yesterday I
announced steps my Administration is taking to bring down the cost of
gas for American families and my Administration remains laser focused on
implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will ease supply
chain bottlenecks across the economy. And it’s why it’s so critical that
the Senate pass the Build Back Better Act, which, according to leading
economists, will cut costs for American families without adding to price
pressures. Build Back Better will cut the cost of prescription drugs,
health care, child care and housing for tens of millions of middle class
families and seniors – while extending critical middle class tax relief
that is helping working families make ends meet.

Today’s data reinforce the historic economic progress we are making and
the importance of building on that progress in the weeks ahead.
