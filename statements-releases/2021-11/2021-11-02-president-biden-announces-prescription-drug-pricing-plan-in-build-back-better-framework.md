Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs. Yet Medicare is
currently prohibited from negotiating prescription drug prices to get
the best deal for American seniors.  President Biden and Congressional
Democrats rolled their sleeves up in recent days to produce a compromise
plan to end this unfair prohibition and reduce the costs of prescription
drugs, while ensuring we continue to reward innovation and breakthrough
new treatments.  Specifically, the plan will:  
   
**Finally let Medicare negotiate drug prices.**  Medicare will negotiate
prices for high-cost prescription drugs.  This will include drugs
seniors get at the pharmacy counter (through Medicare Part D), and drugs
that are administered in a doctor’s office (through Medicare Part B).
Drugs become eligible for negotiation once they have been on the market
for a fixed number of years: 9 years for small molecule drugs and 12
years for biologics. Medicare will negotiate up to 10 drugs per year
during 2023, with those prices taking effect in 2025, increasing to up
to 20 drugs per year.  
   
The policy will establish a clearly defined negotiation process that is
fair for manufacturers, and gets the biggest savings on drugs that have
been on the market a long time.  This discourages drug companies from
abusing laws to prolong their monopolies, while encouraging investments
in research and development of new cures.  Drug companies that refuse to
negotiate will owe an excise tax.  
   
**Impose a tax penalty if drug companies increase their prices faster
than inflation**.  Starting when this bill becomes law, future drug
price increases will be compared to their current prices.  We will
finally put an end to the days where drug companies could raise their
prices with impunity.  If prices for a drug increase faster than
inflation, manufacturers will owe a tax penalty, holding down prices for
Americans with all types of health insurance.  
   
**Directly lower out-of-pocket costs for seniors.** Today, there is no
cap on how much seniors and people with disabilities have to pay for
drugs, and [millions of
seniors](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/millions-of-medicare-part-d-enrollees-have-had-out-of-pocket-drug-spending-above-the-catastrophic-threshold-over-time/)
pay more than $6,000 a year in cost-sharing.  This proposal puts an end
to this burden, and ensures that seniors never pay more than $2,000 a
year for their drugs under Medicare Part D.  
   
The plan will also lower insulin prices so that Americans with diabetes
don’t pay more than $35 per month for their insulin. Lawmakers have also
agreed to lower seniors’ cost-sharing for all types of drugs and they
are working expeditiously to finalize legislative text that will save
seniors money at the pharmacy counter without increasing premiums.
