***President Announces New Actions to Tackle Climate Change, Tap
Economic Opportunity, and Tout Ambition of Collective Global Efforts***

On day one in office, President Joe Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement,
restored U.S. leadership on the world stage, and reestablished our
position to tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad. On day one at
the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the
Parties (COP26), President Biden will outline the bold steps his
Administration is taking in his whole-of-government approach to combat
climate change, underscore how bold action delivers economic prosperity
and peace and security, and rally countries from every corner of the
world to step up their ambition and confront this existential threat
during a decisive decade.

President Biden believes this is not a challenge for future generations,
but one all countries must confront today – with urgent, bold, and
direct action. Heading into COP26, President Biden announced [ the Build
Back Better
Framework](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/28/president-biden-announces-the-build-back-better-framework/)
– the largest effort to combat climate change in American history
alongside his [Bipartisan Infrastructure
Deal](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-advances-president-bidens-climate-agenda/)
that the President is confident can pass both chambers of Congress and
be signed into law. The Build Back Better Framework will cut greenhouse
gas pollution by well over one gigaton in 2030, reduce clean energy
costs for working families, give our kids cleaner air and water, create
hundreds of thousands of good-paying, union jobs, and advance
environmental justice while investing in a 21st century clean energy
economy. President Biden’s bold agenda, [along with his robust executive
and regulatory actions to date](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/climate/),
represents the U.S. intention to capture the economic opportunity that
addressing climate change presents.

President Biden is committed to [cutting greenhouse gas emissions 50-52
percent below 2005 levels in
2030](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/),
reaching a 100% carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, and
achieving a net-zero economy by no later than 2050 – all while creating
good paying, union jobs at home. The President is also committed to
partnering with countries most in need to strengthen the resilience of
communities and economies across the world, including those vulnerable
to the unavoidable impacts of climate change, reducing tensions and
risks of instability.

To deliver on these goals, the President will:

**Launch the** [**President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and
Resilience
(PREPARE)**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Full-PREPARE-Plan.pdf)**.**
This is a whole-of-government initiative that will serve as the
cornerstone of the U.S. Government response to addressing the increasing
impacts of the global climate crisis in order to enhance global
stability. The President will work with Congress to provide $3 billion
in adaptation finance annually for PREPARE by FY2024 – the largest U.S.
commitment ever made to reduce climate impacts on those most vulnerable
to climate change worldwide. PREPARE will activate a coordinated
approach that will bring the United States’ diplomatic, development, and
technical expertise to help more than half a billion people in
developing countries to adapt to and manage the impacts of climate
change through locally-led development by 2030. Specifically, PREPARE
consists of three primary components:

-   **Knowledge: Information is Power.** The United States will support
    efforts to deepen global understanding of climate risks,
    vulnerabilities, and adaptation solutions while supporting expanded
    development, innovation, and delivery of climate information
    services, decision support tools, and early warning systems.
-   **Plans and Programs: Mainstream and Integrate Adaptation, Build
    Relationships, Execute.** The United States will help countries and
    communities in vulnerable situations plan for climate impacts and
    mainstream adaptation into broader decision making, with the
    ultimate goal of enhancing peace and security, safeguarding lives,
    livelihoods, and the natural environment from the impacts of climate
    change.
-   **Resources: Mobilizing Finance and Private Capital.** The United
    States will accelerate financing of adaptation measures by
    contributing to and shaping new and existing multilateral and
    bilateral adaptation funds, supporting multiple climate risk finance
    strategies, strengthening capacity to access finance for adaptation
    and develop bankable investments, and striving to mobilize private
    capital.

**Submit the First U.S. Adaptation Communication under the Paris
Agreement.** This document outlines U.S. priorities, policies, and
initiatives to implement adaptation and resilience strategies both
domestically and in vulnerable countries and communities around the
world. The Adaptation Communication summarizes short- and long-term
climate risks, provides examples of adaptation action, and shares
lessons learned. Building on these lessons learned, the adaptation
communication describes a whole-of-government approach to scaling up
actions that enhance the resilience of people, communities,
infrastructure, and natural resources to the impacts of climate change
at home, and abroad.

**Submit our [7th UNFCCC National Communication, and 3rd and 4th
Biennial
Reports](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ClimateNationalCommunication.pdf)
required by the Paris Agreement.** To communicate our continued progress
in recent years, these reports focus on U.S. actions taken between 2016
and 2020 to combat climate change at home and support developing
countries. They recognize the value of transparency in our shared,
global efforts to tackle the climate crisis and highlight the critical
role of our state, local, and Tribal governments, as well as private,
educational, and non-profit organizations in delivering climate
progress.

**Release the** [**U.S. Long-Term
Strategy**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-Long-Term-Strategy.pdf)
**to meet our 2050 goal—consistent with limiting global warming to less
than 1.5° C.**  The Strategy shows how action in this decade can set us
on track for continued, deeper greenhouse gas reductions through the
2030s and 2040s via federal, state, local, and Tribal government
leadership, in coordination with all-of-society action. The U.S. 2050
net-zero goal is ambitious and achievable, and supports a more
sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy, including the opportunity
to create millions of high-quality jobs with the chance to join a union.
Achieving our net zero goals will mean a completely carbon
pollution-free society, with strong economic and public health benefits
for all Americans – and the world.

**And going into COP26, the President announced the Build Back Better
Framework –** a $555 billion investment representing the largest single
investment in our clean energy economy in history, across buildings,
transportation, industry, electricity, agriculture, and climate-smart
practices across lands and waters. The framework will set the United
States on course to meet its climate targets, achieving a 50-52%
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels in 2030 in a way
that grows domestic industries and good, union jobs and advances
environmental justice. Specifically, it will:

-   Deliver substantial **clean energy rebates for consumers** and
    ensure middle class families save money to afford clean energy and
    electrification, including lowering the costs of electric vehicles
    by $12,500 and cut the cost of installing rooftop solar for a home
    by around 30 percent.
-   Ensure **clean energy technology** – from wind turbine blades to
    solar panels to electric cars – will be built in the United States
    with American made steel and other materials, creating hundreds of
    thousands of good jobs here at home.
-   Make the largest investment in **clean U.S. manufacturing** in
    history, and ensure that the U.S. is a global leader in the
    production of green materials, like steel, aluminum, and cement.
-   Advance environmental justice through a new **Clean Energy and
    Sustainability Accelerator** that will invest in projects around the
    country, while delivering 40% of the benefits of investment to
    disadvantaged communities, as part of the President’s [Justice40
    initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/07/20/the-path-to-achieving-justice40/).
-   Create a new **Civilian Climate Corps** – with over 300,000 members
    that look like America who will conserve our public lands, bolster
    community resilience, and address the changing climate, all while
    putting good-paying union jobs within reach for more Americans.
-   Bolster **resilience and natural solutions** to climate change
    through a historic investment in coastal restoration, forest
    management, and soil conservation. The framework will provide
    resources to States, Tribes, communities, farmers, ranchers, and
    forestland owners, supporting their efforts to improve habitat,
    protect against the effects of climate change, and reduce emissions.

These historic Build Back Better investments will be complemented by the
**Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal,** which will rebuild the arteries of
our economy while accelerating clean energy and transportation,
advancing environmental justice, and bolstering resilience. It will:

-   Make the **largest federal investment in public transit** in
    history, to expand public transit options across every state in the
    country and replace thousands of transit vehicles with clean,
    zero-emission vehicles.
-   Build out the first-ever **national network of electric vehicle
    chargers** along highway corridors and within communities.
-   Upgrade our power infrastructure, by building new, **resilient
    transmission lines** across the country.
-   **Clean up pollution** by remediating Superfund and brownfield
    sites, reclaiming abandoned mine land, and capping orphaned gas
    wells.
-   Deliver clean drinking water by **replacing the nation’s lead
    pipes** and service lines, addressing PFAS chemicals, and investing
    in water infrastructure across America, including in Tribal Nations
    and disadvantaged communities that need it most.
-   **Build community resilience** against climate-fueled extreme
    weather including droughts, floods, and wildfires.
-   **Reconnect communities** divided by transportation infrastructure,
    by funding planning, design, demolition, and reconstruction of
    street grids, parks, or other infrastructure.
