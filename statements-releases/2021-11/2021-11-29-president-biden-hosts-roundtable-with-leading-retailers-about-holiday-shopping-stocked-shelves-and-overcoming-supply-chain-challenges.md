title: President Biden Hosts Roundtable with Leading Retailers About Holiday Shopping,
  Stocked Shelves and Overcoming Supply Chain Challenges
---
 
Today, President Biden, Director of the National Economic Council, Brian
Deese and Cedric Richmond, Director of Office of Public Engagement,
hosted a roundtable with a diverse group of American companies to
discuss their outlook for the strong holiday shopping season, and the
steps companies large and small have taken to meet consumer demands. The
meeting also highlighted steps companies have taken to overcome supply
chain bottlenecks and the progress they are seeing at the Ports of LA
and Long Beach, as a result of the work of the Biden-Harris
Administration.  
  
The CEOs thanked President Biden for his focus on supply chain
bottlenecks and the productive partnership he established with the
private sector to tackle these disruptions.  
The business leaders noted the strength of their supply chains,
especially for seasonal items, and highlighted ways they had planned
ahead, diversified their supplier base, sourced new products, and
partnered closely with suppliers to be ready to meet the seasonal
demand. The result of this planning is evident in their high inventory
levels and high on time delivery rates.  
  
Participants noted that the backlog at the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach has decreased, and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon highlighted a 51%
improvement in his company’s throughput at the ports due to the work of
the Biden-Harris Port Envoy.  
  
In addition to discussing the holiday shopping season, the President
also noted the progress made at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,
which have seen an over 40% drop in the number of long dwelling
containers, an important sign that velocity and fluidity are coming
back.  
  
Black Friday sales were up 30% compared to last year and we are in the
midst of a retail boom with retail sales up double digits every month in
2021 compared to the previous year. In October retail sales were up 15
percent compared to last year.  
  
Many retailers initiated Black Friday deals as early as October, and
many Americans did their holiday shopping earlier than usual, spreading
out the impact of holiday season shopping.

**Business Leader Statements:**  
  
**Karen Lynch – CVS Health President and CEO**  
“We’re seeing progress with port congestion and staffing levels as a
result of the administration’s recent actions, and the outlook for
maintaining stocked shelves improves each day. The focus on increased
availability of over-the-counter COVID-19 tests has also had a
meaningful impact and provides countless families with protection and
peace of mind during the holiday season. With regard to our pharmacies,
we’ve been able to utilize our expertise and extensive partnerships
throughout the supply chain to ensure the continued availability of
prescription medications since the onset of the pandemic.”  
  
**Josh Silverman – Etsy CEO**  
“Today, I am proud to represent Etsy’s community of more than five
million sellers in a discussion about the strength of small businesses
at the White House. Along with other business and retail leaders, I am
meeting President Joe Biden to help address the nation’s supply chain
crisis. I plan to use this time to remind the administration that it’s
critical to always consider actions that promote an environment where
small businesses are able to operate and thrive.”  
  
**Rodney McMullen – Kroger CEO**  
“At Kroger, we feel great about our ability to serve our customers’
needs through the holidays. We are grateful to President Biden for
inviting us to share Kroger’s unique perspective on providing fresh,
affordable and delicious food for customers this holiday season. We
thank the Biden Administration for their efforts to alleviate current
supply chain concerns. We remain focused on providing a full, fresh and
friendly experience for our customers by attracting and retaining
workers with Kroger’s opportunity culture, providing affordable Our
Brands products, partnering with suppliers to plan for increased demand
and to increase our safety stock on more than 70 of our most critical
categories, leveraging our data insights to identify
complementary/substitute items to fill customers’ needs where suppliers
can’t meet demands, and diversifying ports of entry we schedule
through.”  
  
**Carlos Castro – Todos Supermarket CEO**  
“I was honored to represent Todos and America’s independent community
grocers during today’s White House roundtable discussion on supply chain
challenges. Although independents are resilient and our customers can
rely on us during the holidays, independent grocers unfortunately
continue to face competitive disadvantages when sourcing products in
short supply. We appreciate the President’s leadership in helping to
address the major issues facing retailers and consumers.”  
  
**KS Choi – Samsung North America President and CEO**  
“As consumer demand for tech products continues to be unprecedented,
Samsung is committed to ensuring U.S. consumers have the appliances and
electronics they want and need.  We applaud President Biden for taking
action to drive the public/private collaborations that are helping solve
supply chain challenges that otherwise could impact the holiday season. 
Since the White House roundtable on port congestion, as promised we have
ramped up our capacity and have significantly reduced our backlog at the
Ports of LA and Long Beach, which helps ensure we will deliver on our
consumers’ holiday purchases.”  
  
**Ynon Kreiz – Mattel CEO**  
“I was encouraged by President Biden’s commitment to support the private
sector in mitigating supply chain disruptions, including in particular
port congestion. Mattel appreciates the Administration’s leadership in
helping to focus attention and resources in this important area. We
continue to work through supply chain challenges and collaborate closely
with our valued retail partners to try to meet the unprecedented demand
for our product. We are confident that there will be plenty of Mattel
toys for children of all ages to enjoy this holiday season. The toy
industry is a growth industry and is expected to continue to grow as
children, parents and caregivers have made play a bigger part of their
lives. We are grateful for the invitation to share information with the
White House about Mattel’s perspective on supply chain and the toy
industry’s preparation towards the holiday season. We look forward to
continuing the dialogue.”

**Meg Ham – Food Lion President  
**“I appreciated the opportunity to speak with President Biden and
others today to discuss the supply chain and our ongoing work to ensure
our neighbors have the items they need to nourish their families. The
pandemic transformed almost every aspect of our business – from the way
customers shop for groceries to how food is produced and transported to
our shelves. While there have been targeted supply chain issues, the
food supply chain remains robust and there is ample product available
for customers on our shelves. We continue to work with our diverse and
broad network of suppliers, source products from new partners and engage
directly with additional local vendors. On a daily basis, we are working
with our supply chain partners, ADUSA Supply Chain, to get product to
our stores to help meet customers’ needs.”
