The United States and Lithuania convened high-level bilateral
consultations in Washington today to discuss opportunities for enhanced
cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including with like-minded
partners. The United States reaffirmed strong support for Lithuania as a
valued NATO Ally and partner in addressing many shared global challenges
and opportunities, and in particular, those in the Indo-Pacific.
Participants discussed their countries’ shared commitment to democratic
values, human rights, and support for the international rules-based
order. Both sides committed to pursuing enhanced cooperation, including
on trade, investment, and supply chain resiliency; security and defense
ties; and addressing challenges associated with emerging and disruptive
technologies, as well as cyber and hybrid threats.  
   
The dialogue was led by Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis of
Lithuania and on the U.S. side by National Security Council Coordinator
for the Indo-Pacific Kurt Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink. It included
representatives from across the Lithuanian government as well as the
National Security Council, the Department of State, the Department of
Commerce, and the Department of Defense.
