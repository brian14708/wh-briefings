*The President and First Lady: “Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, from
our family to yours”*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

November 29, 2021 — Today, First Lady Jill Biden will unveil the theme
for the [2021 White House
Holiday](https://www.whitehouse.gov/holidays-2021/) Season: *Gifts from
the Heart.*   
   
“The things we hold sacred unite us and transcend distance, time, and
even the constraints of a pandemic: faith, family, and friendship; a
love of the arts, learning, and nature; gratitude, service, and
community; unity and peace. These are the gifts that tie together the
heart strings of our lives. These are the *Gifts from the Heart*,” the
First Lady and President wrote in a welcome letter at the beginning of
the commemorative 2021 White House Holiday Guide.    
   
“As we celebrate our first holiday season in the White House, we are
inspired by the Americans we have met across the country, time and again
reminding us that our differences are precious and our similarities
infinite,” the First Lady and President continued. “We wish you a happy,
healthy, and joyous holiday season. As we look to a new year full of
possibility, may gifts from the heart light our path forward.”  
   
During an event at the White House this afternoon, the First Lady will
offer a holiday message of unity, healing, and gratitude, and will thank
the over 100 volunteers from the local area who helped decorate the
White House for the season. In honor of the National Guard’s role
responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and all those National Guard
families spending holidays apart, the First Lady will be joined again by
a National Guard family: Captain Maryanne V. Harrell; husband Levi; and
their three children, Levi II, Marcus, and Elliana. Captain Maryanne V.
Harrell currently serves as the unit commander for the District of
Columbia Army National Guard (DCARNG) Medical Detachment. The Harrell
family also joined the First Lady for the Official White House Christmas
Tree arrival, and the First Lady invited Elliana’s 2<sup>nd</sup> grade
class from Malcolm Elementary School in Waldorf, Maryland to come to the
White House to help her unveil the 2021 decorations.  
   
Videos, photos, and information about the décor will be available
on WhiteHouse.gov/Holidays. Additionally, over the course of holidays, a
variety of interactive viewing experiences will launch on digital
platforms, including Instagram, Google Maps Street View, Snapchat, and
others, that will allow individuals to engage with the White House
during the holidays from home. Also, characters from PBS KIDS will join
the First Lady to help bring the “People’s House” during the holidays to
children all across the nation through free educational resources.

**2021 White House Holiday by the numbers:** 

-   There are 41 Christmas trees throughout the White House.
-   Approximately 6,000 feet of ribbon, over 300 candles, and over
    10,000 ornaments were used this year to decorate the White House.
-   Over 78,750 holiday lights decorate the Christmas trees, garlands,
    wreaths, and displays in the White House. 
-   Twenty-five classic wreaths adorn the north and south facades of the
    White House.
-   It takes over 100 dedicated volunteers working a full week to
    decorate the inside and outside of the White House. 

**Gifts from the Heart, 2021 Holidays Theme**

Inspired by the small acts of kindness and experiences that lifted our
spirits this year and throughout the pandemic, rooms in the White House
are decorated to reflect the *Gifts from the Heart* that unite us all: 

-   Faith
-   Community
-   Family 
-   Friendship
-   The Arts
-   Learning
-   Nature
-   Gratitude
-   Service
-   Peace
-   Unity 

Included below is a description of each room’s inspiration, expressing
the First Lady’s theme, *Gifts from the Heart:*    
   
**East Wing – Gift of Service**  
  
The 2021 White House holiday décor begins by honoring the *Gift of
Service. *This year has been defined by uncommon acts of compassion,
bravery, and selflessness by so many, and the First Family celebrates
their service and sacrifice.  
  
Throughout the East Colonnade, iridescent doves and shooting stars
illuminate the hallway, representing the peace and light brought to us
all by the service of frontline workers and first responders during the
pandemic. Poinsettias punctuate the glowing topiaries opposite the
windows to the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, dedicated by First Lady
Claudia “Lady Bird” Johnson in 1965. The East Wing of the White House
was expanded to its current form in 1942 and includes the Office of the
First Lady.  
  
**East Landing – Gold Star Tree**  
  
The Gold Star Tree honors the heroic women and men of our Nation’s
military, who have laid down their lives for our country, and the
families who carry on their legacies.  
  
**Library – Gift of Learning**  
   
Throughout the past year especially, we have all appreciated the *Gift
of Learning*. Educators learned how to connect with students in new and
innovative ways, pushing through the challenges of the pandemic.
America’s students and families needed champions like never before, and
they found their heroes in educators.   
   
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated this room to serve as the
White House Library in 1935. This space now holds approximately 2,700
volumes of books, focusing primarily on American history and
literature.  
   
This year, stacks of books as well as butterflies and birds made of
recycled paper decorate the Library, reminding us that, with the *Gift
of Learning*, we can soar to places we never imagined and rise to meet
any challenge.  
   
**Vermeil Room – Gift of the Visual Arts**  
   
To celebrate the *Gift of the Visual Arts*, the Vermeil (French for
“gilded silver”) Room glows with bright, bold, colorful paint brushes
and paint swatches, representing the diverse American artists whose
talents bring delight to all. From historic portraits to graphic art
displays, from light installations to marble sculptures, from wood
carvings to children’s handprint art, the visual arts bring us joy, calm
our minds, and inspire our imaginations.   
   
On the walls of this room, are the portraits of First Lady Jacqueline
Kennedy and First Lady Lou Henry Hoover. Sixty years ago, Mrs. Kennedy
founded the White House Historical Association to protect, preserve, and
provide public access to the rich history of America’s Executive
Mansion. Through educational efforts and programming, the People’s House
is shared far beyond the White House gates.  
   
**China Room – Gift of Friendship and Sharing**  
   
This holiday, as we gather hand-in-hand and heart-to-heart around the
dinner table, we hope the China Room inspires us all to share healing
laughs, comforting meals, and warm memories with loved ones, extending
the *Gift of Friendship and Sharing*. Wrapping the branches of the
room’s Christmas tree are garlands of intertwined hands symbolizing
friendship, fellowship, and merriment.   
   
The China Room, which was formalized by First Lady Edith Wilson in 1917,
houses tableware used by past presidential families. Each set reflects
the presidents and first ladies who selected their designs and recalls
the State Dinners and celebratory meals that have brought together world
leaders and diplomats.   
   
**Grand Foyer and Cross Hall – Gift of Faith and Community**  
   
The Grand Foyer and Cross Hall of the White House celebrate the *Gift of
Faith and Community.* With the strength of faith and love of community,
we are comforted and reassured that we are never alone.  
   
Floating candles symbolize the light we carry out into the world. The
hallway alcoves and tree displays depict wintry scenes of life within
our towns and cities, reflecting the solace of faith, the lasting bonds
of community, and the perseverance of the American spirit. Just like the
shooting stars in the night sky, we are encouraged by the brightness of
tomorrow and the hope it can bring.  
   
**East Room – Gift of Gratitude**  
   
Together, we are restoring the soul of this Nation with love and
understanding, with care and compassion, and most of all, with
gratitude. The East Room celebrates the *Gift of Gratitude,* symbolized
by small acts of kindness and handwritten notes, full of grateful
reflection. Whether it is penning a thank you card, sending a sweet text
with a heart emoji, or dropping off muffins on a neighbor’s front porch,
these expressions of gratitude heal our hearts and bring us together.  
   
Designed to be the largest room in the White House, the East Room has
hosted public receptions, ceremonies, bill signings, and other memorable
occasions. This room also features the most iconic White House artifact:
Gilbert Stuart’s portrait of George Washington, which First Lady Dolley
Madison helped save in 1814 when the White House was about to be set
aflame during the War of 1812.   
   
It was George Washington who, when bidding farewell to the officers of
the victorious Continental Army, described himself as having “a heart
full of love and gratitude” for those who served with him in the cause
of freedom.  
  
Since 1967, the Neapolitan crèche, with over 40 figurines from the
eighteenth century, has been displayed here every holiday season.  
   
**Green Room – Gift of Nature**  
   
The Green Room honors the *Gift of Nature*. One can always find respite,
tranquility, and restoration in the bounty of nature. The beauty of the
sunrise and the constancy of the tides remind us that the world always
moves forward and takes us with it. Hope renews with each new day.  
  
Arranged in the windows of the room are purple trees accented with
natural orchids. Lush foliage and sprays of greenery are draped along
the fireplace mantel. Once Thomas Jefferson’s dining room, the Green
Room houses Henry Ossawa Tanner’s *Sand Dunes at Sunset, Atlantic City*,
using actual sand to illustrate the windswept beaches of our coasts.  
   
**Blue Room – Gift of Peace and Unity**  
   
The Blue Room, featuring the Official White House Christmas Tree,
celebrates the *Gift of Peace and Unity*. Cascading down the tree, peace
doves carry a shimmering banner embossed with the names of each state
and territory of the United States, reminding us all of the importance
of unity and national harmony.   
   
Beginning in the Eisenhower Administration, a large Christmas tree has
been consistently featured in the Blue Room. The centerpiece of the
holiday season, an 18 ½ foot Fraser Fir from Jefferson, North Carolina,
stands floor to ceiling and fills the oval room. Every year, the room’s
chandelier is removed to accommodate the Christmas tree’s full height.
This year’s tree was presented by Rusty and Beau Estes of Peak Farms,
who were named the 2021 Grand Champion Grower in the annual National
Christmas Tree Association’s National Christmas Tree contest—their third
time winning this award.   
   
**Red Room – Gift of the Performing Arts**  
   
The Red Room captures the joy and wonder of the holiday season by
celebrating the *Gift of the Performing Arts*. Brass instruments hang
from the mantel against the rich, red, silk wall coverings. Ballet
slippers, tap shoes, and musical notes dance around the tree like
sugarplum fairies.  
   
The performing arts have taken on new meaning in recent years. The
advent of social media has empowered incredible artists and performers
to share their talent with the world from their own living rooms. When
theatres and concert halls shut down during the pandemic, new apps and
digital platforms allowed us all to join together virtually, keeping us
connected with performers in joy, laughter, and awe when we needed it
most.   
   
In the Red Room, two cranberry topiaries are on display, a tradition
which began in 1975.  
   
**State Dining Room – Gift of Family**  
  
The State Dining Room celebrates the cherished *Gift of Family*—those we
are born into, those we choose, and those we create. The pandemic kept
many of us apart, yet it also reminded us that our time together is so
precious.  
   
Just below the family stockings, an engraving in the fireplace mantel
reads, “I Pray Heaven To Bestow The Best of Blessings Upon This House…”
The words from this blessing were taken from a letter written by
President John Adams to his wife, Abigail, dated November 2, 1800. These
words are now known as the White House blessing. This year, the
Christmas trees in the State Dining Room glisten with ornaments
featuring photographs of First Families, past and present. Each family
who made this house a home reminds us all of the enduring love and
lasting bonds of family.  
   
**The Gingerbread White House**  
  
Situated on the eagle pier table in the State Dining Room is the
official 2021 Gingerbread White House. This year’s gingerbread display
is inspired by our gratitude and admiration for our Nation’s frontline
workers who kept our country running through the global pandemic, often
at great risk to themselves and their families.  
   
The display includes eight detailed replicas of community buildings
representing frontline workers. To complete the finishing touches, the
White House pastry team used 55 sheets of baked gingerbread, 120 pounds
of pastillage, 35 pounds of chocolate, and 25 pounds of royal icing.
