This morning, we learned that Advance Retail Sales increased above
expectations in October and now are 16 percent higher than this time
last year. Sales at restaurants and bars are up more than 29 percent
compared to this time last year and more than 9 percent compared to
pre-pandemic levels. In addition, retailer stores are benefiting from
healthy sales numbers. And this morning, Walmart, the nation’s largest
grocery and retail store, reported that it will have enough products to
meet consumer demand over the holiday season.

In short, families have seen an increase in real disposable income, and
stores and restaurants have the supplies to drive this recovery. Today’s
data show that even as we work to address the real challenge that
elevated inflation from supply chain bottlenecks poses for Americans’
pocketbooks and outlook, the economy is making progress. Going forward,
the Administration remains focused on growing our economy and bringing
prices down for American families by tackling COVID-19, addressing
supply chain challenges through implementation of the historic
infrastructure package signed into law yesterday, and passing the Build
Back Better Act which will boost the productive capacity of the economy
and address key costs for middle-class families, including health care,
housing, child care, and elder care.
