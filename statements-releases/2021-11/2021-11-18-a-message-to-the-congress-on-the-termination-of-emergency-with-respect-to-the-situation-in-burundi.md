title: A Message to the Congress on the Termination of Emergency with Respect to the
  Situation in Burundi
---
 
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
Consistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b), I hereby report that I have
issued an Executive Order that terminates the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13712 of November 22, 2015, and revokes that
Executive Order.

The President issued Executive Order 13712 to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the situation in Burundi, which had been
marked by the killing of and violence against civilians, unrest,
incitement of imminent violence, and significant political repression. 
In Executive Order 13712, the President addressed the threat by blocking
the property and interests in property of, among others, persons
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, to be responsible for or complicit in actions or
policies that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Burundi or
undermine democratic processes or institutions in Burundi, or to have
engaged in human rights abuses.  

I have determined that the situation in Burundi that gave rise to the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712 has been
significantly altered by events of the past year, including the transfer
of power following elections in 2020, significantly decreased violence,
and President Ndayishimiye’s pursuit of reforms across multiple
sectors.  For these reasons I have determined that it is necessary to
terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712 and
revoke that order.   

I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.           

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
November 18, 2021.
