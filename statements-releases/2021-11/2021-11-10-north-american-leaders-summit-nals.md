---
 
On November 18, President Biden will host Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
of Canada and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico at the
White House for the first North American Leaders’ Summit (NALS) since
2016. During the Summit, the United States, Mexico, and Canada will
reaffirm their strong ties and integration while also charting a new
path for collaboration on ending the COVID-19 pandemic and advancing
health security; competitiveness and equitable growth, to include
climate change; and a regional vision for migration. Strengthening our
partnership is essential to our ability to build back better, to
revitalize our leadership, and to respond to a widening range of
regional and global challenges. With respect for each other’s
sovereignty and in a true spirit of partnership, we affirm our
unwavering vision that North America is the most competitive and dynamic
region in the world.
