title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Initiatives on Space and\_Cybersecurity"
---
 
Following her meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Vice
President Kamala Harris is announcing a number of collaborative
initiatives that the United States will undertake alongside France and
other countries to address global issues and emerging threats. She is
announcing expanded cooperation on space and support for efforts to
advance international cooperation in cybersecurity.  These initiatives
underscore the U.S. commitment to work with allies and partners to take
on the challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  
   
**<u>Space</u>**  
   
For decades, the United States and France have benefited from robust
cooperation in space across our respective civil, commercial, and
national security sectors.  Recognizing the growing importance of space
in providing benefits to humanity, from tackling climate challenges and
enabling human exploration of space and scientific discovery to ensuring
sustainable economic development and security, our countries acknowledge
the pivotal role international cooperation plays in sustaining the outer
space environment so we may maximize the benefits space offers. Based on
this shared vision and over 60 years of joint space activities, the
United States and France will seek greater cooperation through the
following initiatives:  
 

-   **<u>Comprehensive Dialogue on Space</u>: ** Experts from the
    National Space Council, the National Security Council, Department of
    State, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, Department of
    Transportation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,
    the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Office
    of Science and Technology Policy, and other Departments and Agencies
    as appropriate, together with their French counterparts, will
    establish a regular bilateral dialogue to ensure a
    whole-of-government approach to space cooperation.  Together, we
    will leverage the growing importance of our civil, commercial, and
    national security space cooperation in order to meet our shared
    national and foreign policy objectives such as: addressing the
    climate crisis; expanding the frontiers of space; enhancing the
    quality of and access to science, technology, engineering and
    mathematics (STEM) education; consulting on norms, guidelines,
    principles, and rules for promoting the long-term sustainability of
    the outer space environment and the security of space activities;
    and enabling a sustainable space economy that ensures humanity
    accrues the benefits space has to offer. We committed to an initial
    emphasis on expanding cooperation to address the climate crisis,
    including discussions about enhancing the exchange of Earth
    observation satellite data and joint analysis of climate change
    risks.
-   **<u>Space Climate Observatory:</u>** Vice President Harris is
    announcing that the United States is committed to joining the Space
    Climate Observatory (SCO) and looks forward to working with France’s
    National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) to finalize the SCO
    Charter. SCO is intended to sponsor projects that help make data
    from space accessible to local entities to inform decisions and
    measures to mitigate and respond to the climate crisis. As Chair of
    the National Space Council, the Vice President is leading efforts to
    address the climate crisis by leveraging the nation’s space
    activities to address the needs of communities, including through
    building climate resilience, increasing understanding, and preparing
    responses to climate change. 

   
**<u>Cybersecurity</u>**  
   
The United States is committed to working alongside our allies and
partners to advance cybersecurity and uphold established global norms in
cyberspace. As part of these efforts, France is a vital partner to
ensuring security and stability for our people, holding actors that
threaten our national and economic security accountable, and setting the
rules of the road for the 21st century.     
 

-   **<u>Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace</u>:** Vice
    President Harris is announcing the U.S. decision to support the
    Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace –a voluntary
    commitment to work with the international community to advance
    cybersecurity and preserve the open, interoperable, secure, and
    reliable Internet.
-   The United States looks forward to continued partnership with France
    and other governments, private sector, and civil society around the
    world to advance and promote norms of responsible behavior in
    cyberspace.  This includes working with likeminded countries to
    attribute and hold accountable States that engage in destructive,
    disruptive, and destabilizing cyber activity.
-   The United States’ decision to support the Paris Call reflects the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s priority to renew and strengthen
    America’s engagement with the international community on cyber
    issues. The United States interprets the Paris Call consistent with
    our existing domestic and international obligations and commitments,
    including the importance we place on respecting human rights,
    freedom of expression and privacy.

This announcement builds on the United States’ continuing work to
improve cybersecurity for our citizens and business, including rallying
G7 countries to hold accountable nations that harbor cyber criminals,
supporting the update of NATO cyber policy for the first time in seven
years, and the recent counter-ransomware engagement with over 30
countries around the world to accelerate international cooperation to
combat cybercrime.
