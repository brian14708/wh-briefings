Today, the jury rendered its verdicts and the three defendants were
found guilty of murdering Ahmaud Arbery. Still, we feel the weight of
grief. Ahmaud Arbery should be alive, and nothing can take away the pain
that his mother Wanda Cooper-Jones, his father Marcus Arbery, and the
entire Arbery family and community feel today. I share in that pain.  
  
These verdicts send an important message, but the fact remains that we
still have work to do. The defense counsel chose to set a tone that cast
the attendance of ministers at the trial as intimidation and dehumanized
a young Black man with racist tropes. The jury arrived at its verdicts
despite these tactics.   
  
Ahmaud Arbery was a son. He was a brother. He was a friend. His life had
meaning. We will not forget him. We honor him best by continuing the
fight for justice.
