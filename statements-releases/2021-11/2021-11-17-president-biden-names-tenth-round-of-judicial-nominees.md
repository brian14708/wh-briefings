title: President Biden Names Tenth Round of Judicial Nominees
---
 
The President is announcing two new judicial nominees, both of whom are
extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law
and our Constitution.  
   
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.  
   
For example, the President’s new nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit, Andre B. Mathis, would become the first Black
man—and the second Black person—to sit on the Sixth Circuit from
Tennessee. The last time that a Black man was confirmed to the Sixth
Circuit was 24 years ago.  
  
And the President’s new nominee to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit, Judge Alison J. Nathan, would be the second
openly LGBT woman to serve on any federal circuit court. The first is
current Second Circuit Judge Beth Robinson from Vermont, who was
nominated by President Biden earlier this year and confirmed by the
Senate on November 1, 2021.  
  
This is President Biden’s tenth round of nominees for federal judicial
positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to
64.  
  
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies.
