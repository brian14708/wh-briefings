title: 'FACT SHEET: Renewed U.S. Leadership in Glasgow Raises Ambition to Tackle Climate
  Crisis'

*International Community Put Forward Innovative Efforts to Build a Clean
Energy Economy and Create Jobs* 

  
*The United States Will Continue to Push for
Action Beyond Glasgow and Keep 1.5 Degrees Celsius Goal Alive *

On day one at the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference
of the Parties (COP26), President Joe Biden made clear that Glasgow must
raise global ambition during this decisive decade of climate action to
preserve our shared future. The President reiterated that tackling the
climate crisis requires the whole of society – communities, businesses,
states, local governments, Tribal nations and nations around the world –
to come together to deliver economic prosperity, peace, and security.
The President and United States have led by the power of example, taking
bold steps to reduce emissions and create economic opportunity at home
and abroad, while rallying other countries to step up. On his first day
in office, President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement, restored U.S.
leadership on the world stage, and reestablished our position to tackle
the climate crisis at home and abroad. He convened the [first-ever
Leaders Summit

Climate that affirmed the need for unprecedented global cooperation and
ambition and convened a [U.S.-led Major Economies Forum on Energy and
Climate](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/17/readout-of-president-bidens-meeting-of-the-major-economies-forum-on-energy-and-climate/).
Congress passed President Biden’s [Bipartisan Infrastructure
Deal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/08/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-boosts-clean-energy-jobs-strengthens-resilience-and-advances-environmental-justice/),
which will expand access to clean drinking water, make unprecedented
investments in clean energy infrastructure, and is a critical step
towards reaching our goal of a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. When
paired with the Build Back Better Framework which the President also
looks forward to signing into law, these once-in-a-generation
investments will reduce our emissions by well over one gigaton this
decade – ensuring we meet President Biden’s commitment to reduce U.S.
emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels in 2030 and unlock the full
potential of a clean energy economy that combats climate change,
advances environmental justice, and creates good-paying, union jobs.  
  
Today, as COP26 ended, over 190 countries concluded negotiations on a
text that includes a global commitment to tackle the climate crisis and
keep the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within
reach. The text sets out a path to increase the commitments and actions
of countries starting next year, outlines new rules of the road for the
Paris Agreement that will provide transparency for countries to turn
words into actions, and doubles the amount of support that is going to
vulnerable countries to enhance their resilience to the crisis. But it
is not enough. More work remains as we leave Glasgow to get where
science tells us we need to be and the United States will continue to
push for more progress at home and abroad in this decisive decade for
climate action.    
  
As the U.S. engaged in intensive diplomacy and partnership with
countries around the world, collective action increased global ambition,
innovation and action to tackle the climate crisis. At the close of
COP26:

-   90% of the world’s GDP now has net zero commitments and 154
    countries put forward new climate action plans to cut emissions or
    “NDCs”. In April, President Biden announced a new target for the
    United States to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels
    in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030 and convened
    the Leaders Summit on Climate to secure stronger targets from world
    leaders.    
-   The United States and European Union announced that over 100
    countries, covering nearly half of global methane emissions and
    almost 70% of global GDP signed the Global Methane Pledge, including
    six of the world’s top 10 methane emitters. This complements the
    U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan – bold steps announced
    by President Biden to redouble efforts from across the government to
    dramatically reduce U.S. methane emissions, cut consumer costs,
    protect workers and communities, maintain and create thousands of
    high-quality, union jobs, and promote U.S. innovation and
    manufacturing of critical new technologies. 
-   Developed countries made progress towards the $100 billion climate
    finance mobilization goal. In April, President Biden has released
    the first-ever U.S. International Climate Finance Plan and announced
    a quadrupling of the U.S. international climate finance pledge at
    the UN General Assembly in September, including the largest U.S.
    commitment ever made to reduce climate impacts on those most
    vulnerable to climate change worldwide.   
-   The U.S. announced our first-ever contribution to the Adaptation
    Fund which at COP26 received $356 million in new support from
    contributing national and regional governments. President Biden
    announced the launch of the President’s Emergency Plan for
    Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE), a whole-of-government
    initiative that will serve as the cornerstone of the U.S. Government
    response to addressing the increasing impacts of the global climate
    crises in order to enhance global stability.   
-   Twenty-five countries, including the United States, and five
    financial institutions pledged to end new international finance for
    unabated fossil fuel energy by the end of 2022, except in limited
    and clearly defined circumstances that are consistent with the 1.5
    degrees Celsius warming limit, reorienting tens of billions of
    dollars of public finance and trillions of private finance towards
    low carbon priorities.   
-   Over $20 billion of new public and philanthropic finance has been
    committed to support developing countries to transition away from
    coal.    
-   Countries representing 90% of global forest cover pledged to reduce
    deforestation to zero by 2030, backed by the biggest ever commitment
    of public funds for forest conservation and a global roadmap to make
    75% of forest commodity supply chains sustainable. Twelve countries
    signed the Global Forest Finance Pledge: a target of $12 billion to
    combat deforestation. The United States released the Plan to
    Conserve Global Forests: Critical Carbon Sinks, a first-of-its-kind,
    whole-of-government effort to preserve global ecosystems which serve
    as vital carbon sinks.   
-   The United States launched the First Movers Coalition with more than
    25 Founding Members including some of the largest companies in the
    world, across a wide range of industries, with hundreds of billions
    of dollars in purchasing power. The buyers’ clubs assembled by this
    initiative will create early market demand for innovations across
    eight “need-to-abate” sectors—steel, trucking, shipping, aviation,
    aluminum, concrete, chemicals, and direct air capture—which
    represent more than one-third of the world’s carbon emissions today,
    and is expected to grow in the coming decades.   
-   China joined the United States, the world’s two biggest economies
    and emitters, in committing in a new Joint Declaration to
    collaborate on increased ambition to keep 1.5 degrees Celsius
    warming within reach, and China for the first time committed to
    develop a plan to address methane emissions and accelerate its coal
    phase-down.   
-   The United States, UK, EU, France, and Germany announced a
    partnership with South Africa to chart a course from coal to clean
    energy through the creation of new jobs and opportunities for South
    African coal communities. This partnership will seek to prevent up
    to 1-1.5 gigatons of emissions over the next 20 years in support of
    South Africa’s accelerated transition to a low emission, climate
    resilient economy, and aims to mobilize $8.5 billion for the first
    phase of financing, through various mechanisms including grants,
    concessional loans, investments, risk sharing, and other instruments
    for private sector mobilization. This partnership comes as the
    United States continues to redouble efforts to invest in our
    nation’s energy communities, including delivering the largest
    investment in American history to tackle legacy pollution while
    creating thousands of new good paying jobs as part of the
    President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.  
-   The United States and the United Arab Emirates launched the
    Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate alongside more than 30
    countries and more than 45 non-government partners to increase and
    accelerate agricultural and food systems innovation in support of
    climate action. The initiative has already garnered an $4 billion in
    increased investment in climate smart agriculture and food systems
    innovation, with the United States planning to mobilize $1 billion
    over five years.
