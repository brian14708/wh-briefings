title: Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on Continued International Counter
  Ransomware Efforts
---
 
Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne
Neuberger and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria
Nuland briefed ambassadors and representatives of 35 countries yesterday
on the Counter-Ransomware Initiative (CRI) and U.S. government efforts
to accelerate cooperation to counter ransomware.

Under Secretary Nuland discussed the Department of State’s efforts to
counter ransomware, including using foreign assistance to increase
partner capacity against threats and by elevating counter-ransomware
efforts in relevant international cooperative efforts. She also noted
establishment of a new Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy which
will incorporate and grow the Department of State’s existing
capabilities and expertise. Under Secretary Nuland encouraged countries
to leverage existing international frameworks, like the Budapest
Cybercrime Convention and the UN Convention Against Transnational
Organized Crime.

Deputy National Security Advisor Neuberger briefed participants on
outcomes from the CRI meeting October 13-14, which for the first time
brought together senior leaders and subject matter experts from law
enforcement, cybersecurity, financial regulators, and foreign affairs
ministries. At the CRI meeting, countries recognized the importance of
integrating these expert communities going forward and committed to
doing so. The United States is working with CRI partners to identify
areas for future cooperation in four categories: improving network
resilience, addressing the laundering of ransoms in virtual currencies,
supporting ransomware-related investigations and subsequent
prosecutions, and diplomatic cooperation. Countries released a joint
statement in October and have expressed an interest in expanding the CRI
partnership.
