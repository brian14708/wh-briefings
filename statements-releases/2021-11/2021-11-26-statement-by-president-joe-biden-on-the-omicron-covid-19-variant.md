title: "Statement by President Joe Biden on the Omicron COVID- \u2060 19 Variant"
---
 
This morning I was briefed by my chief medical advisor, Dr. Tony Fauci,
and the members of our COVID response team, about the Omicron variant,
which is spreading through Southern Africa. As a precautionary measure
until we have more information, I am ordering additional air travel
restrictions from South Africa and seven other countries. These new
restrictions will take effect on November 29. As we move forward, we
will continue to be guided by what the science and my medical team
advises.   
   
For now, I have two important messages for the American people, and one
for the world community.  
   
First, for those Americans who are fully vaccinated against severe COVID
illness – fortunately, for the vast majority of our adults — the best
way to strengthen your protection is to get a booster shot, as soon as
you are eligible.  Boosters are approved for all adults over 18, six
months past their vaccination and are available at 80,000 locations
coast-to-coast.  They are safe, free, and convenient.  Get your booster
shot now, so you can have this additional protection during the holiday
season.  
   
Second, for those not yet fully vaccinated: get vaccinated today.  This
includes both children and adults.  America is leading the world in
vaccinating children ages 5-11, and has been vaccinating teens for many
months now – but we need more Americans in all age groups to get this
life-saving protection. If you have not gotten vaccinated, or have not
taken your children to get vaccinated, now is the time.  
   
Finally, for the world community: the news about this new variant should
make clearer than ever why this pandemic will not end until we have
global vaccinations. The United States has already donated more vaccines
to other countries than every other country combined. It is time for
other countries to match America’s speed and generosity.     
  
In addition, I call on the nations gathering next week for the World
Trade Organization ministerial meeting to meet the U.S. challenge to
waive intellectual property protections for COVID vaccines, so these
vaccines can be manufactured globally.  I endorsed this position in
April; this news today reiterates the importance of moving on this
quickly.
