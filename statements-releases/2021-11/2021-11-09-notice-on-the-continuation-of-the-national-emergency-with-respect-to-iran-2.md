title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to\_Iran"
---
 
On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*), and took
related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States
constituted by the situation in Iran.

Our relations with Iran have not yet normalized, and the process of
implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is
ongoing.  For this reason, the national emergency declared on November
14, 1979, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that
emergency, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2021.  Therefore,
in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with
respect to Iran declared in Executive Order 12170.

The emergency declared by Executive Order 12170 is distinct from the
emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 on March 15, 1995.  This
renewal, therefore, is distinct from the emergency renewal of March 5,
2021.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
November 9, 2021.
