title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Today\u2019s Counter Ransomware\_Actions"
---
 
Cyber threats are a concern for every American, every business
regardless of size, and every community. Since the earliest days of my
Administration, cybersecurity has been a core priority as we have
marshaled a comprehensive national effort, as well as broad
international coordination, to protect our people and critical
infrastructure, our allies, and our interests. I commend the Department
of Justice, and the FBI, the Department of State, and Department of the
Treasury for their efforts to counter cyber threats.

When I met with President Putin in June, I made clear that the United
States would take action to hold cybercriminals accountable. That’s what
we have done today. We are bringing the full strength of the federal
government to disrupt malicious cyber activity and actors, bolster
resilience at home, address the abuse of virtual currency to launder
ransom payments, and leverage international cooperation to disrupt the
ransomware ecosystem and address safe harbors for ransomware criminals.
While much work remains to be done, we have taken important steps to
harden our critical infrastructure against cyberattacks, hold
accountable those that threaten our security, and work together with our
allies and partners around the world to disrupt ransomware networks —
and my Administration will continue to use every tool available to us to
protect the American people and American interests against cyber
threats.
