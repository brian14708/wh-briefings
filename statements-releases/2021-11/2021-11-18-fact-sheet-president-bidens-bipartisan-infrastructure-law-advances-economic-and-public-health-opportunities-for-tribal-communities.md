title: "FACT SHEET: President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Advances\
  \ Economic and Public Health Opportunities for Tribal Communities"
---
 
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law”) is a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure and
economic competitiveness. For far too long, Washington policymakers have
celebrated “infrastructure week” without ever agreeing to build
infrastructure. The President promised to work across the aisle to
deliver results and rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. After the
President put forward his plan, he got to work negotiating a deal with
Members of Congress from both parties and then helped get it passed.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild Tribal roads, bridges and
rails, expand access to clean drinking water for Native communities,
ensure every Native American has access to high-speed internet, tackle
the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and invest in Tribal
communities that have too often been left behind. The legislation will
help ease inflationary pressures and strengthen supply chains by making
long overdue improvements for our nation’s ports, airports, rail, and
roads. It will drive the creation of good-paying union jobs and grow the
economy sustainably and equitably so that everyone gets ahead for
decades to come. **This legislation invests more than $13 billion
directly in Tribal communities across the country, and make Tribal
communities eligible for billions more in much-needed investments.**

This historic legislation will:

-   **Support Critical Infrastructure Including Clean and Safe Drinking
    Water for Tribal Communities.** The legislation makes the largest
    investment in clean drinking water in American history with $55
    billion in funding. This includes an investment of approximately $6
    billion dollars to support water infrastructure in Tribal
    communities, including 3.5 billion over five years for the Indian
    Health Service Sanitation Facilities Construction program and 2.5
    billion for enacted Indian Water Settlements. It also includes large
    increases in Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water
    State Revolving Fund, a portion of which will be dedicated funding
    for Tribal communities.

-   **Ensure Every Native American Has Access to Reliable High-Speed
    Internet.** The legislation will help lower prices for internet
    service and ensure all Americans can do their jobs, equally
    participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. The
    act invests $65 billion to expand broadband, with $2 billion in
    dedicated funding for a long-overdue expansion of broadband for
    Native people.

-   **Repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate
    change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all users.**
    The legislation will reauthorize surface transportation programs for
    five years and invest $110 billion in additional funding to repair
    our roads and bridges and support major, transformational projects.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the single largest
    investment in repairing and reconstructing our nation’s bridges
    since the construction of the interstate highway system. The
    legislation provides a historic investment in the Tribal
    Transportation Program. Approximately $4 billion in funding would
    provide urgently needed resources for often underdeveloped, unsafe,
    and poorly maintained road networks, and hundreds of bridges in need
    of repair in Indian Country.

-   **Make our infrastructure resilient against the impacts of climate
    change, cyber-attacks, and extreme weather events.** The legislation
    makes our communities safer and our infrastructure more resilient to
    the impacts of climate change and cyber-attacks. This includes $32
    million for Tribes for cybersecurity grants. The legislation also
    includes funds to protect against droughts and floods, in addition
    to a major investment in weatherization. The bill is the largest
    investment in the resilience of physical and natural systems in
    American history. This includes substantial investments in programs
    for which Tribes and Tribal members are eligible, such as FEMA’s
    Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities pre-disaster
    mitigation program and for USDA’s Watershed Protection and Flood
    Prevention Program.

-   **Provide Tribal Communities Transition and Relocation Assistance.**
    Tribal lands are significantly at risk to the effects of climate
    change, particularly those of Alaska Natives Tribes and Villages
    that face multiple climate impacts. The legislation invests in a new
    Tribal transition and relocation assistance program with
    approximately $216 million in funding to support planning and
    voluntary, community led transitions for those Tribal communities
    who are most vulnerable to accelerating climate-driven disasters.

<!-- -->

-   **Protect Tribal Land and Water.** As the effects of climate change
    continue to intensify, Indigenous coastal communities are facing
    unique climate-related challenges associated with living on the
    water. Flooding, erosion, permafrost subsidence, sea level rise, and
    storm surges are presenting existential threats to coastal
    communities’ economies, infrastructure, livelihoods and health. This
    legislation invests in landscape-level resilience and conservation
    investments on federal, Tribal, and partner lands, including
    billions of dollars for coastal resilience programs and major
    landscape restoration initiatives. Tribal communities will be key
    partners in many of these initiatives. It also includes $60 million
    for Tribal fish passage improvements and $172 million to support
    Tribes with salmon recovery efforts.

-   **Deliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in
    American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites,
    reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas
    wells**. The act will invest more than $21 billion in environmental
    remediation, making the largest investment to address the legacy
    pollution that harms the public health of communities and
    neighborhoods in American history, creating good-paying union jobs
    in hard-hit energy communities and advancing economic and
    environmental justice. The bill includes funds to clean up Superfund
    and brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine land and cap orphaned
    gas wells – including in rural communities and Tribal communities
    with a $150 million in dedicated funding to remediate orphaned wells
    on Tribal lands.

<!-- -->

-   **Electrify America’s Power Infrastructure.** The legislation
    invests roughly $60 billion – the single largest investment in
    American history – in clean energy transmission. It upgrades our
    power infrastructure, including by building thousands of miles of
    new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of
    renewable energy. It creates a new Grid Deployment Authority,
    invests in research and development for advanced transmission and
    electricity distribution technologies, and promotes smart grid
    technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. It invests in
    demonstration projects and research hubs for next generation
    technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, carbon capture, and
    clean hydrogen. Tribal communities will be key partners in many of
    these initiatives.
