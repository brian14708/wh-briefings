---
 
Today, on Transgender Day of Remembrance, the Biden-Harris
Administration mourns those we lost in the deadliest year on record for
transgender Americans, as well as the countless other transgender
people—disproportionately transgender women and girls of color—who face
brutal violence, discrimination, and harassment. At least 46 transgender
Americans were killed by acts of fatal violence to date this year. As
President Biden made clear in his
[statement](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/20/statement-by-president-biden-on-transgender-day-of-remembrance/)
today, this somber record underscores that we must honor those who have
lost their lives to anti-transgender violence and hate with action.  
  
To memorialize Transgender Day of Remembrance, today the White House:  
  
**Hosted a vigil to honor those lost.** The White House and the Second
Gentleman of the United States hosted a first of its kind vigil in the
Diplomatic Room of the White House to honor the lives of transgender and
gender diverse people killed this year, and countless transgender and
gender diverse people who face brutal violence, harassment, and
discrimination in the United States and around the world. The Second
Gentleman lit 46 candles representing the transgender and gender diverse
killed this year in the United States, and a 47<sup>th</sup> candle for
those who have lost their lives to violence around the world.  
  
**Released a report from the Interagency Working Group on Safety,
Opportunity, and Inclusion for Transgender and Gender Diverse
Individuals.** Today, the White House released a
[report](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Report_Memorializing-Transgender-Day-of-Remembrance_FINAL-002.pdf)
highlighting over 45 key, early actions the Biden-Harris Administration
is taking to address the root causes of anti-transgender violence,
discrimination, and denial of economic opportunity, including:

-   **Taking steps to expand the availability of accurate Federal IDs
    for transgender and gender diverse Americans.** Building on the
    State Department’s announcement that it will offer a third gender
    marker on U.S. passports, the White House is convening an
    interagency policy committee to advance a coordinated federal
    approach to expanding access to accurate and inclusive federal
    identity documents for transgender and gender diverse people.  
-   **Expanding access to gender-affirming care as an essential health
    benefit.** In 2021, the Biden-Harris administration approved the
    first ever application from a state to add additional
    gender-affirming care benefits to a state’s essential health benefit
    benchmark plan.  
-   **Advancing health equity research on gender-affirming care.** NIH
    will increase funding for research on gender-affirming procedures to
    further develop the evidence base for improved standards of care.
    Research priorities include a more thorough investigation and
    characterization of the short- and long-term outcomes on physical
    and mental health associated with gender-affirming care.  
-   **Ending the HIV crisis among transgender and gender diverse
    communities.** The White House Office of National AIDS Policy will
    identity transgender and gender diverse communities as a priority
    population in the revised National HIV AIDS Strategy which will be
    released on World AIDS Day, December 1, 2021.  
-   **Expanding resources for transgender and gender diverse youth in
    care.** The Children’s Bureau at HHS will highlight the needs of
    LGBTQI+ children and youth in announcements for mandatory and
    discretionary funding that supports youth in or transitioning from
    foster care.   
-   **Advancing research to address the harms of so-called conversion
    therapy.** The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration (SAMHSA) will update its 2015 publication *Ending
    Conversion Therapy: Supporting and Affirming LGBTQ Youth* to reflect
    the latest research and state of the field.   
-   **Advancing safety and justice for transgender and Two Spirit
    missing and murdered Indigenous people*.*** President Biden signed
    an [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/15/executive-order-on-improving-public-safety-and-criminal-justice-for-native-americans-and-addressing-the-crisis-of-missing-or-murdered-indigenous-people/)
    on Improving Public Safety and Criminal Justice for Native Americans
    and Addressing the Crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People.
    The Executive Order acknowledges that LGBTQI+ Native Americans and
    people who identify as Two-Spirit people are frequent targets of
    violence. The Executive Order directs federal agencies to work hand
    in hand with Tribal Nations and Tribal partners to build safe and
    healthy Tribal communities and to support comprehensive law
    enforcement, prevention, intervention, and support services to
    address the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous People,
    including for transgender, gender diverse, and Two-Spirit Native
    Americans.  
-   **Advancing data collection and research on the needs of transgender
    older adults.** To advance equity for transgender and gender diverse
    elders, the Administration for Community Living (ACL) will establish
    a technical advisory panel to advise on possible questions for the
    National Survey of Older Americans Act Participants regarding sexual
    orientation and gender identity.

To address the crisis of anti-transgender stigma and violence, during
Pride Month the White House established the first Interagency Working
Group on Safety, Opportunity, and Inclusion for Transgender and Gender
Diverse Individuals (Working Group). The Working Group, which is led by
the White House Domestic Policy Council and Gender Policy Council, is
charged with leading a coordinated federal approach to advance safety,
economic opportunity, and inclusion for transgender and gender diverse
people in the United States and around the world. To inform the
priorities of the Working Group, throughout the fall of 2021 the White
House convened 15 listening sessions with transgender and gender diverse
people, advocates, and civil rights leaders from across the country and
around the world. Today’s report shares findings from these listening
sessions and uplifts the voices and advocacy of transgender and gender
diverse people throughout the United States and around the world.    
  
**Today’s actions to honor the lives of transgender and gender diverse
people lost to violence build on historic steps by the Biden-Harris
Administration to advance LGBTQI+ equality and civil rights for
transgender and gender diverse communities.** Since taking office, the
Biden-Harris Administration has [taken critical
steps](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/01/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-champions-lgbtq-equality-and-marks-pride-month/) to
advance equality for transgender and gender diverse Americans:

-   **Signing One of the Most Comprehensive Executive Orders in History
    on LGBTQI+ Rights on His First Day in Office. **Within hours of
    taking the oath of office, President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/) Preventing
    and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or
    Sexual Orientation. The Executive Order established that it is the
    official policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to prevent and
    combat discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, and to fully
    enforce civil rights laws to prevent discrimination on the basis of
    gender identity or sexual orientation. The President directed all
    federal agencies to implement fully all federal laws that prevent
    discrimination on the basis of sex, to include sexual orientation
    and gender identity. This Executive Order is one of the most
    consequential policies for LGBTQ+ Americans ever signed by a U.S.
    President. As a result of that Order, agencies have already taken
    key steps to advance equality for transgender and gender diverse
    people in housing, healthcare, education, employment, and credit and
    lending services.  
-   **Fighting for passage of the Equality Act.** President Biden
    [continues to
    call](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-the-equality-act-will-provide-long-overdue-civil-rights-protections-for-millions-of-americans/)
    on the Senate to swiftly pass the Equality Act, legislation which
    will provide long overdue federal civil rights protections to
    LGBTQI+ Americans and their families, while strengthening some key
    civil rights laws for people of color, women, people with
    disabilities, and people of faith. As the White House has
    [said](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-the-equality-act-will-provide-long-overdue-civil-rights-protections-for-millions-of-americans/),
    passing the Equality Act is key to addressing the epidemic levels of
    violence and discrimination that transgender people face.  
-   **Reversing the discriminatory ban on transgender servicemembers.**
    In his first week in office, President
    Biden [signed](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/) an
    Executive Order reversing the ban on openly transgender
    servicemembers serving in the Armed Forces, enabling all qualified
    Americans to serve their country in uniform. President Biden
    believes that gender identity should not be a bar to military
    service, America’s strength is found in its diversity, and an
    inclusive military strengthens our national security As a result of
    his Executive Order, the Department of Defense issued
    new [policies](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2557220/dod-announces-policy-updates-for-transgender-military-service/) which
    prohibit discrimination against transgender servicemembers, provide
    a path for transgender servicemembers to access gender-affirming
    medical care, and require that all transgender servicemembers are
    treated with dignity and respect. Patriotic transgender
    servicemembers are once again able to openly and proudly serve our
    Nation in uniform.  
-   **Signing and Leading Implementation of a Presidential Memorandum on
    Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the
    World. **President
    Biden [directed](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/memorandum-advancing-the-human-rights-of-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-persons-around-the-world/) all
    agencies engaged abroad to ensure that United States diplomacy and
    foreign assistance promote and protect the human rights of LGBTQ+
    persons. His Memorandum establishes that it “shall be the policy of
    the United States to pursue an end to violence and discrimination on
    the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or
    sex characteristics, and to lead by the power of our example in the
    cause of advancing the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons around the
    world.”  
-   **Ensuring Transgender Americans Can Access Emergency Shelter That
    Dignifies and Respects Their Identity. **The Department of Housing
    and Urban Development [restored
    protections](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_21_069) for
    transgender individuals seeking emergency shelter and homeless
    services. HUD reaffirmed its commitment that no person be denied
    access to housing or other critical services because of their gender
    identity.
