title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Terrorist Attack in\_Iraq"
---
 
I strongly condemn the terrorist attack targeting the residence of Iraqi
Prime Minister al-Kadhimi. I am relieved the Prime Minister was not
injured and commend the leadership he has shown in calling for calm,
restraint, and dialogue to protect the institutions of the state and
strengthen the democracy Iraqis so richly deserve.

The perpetrators of this terrorist attack on the Iraqi state must be
held accountable. I condemn in the strongest terms those using violence
to undermine Iraq’s democratic process.

I have instructed my national security team to offer all appropriate
assistance to Iraq’s security forces as they investigate this attack and
identify those responsible. The United States stands firmly with the
government and people of Iraq as they strive to uphold Iraq’s
sovereignty and independence.
