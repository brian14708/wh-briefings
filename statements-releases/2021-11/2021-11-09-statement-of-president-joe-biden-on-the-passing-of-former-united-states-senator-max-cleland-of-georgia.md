title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Former United\_States\
  \ Senator Max Cleland of\_Georgia"

Max Cleland was an American hero whose fearless service to our nation,
and to the people of his beloved home state of Georgia, never wavered.

As a 25-year-old serving in the 1<sup>st</sup> Cavalry Division of the
U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, Max lost both of his legs and his
right arm in a grenade explosion at Khe Sanh. After grueling months in
the hospital, enduring multiple surgeries and a long road back to
recovery, Max turned his pain into purpose.  He continued his
distinguished public service, becoming a lifelong champion of the
dignity and rights of working people and America’s wounded veterans. 
His leadership was the essential driving force behind the creation of
the modern VA health system, where so many of his fellow heroes have
found lifesaving support and renewed purpose of their own thanks in no
small part to Max’s lasting impact.

I had the distinct honor of knowing Max as both a colleague and a friend
during our six years together in the United States Senate.  He was a man
of unflinching patriotism, boundless courage, and rare character.  I was
proud to have Max by my side.  He will be remembered as one of Georgia’s
and America’s great leaders.

Max Cleland was a good man who loved God and country. 

Jill and I are deeply saddened to learn of his passing, and our prayers
are with all those who loved him.
