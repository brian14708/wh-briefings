title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Surpassing 100,000 American Overdose\
  \ Deaths in the Past\_Year"
---
 
Today, new data reveal that our nation has reached a tragic milestone:
more than 100,000 lives were lost to the overdose epidemic from April of
last year to April of this year. As we continue to make strides to
defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot overlook this epidemic of loss,
which has touched families and communities across the country.  
   
As we grieve those we’ve lost and honor their memories, my
Administration is committed to doing everything in our power to address
addiction and end the overdose epidemic. Through the American Rescue
Plan, we’ve delivered nearly $4 billion to strengthen and expand
services for substance use disorder and mental health. We’re working to
make health coverage more accessible and affordable for all Americans,
so that more people who need care can get it. We are strengthening
prevention, promoting harm reduction, expanding treatment, and
supporting people in recovery, as well as reducing the supply of harmful
substances in our communities. And we won’t let up.  
   
To all those families who have mourned a loved one and to all those
people who are facing addiction or are in recovery: you are in our
hearts, and you are not alone. Together, we will turn the tide on this
epidemic.
