title: "FACT SHEET: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Will Revitalize Main\_Street"
---
 
America’s small businesses account for more than 40 percent of U.S. GDP,
create two-thirds of net new jobs, and employ almost half of America’s
workers. However, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, America’s aging
infrastructure prevented too many small businesses from reaching their
full potential. **President Biden’s historic Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law will equip America’s Main Street entrepreneurs with the tools and
resources they need to innovate, create good-paying jobs, and provide
the essential goods and services our communities depend on.**
Specifically, President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will:

-   **Reduce small business shipping delays by upgrading our nation’s
    transportation infrastructure.** Decades of declining public
    investment has left our roads, bridges, rail, and transit systems in
    poor condition, with a trillion-dollar backlog of needed repairs.
    Prior to the pandemic, nearly two-thirds of small business owners
    considered local roads and bridges average, poor, or very poor
    quality and more than half of small business owners said
    infrastructure investments are crucial to the success of their
    business. The President’s plan invests an additional $621 billion in
    transportation infrastructure and resilience to help small
    businesses obtain the inputs they need and deliver goods and
    services to consumers across America and around the world. 
-   **Help small businesses hire new employees and reach new customers
    by providing universal broadband.** Broadband internet is necessary
    for Americans to do their jobs and increasingly important for small
    business owners all across America. Yet, by one definition, more
    than 30 million Americans live in areas where there is no broadband
    infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds. Perhaps as
    a result, even before the pandemic, 7 in 10 small business owners
    felt it was important for Congress to fund broadband projects.
    President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will invest $65
    billion in broadband infrastructure, helping ensure that every
    American has access to reliable high-speed internet and creating new
    opportunities for small businesses nationwide.
-   **Expand access to tens of billions of dollars’ worth of federal,
    state, and local government contracts, including more than $37
    billion through the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).** For
    too long, America’s small businesses have struggled to compete for
    and win government contracts. President Biden’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law includes a historic procurement effort designed
    to support small businesses and tackle long standing inequities in
    the contracting system. Among other things, the legislation directs
    DOT to attempt to award more than $37 billion in federal contracts
    to small disadvantaged business contractors. Specifically, the
    Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, and
    National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will seek to expend
    at least 10 percent of their more than $370 billion in contract
    authority through small disadvantaged businesses. President Biden’s
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will put Main Street to work
    rebuilding the nation’s roads and bridges, eliminating the nation’s
    lead service lines and pipes, deploying broadband, and installing
    thousands of miles of new and resilient transmission lines.
-   **Foster the development of Main Street small businesses in
    underserved communities by empowering the Minority Business
    Development Agency (MBDA).** Latino and Black Americans are roughly
    30 percent of the U.S. population; yet they currently own less than
    10 percent of small businesses with employees. For more than 50
    years, the federal agency whose entire focus is on addressing racial
    disparities in business ownership has been operating with meagre
    resources and without permanent authorization from Congress.
    President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will make MBDA
    permanent, elevate its Director to Under Secretary of Commerce, and
    give the agency more tools and authority. These actions will enable
    MBDA to create new programs to address the economic challenges
    facing underserved communities, expand small business ownership, and
    shrink longstanding inequities in wealth and opportunity.
