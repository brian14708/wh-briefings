Tonight, I will travel to France at the invitation of President Macron
to build on our Administration’s progress strengthening our alliances
and partnerships in Europe and around the world. During my visit, I will
join leaders at the Paris Peace Forum to address the rising inequality
that has been exacerbated by the pandemic. To promote security and
stability in cyberspace, I will participate in a high-level meeting on
the Paris Agenda for Technology and the Digital Domain. And to
demonstrate our strong support for the people of Libya as they plan for
elections later this year, I will attend the Paris Conference on
Libya.  
   
The alliance between the United States and France is America’s oldest,
and among our strongest. I look forward to discussing with President
Macron our work together on the most urgent challenges of our time
—including the climate crisis, the global health crisis, and regional
security concerns. We will also discuss new opportunities for
collaboration in the area of space.   
   
It is fitting that the trip coincides with Armistice Day and Veterans
Day. During World War I, and throughout our history, members of the
United States and French armed forces fought side by side in defense of
freedom. The courage and commitment of our military service members is a
source of national pride and gratitude. We honor their sacrifice by
continuing the work—bilaterally and multilaterally—to build a better and
more peaceful future.  
   
I am departing for France on the heels of important progress for the
American people, following passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal
which will make America more competitive. And I look forward to building
on our progress here at home by working with our allies and partners to
advance this Administration’s agenda—and our country’s interests—around
the world.
