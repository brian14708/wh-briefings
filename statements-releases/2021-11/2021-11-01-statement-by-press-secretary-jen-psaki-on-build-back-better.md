title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on Build Back\_Better"
---
 
Senator Manchin says he is prepared to support a Build Back Better plan
that combats inflation, is fiscally responsible, and will create
jobs. The plan the House is finalizing meets those tests—it is fully
paid for, will reduce the deficit, and brings down costs for health
care, child care, elder care, and housing. Experts agree: Seventeen
Nobel Prize-winning economists have said it will reduce inflation. As a
result, we remain confident that the plan will gain Senator Manchin’s
support.
