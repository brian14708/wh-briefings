title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the House Passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act
---
 
Tonight, we took a monumental step forward as a nation.  
  
The United States House of Representatives passed the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act, a once-in-generation bipartisan infrastructure
bill that will create millions of jobs, turn the climate crisis into an
opportunity, and put us on a path to win the economic competition for
the 21st Century.  
  
It will create good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. Jobs that will
transform our transportation system with the most significant
investments in passenger and freight rail, roads, bridges, ports,
airports, and public transit in generations.  
  
This will make it easier for companies to get goods to market more
quickly and reduce supply chain bottlenecks now and for decades to come.
This will ease inflationary pressures and lower costs for working
families.  
  
The bill will create jobs replacing lead water pipes so every family can
drink clean water.  
  
It will make high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere in
America.  
  
This bill will make historic and significant strides that take on the
climate crisis. It will build out the first-ever national network of
electric vehicle charging stations across the country. We will get
America off the sidelines on manufacturing solar panels, wind farms,
batteries, and electric vehicles to grow these supply chains, reward
companies for paying good wages and for sourcing their materials from
here in the United States, and allow us to export these products and
technologies to the world.  
  
It will also make historic investments in environmental clean-up and
remediation, and build up our resilience for the next superstorms,
droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes that cost us billions of dollars in
damage each year.  
  
I’m also proud that a rule was voted on that will allow for passage of
my Build Back Better Act in the House of Representatives the week of
November 15<sup>th</sup>.  
  
The Build Back Better Act will be a once-in-a-generation investment in
our people.  
  
It will lower bills for healthcare, child care, elder care, prescription
drugs, and preschool. And middle-class families get a tax cut.  
  
This bill is also fiscally responsible, fully paid for, and doesn’t
raise the deficit. It does so by making sure the wealthiest Americans
and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share and doesn’t raise
taxes a single cent on anyone making less than $400,000 per year.   
  
I look forward to signing both of these bills into law.  
  
Generations from now, people will look back and know this is when
America won the economic competition for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.
