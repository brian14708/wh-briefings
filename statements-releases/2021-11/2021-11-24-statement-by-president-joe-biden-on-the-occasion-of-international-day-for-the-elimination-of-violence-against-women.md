  \ the Elimination of Violence Against\_Women"

This year, as we again mark the International Day for the Elimination of
Violence Against Women, we must also grapple with the hard truth that
the COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated a “shadow pandemic” of
violence. Around the world, including in the United States, reports of
domestic violence have increased during the pandemic, exacerbating a
deeply entrenched human rights crisis, and women in public life continue
to experience threats, attacks, and fears of reprisal, both online and
in daily life.

It’s estimated one in three women will be subjected to physical
violence, rape, or stalking at some point in their lives. One in three.
It’s unacceptable. And, as is so often the case, it is women and girls
from underserved and historically marginalized communities—including
persons of color, LGBTQI+ people, and individuals with disabilities—who
are disproportionately impacted.

The status and treatment of women and girls and the peace and prosperity
of nations are inextricably linked.** ** Ending gender-based violence is
not only a moral imperative, but a strategic imperative to realize the
full and equal participation of all people as we meet the urgent global
challenges of today. 

Ending gender-based violence has been a policy priority for me for
decades. From writing and championing the Violence Against Women Act
nearly three decades ago, to establishing the Gender Policy Council at
the White House and issuing the first National Strategy for Gender
Equity and Equality, I have worked to help change the culture around
domestic violence and sexual assault in the United States.  As a nation,
we must once again commit ourselves to preventing and responding to
gender-based violence, wherever it occurs. And in the coming months, my
Administration will issue the first National Action Plan to End
Gender-Based Violence, bringing a whole-of-government approach to
supporting survivors, promoting prevention, and shifting norms, and
update our Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence
Globally using the full range of our foreign policy tools.

Eliminating violence against women is an enduring value and goal that we
must prioritize in all that we do. Because it is only when women and
girls are able to live free from the fear of abuse and violence that
they will be able to unleash their full talents. Today, we all stand
together to renew our commitments and redouble our efforts to prevent
and address gender-based violence and create a culture that refuses to
tolerate abuse in any form.
