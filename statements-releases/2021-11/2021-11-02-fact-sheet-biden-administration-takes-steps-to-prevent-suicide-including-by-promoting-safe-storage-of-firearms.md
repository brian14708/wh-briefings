title: 'Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Takes Steps to Prevent Suicide, Including
  by Promoting Safe Storage of Firearms'
---
 
Firearms are the most common method of suicide in the United States,
accounting for two-thirds of all firearms deaths. Before deciding
whether to keep a firearm in their home, families should know that
[having access to a gun triples one’s risk of death by
suicide](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260487452_The_Accessibility_of_Firearms_and_Risk_for_Suicide_and_Homicide_Victimization_Among_Household_Members).
If they choose to purchase a firearm, responsible gun owners should
safely store their firearms to prevent individuals who could be a danger
to themselves or others from using the weapon. Additionally, firearms
dealers have a responsibility to take commonsense steps to keep their
customers and communities safe.  
  
Today, the Biden Administration is announcing three new actions that
will help to prevent suicide, including by promoting safe firearms
storage and clarifying best practices for firearms dealers.  
  
Studies have shown that reducing access to lethal means, including
firearms and medications—particularly in times of crisis—can save lives.
[According to one study, “firearm owners who keep their firearms locked
or unloaded were at least 60% less likely to die from firearm related
suicide than those who store their firearms unlocked and/or
loaded.”](https://jech.bmj.com/content/58/10/841) Suicide crises are
often brief, so strategies that create “time and space” between a person
in crisis and their access to a firearm are lifesaving.  
  
**Launching an Unprecedented Focus on Improving Lethal Means Safety in
the Military and Veteran Suicide Prevention Strategy**  
  
The Biden Administration’s comprehensive [military and veteran suicide
prevention
strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Military-and-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Strategy.pdf),
released today, announces an unprecedented federal focus on improving
lethal means safety as a tool to save lives. The Departments of Defense
(DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice
(DOJ), and Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as the Office of Emergency
Medical Services within the Department of Transportation (DOT), will
jointly create a plan for addressing lethal means safety awareness,
education, training, and program evaluation. The agencies will work
together to identify, develop, and test any tailored messaging, and they
will base their activities on expert guidance (including from suicide
prevention experts and law enforcement professionals) and data. This
campaign will include plans to:

-   Educate the public on lethal means safety, and in turn encourage
    safer storage practices, safety planning, and time and space
    behavioral measures for crisis response. The agencies are planning
    to use:  
    -   Professionally developed public service announcements;
    -   Paid media promoted via social media platforms as well as
        internet search engines;
    -   Toolkits developed with industry partners, as appropriate,
        designed to amplify campaign calls to action;
    -   Multi-state storage maps to help individuals find where they can
        safely store firearms outside of their homes; and
    -   Lethal means safety training opportunities and engagement for
        non-medical counselors, crisis responders, health care
        professionals, family members, and other gate keepers, both
        within the government and within non-government community
        service delivery systems.   
-   Significantly increase Lethal Means Safety training engagement and
    completion for VA Community Care Network providers and for
    healthcare providers in the community. 
-   Expand VA Safety Planning in the Emergency Department (SPED) into
    community healthcare systems and Emergency Departments in an effort
    to increase implementation of evidence-based suicide prevention
    safety planning processes and to increase care management and
    coordination for high-risk individuals who were not admitted for
    medical or psychiatric reasons. The expansion effort will also
    include training family members and supporters on how to use safety
    plans.

**Making it Easier for Customers to Obtain Secure Gun Storage or Safety
Devices**  
  
In 2016, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)
proposed a rule clarifying firearms dealers’ statutory obligations to
make available for purchase compatible secure gun storage or safety
devices. The Department of Justice plans to soon finalize a rule on this
topic, including responding to public comments.  
  
**Promoting Best Practices for Federal Firearms Dealers, Including
Customer Education Regarding Safety and Security for Firearms Owners**  
  
ATF will issue a best practices guide to all federal firearms dealers to
remind them about the important steps they are legally required to take,
and additional steps they are encouraged to take, to keep their
customers and communities safe. The guide includes:

-   Materials for Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to distribute to
    customers to help them better understand their legal obligations as
    firearms owners, as well as practical steps they can take to
    facilitate the safe storage of firearms and keep firearms out of the
    hands of people prohibited from possessing firearms.
-   A summary of the Department of Justice’s zero-tolerance approach to
    willful violations of the Gun Control Act and implementing
    regulations that put public safety at risk. Absent extraordinary
    circumstances that would need to be justified to the ATF Director,
    ATF will seek to revoke the licenses of dealers the first time that
    they violate federal law by willfully 1) transferring a firearm to a
    prohibited person, 2) failing to run a required background check, 3)
    falsifying records, such as a firearms transaction form, 4) failing
    to respond to an ATF tracing request, or 5) refusing to permit ATF
    to conduct an inspection in violation of the law.
-   A reminder regarding FFLs’ obligations to run background checks for
    firearms transfers, and the unlawfulness of selling to prohibited
    persons.
-   Recommendations on how to implement safety and security measures to
    secure firearm inventory, including the use of alarm and video
    surveillance systems, to prevent firearm theft and loss.

These actions build on the Biden Administration’s previous gun violence
prevention actions. Earlier this year, the Justice Department issued
model extreme risk protection order legislation for states. Extreme risk
protection order laws are another strategy for reducing access to lethal
means, allowing family members or law enforcement to petition for a
court order temporarily barring people in crisis from accessing firearms
if they present a danger to themselves or others. The President
continues to urge Congress to pass an appropriate national “red flag”
law, as well as legislation incentivizing states to pass their own
versions of these laws.
