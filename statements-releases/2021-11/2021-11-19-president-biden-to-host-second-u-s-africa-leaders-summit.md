As part of the Biden Administration’s commitment to revitalizing global
partnerships and alliances, President Biden will convene leaders from
across the African continent for the second U.S. – Africa Leaders Summit
next year.  This Summit will continue efforts to strengthen ties with
African partners based on principles of mutual respect and shared
interests and values. It will also serve as an opportunity to listen to
and collaborate with African counterparts on key areas the United States
and Africa define as critical for the future of the continent and our
global community.  Additional details to follow.
