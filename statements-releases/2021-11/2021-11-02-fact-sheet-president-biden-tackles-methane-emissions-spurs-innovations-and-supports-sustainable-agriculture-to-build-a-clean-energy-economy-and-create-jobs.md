title: "Fact Sheet: President\_Biden Tackles Methane Emissions, Spurs Innovations,\
  \ and Supports Sustainable Agriculture to Build a Clean Energy Economy and Create\_\
  Jobs"
---
 
Today, President Biden is announcing bold actions consistent with his
vision that tackling the climate crisis is not just an imperative, but
one of the greatest economic opportunities of our time. When he thinks
of climate, he thinks of jobs – and he knows that decisive actions will
deliver for economies and jobs back home.  
  
The United States is leading the clean energy economy of the future with
initiatives across a range of sectors and all stages of innovation:
research, development, and deployment. The [Department of
Energy](https://www.energy.gov/us-energy-employment-jobs-report-useer)
reports that while most energy sectors lost jobs in 2020, the sectors
that continued growing amid the pandemic were wind generation, battery
storage, and hybrid and electric vehicles. Globally, the [International
Energy
Agency](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-importance-of-focusing-on-jobs-and-fairness-in-clean-energy-transitions)
estimates that moving to a net-zero economy would create 30 million jobs
worldwide by 2030 across energy, construction, and automotive sectors,
65% of which will be high-skilled jobs. The United States is committed
to realizing not only the emissions reductions potential, but also the
economic growth and jobs creation opportunities across key sectors.  
  
Through tackling methane emissions, spurring innovations, and supporting
sustainable agriculture, President Biden today is announcing bold steps
that will push the U.S. clean energy economy forward and create
good-paying jobs. President Biden is unveiling a [**U.S. Methane
Emissions Reduction Action
Plan**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/US-Methane-Emissions-Reduction-Action-Plan-1.pdf)
that redoubles efforts from across the government to dramatically reduce
U.S. methane emissions, cut consumer costs, protect workers and
communities, maintain and create high-quality, union-friendly jobs, and
promote U.S. innovation and manufacturing of critical new
technologies.  
  
The President is also announcing how the U.S. is partnering with
countries around the world to drive innovation and deep decarbonization,
including through **Net-Zero World to** chart pathways to deep
decarbonization; the **Clean Energy Demand Initiative** that will
facilitate greater corporate procurement of renewable energy; and the
**First Movers Coalition** that will drive innovation by sending a
demand signal for the new technologies we need in industry, aviation,
and heavy-duty transportation.  
  
The President is pursuing efforts with partners around the world to
mobilize public and private finance for climate-smart economic growth
and development, including by bringing a climate lens to infrastructure
development through Build Back Better World (B3W), creating jobs in
clean industries in the U.S. and other countries including a new
partnership with South Africa, and strengthening the pipeline of
bankable projects and facilitating private investment in climate-smart
development through USTDA and USAID programming.  
  
The President also recognizes the critical role of natural ecosystems in
solving the climate crisis, launching major initiatives including **AIM
for Climate** to spur agricultural innovation, the Plan to Conserve
Global Forests which will catalyze global efforts to conserve and
restore forests and other critical ecosystems.  
  
*More on today’s announcements:  
*  
**Reducing Methane Emissions:** Methane emissions are a major
contributor to climate change, which is why President Biden is taking
critical, commonsense steps at home to reduce methane across the economy
– all while rallying the rest of the world to take similar bold
actions.  
  
This is why President Biden in September announced that the United
States was joining with the European Union in challenging the world to
meet a Global Methane Pledge and reduce the world’s methane emissions
30% from 2020 levels by 2030.  **The official launch event the second
day of COP-26 will announce that more than 100 governments have now
joined the pledge,** including six of the world’s top 10 methane
emitters: the United States, Brazil, EU, Indonesia, Pakistan, and
Argentina.  
  
The new [**U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action
Plan**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/US-Methane-Emissions-Reduction-Action-Plan-1.pdf)
is an ambitious, whole-of-government initiative that uses all available
tools – commonsense regulations, catalytic financial incentives,
transparency and disclosure of actionable data, and public and private
partnerships – to identify and cost-effectively reduce methane emissions
from all major sources. These actions will protect public health,
promote U.S. innovation in new technologies, and help employee tens of
thousands of skilled workers across the country. The plan aims to
reduce:

-   **Oil & Gas Industry Methane Emissions**: The oil and gas industry
    is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United
    States, responsible for approximately 30% of total methane
    emissions. That is why on January 20, 2021, the first day of his
    Administration, President Biden issued Executive Order 13990,
    directing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue
    regulations under the Clean Air Act to reduce the oil and gas
    industry’s methane emissions.  
      
    The EPA is today proposing new regulations that will significantly
    broaden and strengthen methane emissions reduction for new oil and
    gas facilities. In addition, for the first time ever, it will
    require that states develop plans that will reduce methane
    emissions from existing sources nationwide—including from an
    estimated 300,000 oil and gas well sites. Overall, the proposed
    requirements would reduce emissions from covered sources, equipment,
    and operations by approximately 75%.  
      
    The Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
    and Safety Administration (PHMSA) is implementing the bipartisan
    PIPES Act by upgrading and expanding pipeline rules that will, among
    other things, require operators to cut methane leaks and excursions.
    And the Department of the Interior (DOI) is focusing on
    opportunities to tackle the venting and flaring of methane from oil
    and gas operations and well closures on public lands and waters. 
-   **Landfill Methane Emissions:** Landfills are the second largest
    industrial source of methane in the United States. Building on
    efforts earlier this year to put in place an enforceable federal
    backstop plan to ensure emissions reductions from large municipal
    landfills, EPA is ramping up an initiative to reduce the food loss
    and waste that serves as a major contributor to landfill methane
    emissions. EPA is also boosting its voluntary landfill methane
    outreach program to achieve a national goal of 70 percent methane
    emissions capture for all landfills around the country.
-   **Emissions by Plugging Oil & Gas Wells and Remediating Abandoned
    Mines:** Under the President’s Build Back Better plan, DOI will
    launch an aggressive program to plug hundreds of thousands of orphan
    oil and gas wells, including many that are still venting methane,
    employing union workers across the country. Build Back Better would
    scale up the current Abandoned Mine Land program, funding historic
    remediation efforts that would result in dramatic methane emissions
    reductions from thousands of currently leaking, abandoned coal
    mines. This scaled up program would also enlist tens of thousands of
    skilled workers, especially in energy communities across the
    country.
-   **Agricultural Methane Emissions:** In his early Executive Order on
    “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,” the President
    called on the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to work with farmers
    and ranchers to identify voluntary, incentive-based approaches that
    will advance climate goals. In response, USDA is pursuing multiple
    workstreams to reduce methane emissions from the agricultural
    sector, including (1) the adoption of alternative manure management
    systems and other methane-reducing practices; (2) the expansion of
    on-farm generation and use of renewable energy; (3) the development
    of a climate-smart agricultural commodities partnership initiative
    and (4) increased investments in agricultural methane quantification
    and related innovations.

**Energy, Industry, Transportation, and Other Need-to-Abate Sectors:**
President Biden recognizes that accelerating clean energy adoption
around the world is central to the global net-zero transition. Energy
represents the majority of global emissions, and clean energy
technologies that are already cost-competitive are critical for reducing
emissions across the power, transportation, industry, and buildings
sectors. The United States is committed to partnering with governments
and business leaders around the world to drive the clean energy
transition that will strengthen our economies, which is why the United
States will be hosting the Clean Energy Ministerial and Mission
Innovation next year.  President Biden has launched several initiatives
demonstrating his commitment to partnering with entrepreneurs and
innovators to catalyze the development and deployment of the new
technologies that will power the clean economy of the future.  The
United States is partnering with emerging economies to develop deep
decarbonization strategies, mobilizing private companies to drive
deployment in need-to-abate industrial sectors, strengthening adoption
of renewable and nuclear energy including small modular reactors, and
launching the next Energy Earthshot to accelerate innovation in carbon
dioxide removal technologies.

-   The **First Movers Coalition** (FMC), led by the State Department
    through the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and the
    World Economic Forum, is a platform for building private-sector
    demand to speed clean energy technology innovation and confront the
    climate crisis. Through this flagship public-private partnership,
    companies make purchasing commitments during this decade to send a
    clear demand signal for commercializing emerging technologies
    essential to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The FMC launches
    at COP-26 with more than 25 Founding Members that have each made
    demand commitments, including some of the largest companies in the
    world across a wide range of industries with hundreds of billions of
    dollars in purchasing power. The buyers’ clubs assembled by the FMC
    will create early market demand for innovations across eight
    “need-to-abate” sectors—steel, trucking, shipping, aviation,
    aluminum, concrete, chemicals, and direct air capture—which
    represent more than one-third of the world’s carbon emissions today,
    a proportion set to grow in the coming decades.  
-   **Net-Zero World:**In line with the objectives of the President’s
    Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, the Department of Energy
    is leading an initiative in partnership with the Department of
    State, USAID, USTDA, DFC and others, to accelerate global energy
    system decarbonization by leveraging the Department of Energy’s 17
    National Laboratories and deploying the diplomatic, technical and
    financial expertise from across U.S. government agencies.  Together
    with the philanthropic community, the United States will work
    hand-in-hand with partner countries to provide world-class technical
    assistance to inform each country’s energy decarbonization strategy
    to net zero and collaborate to implement solutions.  Through this
    whole-of-government, holistic approach, the United States will help
    partner countries unlock private-sector financing and deliver on
    low-carbon development pathways through U.S. technical expertise on
    implementation pathways and market reforms. The first Net Zero World
    partner countries announced at COP 26 are Argentina, Egypt,
    Indonesia, Nigeria, and Ukraine.  
-   The **Clean Energy Demand Initiative (CEDI)** leverages private
    sector commitments to deploy clean energy technologies by creating a
    platform for companies to send investment signals to key markets.
     Through CEDI, over 30 companies have signed letters of intent to
    procure renewable energy to offset electricity demand for a
    multitude of sectors, including technology, manufacturing, retail,
    and health. And, over 45 more companies have expressed interest in
    joining. Countries in turn will signal support for high level
    principles to create an enabling environment for corporate renewable
    procurement. The renewable energy demand from over 75 interested
    companies has the potential to unlock up to $67 billion in power
    infrastructure, as a complement to broader sectoral investment. CEDI
    will serve as a platform for stakeholder engagement and country
    partnerships and create a venue for companies and countries to
    continually signal investment potential and policy plans. CEDI
    builds on commitments made by over 325 companies, through RE100, to
    move to 100% renewable energy by 2050 or earlier.   
-   President Biden is announcing the next Energy Earthshot to
    accelerate breakthroughs of more abundant, affordable, and reliable
    clean energy and climate solutions within the decade. Following the
    Energy Earthshots announced this year on Clean Hydrogen and
    Long-Duration Energy Storage, the newest challenge will target
    Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). **Carbon Negative Shot** is DOE’s
    all-hands-on-deck call to mobilize public and private research to
    develop durable and scalable CDR approaches at greatly reduced costs
    relative to today. DOE will develop rigorous standards in
    consultation with researchers and experts around the world to ensure
    that the full suite of CDR approaches that remove carbon dioxide
    from the atmosphere will deliver results that take carbon out of the
    atmosphere for the long term. Carbon Negative Shot will accelerate
    the development of CDR as an additional and necessary tool that can
    be responsibly deployed in a just and sustainable way alongside
    technologies for aggressive greenhouse gas mitigation.

The United States and Romania will announce today plans to build a
**“first-of-a-kind” small modular reactor (SMR) plant in Romania in
partnership with U.S. NuScale Power**, bringing the latest civil nuclear
technology to a critical part of Europe.  The partnership will bring SMR
technology to Romania, positioning U.S. technology to lead in the global
race for SMR deployment.  The commercial agreement will include a
six-module NuScale plant, initially creating over 3,700 U.S. and
Romanian jobs, including possible union jobs, with the potential to
create 30,000 U.S. and Romanian jobs as the project grows. Deployment of
SMR technology will be an important contributor to a decarbonized power
sector and net zero future.  
  
**Driving a Global Clean Economy:** President Biden is committed to
driving development of a clean global economy and establishing new
coalitions and partnerships to do so. Building on the G7’s June 2021
launch of Build Back Better World – a values-driven, high-standard, and
transparent infrastructure partnership to catalyze infrastructure
investment and economic growth–the Biden Administration is pursuing
efforts across the whole of government and with partners around the
world to mobilize public and private finance for climate-smart economic
growth and development.

-   Today, President Biden and European Commission President von der
    Leyen hosted a discussion with leaders from around the world, as
    well as UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney
    and World Bank Group President David Malpass, and leaders from
    around the world on how infrastructure partnerships like Build Back
    Better World will simultaneously advance prosperity and combat the
    climate crisis. In conversation with leaders from countries with
    significant infrastructure needs, participants discussed how Build
    Back Better World and like-minded infrastructure initiatives will be
    an integral part of our fight against climate change, galvanize
    much-needed attention, focus, and resources to help narrow the
    infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries, and build
    infrastructure systems that last instead of infrastructure projects
    that lapse.
-   The United States, UK, EU, France and Germany will announce a
    partnership with South Africa to chart a course from coal to clean
    through the creation of new jobs and opportunities for South African
    coal communities. This partnership will seek to prevent up to 1-1.5
    gigatons of emissions over the next 20 years in support of South
    Africa’s accelerated transition to a low emission, climate resilient
    economy, and aims to mobilize $8.5 billion for the first phase of
    financing, through various mechanisms including grants, concessional
    loans, investments, risk sharing and other instruments for private
    sector mobilization.
-   The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is creating
    opportunities for U.S. companies abroad as countries seek to
    transition to a net-zero economy by tackling one of the major
    challenges in attracting finance for climate-smart infrastructure:
    the need for a strong project pipeline for clean development
    projects. USTDA, through its Global Partnership for Climate-Smart
    Infrastructure, has set a goal of $60 million in programming through
    2023 to tackle the climate crisis while supporting good-paying U.S.
    jobs. In the past year alone, USTDA’s programming has been designed
    to introduce over $5 billion in clean technologies into emerging
    markets globally through feasibility studies and pilot projects that
    help U.S. businesses gain a foothold in markets abroad, and help
    host countries prove the concept for clean projects that can attract
    full-scale investment to grow cleaner economies and address the
    infrastructure gap in emerging economies.
-   USAID is catalyzing private financial flows for clean development
    through a range of programs to connect investors with opportunities
    in developing countries, partner with countries to support the
    deployment of clean energy infrastructure, reduce pollution and
    build resilience. Two new and expanded projects USAID is announcing
    today include a goal to invest up to $250 million to mobilize $2.5
    billion in private finance through its new **Green Recovery
    Investment Platform** to support clean economic growth globally.
    USAID is also expanding the **U.S.-Europe Energy Bridge** with plans
    to invest $100m over 10 years, subject to Congressional
    appropriations, addressing barriers to clean private investment by
    supporting regulatory reforms to create open and transparent energy
    markets.

**Supporting Agriculture and Critical Ecosystems:** Building a clean
economy includes working to shift global economic incentives to
recognize the value of forests, oceans, and other critical ecosystems.
President Biden also recognizes that solving the climate crisis means
building a more sustainable and resilient agricultural sector that feeds
the world with lower emissions. The President is launching and expanding
marque initiatives to bring innovative solutions to agriculture and
forest issues. In particular, the President’s Build Back Better
Framework will provide major financial support to farmers and ranchers
who adopt “climate smart agriculture and forestry” practices that reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and sequester additional carbon stocks in soils
and vegetation. 

-   **[Plan to Conserve Global
    Forests](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Plan_to_Conserve_Global_Forests_final.pdf):
    Critical Carbon Sinks** This is a first of its kind,
    whole-of-government Plan that launches a decade-long effort to
    conserve forests and other terrestrial and coastal ecosystems that
    serve as critical carbon sinks. The Plan supports collective goals
    the United States has previously endorsed, including to strive to
    end natural forest loss by 2030; to significantly increase the rate
    of global restoration of degraded landscapes and forestlands; and to
    slow, halt, and reverse forest cover and carbon loss. The Plan
    outlines four key objectives: 1) Incentivize forest and ecosystem
    conservation and forest landscape restoration; 2) Catalyze private
    sector investment, finance and action to conserve critical carbon
    sinks; 3) Build long-term capacity, and support the data and systems
    that enhance accountability; 4) Increase ambition for climate and
    conservation action. It notes an intent to dedicate up to $9 billion
    of our international climate funding to support these objectives by
    2030, subject to Congressional appropriations.
-   The United States and the United Arab Emirates launched the
    **Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate)**
    alongside more than 30 countries and more than 45 non-government
    partners. The initiative’s goal is to increase and accelerate
    agricultural and food systems innovation in support of climate
    action. To achieve this goal, AIM for Climate partners will work to
    catalyze greater public and private sector investment in, and other
    support for, climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation
    to help to raise global ambition and underpin more rapid and
    transformative climate action in all countries. AIM for Climate has
    already garnered an “early harvest” of $4 billion in increased
    investment in climate smart agriculture and food systems innovation,
    with the United States planning to mobilize $1 billion over 5 years.
-   Today, the United States is also announcing that it will be joining
    the **High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy**. This
    multi-national initiative is harnessing the power of the ocean to
    tackle the climate crisis, provide jobs and food security, and
    accelerate sustainable uses of the ocean. As a member of the Ocean
    Panel, the U.S. will develop a national plan to sustainably manage
    our ocean area under national jurisdiction. COP26 is a timely moment
    to join this initiative. The ocean sustains all life on this planet,
    yet its health is under threat from greenhouse gas emissions and
    other stressors. At the same time, the ocean is a source of climate
    solutions, from reducing shipping emissions, to scaling up offshore
    renewable energy, to protecting coastal ecosystems that store carbon
    and improve climate resilience. This is one step in continued
    efforts to engage on protecting the ocean, including partnering with
    Palau on the Our Ocean Conference in 2022.
