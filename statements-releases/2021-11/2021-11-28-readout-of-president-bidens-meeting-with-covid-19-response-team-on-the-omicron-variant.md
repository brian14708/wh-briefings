  \ on the Omicron Variant"
---
 
Following up on the regular briefings he had on COVID while traveling,
the President met in person today with his Chief Medical Advisor, Dr.
Anthony Fauci, and members of his White House COVID Response Team. Dr.
Fauci and members of the COVID Response Team updated the President on
the latest developments related to the Omicron variant. Dr. Fauci
informed the President that while it will take approximately two more
weeks to have more definitive information on the transmissibility,
severity, and other characteristics of the variant, he continues to
believe that existing vaccines are likely to provide a degree of
protection against severe cases of COVID. Dr. Fauci also reiterated that
boosters for fully vaccinated individuals provide the strongest
available protection from COVID. The COVID Response Teamâ€™s immediate
recommendation to all vaccinated adults is to get a booster shot as soon
as possible; all adults are eligible for a booster if they were
vaccinated six months ago or more with Pfizer or Moderna, or two months
ago or more with Johnson & Johnson. Importantly, those adults and
children who are not yet fully vaccinated should get vaccinated
immediately. The President will provide an update about the new variant
and the U.S. response on Monday.
