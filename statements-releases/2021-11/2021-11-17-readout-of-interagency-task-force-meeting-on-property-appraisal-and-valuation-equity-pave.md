Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia
L. Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice convened a meeting of
the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity
(PAVE). The Task Force, which was created by President Biden in June,
consists of senior leaders from the Cabinet and independent agencies
within the federal government and is tasked with addressing the
persistent misvaluation and undervaluation of properties owned by
families and communities of color.  

Since the first meeting of the Task Force in August, members of the Task
Force have received input from a diverse set of stakeholders, including
 the housing industry, civil rights organizations, advocacy groups,
academic institutions, and philanthropic organizations. That feedback
informed today’s discussion on updating appraisal standards and
guidance, synchronizing regulatory action, and sharing data between
agencies to support policy development, monitoring and enforcement of
fair housing laws, among others. Members considered both near- and
long-term opportunities for government agencies to ensure the methods
used in property valuation are fair and do not discriminate against
communities of color.

The Task Force will deliver a final action report to the President in
early 2022 that (1) describes the extent, causes, and consequences of
misvaluation and undervaluation of properties, and (2) proposes a set of
policy recommendations and consumer-facing actions that participants can
take to advance racial equity in the appraisal process.

The Task Force membership includes the following officials:

-   Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (co-chair)
-   Domestic Policy Advisor (co-chair)
-   Attorney General of the United States
-   Secretary of Agriculture
-   Secretary of Labor
-   Secretary of Veterans Affairs
-   Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
-   Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
-   Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
-   Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
-   Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal
    Financial Institutions Examination Council
-   Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
-   Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
-   Director of the National Economic Council
-   Executive Director of the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC)
