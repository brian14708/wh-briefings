title: "FACT SHEET: Virtual Engagement with Indigenous Women Leaders in Preparation\
  \ for the Fourth Convening of the Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous\
  \ Women and\_Girls"
---
 
Today, the White House welcomes our partners from the governments of
Canada and Mexico as we jointly host a half-day virtual discussion with
Indigenous women leaders from all three of our countries.  This virtual
engagement brings together Indigenous women leaders from across North
America to gather their expertise and recommendations in identifying
priority areas for deliberation at the fourth convening of the
Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls
(Trilateral Working Group), which the White House will host in the
Spring of 2022.

First established as an outcome of the June 2016 North American Leaders’
Summit, the Trilateral Working Group is an initiative to reaffirm and
advance our respective national and regional commitments to:

-   Exchange information about policies, programs and promising
    practices to prevent and respond to gender-based violence (GBV)
    impacting Indigenous women and girls, including Two-Spirit and
    gender-diverse individuals in North America through increased access
    to justice and services, with a human rights, survivor-centered and
    culturally-responsive approach;
-   Enhance cooperation to address violent crimes against Indigenous
    women and girls, including human trafficking, within or outside of
    their communities and across our borders;
-   Enhance prevention efforts and the responses of our justice, health,
    education, and child welfare systems to violence against Indigenous
    women and girls;
-   Facilitate meaningful engagement with Indigenous women and girls,
    acknowledging their agency and supporting their participation in
    listening sessions and knowledge exchange on key issues impacting
    their communities; and,
-   Address the need for improved data collection and research to better
    understand the extent of gender-based violence, including sexual
    violence, human trafficking, and other forms of violence, in
    Indigenous communities and identify opportunities to improve
    prevention and response efforts.

The first convening of the Trilateral Working Group was hosted by the
United States in 2016. The Trilateral Working Group subsequently held
convenings in Canada in 2017, and in Mexico in 2018. The United Nations
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2019 recognized the Trilateral
Working Group as an important initiative, recommending Canada, Mexico,
and the United States maintain our enduring commitment to tackling
ongoing issues of violence against Indigenous women and girls in the
region, including trafficking and the continuing crisis of missing and
murdered Indigenous people.
