  Treatment"
---
 
Earlier this month, we received promising news that Pfizer has developed
an antiviral pill for people infected by COVID-19 that may dramatically
reduce the risk of hospitalizations and death.  
  
While this antiviral pill still requires a full review by the Food and
Drug Administration, I have taken immediate steps to secure enough
supply for the American people.  Today, I’m announcing that we have
purchased 10 million treatment courses of the Pfizer antiviral COVID-19
pill, with delivery starting at the end of this year and across 2022. 
My administration is making the necessary preparations now to ensure
these treatments will be easily accessible and free.  
  
This is positive news. This treatment could prove to be another critical
tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic.  
  
But vaccines remain our strongest tool.  With the authorization of
vaccines for children aged 5 – 11 years old, 95% of Americans are now
eligible to be vaccinated.   
  
My message continues to be: get vaccinated.  
  
The vaccines are safe, free, and easily available.  
  
Don’t wait.  
  
Get vaccinated today.  
  
I will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that America has
the tools we need to save lives and bring an end to this pandemic.
