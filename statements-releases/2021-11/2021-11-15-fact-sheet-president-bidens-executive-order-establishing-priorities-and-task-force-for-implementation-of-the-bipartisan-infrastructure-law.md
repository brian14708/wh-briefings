Today, President Biden will sign the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal into
law– historic legislation to rebuild crumbling infrastructure, create
good paying jobs, and grow our economy. It is a top priority for the
President that these investments deliver meaningful results to Americans
in communities all across the country, strengthen US manufacturing, and
can withstand the impacts of climate change. This morning, the President
will sign an Executive Order outlining the Administration’s
implementation priorities and establishing an Infrastructure
Implementation Task Force to coordinate the law’s effective
implementation.

**Priorities for Infrastructure Implementation. **The Executive Order
lays out six main priorities to guide implementation across the Federal
government:

-   Invest public dollars efficiently, avoid waste, and focus on
    measurable outcomes for the American people
-   Buy American and increase the competitiveness of the U.S. economy,
    including through implementing the Act’s Made-in-America
    requirements and bolstering domestic manufacturing and manufacturing
    supply chains; 
-   Create good-paying job opportunities for millions of Americans by
    focusing on high labor standards for these jobs, including
    prevailing wages and the free and fair chance to join a union;
-   Invest public dollars equitably, including through the Justice40
    Initiative, which is a Government-wide effort toward a goal that 40
    percent of the overall benefits from Federal investments in climate
    and clean energy flow to disadvantaged communities;
-   Build resilient infrastructure that can withstand the impacts of
    climate change and that helps combat the climate crisis; and
-   Effectively coordinate with State, local, Tribal, and territorial
    governments in implementing these critical investments.

**Infrastructure Implementation Task Force. **To coordinate effective
implementation across the government and advance the Administration’s
priorities, the Executive Order also establishes a Task Force.  
  
The Task Force is co-chaired by National Economic Council Director,
Brian Deese, and the White House Infrastructure Implementation
Coordinator, Mitch Landrieu. The Office of Management and Budget,
Domestic Policy Council, and the Climate Policy Office in the White
House will also sit on the Task Force along with the following agencies:

-   Department of Transportation, Secretary Pete Buttigieg
-   Department of Interior, Secretary Deb Haaland
-   Department of Energy, Secretary Jennifer Granholm
-   Department of Commerce, Secretary Gina Raimondo
-   Environmental Protection Agency, Administrator Michael Regan
-   Department of Agriculture, Secretary Tom Vilsack
-   Department of Labor, Secretary Martin Walsh
-   Office of Personnel Management, Director Kiran Ahuja

This Task Force will be committed to break down barriers and drive
implementation of infrastructure investments across all levels of
government to realize the President’s vision of rebuilding our nation’s
infrastructure and positioning the U.S. to compete and win in the
21<sup>st</sup> century.
