  19 Response and Recovery Efforts in the Hardest-Hit and High-Risk Communities and\
  \ Populations as COVID-\u206019 Health Equity Task Force Submits Final\_Report"

Over the past ten months, we have made tremendous progress in our effort
to protect and uplift the hardest-hit and highest-risk communities.
Deaths have declined by nearly 90% in Black, brown, and Indigenous
communities. The gap in vaccination rates between Black and
Latino/Hispanic adults and white adults has closed. Nearly 100% of
schools are open for in-person instruction, offering students more
equitable access to academic resources and allowing parents to go back
to work.

We know our work to close the gap in how communities of color experience
the pandemic is not done. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is
announcing $785 million in American Rescue Plan funding to support
community-based organizations building vaccine confidence across
communities of color, rural areas, and low-income populations; bolster
the efforts of Tribal communities leading the way in mitigating the
spread of the virus; expand public health systems’ ability to respond to
the needs of people with disabilities and older adults who have been
among the highest risk for infection or death from COVID-19; and
continue our mission to build a more diverse and sustainable public
health workforce, including a new apprenticeship program that will train
thousands of our COVID-19 community health workers and prepare them for
long-term careers in public health. This funding builds on the
significant investments we have already made in equity-focused programs
and initiatives since entering office.

These investments are also directly responsive to the recommendations of
the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, which delivered its [final
report](https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/HETFReport) to the White
House Office of COVID-19 Response today. President Biden and Vice
President Harris created this Task Force on their first full day in
office, taking the historic and innovative step to appoint community
activists, advocates, experts, and leaders who have now created a slate
of recommendations that will continue to inform our public health in the
years and decades to come.

The Biden-Harris Administration’s action to prioritize equity in the
COVID-19 Response has the potential to be transformative for health
equity in the United States. Over 80 percent of the Task Force
recommendations have already been fulfilled, and the Administration is
committed to embedding the Task Force’s recommendations into the
historic initiatives and programs we continue to build to promote and
sustain equity across the federal government.

Today’s $785 million funding announcement is a significant step towards
that long-term effort.  Specifically:

-   ***Nearly $240 Million to Expand Public Health Workforce by Creating
    Pipeline Program for 13,000 Community Health Workers and
    Paraprofessionals from Underserved*** ***Communities**.* The
    Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Health
    Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), will invest nearly
    $240 million into a new program focused on education and on-the-job
    training to build the pipeline of public health workers in the most
    underserved communities. This effort will support apprenticeship
    programs at over 500 health care and public health sites nationally,
    including emergency departments, health centers, state and local
    public health departments, community health centers, mobile health
    clinics, shelters, housing programs, faith-based organizations, and
    other locations where high-risk populations access care and receive
    services. Over the past 10 months, the Administration has made
    historic investments in community health workers that have engaged
    in critical vaccine outreach, building vaccine confidence in our
    hardest-hit and highest-risk communities throughout the pandemic.
    These individuals have been hired from the communities they serve,
    resulting in a diverse corps of people typically underrepresented in
    our public health workforce.  
-   ***$210 Million to Build Preparedness in Tribal Communities, Support
    School Nurses in the Bureau of Indian Education, and Expand the
    Public Health Workforce in the Indian Health Service and Across
    Indigenous Communities*.** The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and
    exacerbated preexisting inequities facing Tribal Nations. The Indian
    Health Service (IHS) is investing $92 million to hire school nurses
    that can provide critical testing, contact tracing, case management,
    vaccination, and overall school health support to Bureau of Indian
    Education (BIE) K-12 schools; $67 million to enhance public health
    capacity and build better emergency preparedness for IHS and Tribal
    Nations; $45 million to expand loan repayment and support IHS’s
    ability to recruit and retain highly-skilled health care
    professionals, in IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs; and
    $6 million to support core surveillance and epidemiology work for
    American Indian and Alaska Native populations.  
-   ***$150 Million to Address the Unique Needs of People with
    Disabilities and Older Adults in Response and Recovery from the
    Virus and Improve their Health and Access to Services Moving
    Forward.*** The Administration for Community Living at HHS is
    investing $150 million for its disability and aging networks to
    increase the public health workforce with disability and aging
    expertise and to collaborate with public health systems to support
    the health and safety of people with disabilities and older adults
    who are at heightened risk for severe illness from COVID-19,
    disproportionately experience the effects of social isolation, and
    need services and supports to maintain independence, particularly
    during emergencies and disasters.  
-   ***More Than $140 Million to Continue Supporting Community-Based
    Organizations Leading the Way in High-Touch, Impactful Vaccine
    Outreach to High-Risk Communities.*** HRSA will award an additional
    $66.5 million as part of the [community-based organization (CBO)
    vaccine outreach
    initiative](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/05/04/hhs-announces-250-million-from-american-rescue-plan-to-develop-and-support-underserved-communities.html)
    established in May. Participating organizations report that this
    funding has been essential in allowing CBOs to hire local community
    outreach workers that educate individuals, provide resources, and
    address barriers to getting vaccinated in underserved communities.
    Applicants for this new funding will focus on serving the most
    vulnerable populations, including pregnant people, in key states
    with lower vaccination rates. HRSA will also invest another $77
    million for additional CBOs to hire community workers for vaccine
    outreach and engage in other efforts to build vaccine confidence.  
-   ***$35 Million for CDC to Improve Diversity in the Public Health
    Workforce and Ensure Better Capacity to Response to the Needs of
    Underserved Communities*.** The Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) is investing $35 million to expand activities in
    recruitment and pipeline programs to support diversity, equity, and
    inclusion in public health workforce and increase awareness and
    interest in public health among underrepresented groups, including
    through the [Science Ambassador
    program](https://www.cdc.gov/careerpaths/scienceambassador/index.html)
    for middle and high-school teachers and CDC’s [Undergraduate Public
    Health Scholars
    (CUPS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/features/cups/index.html)
    program for undergraduate students, among others.
