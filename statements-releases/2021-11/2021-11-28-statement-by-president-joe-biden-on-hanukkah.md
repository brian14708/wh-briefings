title: Statement by President Joe Biden on Hanukkah
---
 
Over these eight nights, Jews in the United States, Israel, and around
the globe will proudly celebrate Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of
Lights. They will light the *menorah*, spin the *dreidel*, eat *latkes*,
and tell of how the Maccabees, guided by an abiding belief in their
Creator and an inextinguishable commitment to their faith, prevailed
against all odds.

At its core, Hanukkah recounts a story at the heart of the human spirit
– one that is inherently Jewish and undeniably American. It commemorates
how even the most fragile flame can sustain a tradition and nourish the
soul of a people. It teaches us that even a little bit of light,
wherever it is found, can dispel the darkness and illuminate a path
forward. And it reminds us that whether it is the Holy Temple in
Jerusalem or the temple of our democracy, nothing broken or profaned is
beyond repair.

Much like Thanksgiving, Hanukkah is a holiday dedicated to the
expression of gratitude for the blessings and miracles in our lives –
big and small, seen and unseen, from ancient times until the present
day.

From our family to yours, and from the People’s House to your own homes,
Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a *Chanukah Sameach*, a Happy
Hanukkah!
