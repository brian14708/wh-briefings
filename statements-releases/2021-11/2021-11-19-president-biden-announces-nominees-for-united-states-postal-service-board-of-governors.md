Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate two leaders
to the bipartisan United States Postal Service Board of Governors to
replace outgoing Governors Ron Bloom and John Barger.

    Service
-   Derek Kan, Nominee for Governor, United States Postal Service

The USPS serves hundreds of millions of Americans across the nation
every day. President Biden is committed to supporting USPS workers so
that they can continue delivering for their fellow Americans,
particularly those in rural communities, veterans, and older Americans
who rely so heavily on the Postal Service. President Biden is also
committed to strengthening and modernizing this critical public
institution and its services to ensure it continues serving the American
people for decades to come.  
  
The Board consists of up to nine governors appointed by the President
with the advice and consent of the Senate, and no more than five
governors may be from the same party.
