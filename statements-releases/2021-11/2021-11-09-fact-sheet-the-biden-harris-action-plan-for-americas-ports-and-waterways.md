While American ports are a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, outdated
infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic have strained their capacity
and jeopardized global supply chains.  According to the 2021 Report Card
for America’s Infrastructure Report issued by the American Society of
Civil Engineers (ASCE), in 2018, America’s ports supported more than 30
million jobs and approximately 26% of our nation’s GDP. However, the
ASCE report warns that ports face extensive challenges modernizing
infrastructure and maintaining essential facilities under threat from
sea level rise and other climate challenges.  Only four U.S. ports are
among the top 50 busiest ports in the world and no U.S. port is in the
top 10. Many U.S. ports also have bridge or depth limitations that
restrict their ability to receive the larger, post-Panamax vessels that
are the future of ocean shipping.  Further, the surge of cargo coming
off larger vessels can also strain outdated landside infrastructure. As
a result, more container traffic flows through a smaller number of U.S.
ports with the offshore and onshore capacity to handle the largest
vessels and their cargo. Taken together, America’s underfunded port and
waterway infrastructure has real costs for our families, our economy,
and our global competitiveness.

Recognizing the critical role American ports play in the global economy,
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal includes an
unprecedented $17 billion to improve infrastructure at coastal ports,
inland ports and waterways, and land ports of entry along the border.
These resources will deliver near-term assistance and make long-term
investments to strengthen supply chain resiliency. Along the way, these
investments will create good paying jobs and help America outcompete
China. Together, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is the single
largest federal investment in our ports in U.S. history.

President Biden is not waiting to take action. Today, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing a set of concrete steps to accelerate
investment in our ports, waterways, and freight networks. These goals
and timelines will mobilize federal agencies and lay the foundation for
successful implementation of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure
Deal. This action plan will increase federal flexibilities for port
grants; accelerate port infrastructure grant awards; announce new
construction projects for coastal navigation, inland waterways, and land
ports of entry; and launch the first round of expanded port
infrastructure grants funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.

**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the following
immediate actions:**

-   **Support creative solutions to current supply chain disruptions by
    allowing for flexibility in port grants.** The U.S. Department of
    Transportation (DOT) will allow port authorities across the country
    to redirect project cost savings toward tackling supply chain
    challenges.  The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to look
    for additional flexibilities and other solutions to support
    infrastructure needs in the goods movement supply chain.  
-   **Alleviate congestion at the Port of Savannah by funding the
    Georgia Port Authority pop-up container yards project.** With this
    policy change,  the Georgia Port Authority will be able to
    reallocate more than $8 million to convert existing inland
    facilities into five pop-up container yards in both Georgia and
    North Carolina. Under the plan, the Port of Savannah will transfer
    containers via rail and truck further inland so that they can be
    closer to their final destination, which will make available
    valuable real estate closer to the port.   The effort will free up
    more dock space and speed goods flow in and out of the Port of
    Savannah, which leads the nation in containerized agricultural
    exports. 

**Further Near-Term Actions:**

-   **Launch programs to modernize ports and marine highways with more
    than $240 million in grant funding within the next 45 days. ** The
    Port Infrastructure Development Grant program is the first and only
    federal grant program wholly dedicated to investments in port
    infrastructure.  DOT will award $230 million in funding for this
    program and $13 million for the Marine Highway Program to support
    waterborne freight service.   
-   **Identify projects for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers construction at
    coastal ports and inland waterways within the next 60 days.** This
    plan will provide a roadmap for more than $4 billion in funding to
    repair outdated infrastructure and to deepen harbors for larger
    cargo ships.  
-   **Prioritize key ports of entry for modernization and expansion
    within the next 90 days.** This plan will identify $3.4 billion in
    investments to upgrade obsolete inspection facilities and allow more
    efficient international trade through the northern and southern
    borders.  
-   **Open competition for the first round of port infrastructure grants
    funded through the bipartisan infrastructure deal within 90 days.**
    DOT will announce more than $475 million in additional funding for
    port and marine highway infrastructure. 

**Additional freight investments**  
In addition to making the largest federal investment in American port
infrastructure and freight networks in history, President Biden’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will invest in transformative,
shovel-worthy projects that revitalize other critical elements of
America’s transportation infrastructure and supply chains.  This
includes an additional $110 billion to repair roads and bridges and
support major transformational projects.  These resources, if smartly
deployed, can meaningfully improve supply chains and goods movement. To
help states and other grantees direct federal resources to
transportation supply chain needs, the Biden-Harris Administration will:

-   **Develop a comprehensive freight movement playbook to states**: DOT
    will publish a playbook for States on how to use grant and loan
    programs across the Department to support goods movement and help
    alleviate freight bottlenecks. This playbook will highlight the
    policies, funding and financing available to strengthen the supply
    chain.  Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, States will
    receive more than $50 billion per year in federal-aid highway
    funding, much of which can be used to repair and modernize existing
    infrastructure to improve the performance of freight corridors.  
-   **Incorporate the best worldwide freight planning practices into
    state freight plans:** DOT will develop and issue revised guidance
    on State Freight Plans that incorporates best worldwide freight
    planning practices. The BID strengthens the freight plans that
    States are currently required to produce to include supply chain
    cargo flows, an inventory of commercial ports, the impacts of
    e-commerce on freight infrastructure, and an assessment of truck
    parking facilities.  Improved plans will help States direct
    resources to their greatest economic development needs.

**Data sharing to support supply chains**  
Digital infrastructure also plays a key role in facilitating our supply
chains. The goods movement chain is almost entirely privately operated
and spans shipping lines, terminal operators, railroads, truckers,
warehouses, and beneficial cargo owners. These different actors have
each made great strides in digitizing their own internal operations, but
they do not always exchange data with each other. This lack of data
exchange causes delays and inefficiencies as cargo moves from one part
of the supply chain to another, driving up costs and increasing
fragility.  To further strengthen resiliency and leverage digitization
of the supply chain, the Administration will:

-   **Call for new data standards for goods movement**.  DOT will work
    with the Federal Maritime Commission to publish a request for
    information on standardized data exchange requirements for goods
    movement in the transportation supply chain. Standardized data are
    an important first step to ensure interoperability among actors in
    the supply chain and greater transparency, resiliency, fluidity,
    competition, and efficiency across the supply chain.
