What Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President
Rosario Murillo, orchestrated today was a pantomime election that was
neither free nor fair, and most certainly not democratic.  The arbitrary
imprisonment of nearly 40 opposition figures since May, including seven
potential presidential candidates, and the blocking of political parties
from participation rigged the outcome well before election day.  They
shuttered independent media, locked up journalists and members of the
private sector, and bullied civil society organizations into closing
their doors.  Long unpopular and now without a democratic mandate, the
Ortega and Murillo family now rule Nicaragua as autocrats, no different
from the Somoza family that Ortega and the Sandinistas fought four
decades ago. 

The United States stands in support of the inalienable right to
democratic self-determination of the Nicaraguan people, and those of any
other country in the hemisphere where popular sovereignty is compromised
by the erosion of democratic norms, stifling of civic space, or
violations of fundamental rights. The Inter-American Democratic Charter
obligates the hemisphere to stand up for the democratic rights of the
Nicaraguan people. We call on the Ortega-Murillo regime to take
immediate steps to restore democracy in Nicaragua, and to  immediately
and unconditionally release those unjustly imprisoned for speaking out
against abuses and clamoring for the right of Nicaraguans to vote in
free and fair elections. Until then, the United States, in close
coordination with other members of the international community, will use
all diplomatic and economic tools at our disposal to support the people
of Nicaragua and hold accountable the Ortega-Murillo government and
those that facilitate its abuses.
