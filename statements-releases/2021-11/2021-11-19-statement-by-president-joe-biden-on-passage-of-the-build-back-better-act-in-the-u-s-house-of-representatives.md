title: Statement by President Joe Biden on Passage of the Build Back Better Act in
  the U.S. House of Representatives
---
 
Today, the United States House of Representatives passed the Build Back
Better Act to take another giant step forward in carrying out my
economic plan to create jobs, reduce costs, make our country more
competitive, and give working people and the middle class a fighting
chance.  
  
The Build Back Better Act is fiscally responsible. It reduces the
deficit over the long-term. It’s fully paid for by making sure that the
wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair
share in federal taxes. It keeps my commitment that no one earning less
than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes.  
  
Leading economists and independent experts on Wall Street have confirmed
that it will not add to inflationary pressures. Instead, it will boost
the capacity of our economy and reduce costs for millions of families.  
  
Here are some key parts of the Build Back Better Act:

-   It lowers your costs to save you money on things like prescription
    drugs and health care and housing.  
-   It gets Americans back to work by providing child care and care for
    seniors so workers can get back on the job knowing their loved ones
    have the care they need.  
-   It cuts taxes for working families and the middle class – including
    extending the Child Tax Credit that is already helping the families
    of more than 61 million children and getting us closer to cutting
    child poverty in half this year.  
-   It provides universal pre-Kindergarten for every 3-and 4-year old in
    America and makes education beyond high school more affordable –
    with historic investments in Pell Grants and Historically Black
    Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions and other
    Minority Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and
    Universities.  
-   Together with the bipartisan infrastructure law, it makes the most
    significant investment in our fight against the climate crisis ever
    by creating jobs that build a clean energy future for our children
    and grandchildren.

 Above all, it puts us on the path to build our economy back better than
before by rebuilding the backbone of America: working people and the
middle class.  
  
I thank Speaker Pelosi and the House leadership and every House member
who worked so hard and voted to pass this bill.  
  
For the second time in just two weeks, the House of Representatives has
moved on critical and consequential pieces of my legislative agenda.  
  
Now, the Build Back Better Act goes to the United States Senate, where I
look forward to it passing as soon as possible so I can sign it into
law.
