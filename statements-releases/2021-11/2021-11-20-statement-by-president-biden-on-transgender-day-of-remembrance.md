title: Statement by President Biden on Transgender Day of Remembrance
---
 
This year, at least 46 transgender individuals in this country—and
hundreds more around the world—were killed in horrifying acts of
violence. Each of these lives was precious. Each of them deserved
freedom, justice, and joy. Today, on Transgender Day of Remembrance, we
mourn those we lost in the deadliest year on record for transgender
Americans, as well as the countless other transgender
people—disproportionately Black and brown transgender women and
girls—who face brutal violence, discrimination, and harassment.  
  
In spite of our progress strengthening civil rights for LGBTQI+
Americans, too many transgender people still live in fear and face
systemic barriers to freedom and equality. To ensure that our government
protects the civil rights of transgender Americans, I charged my team
with coordinating across the federal government to address the epidemic
of violence and advance equality for transgender people. I continue to
call on state leaders and lawmakers to combat the disturbing
proliferation of discriminatory state legislation targeting transgender
people, especially transgender children. As I have said before, these
bills are nothing more than bullying disguised as legislation, they are
un-American, and they endanger the safety and well-being of our
children. I also continue to urge the Senate to swiftly pass the
Equality Act so that all people are able to live free from fear and
discrimination.  
  
Transgender people are some of the bravest Americans I know. But no
person should have to be brave just to live in safety and dignity.
Today, we remember. Tomorrow—and every day—we must continue to act.
