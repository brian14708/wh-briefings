 While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry
and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has
spoken. I ran on a promise to bring Americans together, because I
believe that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.  I know
that we’re not going to heal our country’s wounds overnight, but I
remain steadfast in my commitment to do everything in my power to ensure
that every American is treated equally, with fairness and dignity, under
the law.  
  
I urge everyone to express their views peacefully, consistent with the
rule of law.  Violence and destruction of property have no place in our
democracy.  The White House and Federal authorities have been in contact
with Governor Evers’s office to prepare for any outcome in this case,
and I have spoken with the Governor this afternoon and offered support
and any assistance needed to ensure public safety.
