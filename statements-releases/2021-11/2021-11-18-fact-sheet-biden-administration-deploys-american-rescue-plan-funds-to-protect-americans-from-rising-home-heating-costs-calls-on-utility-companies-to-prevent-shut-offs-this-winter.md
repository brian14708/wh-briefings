  \ Americans from Rising Home Heating Costs; Calls on Utility Companies to Prevent\
  \ Shut Offs This\_Winter"

*Unprecedented Funding and Partnerships with State, Local and Tribal
Governments to Protect Vulnerable Homeowners and Renters*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration called on states, localities and
tribes to plan early and coordinate across programs to effectively use
historic American Rescue Plan resources to address home energy costs
this winter. The White House also called on utility companies that
receive public dollars to prevent devastating utility shut-offs this
winter and help expedite the delivery of unprecedented federal aid.

**<u>The American Rescue Plan provides critical resources that states,
localities and tribes can use to address home energy costs:</u>**

-   **More than doubling available Low Income Home Energy Assistance
    Program (LIHEAP) funding:** The recent average annual funding for
    LIHEAP is $3-4 billion, which typically serves 5 million households.
    The American Rescue Plan provided an additional $4.5 billion
    available until September 2022.
-   **Delivering Emergency Rental Assistance—unavailable in previous
    winters—to help cover utility bills:** First established last
    December—and provided an additional $21.5 billion in funding by the
    American Rescue Plan—Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) programs
    provide help with past-due utility bills or ongoing assistance with
    energy costs to help distressed renters avoid shut-offs and keep
    current on expenses. Even as most programs were just beginning to
    ramp up between January and June 2021, grantees made over 200,000
    payments to support households with utility arrears and over 140,000
    prospective utility payments.
-   **Providing state, local and tribal governments additional resources
    to help energy-burdened middle-class families, including through the
    $350 billion State & Local Fiscal Recovery Fund:** States and
    localities have the flexibility to use Fiscal Recovery Funds to help
    deliver energy relief to families, including for middle-class
    households that may not be eligible for programs directed to the
    lowest income consumers.

**<u>Today the White House called on Utilities and Energy Providers to
Commit to Proactively Use Their Resources to Help</u>**

The Administration welcomed initial commitments from seven major utility
companies including **DTE Energy**, **Eversource**, **Green Mountain
Power**, **National Grid**, **NorthWestern Energy, Portland General
Electric** and **Vermont Gas**,as well as the delivered fuel trade
association **NEFI**,that all agreed to the following:

-   *<u>Identify Eligible Recipients:</u>* Many utility companies
    already offer programs to help families in need. Utilities should
    proactively identify those who may be eligible for public benefits,
    such as LIHEAP and ERA, using financial hardship and other customer
    data. In order to help identify and prequalify customers for
    benefits, utilities can also use third-party data – such as whether
    a home is rented or owned and which census tract it is in – and data
    through partnership with government agencies including income or
    proxies, like eligibility for other programs. For example, in
    Connecticut, utilities are using third-party data to pre-qualify and
    contact customers, and share the results with state agencies to
    expedite energy assistance payments.

<!-- -->

-   *<u>Directly Screen and Notify Potentially Eligible Recipients:</u>*
    Utilities and energy providers should inform customers of energy
    assistance programs, screen customers for benefits eligibility, and
    facilitate referrals to available benefits programs prior to any
    shut-offs.
-   *<u>Expedite Assistance to Vulnerable Households:</u>* Energy
    providers should be critical partners by proactively working to
    establish the processes and data-sharing relationships needed to
    speed benefits to their eligible customers as quickly as possible.
    For example, in Michigan, utilities work in partnership with the
    state to receive bundled payments on behalf of many customers at
    once, speeding processing and helping benefits quickly reach their
    customer’s accounts. In South Carolina, utility companies receive a
    bulk payment from the state prior to the full satisfaction of
    application and documentation requirements that they can use to
    apply benefits to customers quickly.
-   *<u>No Shutoffs for Customers Applying for Financial Hardship
    Assistance:</u>* Beyond state or local shut-off moratoria
    requirements, when utility companies are notified that a customer is
    applying for financial hardship assistance, including energy
    assistance benefits, they should commit to restore service or delay
    shut-off. For example, in Michigan, once a household applies for ERA
    utility benefits, the utility company places a hold on utility shut
    off. Utilities should also commit to provide at least 30 days’
    notice to all customers before a shut-off.
-   *<u>Facilitate Assistance to Delivered Fuel Customers:</u>* In order
    to expedite benefits, providers of delivered fuels should commit to
    proactively notify families in distress of how to contact a state
    and local agency for assistance. Fuel providers with capacity should
    set up processes to facilitate referrals with customer permission.
    Fuel providers should prioritize deliveries to households approved
    for benefits, particularly where providers receive direct deposits
    credited to customer accounts prior to or immediately following
    delivery. Fuel providers with capacity should go even further by
    agreeing to deliver fuels to approved households through deferred
    payment or budgeting agreements.

**<u>Today the Administration also called on States, Localities and
Tribes to:</u>**

**Prepare Early to Distribute Expanded LIHEAP to More Families**

-   *<u>Strong and Effective Winter Plans:</u>* The Administration is
    providing technical assistance to LIHEAP grantees to speed up state
    and local planning and program implementation for winter.
-   *Q<u>uick and Automatic Distribution of Benefits:</u>* HHS is urging
    grantees to consider expediting payments to households that have
    benefitted from LIHEAP in previous years and simplifying eligibility
    verification. This option will not be appropriate for all grantees,
    but some states have already shown it can work. For example, Maine
    and New York are providing automatic payments to households who have
    received benefits in the past.
-   *<u>Expanded Outreach to Newly Eligible Households:</u>* HHS is
    urging grantees to consider additional outreach to households who
    need energy assistance for the first time this year. A significant
    number of households receive LIHEAP year after year, but as a result
    of the economic disruption of the pandemic and rising energy prices
    additional households are expected to need help. These households
    may be unfamiliar with how to access benefits, and grantees can help
    these families access the unprecedented LIHEAP resources available
    as well as refer to other benefits.
-   *<u>Coordination between LIHEAP, ERA and Other Programs:</u>* Given
    differences in eligibility, HHS and Treasury are clarifying how
    grantees of LIHEAP and ERA can coordinate to quickly provide
    benefits to eligible households. Coordination ensures support can
    reach a greater number of households, including those who do not
    qualify for LIHEAP due to their household incomes, people on fixed
    incomes, the elderly, and others in need. These best practices
    include coordinating outreach to households, establishing regular
    communication with program leaders and energy providers,
    streamlining intake, and referring across programs as appropriate.
    For example, rental households not fully served by LIHEAP could be
    referred to ERA, and homeowners could be referred to LIHEAP. Where
    available, the Homeowners Assistance Fund may be able to serve
    middle-class homeowner households.

** Use Emergency Rental Assistance to Aid Renters with Utility Costs**

-   *<u>Provide Forward-Looking Assistance to Low-income Renters Facing
    High Energy Costs:</u>* The Treasury Department is encouraging
    grantees to take advantage of the flexibility to provide
    forward-looking utility assistance payments over the next several
    months to low-income families facing high heating costs, including
    for those renters who rely on delivered fuels to heat their homes.
    ERA grantees may also cover arrears and related fees for utility
    bills dating back to the start of the pandemic.
-   *<u>Lower Burdens and Speed Assistance to Distressed Renters Through
    Collaboration between ERA Program Administrators and Utility
    Providers:</u>* The Administration is facilitating cooperation
    between state and local governments and utility providers to
    identify customers at risk of energy insecurity and confirm
    household eligibility. To support this effort, the Treasury
    Department has issued guidance encouraging grantees to establish
    data sharing agreements and bulk payment methods with utility
    providers.
-   *<u>Expedite Payments Through Partnerships with Non-Profits to
    Prevent the Loss of Utility Services</u>*: When the rapid delivery
    of a payment could reasonably be necessary to prevent the loss of
    utility services, Treasury has provided grantees flexibility to
    partner with nonprofit organizations for the purpose of making
    immediate payments while a household’s application is still being
    processed.
-   *<u>Increased Home Heating Costs Can Qualify Income-Eligible
    Households for Needed Assistance this Winter</u>.* The Treasury
    Department is clarifying that elevated energy costs may be a form of
    COVID-19-related hardship that puts distressed renters at-risk of
    housing instability qualifying them for assistance with their
    utilities. Households can self-attest to experiencing both a
    COVID-related hardship and risk of housing instability based on
    significant increases in their home heating costs.

**Use All Available Tools to Help Working and Middle-Class Families**

-   *<u>State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund Can Help Families
    Ineligible for Other Support:</u>* States, localities and tribes can
    tap the $350 billion allocated by the American Rescue Plan to
    provide additional relief on home heating costs, particularly to
    middle-class households. For example, Louisville has supported a
    utility relief fund that provides residents who have fallen behind
    on gas or electric bills a one-time credit of up to $1,000.
-   *<u>$10 Billion Homeowners Assistance Fund to help Distressed
    Homeowners Keep Up with Utility Bills:</u>* Treasury is encouraging
    states, tribes and territories to utilize funds from this American
    Rescue Plan program to help cover home energy costs or prevent the
    loss of utilities this winter, including for hard-pressed
    middle-class families.
-   *<u>$1 Billion Pandemic Emergency Assistance Fund:</u>* The American
    Rescue Plan also created a new fund for states, territories and
    tribes of which a substantial portion remains and is available to
    provide cash or utility-specific assistance to needy families. 

**<u>The Administration also Highlighted Additional Financial Support
Helping Hard-Pressed Families with Energy Costs:</u>**

-   *<u>1/3 of Families Using Child Tax Credit for Utility Bills:</u>*
    Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the families of more than 61
    million children are receiving expanded monthly Child Tax Credit
    payments up to $300 per child and nearly a third used it to pay for
    utilities –including home energy costs – between July and October
    2021.
-   *<u>Weatherization Assistance to Reduce Energy Costs:</u>* The
    bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act invests a historic
    $3.5 billion in the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance
    Program, reducing energy costs for more than 700,000 low-income
    households by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes.
-   *<u>$100 million to Cover Rent and Utilities in Hard-Hit Rural
    Areas:</u>* The American Rescue Plan is providing financial support
    through September 2022 to over 26,000 overburdened rural households
    living in multi-family housing financed by the U.S. Department of
    Agriculture.
-   *<u>Preventing Families from Choosing “Heat or Eat”:</u>* More
    low-income children and families face hunger when energy prices rise
    during winter as higher home heating costs eat up family budgets.
    The Biden-Harris Administration increased Supplemental Nutrition
    Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits on October 1 by an average of
    $36.24 per month, which will help to prevent this cruel tradeoff
    between heat and food this winter.
