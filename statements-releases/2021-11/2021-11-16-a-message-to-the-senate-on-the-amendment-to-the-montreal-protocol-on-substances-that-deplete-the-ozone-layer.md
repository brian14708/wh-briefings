title: "A Message to the Senate on the Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances\
  \ that Deplete the Ozone\_Layer"

TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to
ratification, I transmit herewith the Amendment to the Montreal Protocol
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (the “Montreal Protocol”),
adopted at Kigali on October 15, 2016, by the Twenty-Eighth Meeting of
the Parties to the Montreal Protocol (the “Kigali Amendment”).  The
report of the Department of State is also enclosed for the information
of the Senate.

The principal features of the Kigali Amendment provide for a gradual
phasedown in the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), which are alternatives to ozone-depleting substances being
phased out under the Montreal Protocol, as well as related provisions
concerning reporting, licensing, control of trade with non-Parties, and
control of certain byproduct emissions.

The United States has sufficient domestic authority to implement
obligations under the Kigali Amendment, including through the American
Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (the “AIM Act”) and the Clean
Air Act.  The Environmental Protection Agency’s recent rulemakings under
the AIM Act establish a domestic HFC allocation system and other
provisions that would enable the United States to begin implementation
of the provisions of the Kigali Amendment.

The Kigali Amendment has strong support from the U.S. business community
and nongovernmental organizations.  Ratification by the United States
would advance U.S. interests in remaining a leader in the development
and deployment of HFC alternatives, ensuring access to rapidly growing
refrigeration and cooling markets overseas and stimulating U.S.
investment, exports, and job growth in this sector. Ratification will
also ensure the United States continues to have a full voice to
represent U.S. economic and environmental interests as implementation of
the Kigali Amendment moves forward in coming years.

The Kigali Amendment entered into force on January 1, 2019, and there
are currently 124 Parties to the Amendment.  The Senate has given its
advice and consent to ratification of all four previous amendments to
the Montreal Protocol, with bipartisan support.  I recommend that the
Senate give favorable consideration to the Kigali Amendment and give its
advice and consent to ratification at the earliest date.  
                             

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.   

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    November 16, 2021.
