title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement\_\
  Act"
---
 
Today, Senate Republicans blocked debate on the bipartisan John R. Lewis
Voting Rights Advancement Act. Provisions in the bill have passed the
Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support five times, most recently
98-0 in 2006. Let there be a debate and let there be a vote.

The right to vote is sacred and constitutional. It’s fundamental to all
other rights. The soul of America is at stake.
