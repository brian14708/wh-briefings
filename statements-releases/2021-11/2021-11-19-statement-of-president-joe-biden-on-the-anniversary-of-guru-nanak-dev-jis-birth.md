Jill and I extend our warmest wishes to the Sikh community on the 552nd
anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of the Sikh
faith. Guru Nanakâ€™s visionary message of equality, peace, and service is
as important today as it was five centuries ago. His teachings emphasize
the dignity and equal rights of all people, empowerment of women and
girls, interfaith cooperation, and acts of service to support those in
need. By living these and other core values of their faith, Sikhs
continue to strengthen communities throughout the United States and the
world.
