TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
In accordance with section 506A(a)(3)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974, as
amended (19 U.S.C. 2466a (a)(3)(B)), I am providing advance notification
of my intent to terminate the designation of the Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia (Ethiopia), the Republic of Guinea (Guinea), and
the Republic of Mali (Mali) as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries
under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).

I am taking this step as Ethiopia, Guinea, and Mali are not in
compliance with the eligibility requirements of section 104 of the AGOA
— in Ethiopia, for gross violations of internationally recognized human
rights; in Guinea, for not having established, or not making continual
progress toward establishing, the protection of the rule of law and of
political pluralism; and in Mali, for not having established, or not
making continual progress toward establishing, the protection of the
rule of law, political pluralism, and internationally recognized worker
rights, and for not addressing gross violations of internationally
recognized human rights. 

Despite intensive engagement between the United States and the
Governments of Ethiopia, Guinea, and Mali, these governments have failed
to address United States concerns about their non-compliance with the
AGOA eligibility criteria.

Accordingly, I intend to terminate the designation of Ethiopia, Guinea,
and Mali as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries under the AGOA as
of January 1, 2022.  I will continue to assess whether the Governments
of Ethiopia, Guinea, and Mali are making continual progress toward
meeting the AGOA eligibility requirements.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
November 2, 2021.
