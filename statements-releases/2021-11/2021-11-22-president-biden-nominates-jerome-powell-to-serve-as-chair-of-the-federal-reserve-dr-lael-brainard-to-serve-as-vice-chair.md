title: "President\_Biden Nominates Jerome Powell to Serve as Chair of the Federal\
  \ Reserve, Dr. Lael Brainard to Serve as Vice\_Chair"
---
 
Today, President Biden announced his intent to nominate Jerome Powell
for a second term as Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System and to nominate Dr. Lael Brainard to serve as Vice Chair
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  
   
While our country still faces challenges as we emerge from the pandemic,
we have made enormous progress in bringing our economy back to life and
getting Americans back to work. Since the President took office, the
economy has created over 5.6 million jobs, unemployment has fallen to
4.6% – two years faster than projected – and the pace of our economy’s
growth outstrips the rest of the developed world.  
   
That outcome is a testament to the success of the President’s economic
agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the
Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America’s
economy back on track. Chair Powell has provided steady leadership
during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest
economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of
the Federal Reserve.  
   
During that time, Lael Brainard – one of our country’s leading
macroeconomists – has played a key leadership role at the Federal
Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country’s robust economic
recovery.  
   
Powell and Brainard share the Administration’s focus on ensuring that
economic growth broadly benefits all workers. That’s why they oversaw a
landmark re-evaluation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives to refocus
its mission on the needs of workers of all backgrounds. And they’ve
advanced key priorities that the President shares, like addressing the
financial risks posed by climate change, and staying ahead of emerging
risks to our financial system.  
   
America needs steady, independent, and effective leadership at the
Federal Reserve so it can advance its dual goals of keeping inflation
low and prices stable, as well as creating a strong labor market that
broadly benefits workers with better jobs and higher wages. President
Biden has full confidence in Powell and Brainard’s experience, judgment,
and integrity to continue delivering on those mandates and to help build
our economy back better for working families.  
   
President Biden still has three vacant seats on the Federal Reserve
Board of Governors to fill, including the important position of Vice
Chair for Supervision.  The President intends to make those appointments
beginning in early December, and is committed to improving the diversity
in the Board’s composition.

Biden</span>**  
   
“While there’s still more to be done, we’ve made remarkable progress
over the last 10 months in getting Americans back to work and getting
our economy moving again. That success is a testament to the economic
agenda I’ve pursued and to the decisive action that the Federal Reserve
has taken under Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard to help steer us through
the worst downturn in modern American history and put us on the path to
recovery. As I’ve said before, we can’t just return to where we were
before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I’m
confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard’s focus on keeping
inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make
our economy stronger than ever before. Together, they also share my deep
belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed
by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial
system. Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic
success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal
Reserve – and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the
last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the
strong leadership our country needs.”

areas. In 2011, Powell was nominated by President Obama to the Federal
Reserve Board of Governors, where he served as a Governor until his

University in 1983. She received an MS and a PhD in economics in 1989
from Harvard University, where she was awarded a National Science
Foundation Fellowship. She is also the recipient of a White House
Fellowship.
