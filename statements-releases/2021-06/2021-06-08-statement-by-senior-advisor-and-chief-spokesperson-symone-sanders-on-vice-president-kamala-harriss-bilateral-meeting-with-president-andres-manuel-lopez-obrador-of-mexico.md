Today, Vice President Kamala Harris met with Mexican President
Andr**é**s Manuel López Obrador at the National Palace in Mexico City.
The two leaders discussed the United States and Mexico’s shared
commitment to a prosperous and secure North America, which is founded on
a just and equitable society, broad economic opportunity, and security
for all. To this end, they agreed to expand high-level collaboration on
bilateral economic and security issues and affirmed a new partnership to
work jointly in Central America to address the root causes of migration.

The Vice President announced new U.S. commitments to foster investment
in southern Mexico, including loans for affordable housing, support to
strengthen rural value chains in cacao, coffee, and eco-tourism, trade
and business development missions to support infrastructure projects,
and aviation regulatory support to improve efficiencies. The United
States has also committed approximately $130 million over the next three
years to support Mexican workers’ protections and the implementation of
Mexico’s historic labor reform.

  
The United States and Mexico committed to partner together to address
the shared priority of disabling human trafficking and human smuggling
organizations that prey on vulnerable individuals.  The United States
will also provide forensic training and other capacity building to
Mexican law enforcement and Mexico’s National Search Commission in
support of Mexico’s efforts to resolve the more than 82,000 cases of
missing persons and disappearances, a priority of the López Obrador
Administration.

Finally, to address root causes of migration in El Salvador, Guatemala,
and Honduras, the United States joined Mexico in a new strategic
partnership to share information and strategies and co-manage new
programs to foster economic opportunity through agricultural development
and youth empowerment. The two leaders also agreed to increase
cooperation to further secure our borders and ensure orderly
immigration.
