Every American has a right to have their voice heard at the ballot box,
and no American should be kept from voting early, voting by mail, or
voting at all. Our democracy is strongest when everyone participates,
and it is weaker when people are left out.  
  
Throughout the arc of our nation’s history, many have worked—and many
have died—to ensure that all Americans can cast a ballot and have their
vote counted. Today, that hard-won progress is under assault.  
  
In the last election, more people voted than ever before. Since then,
more than 380 bills have been introduced across the country that would
make it harder for Americans to vote. These bills seek to restrict the
options that make voting more convenient and accessible, including early
voting and vote by mail. Our Administration will not stand by when
confronted with any effort that keeps Americans from voting.   
  
We must protect the fundamental right to vote for all Americans
regardless of where they live. There are two important bills in Congress
that would do just that. The For the People Act would provide all
Americans with fair and accessible voting options, and the John Lewis
Voting Rights Advancement Act would prevent discriminatory changes to
voting laws and procedures.   
  
President Joe Biden asked me to help lead our Administration’s effort to
protect the fundamental right to vote for all Americans. In the days and
weeks ahead, I will engage the American people, and I will work with
voting rights organizations, community organizations, and the private
sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts on voting rights
nationwide. And we will also work with members of Congress to help
advance these bills.  
  
The work ahead of us is to make voting accessible to all American
voters, and to make sure every vote is counted through a free, fair, and
transparent process. This is the work of democracy.
