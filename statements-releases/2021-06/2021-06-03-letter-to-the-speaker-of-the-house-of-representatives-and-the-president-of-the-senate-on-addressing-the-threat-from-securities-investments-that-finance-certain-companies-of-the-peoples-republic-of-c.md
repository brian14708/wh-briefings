  \ the Senate on Addressing the Threat from Securities Investments that Finance Certain\

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq*.), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order
addressing the threat from securities investments that finance certain
companies of the People’s Republic of China (PRC).  
  
I have determined that additional steps are necessary to address the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959 of November 12,
2020 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance
Communist Chinese Military Companies), including the threat posed by the
military-industrial complex of the PRC and its involvement in military,
intelligence, and security research and development programs, and
weapons and related equipment production under the PRC’s Military-Civil
Fusion strategy.  In addition, I find that the use of Chinese
surveillance technology outside the PRC and the development or use of
Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious
human rights abuse, constitute unusual and extraordinary threats, which
have their source in whole or substantial part outside the United
States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States, and I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13959 to address those threats.   
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.  
    

    Sincerely,  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
