title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable with LGBTQ+ and Gun Violence Prevention\
  \ Leaders on the Fifth Anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub Mass\_Shooting"
---
 
On Friday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Public
Engagement Director and Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond hosted a virtual
roundtable with LGBTQ+ leaders and gun violence survivors and advocates
to recognize the fifth anniversary of the mass shooting at the Pulse
Nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Together, they observed a moment of
silence to honor the 49 individuals who lost their lives in the Pulse
tragedy and the traumatic impact that the mass shooting had on LGBTQ+
and Latino communities across the country.

During the meeting, three courageous LGBTQ+ gun violence survivors
discussed the impact that gun violence has had on their lives.
Participants shared their perspectives on the ongoing public health
crisis of gun violence in America and the burden that this crisis has on
LGBTQ+ communities across our nation. They discussed the epidemic levels
of violence faced by transgender people, especially transgender women of
color, and the impact of firearms in the crisis of anti-transgender
homicides. Participants also discussed the intersection of gun safety
and the movement to prevent and end suicide among LGBTQ+ youth.

Ambassador Rice and Congressman Richmond expressed gratitude for the
participants’ courageous leadership in addressing acts of anti-LGBTQ+
violence, and for their persistent advocacy to tackle the gun violence
epidemic. They reiterated President Biden’s commitment to advancing full
equality for every LGBTQ+ person and family, including his urging for
the Senate to pass the Equality Act to ensure that LGBTQ+ Americans can
live free of discrimination and without fear of who they are or whom
they love. Finally, they underscored President Biden’s deep commitment
to ending the gun violence public health epidemic in America and
reiterated his call for the Senate to pass bipartisan legislation to
reduce gun violence that has already passed the House.

-   Jason Lindsay, Pride Fund to End Gun Violence
