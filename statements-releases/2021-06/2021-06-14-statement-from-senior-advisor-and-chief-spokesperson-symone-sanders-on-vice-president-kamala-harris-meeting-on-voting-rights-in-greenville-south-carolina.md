title: Statement From Senior Advisor and Chief Spokesperson Symone Sanders on Vice
  President Kamala Harris Meeting on Voting Rights In Greenville, South Carolina
---
 
Today in Greenville, South Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris
participated in a listening session with local voting rights advocates.
They included Sulaiman Ahmad, who works for the South Carolina Justice
project; Elias Valentin II, who led a voter protection effort during the
2020 election; and Reverend Telley Lynette Gadson, who is the Senior
Pastor of Saint Mark United Methodist.  
   
The group discussed what is happening on the ground in South
Carolina—namely what they are doing to get people registered to vote,
strengthen election infrastructure, and expand voting rights through
bills that are moving through the legislature. The Vice President
thanked participants for their tireless work and expressed the
Administration’s support.  
   
Since the Vice President took on her leadership role for the
Administration’s voting rights efforts, she has spoken with a number of
local and national leaders. This is the first meeting the Vice President
has done on the ground regarding voting rights. Tomorrow, in Washington,
D.C., she will meet with members of the Texas state legislature who
blocked a bill that would limit the right to vote.
