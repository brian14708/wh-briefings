title: U.S.-EU Summit Statement
---
 
**Towards a Renewed Transatlantic Partnership**

1.  The United States and the European Union represent 780 million
    people who share democratic values and the largest economic
    relationship in the world. We have a chance and a responsibility to
    help people make a living and keep them safe and secure, fight
    climate change, and stand up for democracy and human rights. We laid
    the foundations of the world economy and the rules-based
    international order after World War II based on openness, fair
    competition, transparency, and accountability. Some of the rules
    need an update: to protect our health, our climate and planet, to
    ensure democracy delivers and technology improves our lives.
2.  We, the leaders of the European Union and the United States, met
    today to renew our Transatlantic partnership, set a Joint
    Transatlantic Agenda for the post-pandemic era, and commit to
    regular dialogue to take stock of progress.
3.  Together, we intend to: (i) end the COVID-19 pandemic, prepare for
    future global health challenges, and drive forward a sustainable
    global recovery; (ii) protect our planet and foster green
    growth; (iii) strengthen trade, investment, and technological
    cooperation; and (iv) build a more democratic, peaceful, and secure
    world. We are committed to uphold the rules-based international
    order with the United Nations at its core, reinvigorate and reform
    multilateral institutions where needed, and cooperate with all those
    who share these objectives.  
      
    **I. End the COVID-19 pandemic, prepare for future global health
    challenges, and drive forward a sustainable global recovery**
4.  Ending the COVID-19 pandemic through global cooperation is our first
    priority. We promote equitable and affordable access and delivery of
    safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics
    through the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator. We commit to
    continuing to support the COVAX Facility and encourage more donors
    to make 2 billion vaccine doses available worldwide by late 2021. We
    aspire to vaccinate at least two thirds of the world’s population by
    the end of 2022.
5.  A Joint U.S.-EU COVID Manufacturing and Supply Chain Taskforce has
    been established to deepen cooperation and identify and resolve
    issues around expanding vaccine and therapeutics production
    capacity, including by building new production facilities,
    maintaining open and secure supply chains, avoiding any unnecessary
    export restrictions, and encouraging voluntary sharing of know-how
    and technology on mutually-determined terms including through the
    ACT-A. We are committed to strengthen global health security,
    pandemic preparedness, and response to health emergencies and future
    outbreaks. We plan to leverage our strengths to help countries build
    the capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease
    threats.  We intend to work together with like-minded countries this
    year to explore options towards sustainable global health and health
    security financing, supported by strengthened global accountability,
    tracking and allocation of global health security financing,
    including the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and
    Response (IPPPR) recommendation toward a Global Health Threats
    Council.
6.  We resolve to reinforce cooperation to reform the World Health
    Organization (WHO), including advancing sustainable financing and
    improving its internal operations. We welcome the “Rome Declaration”
    principles endorsed at the G20 Global Health Summit and the outcomes
    of the World Health Assembly, including the establishment of a
    Working Group on Strengthening WHO Preparedness and Response to
    Health Emergencies that will prioritize the assessment of the
    benefits of developing a WHO convention, agreement, or other
    international instrument on pandemic preparedness and response and
    provide a report to be considered at the special session of the
    Health Assembly in November 2021. We will continue to engage in
    health research initiatives, including to develop medical
    countermeasures in a much shorter period of time, to support the
    regional surge capacity to produce them, and to facilitate trade in
    essential medical goods. We call for progress on a transparent,
    evidence-based, and expert-led WHO-convened phase 2 study on the
    origins of COVID-19, that is free from interference, and we commit
    to working together toward the development and use of a swift and
    independent means for investigating such outbreaks in the future.
7.  We welcome G7 discussions to build back better for the
    world—orienting development finance tools toward the range of
    challenges faced by developing countries, including in resilient
    infrastructure and technologies, addressing the impact of climate
    change, health systems and security, developing digital solutions,
    and advancing gender equality and education. We intend to jointly
    drive forward a sustainable and inclusive global recovery, in line
    with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that leaves no
    one behind and prioritizes the most vulnerable and marginalized,
    protects our climate and planet, protects human rights, empowers
    women and girls and creates decent jobs. We will enhance our
    cooperation on sustainable connectivity and high-quality
    infrastructure. We intend to continue providing assistance to
    countries in need, address debt vulnerabilities, and stimulate
    domestic reforms and increased private investment.  To address the
    problem of unsustainable debts faced by many countries in the
    aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, we plan to promote the swift and
    transparent implementation of the G20 Common Framework for debt
    treatment and explore innovative instruments such as debt swaps.
    Recognizing the increase in food insecurity and malnutrition
    projected, including as a result of the pandemic, we commit to
    building resilient food systems.
8.  We resolve to support efforts to ensure safe and secure global
    mobility. We will establish a joint U.S.-EU Experts’ Working Group
    to exchange information and expertise to reinitiate safe and
    sustainable travel between the EU and the United States. We welcome
    progress made by the United States and the EU toward additional EU
    member states meeting the requirements necessary for visa-free
    travel to the United States and intend to continue our dialogue
    towards visa waiver travel.  
      
    **II.** **Protect our planet and foster green growth**
9.  Climate change, environmental degradation, and the loss of
    biodiversity are mutually-reinforcing, extraordinary threats to
    humanity. We plan to continue and strengthen our cooperation to
    tackle climate change, environmental degradation and the loss of
    biodiversity, promote green growth, protect our oceans, and urge
    ambitious action by all other major players.
10. We are committed to the Paris Agreement and its effective and
    strengthened implementation. To provide an effective platform for
    cooperation in this regard, we commit to establish a U.S.-EU
    High-Level Climate Action Group. We intend to lead by example
    through becoming net zero greenhouse gases (GHG) economies no later
    than 2050 and implementing our respective enhanced 2030 targets /
    Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We resolve to engage our
    international partners to achieve an ambitious outcome at the 26th
    UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), making every
    effort to keep a 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global temperature
    within reach. We intend to closely coordinate to promote robust
    climate measures, address the risk of carbon leakage, and cooperate
    on sustainable finance, including by providing the private sector
    with usable tools and metrics. 
11. We are determined to accelerate a climate-neutral future and ensure
    a just transition that leaves no one behind, including through low
    greenhouse gas emission technologies, an increasing uptake of
    renewable energies, a stronger engagement to promote clean energy
    innovation in Mission Innovation, increased energy efficiency and
    methane emissions reduction, sustainable food systems, including
    climate-smart agricultural systems, and sustainable and smart
    mobility. We commit to rapidly scaling up technologies and policies
    that further accelerate the transition away from unabated coal
    capacity and to an overwhelmingly decarbonized power system in the
    2030s, consistent with our respective 2030 NDCs and 2050 net zero
    commitments. The U.S.-EU Energy Council will continue to lead
    coordination on strategic energy issues, including decarbonization
    of the energy sector, energy security, and sustainable energy supply
    chains. We resolve to increase our cooperation on transition towards
    a climate-neutral, resource-efficient and circular economy.  In this
    context, we intend to work towards a Transatlantic Green Technology
    Alliance that would foster cooperation on the development and
    deployment of green technologies, as well as promote markets to
    scale such technologies.   
12. We intend to continue to scale up efforts to meet the USD 100
    billion per year climate finance goal through to 2025, in the
    context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on
    implementation from public and private sources, as well as to
    continue to scale up finance contributing to climate adaptation
    action.  In order to fulfill the objectives of the Paris Agreement,
    we stress that international investments in unabated coal must stop
    now and call for global efforts to phase out unabated coal in energy
    production. We resolve to take concrete steps towards an absolute
    end to new direct government support for unabated international
    thermal coal power generation in third countries by the end of 2021,
    including through Official Development Assistance, export finance,
    investment, and financial and trade promotion support. We commit to
    reviewing our official trade, export, and development finance
    policies towards these objectives.
13. We are strongly determined to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by
    2030 and take urgent action to address its drivers. In this context,
    we are committed to the goal of conserving or protecting at least 30
    percent of the global land and 30 percent of the global oceans
    by 2030. We commit to contribute to this goal by conserving or
    protecting at least 30 percent of our own land, including
    terrestrial and inland waters, and coastal and marine areas by 2030
    according to national circumstances and approaches. We plan to
    actively restore nature for the benefit of the health and well-being
    of our citizens, and step up our cooperation on deforestation and
    wildlife trafficking. We encourage others to make similar
    commitments to support efforts that benefit both climate and
    biodiversity, and protect our oceans. We plan to jointly promote a
    successful and ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework at
    the 15<sup>th</sup> UN Biodiversity Conference of the Parties
    (COP15). We also encourage partners to join multilateral efforts at
    the UN Environment Assembly to consider next steps at the global
    level to tackle plastics pollution.
14. We commit to working together to protect our oceans, including by
    combatting marine litter. We resolve to support the designation of
    new marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean, and continue
    cooperating for the purpose of the sustainable blue economy,
    sustainable fishing, prevention of Illegal, Unreported, and
    Unregulated (IUU) Fishing, and research through the All-Atlantic
    Ocean Research alliance. We will also plan to work together at the
    next UN Ocean Conference and at the intergovernmental conference on
    Marine Biodiversity beyond National Jurisdiction.  
      
    **III. Strengthen trade, investment, and technological cooperation**
15. We commit to grow the U.S.-EU trade and investment relationship as
    well as to uphold and reform the rules-based multilateral trading
    system. We intend to use trade to help fight climate change, protect
    the environment, promote workers’ rights, expand resilient and
    sustainable supply chains, continue to cooperate in emerging
    technologies, and create decent jobs. We resolve to stand together
    to protect our businesses and workers from unfair trade practices,
    in particular those posed by non-market economies that are
    undermining the world trading system.
16. We resolve to drive digital transformation that spurs trade and
    investment, strengthens our technological and industrial leadership,
    boosts innovation, and protects and promotes critical and emerging
    technologies and infrastructure. We plan to cooperate on the
    development and deployment of new technologies based on our shared
    democratic values, including respect for human rights, and that
    encourages compatible standards and regulations.  
17. To kick-start this positive agenda and to provide an effective
    platform for cooperation, we establish a high-level U.S.-EU Trade
    and Technology Council (TTC). The major goals of the TTC will be to
    grow the bilateral trade and investment relationship; to avoid new
    unnecessary technical barriers to trade; to coordinate, seek common
    ground, and strengthen global cooperation on technology, digital
    issues, and supply chains; to support collaborative research and
    exchanges; to cooperate on compatible and international standards
    development; to facilitate regulatory policy and enforcement
    cooperation and, where possible, convergence; to promote innovation
    and leadership by U.S. and European firms; and to strengthen other
    areas of cooperation. The cooperation and exchanges of the TTC will
    be without prejudice to the regulatory autonomy of the United States
    and the European Union and will respect the different legal systems
    in both jurisdictions. Cooperation within the TTC will also feed
    into coordination in multilateral bodies and wider efforts with
    like-minded partners, with the aim of promoting a democratic model
    of digital governance.
18. The TTC will initially include working groups with agendas focused
    on technology standards cooperation (including on AI, Internet of
    Things, among other emerging technologies), climate and green tech,
    ICT security and competitiveness, data governance and technology
    platforms, the misuse of technology threatening security and human
    rights, export controls, investment screening, promoting SMEs access
    to, and use of, digital technologies, and global trade challenges.
    It will also include a working group on reviewing and strengthening
    our most critical supply chains. Notably, we commit to building a
    U.S.-EU partnership on the rebalancing of global supply chains in
    semiconductors with a view to enhancing U.S. and EU respective
    security of supply as well as capacity to design and produce the
    most powerful and resource efficient semiconductors.
19. In parallel with the TTC, we intend to establish a U.S.-EU Joint
    Technology Competition Policy Dialogue that would focus on
    approaches to competition policy and enforcement, and increased
    cooperation in the tech sector. To support collaborative research
    and innovation exchanges, we promote a staff exchange program
    between our research funding agencies, and we intend to explore the
    possibility of developing a new research initiative on biotechnology
    and genomics, with a view to setting common standards. A new
    implementing arrangement between the EU Joint Research Centre and
    the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technologies aims to
    expand cooperation to new areas. We also resolve to deepen
    cooperation on cybersecurity information sharing and situational
    awareness, as well as cybersecurity certification of products and
    software.
20. We commit to work together to ensure safe, secure, and trusted
    cross-border data flows that protect consumers and enhance privacy
    protections, while enabling Transatlantic commerce.  To this end, we
    plan to continue to work together to strengthen legal certainty in
    Transatlantic flows of personal data. We also commit to continue
    cooperation on consumer protection and access to electronic evidence
    in criminal matters.
21. We salute having reached an Understanding on a Cooperative Framework
    for Large Civil Aircraft, reflecting a new transatlantic
    relationship in this area.  We are committed to make this framework
    work to promote a level playing field, overcome long-standing
    differences, avoid future litigation, and more effectively address
    the challenge posed by non-market economies. We will engage in
    discussions to allow the resolution of existing differences on
    measures regarding steel and aluminum before the end of the year.
     In this regard, we are determined to work together to resolve
    tensions arising from the U.S. application of tariffs on imports
    from the EU under U.S. Section 232, and will work towards allowing
    trade to recover from its 2020 lows and ending the WTO disputes. We
    commit to ensure the long-term viability of our steel and aluminum
    industries, and to address excess capacity.  We are determined to
    foster a fair, sustainable, and modern international tax system and
    cooperate to reach a global consensus on the question of taxation of
    multinational companies through the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework and
    look forward to reaching an agreement at the July meeting of G20
    Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.  
22. We intend to work cooperatively on efforts to achieve meaningful
    World Trade Organization (WTO) reform and help promote outcomes that
    benefit our workers and companies. We commit to work together to
    advance the proper functioning of the WTO’s negotiating function and
    dispute settlement system, which requires addressing long-standing
    issues. Plurilateral mechanisms can provide a means for addressing
    new trade concerns when multilateral solutions are not possible. We
    plan to continue to cooperate on special and differential treatment,
    and on our joint transparency proposal. We intend to seek to update
    the WTO rulebook with more effective disciplines on industrial
    subsidies, unfair behavior of state-owned enterprises, and other
    trade and market distorting practices. We intend to work closely
    together, and with the wider support of the Membership of the WTO,
    to conclude a meaningful agreement on fisheries subsidies, and to a
    trade policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic that facilitates
    expansion of production and equitable access to vaccines, and to
    work towards a WTO Ministerial later this year that contributes to a
    more effective and modernized rules-based trading system.
23. We commit to strengthen our cooperation on space by building on the
    Galileo – GPS Agreement. This could include making progress on
    access to Galileo’s Public Regulated Service signal, engaging on
    space-based Earth observation to support climate policies, for
    instance by monitoring CO2 levels and emergency services, as well as
    exchanging on our respective approaches on space traffic
    management.  
      
    **IV. Build a more democratic, peaceful and secure world**
24. Together, the European Union and the United States are an anchor for
    democracy, peace, and security around the world, to peacefully
    prevent and resolve conflicts, uphold the rule of law and
    international law, and promote human rights for all, gender equity
    and equality, and the empowerment of women and girls, including by
    working together through multilateral institutions including the UN
    Human Rights Council. Together, we resolve to address humanitarian
    needs and stand up for international humanitarian law as well as
    expand the resource base for humanitarian action**.** We reject
    authoritarianism in all its forms around the globe, resisting
    autocrats’ efforts to create an environment that protects their rule
    and serves their interests, while undermining liberal democracies.
    We intend to enhance cooperation on the use of sanctions to pursue
    shared foreign policy and security objectives, while avoiding
    possible unintended consequences for European and U.S. interests. In
    this respect, we resolve to continue to engage on issues on which we
    might have different approaches.
25. We intend to support democracy across the globe by defending media
    freedom; advancing a free and open internet; fostering responsible
    behavior in cyberspace; upholding transparency and combatting
    corruption in financial systems, politics, and the economy; tackling
    disinformation; protecting civil society and civic space; advancing
    women’s political participation and empowerment; and protecting the
    human rights of all people. We resolve to lead by example at home.
    We intend to partner in the Summit for Democracy, committing to
    concrete actions to defend universal human rights, prevent
    democratic backsliding, and fight corruption. We plan to increase
    cooperation and exchange information and expertise to increase
    resilience against and to counter foreign information manipulation
    and interference, all forms of coercion including economic pressure,
    hybrid threats, malicious cyber activities, terrorism and violent
    extremism, and other common security threats. We resolve to support
    the ability of civil society and independent media to operate
    freely, and to protect and defend journalists in order to hold
    governments accountable.
26. We intend to closely consult and cooperate on the full range of
    issues in the framework of our respective similar multi-faceted
    approaches to China, which include elements of cooperation,
    competition, and systemic rivalry. We intend to continue
    coordinating on our shared concerns, including ongoing human rights
    violations in Xinjiang and Tibet; the erosion of autonomy and
    democratic processes in Hong Kong; economic coercion; disinformation
    campaigns; and regional security issues. We remain seriously
    concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and
    strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo and
    increase tensions. We reaffirm the critical importance of respecting
    international law, in particular the UN Convention on the Law of the
    Sea (UNCLOS) noting its provisions setting forth the lawful maritime
    entitlements of States, on maritime delimitation, on the sovereign
    rights and jurisdictions of States, on the obligation to settle
    disputes by peaceful means, and on the freedom of navigation and
    overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the sea. We
    underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan
    Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait
    issues. We intend also to coordinate on our constructive engagement
    with China on issues such as climate change and non-proliferation,
    and on certain regional issues.
27. We stand united in our principled approach towards Russia and we are
    ready to respond decisively to its repeating pattern of negative
    behavior and harmful activities, which Russia must address to
    prevent the further deterioration of relations including on the list
    of so-called unfriendly states.To coordinate our policies and
    actions, we plan to establish a U.S.-EU high-level dialogue on
    Russia. We condemn Russia’s continued actions to undermine Ukraine’s
    and Georgia’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.
    We call on Russia to ensure foreign diplomatic missions in Russia
    can operate in a safe, secure, and productive fashion. We urge
    Russia to stop its continuous crackdown on civil society, the
    opposition, and independent media, and release all political
    prisoners. At the same time, we keep channels of communication open
    and possibilities for selective cooperation in areas of common
    interest. We also commit to work together to address the urgent and
    escalating threat from criminal ransomware networks that pose risks
    to our citizens and companies.
28. We are determined to continue to stand in support of the
    sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the EU’s
    Eastern partners and will support the reform path of Ukraine,
    Georgia, and the Republic of Moldova. We resolve to work towards
    long-term peace, resilience, and stability in the South Caucasus. We
    stand with the people of Belarus and their demands for human rights
    and democracy. We resolve to hold the Lukashenka regime to account
    for its escalating attacks on human rights and fundamental freedoms
    and for endangering aviation safety through the unprecedented and
    unacceptable forced diversion of an EU passenger airplane under
    false pretenses, and the subsequent arrest of a journalist as part
    of a continuing assault on opposition voices and the freedom of the
    press.    
29. We intend to further strengthen our joint engagement in the Western
    Balkans, including through the EU-facilitated dialogue between
    Belgrade and Pristina on normalization of their relations, and by
    supporting key reforms for EU integration. We resolve to work
    hand-in-hand for sustainable de-escalation in the Eastern
    Mediterranean, where differences should be settled through dialogue
    in good faith and in accordance with international law. We aim for a
    cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with a democratic
    Turkey. We plan to join efforts for a stable and secure Middle East
    and North Africa. The European Union and the United States welcome
    the ceasefire in the conflict in the Middle East and reaffirm the
    need for Israelis and Palestinians to enjoy equal measures of
    freedom, security, prosperity, and democracy on the basis of a
    two-State solution. In light of the growing humanitarian needs
    across Syria and the COVID 19 pandemic, we call on the UN Security
    Council to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach all people in need
    in Syria, including through cross border and cross line operations.
    We also regret the recent illegitimate elections in Syria and call
    on the international community to hold the Assad regime accountable
    for its brutal crimes and to work together to advance a political
    resolution to the conflict in line with UNSC resolution 2254. We
    reaffirm our commitment to support Libya in its path towards peace,
    security, and stability, and to work with parties in Yemen to agree
    to the UN’s proposal for an immediate ceasefire.
30. We are committed to peace and sustainable development in Africa. The
    political, human rights, security, and humanitarian situation in
    Ethiopia, Somalia, and the Sahel countries is of grave concern. We
    share deep concerns about the growing political and ethnic
    polarization throughout Ethiopia that threatens the country’s
    sovereignty and territorial integrity. We condemn ongoing
    atrocities, including widespread sexual violence, and we welcome the
    ongoing OHCHR investigations and call for full accountability for
    reported human rights violations in Tigray and for the perpetrators
    to be brought to justice. We also call for the withdrawal of foreign
    forces, and unimpeded humanitarian access. Following the Summit on
    financing African economies, we plan to act together with our
    African partners to ensure equitable access to safe and effective
    vaccines, and to provide financial support towards a sustainable
    recovery. We are determined to significantly amplify, on a voluntary
    basis, the impact of the proposed general allocation of Special
    Drawing Rights by the IMF for Africa.
31. We intend to work together with our partners for a free and open
    Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive, based on the rule of law and
    democratic values, and will contribute to the security and
    sustainable development of the region. We intend to work together to
    promote a swift return to democracy in Burma. In view of the
    withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan, we intend to
    work closely to support the ongoing peace process and sustain
    regional stability and protect human rights gains, in particular for
    women and girls.
32. We further commit to strengthen our cooperation with the countries
    of Latin America and the Caribbean to support socio-economic
    recovery, address economic vulnerability, and push for stronger
    democratic governance, including supporting a negotiated outcome
    that leads to free and fair elections in Venezuela.
33. We resolve to work together to retain the Arctic as a region of
    peace and stability and collaborate, in particular through the
    Arctic Council, to ensure a clean habitat and constructive
    cooperation on climate change, environmental protection, and
    sustainable economic development benefiting the region’s
    inhabitants.
34. We resolve to work together to counter the proliferation of weapons
    of mass destruction and renew global arms control efforts. We
    emphasize our support for the ongoing diplomatic efforts and
    negotiations in Vienna aimed at facilitating the return of the
    United States to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as
    well as the full and effective implementation of the deal by Iran
    and the United States. We share serious concerns about steps taken
    by Iran, which are inconsistent with the JCPOA. The European Union
    and the United States recognize that, alongside the return to full
    and effective implementation by Iran of its nuclear related
    commitments, the lifting of sanctions constitutes an essential part
    of the JCPOA. The JCPOA remains critical to ensuring the exclusively
    peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program and to upholding the
    global nuclear non-proliferation architecture.
35. We resolve to revive dialogue on migration and mobility, including
    innovative solutions on effective and safe migration policy in
    cooperation with third countries, including via the U.S.-EU Platform
    on Migration and Asylum.
36. We welcome the EU’s invitation to the United States to join the
    PESCO project Military Mobility as an important step towards closer
    U.S.-EU partnership in security and defense.  We recognize the
    contribution EU security and defense initiatives can make to both
    European and Transatlantic security and plan to launch a dedicated
    dialogue on security and defense and pursue closer cooperation in
    this field.  We commit to work towards an Administrative Arrangement
    for the United States with the European Defence Agency, with
    discussions, including on modalities and conditions for a closer and
    mutually beneficial cooperation in this framework, beginning as soon
    as possible.  We reaffirm our unwavering support for robust NATO-EU
    cooperation and to the commitments outlined and principles enshrined
    in the 2016 and 2018 Joint Declarations.  We will work jointly to
    raise the level of NATO-EU ambition in order to further strengthen
    this mutually reinforcing key strategic partnership.
