title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden and G7 Leaders Launch Build Back Better World\
  \ (B3W)\_Partnership"
---
 
*The United States is rallying the world’s democracies to deliver for
our people, meet the world’s biggest challenges, and demonstrate our
shared values*

Today President Biden met with G7 leaders to discuss strategic
competition with China and commit to concrete actions to help meet the
tremendous infrastructure need in low- and middle-income countries.  
  
**Build Back Better World: An Affirmative Initiative for Meeting the
Tremendous Infrastructure Needs of Low- and Middle-Income
Countries. **President Biden and G7 partners agreed to launch the bold
new global infrastructure initiative Build Back Better World (B3W), a
values-driven, high-standard, and transparent infrastructure partnership
led by major democracies to help narrow the $40+ trillion infrastructure
need in the developing world, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19
pandemic.  
  
Through B3W, the G7 and other like-minded partners will coordinate in
mobilizing private-sector capital in four areas of focus—climate, health
and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and
equality—with catalytic investments from our respective development
finance institutions.  
  
B3W will be global in scope, from Latin America and the Caribbean to
Africa to the Indo-Pacific. Different G7 partners will have different
geographic orientations, but the sum of the initiative will cover low-
and middle-income countries across the world.   
  
In announcing this partnership, the United States and its G7 partners
are expressing a unified vision for global infrastructure development.
As a lead partner in B3W, the United States will seek to mobilize the
full potential of our development finance tools, including the
Development Finance Corporation, USAID, EXIM, the Millennium Challenge
Corporation, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and
complementary bodies such as the Transaction Advisory Fund. In doing so,
the Biden Administration aims to complement domestic infrastructure
investments in the American Jobs Plan and create new opportunities to
demonstrate U.S. competitiveness abroad and create jobs at home.  
  
In addition to the billions of dollars which the United States mobilizes
in overseas infrastructure financing through existing bilateral and
multilateral tools, we will work with Congress to augment our
development finance toolkit with the hope that, together with the
private sector, other U.S. stakeholders, and G7 partners, **B3W will
collectively catalyze hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure
investment for low- and middle-income countries in the coming years**.  
  
Together with leaders of the G7, the Biden Administration fully endorses
the guiding principles of B3W:

-   **Values-Driven.** Infrastructure development carried out in a
    transparent and sustainable manner—financially, environmentally, and
    socially —will lead to a better outcome for recipient countries and
    communities. We will offer countries a positive vision and a
    sustainable, transparent source of financing to meet their
    infrastructure needs.
-   **Good Governance and Strong Standards**. High standards have become
    ever more important at a time when governments are grappling with
    complex decisions on how to tackle climate change, build back local
    economies, direct scarce financing, and boost employment in an
    inclusive way. We are committed to providing citizens of recipient
    communities with the long-run benefits they expect and deserve from
    infrastructure projects. Our efforts will be guided by high
    standards and principles, such as those promoted by the updated Blue
    Dot Network, relating to the environment and climate, labor and
    social safeguards, transparency, financing, construction,
    anticorruption, and other areas.
-   **Climate-Friendly.** The investments will be made in a manner
    consistent with achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.
-   **Strong Strategic Partnerships.** Infrastructure that is developed
    in partnership with those whom it benefits will last longer and
    generate more development impact. Infrastructure created under the
    B3W will be developed through consultation with communities and
    assessing local needs as a true partners. We will establish a
    taskforce together as a G7, and with others, to coordinate,
    harmonize our efforts, and increase our impact and reach**.**
-   **Mobilize Private Capital Through Development Finance. **Status quo
    funding and financing approaches are inadequate to address the
    tremendous infrastructure gap in low- and middle-income countries.
    We are committed to augmenting the development finance tools at our
    disposal to support and catalyze a significant increase in private
    capital to address infrastructure needs. Infrastructure investment
    by a responsible and market-driven private sector, paired with high
    standards and transparency in public funding, is crucial for
    long-run development effectiveness and sustainability.
-   **Enhancing the Impact of Multilateral Public Finance. **
    Multilateral development banks and other international financial
    institutions (IFIs) have developed rigorous standards for project
    planning, implementation, social and environmental safeguards, and
    analytical capability. The United States will incorporate these
    standards and safeguards to help ensure that U.S. taxpayer resources
    are used appropriately and effectively. We will work with the IFIs
    to enhance their catalytic impact and increase the mobilization of
    capital—both public and private—needed for impactful and sustainable
    infrastructure investment.

More detail will be included in the G7 Leaders’ Communique.
