President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine.  The leaders discussed our strategic partnership
in support of President Zelenskyy’s plan to tackle corruption and
implement a reform agenda, based on our shared democratic values and
Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations, that delivers justice, security,
and prosperity to the people of Ukraine.  President Biden affirmed the
United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and
territorial integrity in the face of ongoing Russian aggression in
Donbas and Crimea.  The leaders also discussed the need for close
cooperation on energy security and the fight against COVID-19, including
U.S. plans to provide 900,000 vaccine doses to help Ukraine address the
pandemic.  President Biden invited President Zelenskyy to visit
Washington later this summer.
