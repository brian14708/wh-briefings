President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke today with President Ivan Duque of
Colombia to express U.S. support following the attack on the Colombian
presidential helicopter last Friday. The President reaffirmed the
enduring partnership between the United States and Colombia, and pledged
support for Colombiaâ€™s efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic by
donating 2.5 million vaccines. President Biden also voiced support for
the rights of peaceful protestors, underscored that law enforcement must
be held to the highest standards of accountability, and condemned wanton
acts of violence and vandalism. They discussed joint security
cooperation, a holistic approach to combating the drug trade, the need
to promote broad-based economic recovery from the pandemic, and the
urgency of addressing the threat of climate change. The President also
shared his concern regarding the situation in Venezuela and its regional
impact and underscored the importance of expanding international
consensus in favor of comprehensive negotiations that lead to free and
fair elections.
