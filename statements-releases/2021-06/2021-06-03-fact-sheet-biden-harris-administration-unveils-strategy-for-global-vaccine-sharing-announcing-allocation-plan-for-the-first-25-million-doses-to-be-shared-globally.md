As we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic at home and work to end
the pandemic worldwide, President Biden has promised that the United
States will be an arsenal of vaccines for the world. To do that, the
Administration will pursue several additional measures beyond our robust
funding for COVAX: Donating from the U.S. vaccine supply to the world
and encouraging other nations to do the same, working with U.S.
manufacturers to increase vaccine production for the rest of the world,
and helping more countries expand their own capacity to produce vaccines
including through support for global supply chains. This vaccine
strategy is a vital component of our overall global strategy to lead the
world in the fight to defeat COVID-19, including emergency public health
assistance and aid to stop the spread and building global public health
capacity and readiness to beat not just this pandemic, but the next
one.  
  
Today, the Administration announced its framework for sharing at least
80 million U.S. vaccine doses globally by the end of June and the plan
for the first 25 million doses.    
  
Specifically, the Administration announced that:    
  
**<u>The United States will share vaccines in service of ending the
pandemic globally</u>**. Today, the Administration announced its
framework for sharing these 80 million U.S. vaccine doses worldwide.
Specifically, the United States will:  
  
***Share 75% of these vaccines through COVAX***. The United States will
share at least three-quarters of its donated doses through COVAX,
supplying U.S. doses to countries in need. This will maximize the number
of vaccines available equitably for the greatest number of countries and
for those most at-risk within countries.  For doses shared through
COVAX, the United States will prioritize Latin America and the
Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa, in coordination with
the African Union.     
  
***Share 25% for immediate needs and to help with surges around the
world.*** The United States has received requests for vaccines from
countries all over the world.  The U.S. will share up to one-quarter of
its donated doses directly with countries in need, those experiencing
surges, immediate neighbors, and other countries that have requested
immediate U.S. assistance. Specifically, we will:

-   **Set the stage for increased global coverage.**  The allocation of
    this first tranche of donated doses reflects the desire of the
    United States to respond to all regions and lay the ground for
    increased supply and access throughout the world.  
-   **Prepare for surges and prioritize healthcare workers and other
    vulnerable populations** based on public health data and
    acknowledged best practice. We will share with countries in urgent
    need, with a priority on vaccinating frontline workers. The United
    States will not use its vaccines to secure favors from other
    countries.  The U.S. will work with partners who are both ready and
    in need.  And, our donations will prioritize countries with vaccine
    readiness plans that prioritize individuals at highest risk of
    severe disease and those working to help care for them, like health
    care workers.  
-   **Help countries in need and our neighbors.** The United States will
    share vaccines in our region and across our borders. We first made
    doses available to our closest neighbors – Canada and Mexico.  Our
    dose sharing approach prioritizes Latin American and the Caribbean
    on a *per capita* basis.

**<u>The U.S. announced the proposed allocation plan for the first 25
Million doses.</u>** Based on the framework above and pending legal and
regulatory approvals, the United States plans to send our first tranche
of 25 million doses:

-   Nearly 19 million will be shared through COVAX, with the following
    allocations:
    -   Approximately 6 million for South and Central America to the
        following countries: Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica,
        Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Guatemala, El Salvador,
        Honduras, Panama, Haiti, and other Caribbean Community (CARICOM)
        countries, as well as the Dominican Republic.
    -   Approximately 7 million for Asia to the following countries and
        entities:  India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
        Afghanistan, Maldives, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam,
        Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and the
        Pacific Islands. 
    -   Approximately 5 million for Africa to be shared with countries
        that will be selected in coordination with the African Union.   
-   Approximately 6 million will be targeted toward regional priorities
    and partner recipients, including Mexico, Canada, and the Republic
    of Korea, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Haiti, Georgia,
    Egypt, Jordan, India, Iraq, and Yemen, as well as for United Nations
    frontline workers.  

The sharing of millions of U.S. vaccines with other countries signals a
major commitment by the U.S. government.  Just like in the United
States, we will move as expeditiously as possible, while abiding by U.S.
and host country regulatory and legal requirements, to facilitate the
safe and secure transport of vaccines across international borders. 
This will take time, but the President has directed the Administration
to use all the levers of the U.S. government to protect individuals from
this virus as quickly as possible.  The specific vaccines and amounts
will be determined and shared as the Administration works through the
logistical, regulatory and other parameters particular to each region
and country.
