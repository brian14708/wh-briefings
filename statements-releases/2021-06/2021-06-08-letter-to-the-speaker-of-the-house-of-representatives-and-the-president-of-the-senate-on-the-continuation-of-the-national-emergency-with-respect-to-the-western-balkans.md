  Balkans"

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:) 

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)),
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans
that was declared in Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001, is to
continue in effect beyond June 26, 2021.  
  
The threat constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or
assisting, sponsoring, or supporting, (i) extremist violence in the
former Republic of Macedonia (what is now the Republic of North
Macedonia) and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts
obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo,
has not been resolved.  In addition, Executive Order 13219 was amended
by Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003, to take additional steps with
respect to certain actions that obstruct implementation of, among other
things, the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 relating to the former
Republic of Macedonia (what is now the Republic of North Macedonia).  
  
The acts of extremist violence and obstructionist activity outlined in
these Executive Orders are hostile to United States interests and
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this reason, I
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared with respect to the Western Balkans in Executive Order 13219.

Sincerely,  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
