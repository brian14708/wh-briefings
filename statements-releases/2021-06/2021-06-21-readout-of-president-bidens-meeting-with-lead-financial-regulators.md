Today, the President met with top financial regulators to discuss how to
build on the rapid economic turnaround since his inauguration and ensure
there is sustainable and equitable growth that benefits every American
family. The regulators reported that the financial system is in strong
condition. They further indicated that financial risks are being
mitigated by robust capital and liquidity levels in the banking system,
and healthy household balance sheets stemming from fiscal support and
the ongoing economic recovery. The regulators also said they were making
steady progress on the Presidentâ€™s executive order on climate-related
risk and discussed ideas for promoting financial inclusion and for
responsibly increasing access to credit for potential homeowners and
small businesses.
