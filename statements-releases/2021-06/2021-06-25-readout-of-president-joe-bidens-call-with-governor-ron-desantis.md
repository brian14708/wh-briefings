President Biden spoke this afternoon with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis
to offer support after the President approved an emergency declaration
for Miami-Dade County, Florida last night following the partial collapse
of a residential building in Surfside, Florida. The President said his
administration stands ready to provide additional resources and
assistance that state and local officials need. The President expressed
his gratitude for the heroic first responders and search and rescue
teams who are working tirelessly and whose bravery and courage have
saved lives. The President also expressed his condolences to the
Governor and the people of the Surfside community, sharing his grief for
the families who lost loved ones in this devastating tragedy and for the
families who are waiting in anguish as search and rescue efforts
continue.

**<u>Background:</u>**

The President approved the emergency declaration shortly after receiving
the request from the Governor of Florida, ordering Federal assistance be
made available. The emergency declaration authorizes FEMA to coordinate
disaster relief efforts, reimburse response costs, provide equipment and
resources to assist with debris removal and emergency protective
measures in order to try to save lives, and to provide temporary shelter
and housing for those who have been displaced. FEMA has deployed an
Incident Management Assistance Team to Florida to provide support for
the state and two FEMA-supported search and rescue teams are involved in
the response to this devastating incident. FEMA is also sending building
science experts, search and rescue technical experts, and a mobile
command center. Additional FEMA National Urban Search and Rescue System
teams are on alert if requested. The White House and FEMA have been in
close coordination with local officials throughout the past two days.
The White House is continuing to monitor the situation, and the
President will continue to receive regular updates from his Homeland
Security team.
