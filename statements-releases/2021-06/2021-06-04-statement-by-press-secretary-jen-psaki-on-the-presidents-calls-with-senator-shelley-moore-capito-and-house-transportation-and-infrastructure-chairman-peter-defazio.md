The President spoke to Senator Shelley Moore Capito and Chairman Peter
DeFazio today.

Senator Capito conveyed to the President a new offer from her group
which consisted of an about $50 billion increase in spending across a
number of infrastructure programs. The President expressed his gratitude
for her effort and goodwill, but also indicated that the current offer
did not meet his objectives to grow the economy, tackle the climate
crisis, and create new jobs. He indicated to Senator Capito that he
would continue to engage a number of Senators in both parties in the
hopes of achieving a more substantial package. They agreed to speak
again on Monday.

The President also spoke to Chairman DeFazio to thank him for all his
hard work on key elements of the American Jobs Plan, and to offer his
support for the Committee mark-up that Chairman DeFazio will begin on
Wednesday. The President and Chairman DeFazio agreed on the benefits of
continued engagement with Democratic and Republican Senators as the
House work on infrastructure advances this coming week.
