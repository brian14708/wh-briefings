for the Afghan people, including Afghan women, girls, and minorities,
through civilian, development, and humanitarian aid, as well as the
continued provision of security assistance to support Afghan National
Defense and Security Forces. President Biden expressed his concern about
the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan, and noted
additional emergency U.S. assistance, including three million doses of
vaccines, to help the Afghan government respond to the pandemic.
