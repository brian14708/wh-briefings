Today, I join people around the globe in commemorating World Refugee
Day, a day when we recognize the courage and humanity of the millions
forced to flee violence, persecution, and war. It is also a moment to
honor the generosity of communities welcoming refugees and the bravery
and dedication of humanitarian workers who provide life-saving
assistance, often in challenging and dangerous conditions.

At a time when the number of refugees and other displaced persons has
reached an alarming and historic high—more than 82 million worldwide—the
United States has a moral obligation to ensure that refugees have access
to life-saving care, opportunities to pursue an education, and
livelihoods that allow them to live with dignity and hope for the
future.  On this day, we reaffirm our sacred commitment to alleviate
suffering through humanitarian relief, and redouble our efforts
to achieve lasting solutions for refugees—including through
resettlement.  We also recommit to engaging in diplomatic efforts to
bring an end to the ongoing conflicts that compel refugees to seek
safety elsewhere.  

Protecting refugees is part of our DNA.  Our nation was founded by those
fleeing religious persecution.  When we take action to help refugees
around the world, we honor our past and live up to our highest values. 
We show our greatest strength as a nation.

We do this because it’s the right thing to do, but make no mistake: 
helping refugees helps the United States, too, bringing greater regional
stability and making the world a safer place for all of us.  

That’s why I revised the United States’ annual refugee admissions cap to
62,500 for this fiscal year, and plan to raise it to 125,000 next year.
While meeting these targets will be a challenge, I have directed my
Administration to work as quickly as possible to rebuild and improve
refugee processing and to expand our capacity to admit
refugees.  We need to lead by example.  And the refugees who arrive at
our shores will continue to strengthen our communities, as they always
have, bringing new life, energy, and ideas to our great country. The
United States is proud to stand as a beacon of liberty and refuge to the
world, and whether it’s taking in those seeking safety or providing more
humanitarian relief than any other nation, we’re going to do our part.
