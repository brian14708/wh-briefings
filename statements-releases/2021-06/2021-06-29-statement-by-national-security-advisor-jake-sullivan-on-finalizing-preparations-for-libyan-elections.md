title: Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Finalizing Preparations
  for Libyan Elections
---
 
I commend the work of the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) as its
members meet in Geneva this week to finalize preparations for Libya to
hold historic national elections on December 24, 2021. As the Berlin II
conference affirmed, the United States stands together with our Libyan
and international partners in full support for holding presidential and
parliamentary elections on time that will enable Libyans to choose their
own leaders and re-establish their sovereignty after years of civil
conflict and economic upheaval. This builds on recent progress with the
establishment of the interim Government of National Unity.

We are encouraged by the positive atmosphere and spirit of compromise in
which the LPDF is meeting, with active United Nations facilitation, to
adopt the constitutional and legislative arrangements needed for
elections. We support the Libyan people as they chart a path toward a
more stable, prosperous, and secure future.
