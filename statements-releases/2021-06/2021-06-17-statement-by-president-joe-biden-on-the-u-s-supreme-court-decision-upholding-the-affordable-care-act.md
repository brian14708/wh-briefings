title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the U.S. Supreme Court Decision Upholding\
  \ the Affordable Care\_Act"

The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land.   
  
Today’s U.S. Supreme Court decision is a major victory for all Americans
benefitting from this groundbreaking and life-changing law. It is a
victory for more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions
and millions more who were in immediate danger of losing their health
care in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic.   
  
It is a victory for every American who, prior to the Affordable Care
Act, stayed up at night staring at the ceiling, wondering whether they
would lose everything if they or a loved one got sick. Because of this
law, they don’t have to worry about being denied coverage due to a
pre-existing condition like diabetes or watching their coverage being
capped during a cancer treatment. Because of the law, they are able to
get free preventive screenings that can save their lives and improve
their health. Today’s victory is also for all the young people who can
stay on their parents’ insurance plan until they turn 26 years old, and
for the millions of low-income families and people with disabilities
receiving health care because their states expanded Medicaid under this
law.

After more than a decade of attacks on the Affordable Care Act through
the Congress and the courts, today’s decision – the third major
challenge to the law that the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected – it is
time move forward and keep building on this landmark law.  
  
That is what we are doing thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which has
lowered health care costs and expanded coverage for millions
of Americans through the Affordable Care Act. More than 1.2 million
Americans signed up for coverage under the law through a special
enrollment period I established during this pandemic, which people can
still sign up for through August 15<sup>th</sup>. And I look forward to
working with the Congress to build on this law so that the American
people will continue to have access to quality and affordable health
care.  
  
Today’s decision affirms that the Affordable Care Act is stronger than
ever, delivers for the American people, and gets us closer to fulfilling
our moral obligation to ensure that, here in America, health care is a
right and not a privilege.
