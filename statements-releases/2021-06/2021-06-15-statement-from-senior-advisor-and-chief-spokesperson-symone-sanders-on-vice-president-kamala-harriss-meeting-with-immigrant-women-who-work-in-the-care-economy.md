---
 
Today, on the ninth anniversary of the creation of the Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Vice President Kamala Harris met
with immigrant women who work in the care economy, including two DACA
recipients. U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (NJ) and Dick Durbin (IL), as
well as Ai-Jen Poo and Jessica Morales Rocketto of the National Domestic
Workers Alliance, also participated.  
   
The Vice President heard directly from two DACA recipients, Scarleth
Herrera Lopez and Gloria Elizabeth Blanco; two Temporary Protected
Status (TPS) recipients, Melissa Larette and Rukmani Bhattari Adhikari;
and two green card holders, Yaquelin Lopez Chavez and Gilda Blanco. The
women told the Vice President about the challenges they face on the
frontlines during the pandemic, and how they and their loved ones have
experienced the U.S. immigration system. The Vice President thanked the
women for the critically important work they do, for their courage, and
for sharing their personal stories with her and the group.  
   
During the conversation, the Vice President reiterated the urgent need
for Congress to create a clear pathway to citizenship for Dreamers,
farmworkers, and individuals with Temporary Protected Status, and she
called on the U.S. Senate to pass the American Dream and Promise Act and
the Farm Workforce Modernization Act. She thanked Chairman Durbin for
his leadership on the American Dream and Promise Act, and Chairman
Menendez for his leadership on the U.S. Citizenship Act.
