title: "U.S.-Russia Presidential Joint Statement on Strategic\_Stability"
---
 
We, President of the United States of America Joseph R. Biden and
President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, note the United
States and Russia have demonstrated that, even in periods of tension,
they are able to make progress on our shared goals of ensuring
predictability in the strategic sphere, reducing the risk of armed
conflicts and the threat of nuclear war.

The recent extension of the New START Treaty exemplifies our commitment
to nuclear arms control. Today, we reaffirm the principle that a nuclear
war cannot be won and must never be fought.

Consistent with these goals, the United States and Russia will embark
together on an integrated bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue in the
near future that will be deliberate and robust. Through this Dialogue,
we seek to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction
measures.
