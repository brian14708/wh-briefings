President Biden looks forward to welcoming Afghan President Ashraf Ghani
and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chairman of the High Council for National
Reconciliation, to the White House on June 25, 2021. The visit by
President Ghani and Dr. Abdullah will highlight the enduring partnership
between the United States and Afghanistan as the military drawdown
continues. The United States is committed to supporting the Afghan
people by providing diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian assistance to
support the Afghan people, including Afghan women, girls and minorities.
The United States will remain deeply engaged with the Government of
Afghanistan to ensure the country never again becomes a safe haven for
terrorist groups who pose a threat to the U.S. homeland. The United
States continues to fully support the ongoing peace process and
encourages all Afghan parties to participate meaningfully in
negotiations to bring an end to the conflict.
