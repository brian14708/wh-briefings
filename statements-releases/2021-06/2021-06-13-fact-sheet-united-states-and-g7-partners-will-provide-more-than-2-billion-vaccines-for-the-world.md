title: 'FACT SHEET: United States and G7+ Partners Will Provide More than 2 Billion
  Vaccines for the World'
---
 
***The United States and our G7 Partners are rallying to defeat COVID-19
through historic financing, donations, and capacity building,
demonstrating how democracies can provide for our people and the
world.***

This week in Cornwall, the United States and G7+ Leaders announced more
than one billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to accelerate
global coverage. This announcement means that since 2020, the G7+ has
committed to financing and providing approximately 2.3 billion vaccines
for the world. The United States is providing nearly half of that
support and is the single largest COVID-19 vaccine donor in the world.
This 2.3 billion total includes support for expanding local production
capacity around the world to add more than a billion doses to the global
vaccine supply by the end of 2022.    
  
**Earlier Financing and Sharing:** G7+ countries have previously
committed to finance and share more than 1 billion doses.

-   Since the inception of COVAX, G7+ countries have previously
    committed more than **<u>1 billion doses</u>** through COVAX to date
    in direct financing and doses.   
-   This includes more than 330 million dose equivalents from the United
    States in funding for COVAX and at least 80 million U.S. vaccines
    donated to the world from surplus supply.

**Local Vaccine Production Investments:** G7+ investment in local
vaccine production capacity will support at least 1 billion vaccine
doses by the end of 2022.

-   Through partnerships like the Quad Vaccine Partnership of the United
    States, India, Japan, and Australia, the G7+ is committed to
    expanding local production for at least **<u>1 billion doses</u>**
    of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 and 2022.  
-   The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is
    driving this effort and is also working with peer Development
    Finance Institutions including the International Finance
    Corporation, Proparco, and DEG to support vaccine manufacturing in
    Africa – for Africa.

**This week:** The G7+ agreed to provide an additional more than 1
billion doses starting summer 2021.

-   This week in Cornwall, G7+ Leaders agreed to provide at least **<u>1
    billion doses</u>** of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to
    accelerate global vaccine coverage, particularly for the poorest
    countries.  
-   The United States announced its commitment to purchase and
    contribute to Gavi or in support of COVAX **500 million doses** of
    Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, with delivery beginning in August
    2021, as its portion of approximately half of the overall G7+
    commitment. The U.S. will allocate these doses to 92 low and
    lower-middle income nations around the world. **This is the world’s
    largest-ever purchase and donation of vaccines by a single
    country.**

The United States calls on countries to donate additional doses of safe
and effective vaccines, strengthen vaccine readiness, and work with
private sector partners to vaccinate the world. In addition to support
for the G7+ commitment on vaccines, the United States will continue to
share doses from our domestic supply as they become available.
