title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Wildfire Preparedness Meeting with Cabinet\
  \ Officials, Governors and Private Sector\_Partners"
---
 
Today, President Biden convened a meeting with Governors from Western
States, Cabinet and agency officials, and energy sector partners to
discuss the critical need to work together to strengthen prevention,
preparedness and response efforts for this wildfire season, which is on
track to outpace last season.  In the meeting, the President emphasized
the importance of making much-needed investments to prepare our country
to do everything we can to address the growing and severe threat of
wildfires and save lives.  The President highlighted the series of
actions his Administration is taking immediately to respond to wildfires
this year, including making substantial investments in our firefighter
personnel, increasing Federal firefighter pay and providing access to
retention incentives, and extending the hiring of temporary firefighters
to ensure a more effective response throughout this year’s fire season.
 The President also shared how the Biden Administration is improving our
wildfire response capabilities including through the use of new
technologies, and helping vulnerable communities mitigate the impact of
fires through new funding.  President Biden announced a $37 million
grant award to California to support fire mitigation efforts as part of
FEMA’s new Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. 
Last month, President Biden
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/24/fact-sheet-biden-administration-invests-1-billion-to-protect-communities-families-and-businesses-before-disaster-strikes/)
the Administration will double funding for the program to $1 billion
next year in order to invest in pre-disaster resilience and mitigation
resources and help strengthen the ability of communities, families, and
businesses to withstand extreme weather events and other disasters.  
  
Vice President Harris spoke about how this administration is investing
in resilience to protect against wildfires and extreme weather.
 President Biden and Vice President Harris asked the Governors what
additional support and resources they need and what immediate actions
can be taken by the Federal government to protect communities from
wildfires, help them deal with drought conditions, and improve emergency
preparedness.  The Governors – who represent a range of states across
the West – talked about the importance of working closely together and
closely coordinating to prevent wildfires from happening and ensure
response efforts are as speedy and effective as possible.  The President
and his Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall asked the three
CEOs of Western utilities to describe how they can improve capacity to
manage extreme demands on the grid, diminish the likelihood of power
infrastructure sparking or being impacted by wildfires, and rapidly
develop and deploy innovative new technologies to improve extreme heat
management and wildfire prevention.  The President also discussed the
synergistic relationship between modernizing the grid and enabling a
more resilient low carbon future.  
  
The members of the Cabinet discussed their departments’ respective
efforts to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of wildfires, and
answered questions from the President about what more can be done to
advance collaboration with states and the private sector on prevention
and response.  Secretary Vilsack discussed how we have to stop doing
wildfire preparedness on the cheap and must make the much-needed
investments in firefighting personnel, equipment and mitigation
efforts.  Forest Service Chief Christiansen outlined the steps being
taken to increase firefighter pay, readiness and availability.
 Secretary Haaland highlighted DOI’s wildfire preparedness and response
efforts.  Secretary Mayorkas highlighted efforts to support wildfire
response and elaborated on the FEMA grant funding being awarded to
California today, and the new technologies they are developing to
improve early detection of wildfires and meet first responders’
operational needs.  EPA Administrator Regan described new technology
tools that provide broader public access to prompt and reliable
information and health guidance on air quality issues resulting from
wildfire smoke in their communities, and Secretary Granholm noted the
work being done to support reliable power generation during extreme
weather events and prevent structural energy infrastructure failures
that have the potential to ignite wildfires.
