President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Emmanuel Macron
on the margins of the G7 Summit. The two leaders reaffirmed their

including through participation in the G7 commitment to donate COVID-19
vaccines to countries in need, and to build back better global health
security for the future. They reaffirmed their commitment to reform the
international tax system to address some of the inequities created by
globalization. President Biden expressed his appreciation for Franceâ€™s
leadership on climate issues through the Paris Agreement, and both
leaders underscored their dedication to achieve ambitious outcomes at
the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November. President Biden and President
Macron discussed our work to strengthen and modernize NATO, and our
close cooperation on counter terrorism cooperation, including in the
Sahel, and other shared foreign policy priorities such as China and
Russia.
