President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to discuss
the June 14 NATO Summit in Brussels.  The President expressed his strong
commitment to working closely with Allies to build on NATO’s seven
decades of success safeguarding transatlantic security and democratic
values.  The two leaders agreed on the importance of the NATO 2030
initiative to adapt the Alliance to meet the challenges of strategic
competition and transnational threats, including climate change and
cyberattacks.  They also reviewed Allies’ progress over the last seven
years in boosting defense spending and other contributions to our common
defense, underscoring the importance of sharing responsibility equitably
within NATO and ensuring NATO is adequately resourced to address the
threat environment.  In addition, they discussed NATO’s two decades of
investment in Afghanistan and continued support for diplomatic peace
efforts.
