title: Statement from Vice President Kamala Harris On Nevada Expanding Voting Access
---
 
The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy—and defending that
fundamental right is the most important work we can do as a nation.
Earlier this month, Nevada made voting easier by expanding mail in
voting. And today, the Governor signed into law additional legislation
to increase access to the ballot box. The fact is: when Americans cast a
ballot, we not only decide our leaders. We determine the future of our
nation, and we strengthen our democracy.   
   
That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration strongly supports the For the
People Act, which would ensure fair participation in every state, and
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would curb racial
discrimination in our elections.
