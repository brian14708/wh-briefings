Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Louisiana and ordered federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding from May 17 to May
21, 2021.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the parishes of Ascension, Calcasieu, East Baton Rouge,
Iberville, and Lafayette.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named John E. Long as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
parishes can begin applying for assistance by registering online at
