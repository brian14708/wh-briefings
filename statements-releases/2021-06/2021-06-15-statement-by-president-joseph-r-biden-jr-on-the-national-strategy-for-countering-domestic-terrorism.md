title: Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on the National Strategy for Countering
  Domestic Terrorism
---
 
Domestic terrorism – driven by hate, bigotry, and other forms of
extremism— is a stain on the soul of America.  It goes against
everything our country strives for and it poses a direct challenge to
our national security, democracy, and unity.  
  
To meet this serious and growing threat, on my first day in office I
directed my national security team to confront the rise in domestic
terrorism with the necessary resources and resolve.  Today, I am
releasing the first-ever [National Strategy for Countering Domestic
Terrorism](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf). 
It lays out a comprehensive approach to protecting our nation from
domestic terrorism while safeguarding our bedrock civil rights and civil
liberties – values that make us who we are as Americans.  We have to
take both short-term steps to counter the very real threats of today and
longer-term measures to diminish the drivers that will contribute to
this ongoing challenge to our democracy.  
  
This is a project that should unite all Americans.  Together we must
affirm that domestic terrorism has no place in our society.  We must
work to root out the hatreds that can too often drive violence.  And we
must recommit to defending and protecting our basic freedoms, which
belong to all Americans in equal measure, and which are not only the
foundation of our democracy – they are our enduring advantage in the
world.
