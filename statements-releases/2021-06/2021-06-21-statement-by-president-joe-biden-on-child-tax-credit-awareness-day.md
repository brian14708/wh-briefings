I have repeatedly said that America’s middle class deserves a tax cut,
and we’re providing a significant tax cut to America’s working families
with children through the largest-ever child tax credit.

Not only did the American Rescue Plan increase the child tax credit to
$3000 for families whose children are between 6-17 years old and $3600
for families with children under 6 years old, it allows half of that tax
cut to be paid to families in advance through a monthly check or direct
deposit. This year, a family with two young children would receive a tax
cut of $7200, with a monthly payment of $600 starting in July. Almost
all families who have filed taxes in the last two years will receive
this tax cut automatically.

This tax cut will give our nation’s hardworking families with children a
little more breathing room when it comes to putting food on the table,
paying the bills, and making ends meet. Nearly every working family with
children is going to feel this tax cut make a difference in their lives,
and we need to spread the word so that all eligible families get the
full credit.

Just as Americans came together in support of the American Rescue Plan,
we’re asking Americans to come together to build support and awareness
for this vital tax relief for families, to help us extend it for years
to come, and to ensure we get all children in our nation’s low-income
families signed up this year.

If we’re able to get every family signed up, it will mean significant
tax relief for America’s working families, and will help bring us even
closer to cutting child poverty in half. That is why we have designated
today, June 21, as Child Tax Credit Awareness Day. Across the nation,
organizations that advocate for children, faith-based organizations and
elected officials are holding events, training volunteers, announcing
strategies to sign up the lowest income families, and using social media
to explain how the Child Tax Credit will cut child poverty and why we
must extend it through the American Families Plan.

To help or sign up, please go to ChildTaxCredit.Gov. It provides simple,
useful information, in both English and Spanish, as well as a link to
help families sign up. 

For parents working to make ends meet and raise their children with
greater security, dignity, and opportunity, help is here. On this Child
Tax Credit Awareness day, let us all work together to make sure that the
help that is here reaches those who most need it, this year and for
years to come.
