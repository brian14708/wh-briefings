title: "Statement by the President on the Affirmation of Ratko Mladic\u2019s Conviction"
---
 
Almost twenty-six years ago, Ratko Mladic ordered the summary execution
of some 8,000 unarmed men and boys in Srebrenica. He also led the brutal
years-long siege of Sarajevo and was responsible for many other crimes.
Today, the United Nations International Residual Mechanism for Criminal
Tribunals in The Hague affirmed his conviction for genocide, crimes
against humanity, and war crimes. This historic judgment shows that
those who commit horrific crimes will be held accountable. It also
reinforces our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from
occurring anywhere in the world.

The United States helped lead the international effort to end the
atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to bring to justice those who
committed crimes there and in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, and
to establish a lasting peace to that country and the broader region. We
are grateful for the tireless work of the UN tribunals over the past two
decades on cases related to the conflict in the Balkans and all those
whose dedication made this judgment possible.

Justice and reconciliation are the foundation for peace and stability
for the future, and today’s decision is also an important confirmation
that this is possible. I sincerely hope leaders in the region will
respect this judgment and reinforce its importance for the rule of law.

My thoughts today are with all the surviving families of the many
victims of Mladic’s atrocities. We can never erase the tragedy of their
deaths, but I hope today’s judgment provides some solace to all those
who are grieving.
