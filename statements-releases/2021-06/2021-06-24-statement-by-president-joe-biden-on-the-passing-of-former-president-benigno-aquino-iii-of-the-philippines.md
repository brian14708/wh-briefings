  \ Aquino III of the\_Philippines"

I extend my deepest condolences to the people of the Philippines on the
death of former President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III. He was a valued
friend and partner to the United States, and he will long be remembered
for serving his country with integrity and selfless dedication.
President Aquino’s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding
the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while
taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves
a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for years to
come. I greatly valued our time working together, and I extend my
heartfelt sympathies to his family and to all who will mourn his
absence.
