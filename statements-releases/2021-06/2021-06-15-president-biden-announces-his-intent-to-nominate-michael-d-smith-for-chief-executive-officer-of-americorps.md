WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate

Michael Smith currently serves as Executive Director of the My Brother’s

Prior to joining the White House team, Smith was director of the Social
Innovation Fund (SIF), Senior Vice President of Social Innovation at the
Case Foundation, and helped build national initiatives aimed at bridging
the “digital divide.” Smith is a Senior Atlantic Fellow for Racial
Equity and a member of Boys and Girls Clubs of America’s Alumni Hall of
