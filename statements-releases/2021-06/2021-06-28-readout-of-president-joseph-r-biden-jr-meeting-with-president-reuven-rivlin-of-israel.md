President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Reuven Rivlin of
Israel to honor President Rivlin as he approaches the conclusion of his
term and to demonstrate the enduring strength of the U.S.-Israel
partnership.  President Biden conveyed his unwavering support for
Israel’s security and his commitment to deepening the cooperation
between the two countries across all fields.  The leaders discussed the
many challenges facing the region, including the threat posed by Iran. 
The President emphasized that under his administration, Iran will never
get a nuclear weapon.  He also assured President Rivlin that the United
States remains determined to counter Iran’s malign activity and support
for terrorist proxies, which have destabilizing consequences for the
region.  
  
The leaders also consulted on opportunities to enhance peace and
stability in the Middle East and beyond.  In that regard, the President
expressed his strong support for the normalization of relations between
Israel and other countries in the Arab and Muslim world.    
  
The leaders also discussed recent developments in Gaza and the West Bank
and the President emphasized the importance of Israel taking steps to
ensure calm, stability, and to support greater economic opportunities
for the Palestinian people.  President Biden affirmed his view that a
negotiated two-state solution remains the best avenue to achieving a
lasting peace.  The leaders discussed the importance of enhancing
efforts to strengthen moderate voices and promote the cause of
coexistence while weakening extremists who advocate for hatred and
violence.    
  
The President warmly extended an invitation for Prime Minister Naftali
Bennett to meet with him soon at the White House and reaffirmed that
this administration looks forward to close collaboration with the new
Israeli government on the many important issues on the bilateral agenda.
