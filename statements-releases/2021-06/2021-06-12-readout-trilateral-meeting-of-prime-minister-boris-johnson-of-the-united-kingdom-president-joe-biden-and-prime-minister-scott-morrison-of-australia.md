Prime Minster Johnson, President Biden and Prime Minister Morrison met
in the margins of the G7 summit in Carbis Bay on 12 June 2021. They
discussed a number of issues of mutual concern, including the
Indo-Pacific region. They agreed that the strategic context in the
Indo-Pacific was changing and that there was a strong rationale for
