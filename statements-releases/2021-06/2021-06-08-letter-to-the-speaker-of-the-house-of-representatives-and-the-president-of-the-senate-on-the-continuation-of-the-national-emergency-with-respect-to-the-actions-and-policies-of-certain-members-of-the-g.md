Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions and
policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other
persons to undermine democratic processes or institutions of Belarus
that was declared in Executive Order 13405 of June 16, 2006, is to
continue in effect beyond June 16, 2021.  
  
The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus
and other persons to undermine Belarus’s democratic processes or
institutions, to commit human rights abuses related to political
repression, and to engage in public corruption continue to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is
necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13405 with respect to Belarus.

        Sincerely,  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
