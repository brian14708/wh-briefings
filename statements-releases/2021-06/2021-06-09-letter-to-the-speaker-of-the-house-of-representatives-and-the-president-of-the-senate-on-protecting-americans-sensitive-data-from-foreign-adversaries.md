Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq*.), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order
addressing the threat from certain connected software applications
designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by,
controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign
adversary, to include the People’s Republic of China, among others.  
  
I have determined that additional consideration must be given
in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13873
of May 15, 2019 (Securing the Information and Communications Technology
and Services Supply Chain), including the threat posed by certain
connected software applications designed, developed, manufactured, or
supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the
jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary.  
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

        Sincerely,  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
