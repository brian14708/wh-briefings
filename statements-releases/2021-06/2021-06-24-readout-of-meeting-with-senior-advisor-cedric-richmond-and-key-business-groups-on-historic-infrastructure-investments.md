Today, Senior Advisor and Director of the Office of Public Engagement
Cedric Richmond hosted a virtual roundtable with key business groups,
including those representing Black, LGBTQ+, Hispanic, AAPI, women and
small business leaders. Director Richmond discussed the historic
investments proposed in President Biden’s American Jobs Plan and updated
business leaders on the status of the negotiations with the bipartisan
group of Senators. He also reiterated the President’s commitment to not
raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year and thanked the
business leaders for their leadership and support.  
   
The business leaders spoke of the urgent need for investments in
infrastructure, including roads, bridges, ports, seaports and broadband.
They also emphasized their support for programs to help businesses
recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic and expanding federal
contracting opportunities for small businesses. The group discussed how
access to paid leave and child care resources will support their
employees and allow small businesses to better compete. The leaders
reiterated the need for additional capital investment in order to create
jobs and compete in the 21st century economy.  
   
Richmond also thanked participants for joining and said that he looks
forward to continued dialogue about how the Biden – Harris
Administration can continue its support for small businesses. This
meeting is part of Director Richmond’s outreach to small businesses. To
date, Richmond has organized nearly 150 meetings with the private sector
that were attended by over 95,000 people.
