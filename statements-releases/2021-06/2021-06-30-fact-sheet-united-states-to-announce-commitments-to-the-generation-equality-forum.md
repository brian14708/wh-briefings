title: "Fact Sheet: United\_States to Announce Commitments to the Generation Equality\_\
  Forum"
---
 
*Today, the United States joined global partners – including
governments, civil society, and the private sector – in making
commitments to the Generation Equality Forum, reasserting U.S.
leadership on gender equity and equality on the world stage.*

The Generation Equality Forum (GEF), convened by UN Women and co-hosted
by the governments of France and Mexico, marks the anniversary of the
United Nation’s Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing over 25
years ago, where the world recognized that “women’s rights are human
rights” and adopted an ambitious Platform for Action to achieve equality
and opportunity for women around the world.  While tremendous progress
has been made since the Beijing Conference, serious gaps remain, which
have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Generation Equality
Forum offers an opportunity to make bold, measurable commitments to
build back better and accelerate progress towards the Beijing Platform
and the Sustainable Development Goals.

The U.S. commitments reflect the Biden-Harris Administration’s domestic
and global priorities, including policy and resource commitments to:

-   Prevent and respond to all forms of gender-based violence;
-   Strengthen women’s economic security; and
-   Protect and advance sexual and reproductive health and rights.

Our participation in the Generation Equality Forum is an important part
of broader U.S. efforts to advance gender equity and equality, including
in areas beyond the scope of commitments announced today, such as
climate, science and technology, leadership and democracy, and
education. This includes efforts underway to support the [Build Back
Better
World](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-g7-leaders-launch-build-back-better-world-b3w-partnership/) Partnership
to meet the tremendous infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income
countries, particularly across the areas of gender equity and equality,
climate, health and health security, and information and communications
technology. Finally, as part of Generation Equality, we have also signed
on to the Compact on Women, Peace, and Security and Humanitarian Action
and will continue our robust implementation of the U.S. Women, Peace,
and Security Act, which strengthens our efforts to prevent, mitigate,
and resolve conflict by improving the participation of women in peace
and security processes.  
  
Our Generation Equality Forum commitments include:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">**Prevent and Respond to
Gender-Based Violence**</span>  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">  
</span>Preventing and responding to gender-based violence is a
significant pillar of the Biden-Harris Administration’s work on gender
equity and equality. The “shadow pandemic” of alarming increases in
rates of gender-based violence in the U.S. and globally underscore the
urgency of our collective efforts.

***Domestic efforts to combat gender-based violence***

-   Create the first U.S. National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence,
    led by the White House Gender Policy Council, to be launched in
    2022.  This plan will establish a whole-of-government approach to
    preventing and addressing gender-based violence (GBV) domestically
    and globally, with significant input from civil society.  
     
-   Provide $450 million in supplementary funding through the
    President’s [American Rescue
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/American-Rescue-Plan-Fact-Sheet.pdf) to
    prevent and respond to domestic violence and sexual assault. This
    includes $200 million for domestic violence services and support;
    $198 million for sexual assault services programs; and $49.5 million
    for a new program to fund culturally specific community-based
    organizations to improve access to services and safety for survivors
    in historically marginalized communities, with a primary focus on
    racial and ethnic minority communities.  
     
-   Reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA),
    which passed the U. S. House of Representatives this spring with
    bipartisan support and is pending in the U.S. Senate.  First passed
    in 1994 with then-Senator Biden as its champion, the VAWA is a
    landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that has transformed the
    nation’s response to gender-based violence, bringing critically
    needed resources to States, Territories, Tribes, and local
    communities to help prevent and improve the response to domestic
    violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.  
     
-   Request, as part of the FY 2022 President’s Budget, an historic
    investment of $1 billion to support VAWA programs coordinated
    through the U.S. Department of Justice—a 95% increase over FY 2021
    enacted levels.  Also request $463.5 million to be administered
    through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including
    $250 million to provide cash assistance to survivors of domestic
    violence to support their short and long-term transition to safety
    and stability.  
     
-   Improve prevention and response to sexual assault and harassment in
    the U.S. military, including by establishing an Independent Review
    Commission (IRC) on Military Sexual Assault, which conducted a
    thorough review and recently made significant recommendations on
    accountability, prevention, climate and culture, and victim support
    to the U.S. Secretary of Defense and the President.  
     
-   Strengthen the U.S. National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons
    to integrate the administration’s commitments to gender and racial
    equity.  
     
-   Propose “safe leave” as part of the [American Families
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/),
    a comprehensive paid family and medical leave program that would
    permit workers eligible to receive paid leave for reasons pertaining
    to sexual assault, stalking, dating or domestic violence.

***International efforts to combat gender-based violence***

-   Update and strengthen the 2016 U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond
    to Gender-Based Violence Globally, in coordination with the
    development of the first-ever U.S. National Action Plan to End
    Gender-Based Violence.  
     
-   Request, as part of the FY 2022 President’s Budget, $175 million to
    prevent and respond to gender-based violence globally, as part of a
    $1.2 billion request for gender programming abroad.  
     
-   Host the Fourth Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against
    Indigenous Women and Girls with the Governments of Mexico and
    Canada. The Biden-Harris Administration will relaunch this regional
    collaboration, which presents an opportunity to continue to improve
    and reaffirm our respective national and regional commitments to
    exchanging information about policies, programs and promising
    practices to prevent and respond to violence against Indigenous
    women and girls through increased access to justice and services,
    with a human rights and culturally-responsive approach.  
     
-   Double the annual investment by the President’s Emergency Plan for
    AIDS Relief in DREAMS–Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free,
    Mentored, Safe Partnership–which supports programs focused on
    economic strengthening, gender-based violence prevention, post-GBV
    care, and sexual and reproductive health services in Haiti and 14
    African countries. The U.S. government will seek to continue this
    increased level of support during FY2022, pending Congressional
    notification and approval.  
     
-   Announce U.S. commitments to the Call to Action on Protection from
    Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies 2021-2025 Road Map. The U.S.
    will strengthen its leadership role in addressing GBV within the
    humanitarian system to ensure this issue is prioritized and
    resourced from the outset of emergencies. Through the joint
    State/USAID Safe from the Start initiative, the U.S. will implement
    Call to Action commitments that seek to strengthen the quality of
    GBV programming, support improved GBV risk mitigation efforts, and
    improve resource tracking and accountability for GBV programming as
    part of humanitarian assistance.  
     
-   Co-sponsor a resolution on “Ending violence against children through
    health systems strengthening and multisectoral approaches” during
    the 2021 World Health Assembly, which was passed by consensus. This
    resolution prioritizes WHO Member State actions on child protection,
    to prevent and address early, child, and forced marriage, child
    trafficking, exploitation and abuse of children and other actions
    that threaten the emotional, mental, and physical health of
    children.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Advance Women’s Economic
Security and Promote Economic Justice </span>**

The Biden Administration has taken critical steps to strengthen women’s
economic security through the [American Rescue
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/American-Rescue-Plan-Fact-Sheet.pdf) and
has proposed once-in-a-generation investments as part of the American
Jobs Plan and American Families Plan. The Administration is also
committed to advancing women’s economic opportunity and security around
the world.

***Domestic efforts to strengthen women’s economic security***

-   Provide immediate relief for women and families through the American
    Rescue Plan (ARP), helping hard-hit households recover from the
    economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ARP expands the Child
    Tax Credit, allowing more families to benefit, increasing the size
    of the benefit, and distributing benefits monthly. And it includes a
    historic investment of more than $40 billion in child care and early
    learning. States, tribes, and territories can use these investments
    to help child care providers—who are disproportionately women of
    color—avoid potential closure and ensure that they can operate
    safely and increase pay and benefits for care workers, who are also
    disproportionately women of color. These funds can also be used to
    help parents better afford high-quality child care.

<!-- -->

-   Propose, as part of the American Jobs Plan, a major investment in
    care infrastructure, including a $400 billion investment in
    expanding access to home- or community-based care, expanding access
    to long-term care services under Medicaid, and additional
    investments to modernize schools and child care facilities.  
     
-   Strengthen the workforce pipeline for all, including more women and
    communities of color, to access in-demand jobs through the [American
    Jobs
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/),
    including by investing in apprenticeships and other workforce
    development programs like Women in Apprenticeship in Non-Traditional
    Occupations. This commitment includes ensuring jobs with fair and
    equal pay, safe and healthy workplaces, and workplaces free from
    racial, gender, and other forms of discrimination and harassment.  
     
-   Propose, through the American Families Plan (AFP), a $1 trillion
    commitment to working families, helping cover basic expenses that
    families need and care most about: making child care and higher
    education more affordable, lowering the cost of health care over the
    long term, and continuing to reduce child poverty and put money in
    parents’ pockets by extending the historic expansion of the Child
    Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan. This investment in working
    families also includes establishing a comprehensive national paid
    family and medical leave program.  
     
-   Work with Congress to pass key legislation for women’s employment in
    addition to the American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan,
    including the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed the U.S.
    House of Representatives this spring with bipartisan support. 

***International efforts to strengthen women’s economic security***

-   Mobilize at least $12 billion—an average $2.4 billion per year, from
    January 2021 through December 2025—as part of the U.S. International
    Development Finance Corporation’s new 2X commitment to invest in
    businesses that advance gender equity in emerging markets.  These
    funds will support 15 million women and girls, including from
    marginalized communities and fragile and post-conflict settings.  
     
-   Announce that the Development Finance Corporation will establish 2X
    Technical Assistance Pilot Program to help private sector clients
    advance gender equity in their businesses, such as by increasing the
    number of women in leadership or developing products or services
    designed specifically to meet the differentiated needs of their
    women clients.  
     
-   Establish the Gender Equity and Equality Action (GEEA) Fund—with
    $100 million in FY 2021 and a request of $200 million in the FY 2022
    President’s Budget—to advance economic security for women and girls
    globally, prevent and respond to gender-based violence, and support
    underserved and marginalized populations. In addition, the GEEA Fund
    will help address the disproportionate impact that COVID-19, climate
    change, and conflict and crisis have on women and girls.  
     
-   Promote women’s entrepreneurship around the world, including through
    grants to grassroots and community-led organizations through the
    Inter-American Foundation and grants to gender-inclusive digital
    services for women-owned businesses through the U.S.-African
    Development Foundation.  
     
-   Commit $33 million in FY 2020 funds to advance gender equity and
    equality in the Northern Triangle by increasing women’s economic
    access, agency, and power while reducing gender-based violence in
    the community, workplace, and household. In addition, commit $2.2
    million in FY 2020 funding to small grants for 15 local
    organizations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras that advance
    women’s economic participation through the Inter-American
    Foundation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">**Protect and Expand Sexual and
Reproductive Health and Rights**</span>  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">  
</span>The Biden Administration is committed to advancing sexual and
reproductive health and rights in the U.S. and around the world.
Everyone should have access to quality, affordable health care
regardless of their income or where they live.

***Domestic efforts to protect and expand sexual and reproductive health
and rights***

-   Remove, as part of the President’s first budget, the Hyde Amendment
    restriction from government spending bills, reflecting the
    President’s support for expanding access to health care, including
    reproductive health care, through Medicaid and other
    federally-funded programs.  
     
-   Review rules for Title X of the Public Health Services Act, which
    provides Federal funding for family planning services that primarily
    benefit low-income patients, to ensure access to family planning and
    other preventive health care. The Department of Health and Human
    Services published a notice of proposed rulemaking related to the
    Title X program entitled “Ensuring access to equitable, affordable,
    client-centered, quality family planning services.” This proposed
    rule revises the 2019 rules by readopting the 2000 regulations, with
    several modifications needed to strengthen the program and ensure
    access to equitable, affordable, client-centered, quality family
    planning services for all clients, especially for low-income
    clients.

<!-- -->

-   Direct $50 million in supplemental funding to the Title X Family
    Planning Program through the American Rescue Plan, in addition to
    a proposed $340 million to the Title X Program in the President’s
    discretionary budget request.  
     
-   Expand Medicaid postpartum coverage from 60 days to 12 months,
    ensuring that more new mothers can retain health coverage and stay
    healthy.
-   Propose, as part of the President’s FY 2022 discretionary budget
    request, $200 million to reduce maternal mortality rates and end
    race-based disparities, and as part of the American Families Plan, a
    $3 billion investment to further address the maternal health crisis
    in the United States, which has a particularly significant impact on
    Black and Indigenous women, by growing and diversifying the
    perinatal workforce, improving data collection to better understand
    the causes of maternal death and complications from birth, and
    investing in community-based organizations.

***International efforts to protect and expand sexual and reproductive
health and rights***

-   Issued a Presidential Memorandum on January 28, 2021 to protect and
    expand access to comprehensive reproductive health services and
    care, which rescinded the harmful Mexico City Policy, among other
    actions.  
     
-   Propose, as part of the President’s FY 2022 budget request, resuming
    funding for the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), including $56 million in
    the FY 2022 President’s Budget, a 72% increase over the FY 2021
    enacted level. Funding for UNFPA would directly support the
    provision of sexual and reproductive health services in fragile
    contexts, where access to such services is limited.  
     
-   Support the World Health Organization’s (WHO) strengthening of
    internal operations, including efforts to prevent and address sexual
    exploitation and abuse within their workforce and the broader health
    sector, and to bolster WHO’s capacity to deliver critical services
    and technical guidance, including in emergency contexts.  
     
-   Assess the current status of HRP (the UN Development Programme/UN
    Population Fund/UN Children’s Fund/WHO/World Bank Special Programme
    of Research, Development and Research Training in Human
    Reproduction) and how U.S. expertise can align to support its work.
    The HRP is the primary instrument within the United Nations system
    for research in human reproduction, and U.S. engagement will help
    advance critical research, including building research capacity of
    lower income countries.

<!-- -->

-   Commit publicly with like-minded countries to a series of
    progressive meetings on continuing and expanding essential sexual
    and reproductive health service delivery on the margins of WHA and
    WHO regional committees, the UN General Assembly, World Economic
    Forum, and World Bank fall meetings, among others.  
     
-   Commit to supporting women in the global health workforce and affirm
    U.S. support of the Gender Equal Healthcare Workforce Initiative and
    its pillars, which aims to minimize and address inequities and
    inequalities female health workers face globally. This includes
    harassment and violence, pay inequities, and lack of opportunities
    for professional training and advancement.
