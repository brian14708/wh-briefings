  \ Open Investment"

The Open Investment Policy of the United States is a pledge to treat all
investors fairly and equitably under the law. As Governors, CEOs, and
other public and private sector leaders come together at the 2021
SelectUSA Summit this week, I want to reiterate my administration’s
commitment to ensuring that the United States remains the most
attractive place in the world for businesses to invest and grow, thus
creating jobs here at home, strengthening supply chains across the
country, and deepening our relationships with allies and partners.  
  
America has the most productive workforce in the world. We have an
unmatched business environment strengthened by our culture of innovation
and entrepreneurship, outstanding educational institutions, and
commitment to transparency, protection of intellectual property,
flexible and efficient capital markets, and the rule of law. We believe
that our country – and our world – are safer, more resilient, and more
prosperous because of the investment of foreign-owned companies in the
United States.  
  
As we continue to advance our agenda to revitalize American
manufacturing, build an inclusive 21st century workforce, and maintain
our competitive edge, the United States welcomes foreign investment.
Today, U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies directly employ
almost 8 million Americans and help boost U.S. innovation by investing
$70 billion in research and development. They contribute to all sectors
of the U.S. economy and are responsible for nearly 24% of all U.S. goods
exports.  
  
We will always protect our national security, and certain foreign
investments will be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States for this purpose. But, we will also maintain a level
playing field. As the United States faces increasing competition for the
jobs and industries of the future, we will remain the destination of
choice for investors around the world.
