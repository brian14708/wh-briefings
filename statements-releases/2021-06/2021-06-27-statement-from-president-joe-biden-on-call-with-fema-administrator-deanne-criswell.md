title: Statement from President Joe Biden on Call with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell
---
 
I spoke this afternoon with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to hear
firsthand about her visit today to Surfside, FL and the scene of the
partial collapse of the Champlain Towers residential building. What I
heard from Administrator Criswell was excruciating: she reiterated that
words can’t describe the scene on the ground and she gave me an update
on meetings she had with state and local officials to ensure they have
everything they need.  
  
I am grateful for the heroic first responders, search and rescue teams,
and all FEMA, state, county, local, and volunteer personnel who are
working around the clock to try to save lives and for those who are
dedicated to helping survivors with many needs, including temporary
housing. We will continue to coordinate closely with officials on the
ground throughout this terrible ordeal and my administration is ready to
provide any support or assistance that is needed.   
  
This is an unimaginably difficult time for the families enduring this
tragedy. For those who are waiting in anguish for word of their loved
ones as search and rescue efforts continue in the aftermath of this
catastrophic incident, the pain of the uncertainty is an added,
heartbreaking burden. My heart goes out to every single person suffering
during this awful moment.
