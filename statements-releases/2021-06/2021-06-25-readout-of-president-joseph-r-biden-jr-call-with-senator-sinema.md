The President spoke to Senator Sinema today to thank her again for her
work on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Agreement. He reiterated his
strong support for the compromise agreement, and they discussed his plan
to try to build support for the Agreement among both Democrats and
Republicans. The President also reiterated that he would fight to pass
the Bipartisan Agreement, as he committed to the group. The President
reiterated strong support for both the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill
and a reconciliation bill containing the American Families Plan moving
forward on a two-track system, as he said yesterday when meeting the
press with the bipartisan group of ten Senators. These are two critical
priorities to the President that he wants to see advance through the
legislative process as quickly as possible, pass as quickly as possible,
and be presented to him for signing as quickly as possible. The
President looks forward to signing both these bills.
