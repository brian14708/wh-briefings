Vice President Kamala D. Harris spoke this morning to President Andres
Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, President Alejandro Giammattei of
Guatemala, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister
Keith Rowley, Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). In four
separate calls, the Vice President notified each of the leaders that the
Biden-Harris Administration will begin sharing the first 25 million
doses of COVID vaccines to their respective countries and others, as
part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s framework for sharing at least
80 million vaccines globally by the end of June.  
  
The Vice President reiterated that the Administration’s efforts are
focused on achieving broad global coverage, responding to surges and
other urgent situations and public health needs, and helping as many
countries as possible who requested vaccines. The four leaders thanked
the Vice President, and they agreed to continue working together to
address COVID-19 and advance our mutual interests around the world.
