title: "FACT SHEET: How the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration is Fighting Against\
  \ Attacks on Americans\u2019 Constitutional Right to\_Vote"
---
 
As the President said when recognizing the tragic injustice of the Tulsa
race massacre, the “sacred right \[to vote\] is under assault with an
incredible intensity,” in a manner that is “simply un-American” but
sadly, not unprecedented. And he called for a redoubling of efforts to
expand voting rights and overcome the surge in efforts to undermine the
right to vote of so many Americans through anti-voter laws that are
motivated by a dangerous lie – a lie that motivated the unprecedented
assault on our Capitol on January 6th, that cost the lives of brave law
enforcement officers, and that has been disproven by over 80 federal
judges appointed by Presidents of both parties and bipartisan election
official across the country.  
  
Plain and simple, these voter suppression laws are meant to attack
Americans’ constitutional rights — especially people of color — and that
is absolutely unacceptable to the President. He ran to restore the soul
of America, and to address the four principal crises facing our nation –
one of which is racial justice.

In office, the President has taken unprecedented action to advance
voting rights and defend this sacred right. And he recently named Vice
President Harris to take charge of a new, intensified campaign on this
issue, signifying its vital importance to this administration.

Voting rights have been at the core of his agenda for his entire time in
public life. In the Senate he was indispensable to expanding access to
the franchise, securing a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act –
when Strom Thurmond chaired the Judiciary Committee. And in the Senate,
Vice President Harris was a leader on voting rights legislation and
built a very strong record on the issue as Attorney General of
California.  

In addition to today’s major announcements by Attorney General Garland –
including that the Department of Justice will within 30 days double the
staff of its Civil Rights Division for protecting the right to vote —
here are the actions the administration has taken on voting rights since
taking office:

-   On the anniversary of the brutal attacks on civil rights protesters
    crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama in 1965, the
    President signed an historic executive order which took far-reaching
    actions to expand voting access and protect the freedom to vote
    using every executive authority available to make voting easier,
    more accessible, and fairer.  
-   This order directed federal agencies, in a whole-of-government
    effort, to expand access to voter registration and election
    information; put themselves in the best position to assist states
    under the National Voter Registration Act; improve and modernize
    Vote.gov; increase federal employees’ access to voting; analyze
    barriers to voting for people with disabilities; increase voting
    access for active duty military and other overseas voters; and
    establish a Native American voting rights steering group.  
-   The President also nominated and won hard-fought confirmation for
    some of the most qualified civil rights leaders to ever have senior
    posts at the Department of Justice, including Vanita Gupta as the
    first woman of color to serve as the Associate Attorney General and
    Kristen Clarke as the first Black woman to lead the DOJ’s Civil
    Rights Division. And the President is taking steps to ensure DOJ the
    resources needed to enforce existing laws.  
-   The President and Vice President are fighting for
    legislation<s>,</s>. That includes the For the People Act, which
    would set basic national standards for fair voting access in federal
    elections, and help ensure the ethical conduct of those elected to
    office.  And it includes the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement
    Act, which would stop racial discrimination in our elections before
    that discrimination has the chance to take effect.   
-   When he became the first president to travel to Tulsa to mark the
    history of the terrible massacre on Black Wall Street, he named Vice
    President Harris to lead a new, specific effort to fight for voting
    rights. Her strategy is to use the bully pulpit to build additional
    public support on top of the bipartisan majorities that already back
    our voting rights agenda. She’s using the power of the White House
    to convene key stakeholders, and will be hosting several next week.
    And she’ll continue to fight for our key bills.
