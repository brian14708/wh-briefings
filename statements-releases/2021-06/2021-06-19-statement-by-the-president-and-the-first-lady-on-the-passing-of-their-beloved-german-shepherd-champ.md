title: Statement by the President and the First Lady on the Passing of their Beloved
  German Shepherd, Champ
---
 
Our hearts are heavy today as we let you all know that our beloved
German Shepherd, Champ, passed away peacefully at home. He was our
constant, cherished companion during the last 13 years and was adored by
the entire Biden family. Even as Champ’s strength waned in his last
months, when we came into a room, he would immediately pull himself up,
his tail always wagging, and nuzzle us for an ear scratch or a belly
rub. Wherever we were, he wanted to be, and everything was instantly
better when he was next to us. He loved nothing more than curling up at
our feet in front of a fire at the end of the day, joining us as a
comforting presence in meetings, or sunning himself in the White House
garden. In his younger days, he was happiest chasing golf balls on the
front lawn of the Naval Observatory or racing to catch our grandchildren
as they ran around our backyard in Delaware. In our most joyful moments
and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to
our every unspoken feeling and emotion. We love our sweet, good boy and
will miss him always.
