title: 'FACT SHEET: President Biden to Announce National Month of Action to Mobilize
  an All-of-America Sprint to Get More People Vaccinated by July 4th'
---
 
*National Month of Action will mobilize national organizations, local
government leaders, community-based and faith-based partners,
businesses, employers, social media influencers, celebrities, athletes,
colleges, young people, and thousands of volunteers*

*The President will highlight additional efforts by businesses and
organizations across the country to advance equity and make it even
easier to get vaccinated*

*The Vice President will lead a National Vaccination Tour to encourage
vaccinations in key communities across the country*

Today, President Biden will announce a National Month of Action to
mobilize an all-of-America sprint to get 70% of U.S. adults at least one
shot by July 4<sup>th</sup>, so that more people can get the protection
they need to be safe from a pandemic that has taken the lives of nearly
600,000 Americans.

Throughout the month, national organizations, local government leaders,
community-based and faith-based partners, businesses, employers, social
media influencers, celebrities, athletes, colleges, young people, and
thousands of volunteers across the nation will work together to get
their communities vaccinated.

Today, the President will announce actions that will make it even easier
to get vaccinated, mobilize the country around vaccine outreach and
education efforts, and incentivize vaccination. Additionally,
organizations and businesses from across the country continue to step up
and respond to the President’s call to action.

Thanks to the President’s whole-of-government response, the U.S. has
made significant progress in its fight against the pandemic since the
President took office less than 5 months ago. Already, 63% of adult
Americans have gotten vaccinated, including 73% of Americans age 40 and
over, and COVID-19 cases and deaths have plummeted as a result – cases
are down over 90% and deaths are down over 85% since January
20<sup>th</sup>.

Twelve states have already given at least one shot to 70% of adults and
more than 28 states and D.C. have fully vaccinated 50% or more of their
adult populations, but millions of Americans still need protection
against the virus.  
  
**The National Month of Action will include the following
initiatives:**  
  
**MAKING IT EASIER TO GET VACCINATED AND ADVANCING EQUITY**

-   **Free child care for individuals getting vaccinated:** Four of the
    nation’s largest child care providers will offer free child care to
    all parents and caregivers getting vaccinated or recovering from
    vaccination from now until July 4<sup>th</sup>. KinderCare and
    Learning Care Group locations across the country will offer free,
    drop-in appointments to any parent or caregiver who needs support to
    get vaccinated or recover from vaccination, and more than 500 YMCAs
    in nearly every state will offer drop-in care during vaccination
    appointments. Bright Horizons will also provide free child care to
    support the vaccination of over 10 million workers employed at
    participating organizations. The vaccine is free for everyone,
    however, many unvaccinated Americans report concern about the
    potential ripple expenses of getting vaccinated, such as having to
    pay for child care.  
      
    The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is also issuing new
    guidance that encourages states to use child care funding from the
    American Rescue Plan to provide financial incentives to
    neighborhood- and home-based child care providers who join the
    President’s call to action and support their communities in getting
    vaccinated.

    to learn more.  
     
-   **Extended hours at pharmacies across the country in June to offer
    more flexible appointment availability: **Starting next week,
    thousands of pharmacies nationwide will stay open late every Friday
    in June, and offer services throughout the night to make sure
    Americans can get their shot. These extended hours will ensure that
    those with less flexible work hours have the opportunity to get
    vaccinated at times convenient to them. Participating pharmacy
    chains include Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid, and Walgreens.

**MOBILIZING THE COUNTRY TO DO MORE VACCINATION EDUCATION AND
OUTREACH:**

-   **Community Canvassing, Phone Banking, Text Banking, and Vaccination
    Events:** The Administration’s organizing efforts will focus on what
    we know works best to ensure everyone has equitable vaccine access:
    person-to-person action that connects people with key resources and
    information like Vaccines.gov, text 4-3-8-8-2-9, the National
    COVID-19 Vaccination Hotline (1-800-232-0233), and more. The Month
    of Action will include calls and texts to people in areas with low
    vaccination rates and canvasses in neighborhoods close to walk-in
    clinics where people can get vaccinated on the spot. More than 100
    organizations have already committed to host over 1,000 events the
    first weekend alone, with thousands of additional events to take
    place over the course of the month. The President will call on
    Americans to take at least five actions to help their communities
    during the Month of Action, and some volunteers may be invited to
    visit the White House in July. Americans can
    visit [WeCanDoThis.hhs.gov](http://wecandothis.hhs.gov/) to learn
    more and sign up to help their communities get vaccinated.  
     
-   **“We Can Do This” National Vaccination Tour:** The President will
    announce that the Vice President will lead a nation-wide tour to
    reach millions of Americans who still need protection against the
    virus, to highlight the ease of getting vaccinated, encourage
    vaccinations, and energize and mobilize grassroots vaccine education
    and outreach efforts. The Vice President’s travel will be anchored
    in the South, and the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and members
    of the Cabinet will also join the Administration’s tour to
    communities across the country. 
-   **Mayors Challenge to Increase Vaccination Rates in Cities Across
    America:** Mayors across the country are stepping up to help in this
    effort by launching the “Mayors Challenge,” a competition to see
    which city can grow its vaccination rate the most by July
    4<sup>th</sup>. Participating mayors commit to taking actions
    throughout the month to boost vaccinations, such as coordinated
    canvassing efforts, partnerships with local businesses, and
    incentives for local residents. The Administration has created a
    toolkit for mayors and local leaders, and will help recognize the
    winning cities later this year. More than 50 mayors of cities in
    Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky,
    Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana,
    Nevada, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, South
    Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin,
    and, as well as D.C., have already signed up the challenge, which is
    being run in collaboration with the [U.S. Conference of
    Mayors](http://www.usmayors.org/vaccination-challenge).  
     
-   **Shots at the Shop – A New Initiative to Engage Black-Owned
    Barbershops and Beauty Salons:** The President will announce the
    Administration is teaming up with the Black Coalition Against COVID,
    the University of Maryland Center for Health Equity, and
    SheaMoisture to launch “Shots at the Shop,” an initiative that will
    engage Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons across the country
    to support local vaccine education and outreach efforts. Throughout
    the month of June, each participating shop will engage customers
    with information about the vaccines, display educational materials,
    and host on-site vaccination events in partnership with local
    providers. The “Shots at the Shop” initiative will invite
    participation from across the country, with a particular focus on
    supporting shops in some of the hardest-hit localities still
    experiencing significant gaps in vaccination rates.  
     
-   **Blanketing Local TV and Radio and Social Media to Get Americans
    the Facts and Answer Their Questions:** The National Association of
    Broadcasters (NAB), representing more than 7,000 TV and radio
    stations across the country, will have local station members
    participate in the National Month of Action. NAB members will be
    airing vaccine education segments in their programming featuring
    trusted voices from the community, as well as medical professionals
    from leading medical associations across the country, including the
    American Medical Association, American Academy of Family Physicians,
    American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians,
    American Hospital Association, American Association of Nurse
    Practitioners, and Primary Care Collaborative. Medical experts will
    have the opportunity to share information on benefits of
    vaccination, address questions and concerns, and publicize where
    individuals in the community can get vaccinated. And, the
    Administration will continue deploying medical experts, public
    health leaders, and Cabinet officials through a whole-of-government
    approach to communicate directly with Americans, including by
    working with social media platforms and engaging celebrities and
    influencers to reach people where they are.  
     
-   **COVID-19 College Challenge:** The Administration is launching the
    COVID-19 College Challenge, where colleges and universities can take
    a pledge and commit to taking action to get their students and
    communities vaccinated by going
    to [WhiteHouse.gov/COVIDCollegeChallenge](http://www.whitehouse.gov/COVIDCollegeChallenge) and
    signing up. As part of the challenge, the Administration will
    provide resources like training sessions, toolkits, and educational
    material to assist colleges and universities in vaccination efforts;
    facilitate on-site vaccinations at schools; and launch a student
    corps within the COVID-19 Community Corps to recognize and activate
    students across the country who are taking extraordinary efforts to
    draw young people out to get vaccinated and engage the youth
    community. More than 200 colleges in 43 states have already taken
    the pledge and committed to the COVID-19 College Challenge. This
    challenge builds on the Administration’s work to facilitate
    partnerships between more than 60 community colleges and pharmacies
    in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program to provide pop-up vaccination
    clinics at high-enrollment community colleges between now and July
    4<sup>th</sup>.

**INCENTIVIZING VACCINATION**  
  
**Business Incentives for Vaccinated Americans:** Thousands of employers
and businesses have already stepped up to support vaccination efforts,
including by offering incentives for vaccinations and providing their
workers paid-leave for vaccinations. During the Month of Action, the
Administration will continue working with employers to make it even
easier to set up workplace vaccination clinics, and call on more
businesses to encourage and incentivize vaccinations.  
  
Starting today, Americans will be able to find a list of these and other
incentives
on [Vaccines.gov/incentives.html](http://www.vaccines.gov/incentives.html).
Examples of new private sector actions and incentives that recently
launched include:

-   **Anheuser-Busch** will give away free beer to all adults over the
    age of 21 in America on July 4<sup>th</sup> to celebrate the
    country’s progress against COVID.  
     
-   **CVS **launched a sweepstakes for vaccinated people to win free
    cruises, tickets to Super Bowl LVI, and cash prizes.  
     
-   **Door Dash** will give $2 million in gift cards to the National
    Association of Community Health Centers to incentivize
    vaccinations.  
     
-   **Major League Baseball **teams will offer on-site vaccinations at
    games and give free tickets to those who get vaccinated.  
     
-   **Microsoft** will give away thousands of Xboxes to Boys and Girls
    Clubs in hard-hit areas who will run promotions and educational
    seminars about the importance of vaccinations in hard-hit and
    hard-to-reach communities.  
     
-   **Kroger **launched a “Community Immunity” program to give $1
    million to a vaccinated person every week in June and give dozens of
    vaccinated Americans free groceries for a year.

    Mileage Plus members to win a year of free flights or a roundtrip
    for two in any class of service.
