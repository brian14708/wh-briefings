Following a bilateral meeting with Guatemalan President Giammattei, and
in light of the U.S. desire to partner with Guatemala to address the
economic, governance, and security conditions influencing out-migration,
Vice President Harris announces the following:  
   
**Anticorruption Task Force**

-   The Department of Justice, with support from the Department of
    State, will create an anticorruption task force that will include
    U.S. prosecutors and law enforcement experts to investigate and
    prosecute corruption cases with a nexus in the United States,
    Guatemala, and the region.  The task force will include three
    components:  1) increased focus of the global Kleptocracy Initiative
    to prosecute corruption cases and seize illicitly gained assets
    arising from corruption in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras 2)
    expand the number of Resident Legal Advisors to provide
    capacity-building, training, and case-based mentoring to the
    Guatemalan Public Ministry, including the Special Prosecutor Against
    Impunity (FECI), to build corruption cases, and 3) a rapid response
    capability to deploy U.S. prosecutors and law enforcement experts to
    provide mentorship to develop corruption cases.  

**Human Smuggling and Trafficking Task Force** 

-   The Department of Justice, with support from the Department of
    State, will create a regional task force to identify, disrupt, and
    prevent migrant smuggling and human trafficking operations.  The
    task force will work with U.S. law enforcement counterparts in the
    region to track migrant smuggling and human trafficking operations,
    share intelligence, and plan coordinated enforcement actions. 

**U.S.-Guatemala Young Women’s Empowerment Initiative**

-   USAID will provide up to $40 million over three years to launch the
    Young Women’s Empowerment Initiative that will focus on creating
    opportunities for young, primarily indigenous women, who face
    substantial gender gaps.  Activities will strengthen efforts to
    prevent and combat pervasive gender-based violence and trafficking
    in persons from areas of high out-migration while increasing access
    to justice, education and economic opportunities, and health and
    social services. 

**Increase Economic Opportunity ($48 million total)**

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Support Entrepreneurship
    and Development Innovation</span>.  USAID will provide up to $7.5
    million over three years, and leverage at least $22.5million from
    the private sector, to support entrepreneurs and innovators –
    including women, youth, and indigenous people – who are creating
    technology-driven, market-led solutions to development challenges in
    regions of high out-migration.  Support will be directed toward
    entrepreneurs and businesses that are working in multiple sectors,
    including renewable energy, climate resilience, health, water and
    sanitation, telemedicine, agriculture, fintech, and education. 
    Initial private sector partners include the Argidius Foundation,
    PriceSmart Foundation, IDC-Alterna, Pomona Impact, Ascenda, and
    Valhalla Capital which have committed to invest and grant over $10
    million in support of this initiative.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Investment to Support
    Affordable Housing in Guatemala</span>.  DFC will provide a $19.5
    million loan to *Destino Desarollos* (Destiny Developments) to help
    build approximately 1,800 homes and associated infrastructure in
    Guatemala’s secondary and tertiary cities of Quetzaltenango, Coban,
    and Fraijanes, which have high rates of out-migration.  This project
    will create safe and affordable family housing and support hundreds
    of local jobs within the community. 
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Investment to Support
    Agri-business in Guatemala</span>.  DFC will seek to invest $6
    million in a project with *Agro Atlantic* that will help expand a
    banana plantation.  The project will also help create hundreds of
    new jobs, including for women, in central Guatemala. 
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Investment to Support
    Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME)</span>.  DFC will seek
    to provide a $15 million loan portfolio guaranty facility to *Banco
    Internacional* to help increase lending to local micro, small, and
    medium businesses particularly to those businesses operating in the
    western highlands and other areas of Guatemala where there are high
    rates of out-migration.
