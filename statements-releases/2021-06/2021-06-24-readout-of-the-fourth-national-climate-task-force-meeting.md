*Biden Administration Mounts Whole-of-Government Response to Address
Extreme Heat Impacting Nearly Half of U.S. and Boosting Climate
Resilience*

Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the fourth
National Climate Task Force meeting where she was joined by Cabinet
members and senior leadership from 17 federal agencies. During the
meeting, Biden Administration officials discussed the
whole-of-government effort taking place to address historic and severe
climate impacts currently facing communities across the United States,
including record breaking heat waves, unprecedented drought and water
scarcity, and devastating wildfires. Task Force members discussed a
sobering summer outlook, identified near-term readiness plans in the
face of extreme weather risks, and laid out long-term resilience
measures that will help the nation fend off the worst impacts of climate
change.

Additionally, agency leadership shared the climate-related challenges
they are working to address:

-   **Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra** emphasized
    that record-breaking heat waves across the nation’s Western States
    pose a severe public health threat to tens of thousands of
    Americans, particularly in disadvantaged or vulnerable communities.
    The Center for Disease Control’s National Syndromic Surveillance
    Program data show that cases of heat related emergency room hospital
    visits increased from 857, in the first week of May, to 5313 in the
    week of June 13-19 – a six-fold increase.   
     
-   **Interior Secretary Deb Haaland** discussed how climate-related
    impacts are displacing certain coastal communities, especially
    tribal and indigenous communities, in regions already dramatically
    influenced by climate change.  More and more Alaska Native villages,
    for example, are experiencing increasingly dire impacts from climate
    change, including receding summer sea ice; storm-fueled coastal
    erosion; and thawing permafrost, which presents a risk to food
    security. President Biden’s American Jobs Plan includes a $2B
    investment for transition and relocation assistance to support
    community-led transitions in the most vulnerable communities.    
     
-   **Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack** spoke about ongoing efforts to
    combat wildfire and drought, including a focus on forest management
    and natural solutions. He emphasized the Agriculture Department’s
    focus on building resilience to these challenges through
    climate-smart agriculture and forestry management. This approach is
    mirrored in President Biden’s American Job’s Plan, which includes an
    investment of more than $50B in resilience in the face of a changing
    climate.  
     
-   **Housing and Urban Development Deputy Secretary Adrianne
    Todman** noted that our nation’s low-income families and communities
    of color are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate
    change due to historic disinvestment, aging infrastructure, and the
    legacy of residential segregation. For example, historically the
    nation’s public housing stock has not been built to withstand
    extreme temperatures, thereby exacerbating health risks and
    resulting in crippling energy costs for residents. To address this
    need, HUD’s FY22 budget request proposes $800 million in energy,
    resilience, and healthy retrofits for federally subsidized housing
    and housing in Native American communities.  
     
-   **White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda
    Mallory **noted that one of the most powerful and cost-effective
    strategies for combatting climate change and protecting communities
    from its impacts is through the conservation and restoration of
    natural lands and waters. Chair Mallory provided an update on the
    work that Federal agencies are doing through the Administration’s
    America the Beautiful initiative to support locally-led, voluntary
    stewardship efforts and to pursue the first-ever national
    conservation goal.

To ensure resilient federal operations and physical footprints, agencies
are preparing Climate Action Plans, per President Biden’s Executive
Order 14008. These plans parallel many of the nation’s climate related
vulnerabilities, including natural resources such as land and water
resources; financial risk — including risks to assets, supplies, and
services; and the health, safety, and availability of the Federal
workforce.

-   **Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment
    Stacy Cummings **emphasized that around the world, climate change is
    a destabilizing force, creating new missions and impacting the
    operational environment. At the same time, climate-related extreme
    weather can affect military readiness and drain resources. For these
    reasons, the Department of Defense focused their Climate Adaptation
    Plan on building resilience across the entire Department in
    alignment with warfighting requirements.  
     
-   **Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg** spoke about
    how the Department of Transportation is using their Climate Action
    Plan to explore a range of strategies that will guide decision
    making to make our transportation infrastructure more resilient.
    These strategies include building stronger or better by retrofitting
    existing infrastructure, adding network redundancy, relocating
    transportation assets to less vulnerable locations, and improving
    maintenance and operational strategies to respond to disruptions.

As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 executive order on tackling
the climate, the Task Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor
and includes Cabinet-level leaders from 21 federal agencies and senior
White House officials to mobilize the Biden-Harris Administration’s
implementation of a whole-of-government approach.
