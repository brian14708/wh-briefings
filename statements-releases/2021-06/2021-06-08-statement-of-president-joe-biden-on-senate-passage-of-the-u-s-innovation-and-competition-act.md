title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on Senate Passage of the U.S. Innovation\
  \ and Competition\_Act"

I applaud the United States Senate — led by the dedicated efforts of
Majority Leader Schumer and Senators Todd Young, Maria Cantwell, and
Roger Wicker — for coming together to pass the U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act.  This legislation addresses key elements that were
included in my American Jobs Plan, and I am encouraged by this
bipartisan effort to advance those elements separately through this
bill.  
  
It is long past time that we invest in American workers and American
innovation.  Along with the American Jobs Plan, the U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act would make generational investments in research and
development and advanced manufacturing to help us grow critical
industries and win the jobs of the future.  It will empower us to
discover, build, and enhance tomorrow’s most vital technologies — from
artificial intelligence, to computer chips, to the lithium batteries
used in smart devices and electric vehicles — right here in the United
States.  By strengthening our innovation infrastructure, we can lay the
foundation for the next generation of American jobs and American
leadership in manufacturing and technology.  
  
We are in a competition to win the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and the
starting gun has gone off.  As other countries continue to invest in
their own research and development, we cannot risk falling behind. 
America must maintain its position as the most innovative and productive
nation on Earth.  I look forward to working with the House of
Representatives on this important bipartisan legislation, and I look
forward to signing it into law as soon as possible.
