On behalf of the people of the United States, I extend my warm
congratulations to Isaac Herzog on his election to serve as the 11th
President of the State of Israel.  Throughout his career,
President-elect Herzog has demonstrated his unwavering commitment to
strengthening Israel’s security, advancing dialogue, and building
bridges across the global Jewish community.  I am confident that under
his presidency, the partnership between Israel and the United States
will continue to grow and deepen.

I also want to thank President Reuven Rivlin for his many years of
service to the people of Israel.  I look forward to welcoming President
Rivlin to Washington in the weeks ahead to honor his dedication to the
enduring partnership and the close friendship between our two nations.
