Q    How are you, sir?  
   
PRESIDENT MACRON:  How are you?    
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I’m well.  The sun is shining.  We’re almost on the
beach.  I’m well.  And I’m with the President of France; that makes me
even feel better.  (Laughs.)  
   
AIDE:  We’re on.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We’re on.  Okay.  We’re on.  Did you know that? 
(Laughter.)  Well, we’re — we’re just having a — we’ve had a good couple
days so far.  I’ve had a chance to spend some time with President
Macron, get to know him.  And we — we have some things we’ve got to talk
about a little bit later, but things are going, I think, well.  And
we’re — we’re, as we say in — back in the States, “We’re on the same
page.”  So, thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT MACRON:  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  We had
a — I want to thank you for our discussion yesterday and the working
sessions we had, indeed.   
   
We have to — to deal with this pandemic and the COVID-19.  We have to
face a lot of challenges, a lot of crisis — climate change.  And for all
these issues, what we need is cooperation.  And I think it’s great to
have the U.S. President part of the club and very willing to cooperate. 
And I think that what you — what you demonstrate is that leadership is
partnership. And — and we do appreciate it, and I think we can deliver
great things for that.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I think we can do a lot, too.  We — the United States,
I’ve said before — we’re back.  The U.S. is back.  We feel very, very
strongly about the cohesion of NATO.   
   
And I, for one, think that the European Union is an incredibly strong
and vibrant entity that has a lot to do with the ability of Western
Europe to not only handle its economic issues, but provide the backbone
and the support for NATO.   
   
And so I — we’re very supportive — very supportive.  
   
PRESIDENT MACRON:  Thank you.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.   
   
Q Mr. President, have you convinced allies that America is back?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Ask him.  
   
Q    Is America back?  
   
PRESIDENT MACRON:  Yeah.  Definitely.  
   
Q    Do you believe America is back?  
   
PRESIDENT MACRON:  Definitely.
