**100-Day Review Outlines Steps to Strengthen Critical Supply Chains  
**  
[**FINAL
REPORT**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf)

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing [key
findings](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf) from
the reviews directed under Executive Order (E.O.) 14017 “America’s
Supply Chains,” as well as immediate actions the Administration will
take to strengthen American supply chains to promote economic security,
national security, and good-paying, union jobs here at home.

On February 24, 2021, the President signed E.O. 14017, directing a
whole-of-government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. Stemming from
that effort, the Biden-Harris Administration has already begun to take
steps to address supply chain vulnerabilities:

-   The Administration’s COVID-19 Response Team has drastically expanded
    the manufacture of vaccines and other essential supplies, enabling
    more than 137 million Americans to get fully vaccinated.  
-   The Administration has also worked with companies that manufacture
    and use semiconductor chips to identify improvements in supply chain
    management practices that can strengthen the semiconductor supply
    chain over time.  
-   The Department of Defense (DOD) has announced an investment in the
    expansion of the largest rare earth element mining and processing
    company outside of China to provide the raw materials necessary to
    help combat the climate crisis. 
-   And the Biden-Harris Administration is working to address critical
    cyber vulnerabilities to U.S. supply chains and critical
    infrastructure, including issuing E.O. 14028 on “Improving the
    Nation’s Cyber Security” just last month. 

Today, building on these efforts, the Administration released findings
from the comprehensive 100-day supply chain assessments for four
critical products: semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging;
large capacity batteries, like those for electric vehicles; critical
minerals and materials; and pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical
ingredients (APIs). The Administration is taking immediate action to
address vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience with the launch of a
new effort aimed at addressing near-term supply chain disruptions. And,
pursuant to E.O. 14017, it is crafting strategies for six industrial
bases that underpin America’s economic and national security, which will
be completed within a year. The supply chain reviews reinforce the need
for the transformative investments proposed in the President’s American
Jobs Plan.  

These efforts are critical because, as the COVID-19 pandemic and
resulting economic crisis have shown, structural weaknesses in both
domestic and international supply chains threaten America’s economic and
national security. While amplified by the public health and economic
crisis, decades of underinvestment and public policy choices led to
fragile supply chains across a range of sectors and products. Unfair
trade practices by competitor nations and private sector and public
policy prioritization of low-cost labor, just-in-time production,
consolidation, and private sector focus on short-term returns over
long-term investment have hollowed out the U.S. industrial base,
siphoned innovation from the United States, and stifled wage and
productivity growth. 

At the same time, the reviews find that the United States is
well-positioned to maintain and strengthen our innovative leadership and
rebuild our productive capacity in key sectors and value-chains. Our
unparalleled university and research systems, skilled and diverse
workforce, ecosystem of entrepreneurs and small businesses, and position
as a global leader with strong relationships with allies and partners
are the building blocks to revitalizing domestic competitiveness and
strengthening supply chains. Working together, industry, labor, the
government, and other stakeholders can chart a new path forward that
emphasizes resilience and security, as well as broad-based growth and
tackling the climate crisis.

**<u>Taking Action to Address Vulnerabilities in Critical Product Supply
Chains</u>**  
  
The actions the Biden-Harris Administration announced today are the
first step in a whole-of-government effort to strengthen domestic
competitiveness and supply chain resilience. To address vulnerabilities
in the supply chains of the four critical products identified by E.O.
14017, the Biden-Harris Administration will immediately:

***Support domestic production of critical medicines***

-   The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under the Defense
    Production Act (DPA) and building on current public-private
    partnerships, will establish a public-private consortium for
    advanced manufacturing and onshoring of domestic essential medicines
    production. The consortium’s first task will be to select 50-100
    critical drugs, drawn from the Food and Drug Administration’s
    [essential medicines
    list](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/reports/executive-order-13944-list-essential-medicines-medical-countermeasures-and-critical-inputs),
    to be the focus of an enhanced onshoring effort.  
-   HHS will make an initial commitment of approximately $60 million
    from the Defense Production Act appropriation in the American Rescue
    Plan to develop novel platform technologies to increase domestic
    manufacturing capacity for API. Greater API production domestically
    will help reduce reliance on global supply chains for medications
    that are in shortage, particularly during times of increased public
    health need.

***Secure an end-to-end domestic supply chain for advanced batteries***

-   The Department of Energy (DOE) will release a National Blueprint for
    Lithium Batteries. This Blueprint will codify the findings of the
    battery supply chain review in a 10-year, whole-of-government plan
    to urgently develop a domestic lithium battery supply chain that
    combats the climate crisis by creating good-paying clean energy jobs
    across America. Later this month, the Department of Energy will host
    a Battery Roundtable, including representatives from each segment of
    the battery supply chain, to discuss the Blueprint.  
-   DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) will immediately leverage the
    approximately $17 billion in loan authority in the Advanced
    Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) to support the
    domestic battery supply chain. LPO will leverage full statutory
    authority to finance key strategic areas of development and fill
    deficits in the domestic supply chain capacity. This will include
    the ATVM program making loans to manufacturers of advanced
    technology vehicle battery cells and packs for re-equipping,
    expanding or establishing such manufacturing facilities in the
    United States.  
-   DOE’s Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) will launch a new
    effort to support deployment of energy storage projects by federal
    agencies. It will begin with a federal government-wide energy
    storage review that will evaluate the current opportunity for
    deploying battery storage at federal sites. FEMP will also launch a
    call for projects from federal sites interested in deploying energy
    storage projects, and provide the necessary technical assistance to
    get those projects built. These actions build on steps taken earlier
    this year to leverage $13 million in FEMP’s Assisting Federal
    Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies grants to unlock an
    estimated $260 million or more in project investments, including
    battery storage projects.

***Invest in sustainable domestic and international production and
processing of critical minerals***

-   The Department of Interior (DOI), with the support of the White
    House Office of Science and Technology Policy, will establish a
    working group composed of agencies such as the Department of
    Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
    identify sites where critical minerals could be produced and
    processed in the United States while adhering to the highest
    environmental, labor, and sustainability standards. This working
    group will collaborate with the private sector, states, Tribal
    Nations, and stakeholders—including representatives of labor,
    impacted communities, and environmental justice leaders—to expand
    sustainable, responsible critical minerals production and processing
    in the United States.  
-   The Administration will establish an interagency team composed of
    staff from agencies including DOI, USDA, EPA, and others with
    expertise in mine permitting and environmental law. This team will
    identify gaps in statutes and regulations that may need to be
    updated by Congress to ensure: new production meets strong standards
    before mining begins, during the mining process, and after mining
    ends; meaningful community engagement and consultation with Tribal
    Nations, respecting the government-to-government relationship at all
    stages of the mining process; and opportunities to reduce time,
    cost, and risk of permitting without compromising strong
    environmental and consultation benchmarks are fully explored.   
-   DOD will deploy DPA Title III incentives—including grants, loans,
    loan guarantees, and offtake agreements—to support
    sustainably-produced strategic and critical materials, including
    scaling proven research and development (R&D) concepts and emerging
    technologies from other programs such as the Small Business
    Innovation Research awardees.  
-   The DOE LPO, through its Title 17 Renewable Energy and Efficiency
    Energy Projects solicitation, has more than $3 billion in loan
    guarantees available to support efficient end-use energy
    technologies, such as mining, extraction, processing, recovery, or
    recycling technologies, of critical materials projects that satisfy
    Title 17 requirements.  
-   The U.S. Development Finance Corporation will expand international
    investments in projects that will increase production capacity for
    critical products, including critical minerals and other products
    identified pursuant to the E.O. 14017 process, ensuring that
    investments that support supply chain resilience and uphold
    international standards of environmental and social performance.

***Partner with industry, allies, and partners to address semiconductor
shortages***

-   Through strategic engagement with industry, the Department of
    Commerce (DOC) has supported nearly $75 billion in direct
    investments from the private sector in domestic semiconductor
    manufacturing and R&D. DOC will bolster its partnership with
    industry to facilitate information flow between semiconductor
    producers and suppliers and end-users. Leveraging the Department’s
    convening power, including through its advisory committees, DOC will
    bring stakeholders together to promote improved transparency and
    data sharing.  
-   Building on the success of recent engagements with Japan and the
    Republic of Korea, including the announcement of more than $17
    billion in U.S. semiconductor investments by leading companies in
    ROK, the Administration will strengthen engagement with allies and
    partners to promote fair semiconductor chip allocations, increase
    production, and promote increased investment.

**<u>Building Fair and Sustainable Industrial Bases</u>**  
In addition to the immediate actions taken in the supply chains of the
critical products identified in E.O. 14017, the Administration is also
announcing a series of actions to be taken across the Federal government
to support supply chain resilience, workforce development, production
and innovation, and strong sustainability and labor standards at home
and abroad.

The Administration will:

***Support American workers and innovation***

-   The Department of Labor (DOL) will announce later this month more
    than $100 million in grants to support state-led apprenticeship
    expansion efforts as well as establish national Registered
    Apprenticeship Technical Assistance Centers of Excellence. The
    Apprenticeship Occupations and Standards Center of Excellence will
    provide support and technical assistance to employers and industry
    to build out model registered apprenticeship programs in critical
    supply chains.  
-   DOE will announce a new policy to ensure that all innovations that
    are developed with taxpayer dollars through DOE’s Science and Energy
    Programs require awardees to substantially manufacture those
    products in the United States, creating good-paying domestic jobs.
    This change will cover more than $8 billion in clean energy and
    climate innovation funding requested in the President’s Budget for
    Fiscal Year 2022, as well as future fiscal year spending. DOE will
    implement these actions through a Determination of Exceptional
    Circumstances under the Bayh-Dole Act. Additionally, the
    Administration will establish an interagency working group to
    identify best practices to develop and implement further
    improvements across the
    government.                                                   
               

***Invest in sustainable supply chains at home and abroad***

-   The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in connection with the
    implementation of Executive Order 14005, “Ensuring the Future is
    Made in America with All of America’s Workers,” plans to issue a
    proposed rule to develop a new process for preferencing critical
    products that are in manufactured products or component parts, under
    the Buy American Act. This will leverage the buying power of the
    nearly $600 billion in federal contracting to strengthen domestic
    supply chains for critical products.   
-   USDA will commit more than $4 billion in a new, robust suite of
    Build Back Better initiatives focused on rebuilding the U.S. food
    system and strengthening and diversifying supply chains for food
    production, food processing, food distribution and aggregation, and
    markets and consumers. Build Back Better efforts by USDA will seek
    to provide improved access to nutritious food, address racial equity
    and justice as well as climate change, make markets fair and
    competitive, provide ongoing support for producers and workers, and
    create greater resilience in the food supply chain.  
-   The President will convene a global forum on supply chain resilience
    that will bring together key government officials and private sector
    stakeholders from across key U.S. allies and partners to
    collectively assess vulnerabilities, develop common approaches to
    supply chain challenges, and work to build strength through
    diversity and shared prosperity.

***Combat unfair trade practices***

-   The Administration will establish a trade strike force led by the
    U.S. Trade Representative to propose unilateral and multilateral
    enforcement actions against unfair foreign trade practices that have
    eroded critical supply chains. The trade strike force will also
    identify opportunities to use trade agreements to strengthen
    collective approaches to supply chain resilience with U.S. partners
    and allies.  
-   DOC will evaluate whether to initiate an investigation into
    neodymium magnets, which are critical inputs in motors and other
    devices, and are important to both defense and civilian industrial
    uses, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

**<u>Tackling Near-Term Supply Chain Disruptions As the Economy
Reopens  
</u>**  
The Administration’s historic vaccination and economic relief efforts
have spurred a rapid return of economic activity. As the United States
and the broader global economy emerge from the pandemic, we have seen
signs of new pressures on supply chains due to changes in demand. While
these short-term supply chain disruptions are temporary, the President
has directed his Administration to closely monitor these developments
and take actions to minimize the impacts on workers, consumers, and
businesses in order to bolster a strong economic recovery. To address
these challenges, the Administration will:

***Establish a whole-of-government effort to monitor and address
transitory supply chain challenges***

-   The Administration will establish new Supply Chain Disruptions Task
    Force to provide a whole-of-government response to address near-term
    supply chain challenges to the economic recovery. The Task Force
    will be led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and
    Agriculture and will focus on areas where a mismatch between supply
    and demand has been evident: homebuilding and construction,
    semiconductors, transportation, and agriculture and food. The Task
    Force will bring the full capacity of the federal government to
    address near-term supply/demand mismatches. It will convene
    stakeholders to diagnose problems and surface solutions—large and
    small, public or private—that could help alleviate bottlenecks and
    supply constraints.   
-   DOC will lead a coordinated effort to bring together data from
    across the federal government to improve the federal government’s
    ability to track supply and demand disruptions and facilitate
    information sharing between federal agencies and the private sector
    to more effectively identify near term risks and vulnerabilities.

**<u>Charting A New Course: Toward a Long-Term Strategy for
Strengthening U.S. Supply Chain Resilience  
</u>**  
President Biden believes this is the moment to reimagine and rebuild a
new American economy, not go back to the way things used to be. The
report delivered to the President offers six sets of recommendations
that, collectively, will not only strengthen the four prioritized supply
chains, but will rebuild the U.S. industrial base and restart our
innovation engine.

The supply chain reviews reinforce the need for the transformative
investments proposed in the President’s American Jobs Plan. The American
Jobs Plan will make a once-in-a-generation capital investment to create
millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild our country’s infrastructure, and
position the U.S. to compete globally in key industries. This agenda
aligns with and reinforces the Administration’s strategy outlined above
to invest in US supply chain resilience.  

*Key Recommendations Include:  
*  
***Rebuild America’s production and innovation capabilities.***
Long-term competitiveness will require an ecosystem of production,
innovation, skilled workers, and diverse small and medium-sized
suppliers. Those ecosystems are the infrastructure needed to spur
private sector investment in manufacturing and innovation. But that
infrastructure cannot be created or sustained without the support and
leadership of the federal government. Specific recommendations to
rebuild our industrial base for critical sectors include:

-   *Provide dedicated funding for semiconductor manufacturing and R&D:
    We recommend* Congress support at least $50 billion in investments
    to advance domestic manufacturing of critical semiconductors and
    promote semiconductor R&D.  
-   *Provide funding and financial incentives to spur consumer adoption
    of EVs and other EV incentives:* We recommend Congress authorize new
    and expanded incentives to spur consumer adoption of U.S.-made
    electric vehicles. In addition, we recommend Congress support $5
    billion in investments to electrify the federal fleet with U.S.-made
    EVs, and $15 billion in infrastructure investment to build out a
    national charging infrastructure to facilitate the adoptions of
    EVs.  
-   *Provide financing to support advanced battery production:* DOE
    should use existing authorities and funding to support U.S.
    manufacturing of advanced technology vehicle battery cells.  
-   *Establish a new Supply Chain Resilience Program:* We recommend
    Congress enact a Supply Chain Resilience Program at DOC to create a
    focal point within the government to monitor and address supply
    chain challenges. This program should be backed with $50 billion to
    make transformative investments in strengthening U.S. supply chains
    across a range of critical products.    
-   *Deploy the DPA to expand production capacity in critical
    industries:* A DPA Action Group should determine how best to
    leverage the authorities of the DPA to strengthen supply chain
    resilience, building off work done to respond to the COVID-19
    pandemic.  
-   *Invest in the development of next generation batteries:* Agencies
    should support technologies that will reduce the critical mineral
    requirements for next generation electric vehicle batteries and grid
    storage technologies, and that improve U.S. competitiveness in this
    critical sector.  
-   *Invest in the development of new pharmaceutical manufacturing
    processes:* Agencies should increase their funding of advanced
    manufacturing technologies to increase production of key
    pharmaceuticals and ingredients, including using both traditional
    manufacturing techniques and on-demand manufacturing capabilities
    for supportive care fluids, APIs, and finished dosage form drugs.  
-   *Work with industry and labor to create pathways to quality jobs,
    with a free and fair choice to join a union, through sector-based
    community college partnerships, apprenticeships and on-the-job
    training:* DOL’s Employment and Training Administration should
    support sector-based pathways to jobs, for example in the
    semiconductor industry.   
-   *Invest in small, medium and disadvantaged businesses in critical
    supply chains:* The Small Business Innovation Research and Small
    Business Technology Transfer competitive programs should support a
    diverse portfolio of small businesses to meet R&D needs, and
    increase commercialization.   
-   *Examine the ability of the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) to use
    existing authorities to support U.S. manufacturing of products:*
    EXIM should develop a proposal for Board consideration regarding
    whether EXIM should establish a new Domestic Financing Program that
    would provide financing to support the establishment and/or
    expansion of U.S. manufacturing facilities and infrastructure
    projects in the United States that would facilitate U.S. exports.

***Support the development of markets that invest in workers, value
sustainability, and drive quality.*** These reports identify key areas
where government could play a more active role in setting standards and
incentivizing high-road business practices. By establishing strong
domestic standards and advocating for the establishment of global
standards, the United States can support the private sector’s ability to
create and adopt sustainable and resilient practices.

-   *Create 21<sup>st</sup> century standards for the extraction and
    processing of critical minerals at home and abroad:* The government,
    working with private sector and non-governmental stakeholders,
    should encourage the development and adoption of comprehensive
    sustainability standards for essential minerals, such as lithium,
    cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and other materials.  
-   *Identify potential sustainable production and processing locations
    for critical minerals: * The United States’ non-fuel mineral
    resources are significantly under-mapped relative to those of other
    developed nations. Congress should fully resource programs like the
    U.S. Geological Survey’s Mineral Resources Program at DOI to develop
    a comprehensive map of domestic critical mineral resources and
    reserves.  
-   *Improve transparency throughout the pharmaceuticals supply chain:*
    HHS should develop and make recommendations to Congress on new
    authorities that would allow HHS to track production by facility,
    track API sourcing, and require that API and finished dosage form
    sources be identified on labeling for all pharmaceuticals sold in
    the United States. 

***Leverage the government’s role as a purchaser and investor in
critical goods.*** As a significant customer and investor, the Federal
Government has the capacity to shape the market for many critical
products. The public sector can deploy this power in times of crisis, as
in the case of Operation Warp Speed, or in normal times. The
Administration should leverage this role to strengthen supply chain
resilience and support national priorities.

-   *Reform and strengthen U.S. stockpiles*: The Administration and
    Congress should take actions to recapitalize and restore the
    National Defense Stockpile of critical minerals and materials. In
    the private sector, industries that have faced shortages of critical
    goods should evaluate mechanisms to strengthen corporate stockpiles
    of select critical products to ensure greater resilience in times of
    disruption.  
-   *Ensure that new automotive battery production in the United States
    adheres to high labor standards:* Tax credits, lending and grants
    offered to businesses to produce batteries domestically should
    ensure the creation of quality jobs with the free and fair choice to
    organize and bargain collectively for workers.

***Strengthen international trade rules, including trade enforcement
mechanisms.*** While fair competition from abroad is welcome, too often
unfair foreign subsidies and other trade practices have adversely
impacted U.S. manufacturing and more broadly, U.S. competitiveness. The
U.S. government must implement a comprehensive strategy to push back on
unfair foreign competition that erodes the resilience of U.S. critical
supply chains and industries.

-   *Develop a comprehensive trade strategy to support fair and
    resilient supply chains:* The Administration should develop a
    comprehensive trade strategy to support supply chain resilience and
    U.S. competitiveness. Supply chain resilience should be incorporated
    into the U.S. trade policy approach towards China, including in the
    ongoing review of U.S.-China trade policy. The Administration should
    also examine existing U.S. trade agreements to identify ways to
    strengthen collective supply chain resilience.

***Work with allies and partners to decrease vulnerabilities in the
global supply chains.*** The United States cannot address its supply
chain vulnerabilities alone. Even as the U.S. makes investments to
expand domestic production capacity for some critical products, we must
work with allies and partners to secure supplies of critical goods that
we will not make in sufficient quantities at home. We must work with
America’s allies and partners to strengthen our collective supply chain
resilience, while ensuring high standards for labor and environmental
practices are upheld. 

-   *Use diplomatic tools to encourage and facilitate resilient supply
    chains:* The U.S. should expand multilateral diplomatic engagement
    on supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly through groupings of
    like-minded allies such as the Quad and the G7.  
-   *Leverage financial tools to support sustainable and resilient
    international supply chains:* U.S. development and international
    finance tools offer a powerful avenue for working with allies and
    partners to strengthen supply chains for key products. The U.S.
    should explore initiatives and mechanisms for investing in projects
    to expand production in critical supply chains. Even as the U.S.
    expands the manufacture and mining of critical products
    domestically, it must take steps to ensure that the manufacturing
    and mining that takes place abroad supports supply chain resilience
    and meets high labor and environmental standards.

**<u>Key Findings from 100-Day Critical Product Supply Chain Reviews  
</u>**  
The reports being released today document a wide range of risks and
vulnerabilities to U.S. supply chains for critical products. Over the
course of the year, pursuant to E.O. 14017, the Departments of
Transportation, Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Defense,
Energy, and Health and Human Services, working with other Departments
and Agencies across the U.S. government, will develop comprehensive
strategies for revitalizing six industrial bases: defense, public health
and biological preparedness, information and communications technology,
energy, transportation, and agriculture and food production.  
  
Highlights of these risks and vulnerabilities identified by the 100-day
reports include:  
  
***Semiconductors***  
  
Semiconductors are essential to our national security, our economic
competitiveness, and to our daily lives. These tiny chips are vital to
virtually every sector of the economy—including energy, healthcare,
agriculture, consumer electronics, manufacturing, defense, and
transportation.  Semiconductors power our cell phones and dishwashers;
as well as our fighter jets and cybersecurity defenses. Once a global
leader in semiconductor production with robust public support, the
United States has outsourced and offshored too much semiconductor
manufacturing in recent decades. The United States has fallen from 37
percent of global semiconductor production to just 12 percent over the
last 20 years.  
  
The United States also lacks production capability at the most advanced
technology levels. For leading edge logic chips, the U.S. and U.S.
allies rely primarily on facilities in Taiwan, which produces 92 percent
of such chips. Our reliance on imported chips introduces new
vulnerabilities into the critical semiconductor supply chain. The United
States produces only six to nine percent of the more mature logic chips,
which are severely impacted by the current shortage. The loss of
production capacity threatens all segments of the semiconductor supply
chain as well as our long-term economic competitiveness.  
  
We must build resilient and competitive semiconductor supply chains for
the long-term. Our strategy must include taking defensive actions to
protect our technological advantages. But we must also proactively
invest in domestic production and R&D. We must develop an ecosystem that
includes growing our innovative small, medium, and disadvantaged
businesses, along with building a pipeline of skilled workers who can
benefit from well-paying semiconductor jobs.  Finally, we must engage
our partners and allies to promote global resilience.  
  
***Large capacity batteries***  
  
Advanced, high-capacity batteries play an integral role in 21st-century
technologies that are critical to the clean energy transition and
national security capabilities around the world—from electric vehicles,
to stationary energy storage, to defense applications. Demand for these
products is set to grow as supply chain constraints, geopolitical and
economic competition, and other vulnerabilities continue to increase.  
  
Today, America relies heavily on importing the inputs for fabricated
advanced battery packs from abroad, exposing the nation to supply chain
vulnerabilities that threaten to disrupt the availability and cost of
the critical technologies that rely on them and the workforce that
manufactures them. With the global lithium battery market expected to
grow by a factor of five to ten by 2030, it is imperative that the
United States invest immediately in scaling up a secure, diversified
supply chain for high-capacity batteries here at home that supports
good-paying, quality jobs with a free and fair choice to join a union
and bargain collectively. That means seizing a critical opportunity to
increase domestic battery manufacturing while investing to scale the
full lithium battery supply chain, including the sourcing and processing
of the critical minerals used in battery production all the way through
to end-of-life battery collection and recycling.  
  
***Critical minerals and materials***  
  
A range of critical minerals and materials are the building blocks of
the products we use every day. As demand for clean energy technology
increases over the short- and medium-term, an increased supply of
critical minerals and materials will be necessary to meet national and
global climate goals. China, using state-led, non-market interventions,
captured large portions of value chains in several critical minerals and
materials necessary for national and economic security. China accounts
for an outsized share of the world’s refining capacity, meaning that
even if the United States were to diversify our sources of critical
minerals or increase domestic extraction, we would still be reliant on
China for processing before use in end-product manufacturing.  
  
To secure a reliable, sustainable supply of critical minerals and
materials, the United States must work with allies and partners to
diversify supply chains away from adversarial nations and sources with
unacceptable environmental and labor standards. U.S. investments abroad
must incentivize environmentally and socially responsible production.
The United States must also invest in sustainable production, refining,
and recycling capacity domestically, while ensuring strong
environmental, environmental justice, and labor standards and meaningful
community consultation, including with Tribal Nations through
government-to-government collaboration.

***Pharmaceuticals and APIs***  
  
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of a resilient
U.S. healthcare manufacturing sector. Private sector innovation and
robust federal investment allowed the U.S. to rapidly develop and
strengthen COVID-19 supply chains. But the United States remains
critically dependent on imports for a range of key pharmaceutical
products and APIs—the primary ingredients of generic drugs—which
represent 90 percent of all prescription medications filled. About 87
percent of API facilities for generic drugs are located overseas which
has left U.S. supply chains of essential medicines vulnerable.  
  
China and India are estimated to control substantial parts of the supply
chain where there have been issues with shortages due to a range of
disruptions that have impacted supply as well as quality and safety. The

hollowing out of domestic production. A new approach is needed to ensure
more resilient supply chains that includes improving transparency,
building emergency capacity, and investing in domestic production.
