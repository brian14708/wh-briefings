title: Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on Agreement with the European
  Union on Boeing-Airbus
---
 
Today, the United States and the European Union made a major
breakthrough in the Boeing-Airbus trade dispute, which has lasted more
than 16 years. Both the U.S. and EU agreed to suspend our tariffs for
five years, and we committed to ensuring a level playing field for our
companies and our workers. Significantly, we also agreed to work
together to challenge and counter China’s non-market practices in this
sector that give China’s companies an unfair advantage. The U.S. and EU
will work together in specific ways that reflect our high standards,
including collaborating on inward and outbound investment and technology
transfer. It’s a model we can build on for other challenges posed by
China’s economic model.  
  
This week, at the G7, at NATO, in my meeting with the leaders of the
European Union, and in all my bilateral meetings with world leaders,
I’ve been making the case that the U.S. and Europe—and democracies
everywhere—are stronger when we work together to advance our shared
values like fair competition and transparency. Today’s announcement
demonstrates exactly how that can work in practice.
