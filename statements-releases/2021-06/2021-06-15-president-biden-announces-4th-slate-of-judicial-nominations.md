title: "President\_Biden Announces Fourth Slate of Judicial\_Nominations"
---
 
As he continues to move at an historic pace with respect to judicial
nominees, the President is announcing five new candidates for the
federal bench and two new candidates for District of Columbia courts,
all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to
the rule of law and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.  
  
For example, this slate includes:

-   A nationally-recognized leader on voting rights who would be the
    only Latina serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
    Circuit
-   A former public defender and current civil rights plaintiff’s
    attorney who would be the second African American woman judge
    actively serving on the District Court for the District of Columbia
-   A federal prosecutor who would be the first judge of South Asian
    descent to serve on the District Court for the District of
    Connecticut
-   A Department of Justice lawyer with two decades of civil rights
    experience, including as Deputy Chief of the Appellate Section in
    the Civil Rights Division
-   A magistrate judge on the D.C. Superior Court with deep experience
    in domestic violence and family law issues

This is President Biden’s fourth round of names for federal judicial
positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to
24.  
  
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move at an unparalleled speed with
respect to judicial nominations. His first judicial nominations
announcement was made faster than that of any new President in modern
American history, and today’s announcement continues that trend.
