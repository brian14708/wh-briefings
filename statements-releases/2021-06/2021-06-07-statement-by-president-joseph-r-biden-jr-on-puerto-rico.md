title: Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on Puerto Rico
---
 
Today, the Department of Justice will file a brief in the Supreme Court
in the case *United States v. Vaello-Madero*, which addresses whether a
provision in the Social Security Act that declines to provide Puerto
Rico residents with Supplemental Security Income (SSI) violates the
Constitution’s equal protection principle.  
  
This provision is inconsistent with my Administration’s policies and
values. However, the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice
of defending the constitutionality of federal statutes, regardless of
policy preferences. This practice is critical to the Department’s
mission of preserving the rule of law. Consistent with this important
practice, the Department is defending the constitutionality of the
Social Security Act provision in this case.  
  
As I have stated, I believe that Puerto Rico residents should be able to
receive SSI benefits, just like their fellow Americans in all 50 states
and Washington D.C. I call on Congress to amend the Social Security Act
to extend these benefits to residents of Puerto Rico. And as I
reiterated in my first budget request, I also support eliminating
Medicaid funding caps for Puerto Rico and moving toward parity for the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to align with States. These
steps, along with the American Rescue Plan, which included an enhanced
Child Tax Credit for families and a permanent federal match expansion to
the Earned Income Tax Credit program, will provide families in Puerto
Rico an equal chance to get ahead. As I’ve said before, there can be no
second-class citizens in the United States of America. My Administration
will work with members of Congress to make these legislative fixes a
reality.
