title: "Statement from Brian Deese on Unemployment Insurance\_Claims"

As President Biden travels overseas to engage with global counterparts,
recent economic data reinforce that U.S. fiscal policy and vaccination
progress are positioning the economy for growth and job creation. Today
we learned that, since January, the four-week moving average for state
unemployment insurance claims have fallen by more than 50% — from more
than 834,000 to 402,500. That’s the lowest level since the pandemic
began.  This news comes as independent analysts project that economic
growth in the United States will outpace growth for our peer nations and
reach the fastest pace in nearly four decades.  Earlier this week, the
World Bank increased their projection for U.S. economic growth this year
by 3.3% to 6.8%. The 3.3% upward revision in the United States compares
to a 2.1% revision in other advanced economies.  Another analysis last
week found that the United States is the only major industrialized
nation to have its growth projection through 2025 revised upward. These
data underscore the leading role the U.S. is playing in building towards
a global recovery.
