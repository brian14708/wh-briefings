President Biden looks forward to welcoming Israeli President Reuven
Rivlin to the White House on June 28, 2021.  President Rivlin’s visit
will highlight the enduring partnership between the United States and
Israel and the deep ties between our governments and our people.  It
will be an opportunity to consult about the many challenges and
opportunities facing the region.  As President Rivlin approaches the end
of his term, this visit will honor the dedication he has shown to
strengthening the friendship between the two countries over the course
of many years.
