The President has spoken to a number of members of the House and Senate
the past two days.

He informed Senator Capito today that the latest offer from her group
did not, in his view, meet the essential needs of our country to restore
our roads and bridges, prepare us for our clean energy future, and
create jobs. He offered his gratitude to her for her efforts and good
faith conversations, but expressed his disappointment that, while he was
willing to reduce his plan by more than $1 trillion, the Republican
group had increased their proposed new investments by only $150 billion.

The President also spoke with Senators Sinema, Cassidy, and Manchin
today. He urged them to continue their work with other Democrats and
Republicans to develop a bipartisan proposal that he hopes will be more
responsive to the country’s pressing infrastructure needs. The President
said that he would be in contact with members of the group by phone
while in Europe, and he designated his Jobs Cabinet and White House
aides Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, and Brian Deese to meet with them
in person to advance this effort.

From Day One, the President has been clear that he has two red lines: he
will not raise taxes on Americans who make under $400,000 and he will
not accept inaction as the outcome. To ensure that the American Jobs
Plan moves forward on a timely basis, the President spoke with Speaker
Pelosi to consult with her on efforts to move forward on a jobs package
in the House this month. In the same regard, the President also spoke
with Senate Majority Leader Schumer to discuss the need to commence work
on the budget resolution process so that legislation to advance the
President’s economic priorities and tax reform plans could move to the
Senate floor in July. The President is committed to moving his economic
legislation through Congress this summer, and is pursuing multiple paths
to get this done.
