title: "Action the Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Has Taken to Address the Border\
  \ Challenge"
---
 
The Biden-Harris administration is working to rebuild our immigration
system after four years of chaos and mismanagement. The trend of border
apprehensions in
[May](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-announces-may-2021-operational-update)
is a reduction of individuals (unique encounters) and families below the
peak in 2019. Border numbers fluctuate, however, based on annual
migration trends and that is why this administration is working to
establish lawful pathways for individuals to migrate or seek protection,
address the root causes of migration, restore fair, orderly and humane
means to apply for asylum and deter irregular migration. The
administration has made significant progress at establishing a
well-managed and secure border while also treating people fairly and
humanely.  The American people support this approach.

-   **Improved Processing of Unaccompanied Children **
    -   The administration successfully reduced the number of
        unaccompanied children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection
        (CBP) facilities **from 5,676 in late March to 570** on June
        14**.**
    -   The administration reduced the average amount of time children
        are in CBP facilities to **26 hours, compared with 131 hours on
        April 1<sup>st</sup>.**
    -   The administration has reduced the number of unaccompanied
        children in the care of the Department of Health and Human
        Services (HHS) to **under 16,000 from over 22,000 in late
        April.**  
-   **Removed Barriers to Unifying Children with Parents and Sponsors**
    -   HHS has surged case management resources to **dramatically
        increase the rates by which children are united with their
        sponsors**.
    -   DHS and HHS **rescinded an agreement from the former
        administration** that subjected undocumented parents to
        immigration enforcement when they came forward to claim their
        child.
    -   HHS **expanded access to fingerprinting sites** to conduct
        background checks on sponsors that has resulted in reduced
        backlogs and long-distance travel for sponsors.
    -   With support from the United States Digital Service, HHS
        implemented **the UC Bed Census** that assists facilities and
        licensed providers with **reporting bed capacity data, thereby
        improving bed count accuracy and data collection**.  
-   **Put in Place Orderly Processes and Protocols at the Border**
    -   Through support and coordination with the Government of Mexico,
        the Department of State (State), and international organization
        partners, DHS has successfully processed over **11,900 eligible
        people who had been returned to Mexico under the Migrant
        Protection Protocols (MPP)** to reenter the United States to
        pursue their active U.S. immigration cases in a safe and orderly
        manner.
    -   DHS has developed a partnership model, working with
        community-based organizations, cities, and counties **to ensure
        that family units and single adults released from DHS custody
        are COVID tested and isolated in compliance with CDC
        recommendations.**
-   **Expanded Lawful Pathways for Protection and Opportunity**
    -   DHS announced the availability of **6,000 temporary,
        non-agricultural worker – or H-2B – visas** for nationals of
        Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala for FY 2021.
    -   State and DHS **reopened the Central American Minors (CAM)
        program** to reunite children who are nationals of El Salvador,
        Guatemala or Honduras with their parents in the U.S. through
        refugee resettlement or humanitarian parole. On June 15th, State
        and DHS announced the second phase of CAM, which will expand
        access to the program to legal guardians (in addition to
        parents) and to U.S.-based parents or legal guardians who have a
        pending asylum application or pending U visa petition filed
        before May 15, 2021.
    -   State and DHS resumed interviewing individuals via the
        **Protection Transfer Arrangement (PTA)** to expand protection
        for vulnerable nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, and
        Honduras.
    -   The President issued a new FY 2021 Presidential Determination on
        refugees that created **4,000 additional slots for refugees**
        from Latin America and the Caribbean, which includes the
        Northern Triangle.
    -   State is supporting the **Regional Conference on Migration
        (RCM)** through U.S.  partner organizations to **promote humane
        practices in labor migration agreements** in the region.  In
        late May, 61 participants from 11 RCM member countries, the
        private sector, and civil society organizations exchanged best
        practices on fair recruitment and protection of migrant
        workers.  
-   **Enhanced Migration Management**
    -   On June 10, the U.S. Government announced an additional $57
        million in funds, including $46 million the President authorized
        from the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund, to
        support **urgent humanitarian needs of vulnerable refugees and
        migrants in Central America** and third countries in the region,
        including the compounding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on
        forced displacement.  **This builds on the $310 million in
        humanitarian support for the region announced in April.** 
    -   The Department of State opened the first **Migration Resource
        Center (MRC)** in Guatemala to provide individuals with
        protection screenings and referrals to asylum, refugee
        resettlement, and parole options.  The MRC will also have
        referrals for labor and reintegration programs for individuals
        who do not have protection needs.
    -   The Department of Justice, with support from the Department of
        State, will create a **regional task force to identify, disrupt,

        operations**. 
    -   DHS implemented “Operation Sentinel” – a U.S. government effort
        to **crack down on international criminal organizations engaged
        in migrant smuggling** by targeting their ability to travel,
        trade, and access financial assets in the United States.  
    -   On her trip to Guatemala, the Vice President announced a new
        **Human Smuggling and Trafficking Task Force** that will
        identify, disrupt, and prevent migrant smuggling and human
        trafficking operations.
    -   On her trip to Mexico, the Vice President announced that U.S.
        and Mexican law enforcement agencies will partner to exchange
        information and take appropriate actions to address the shared
        priority of **disabling human trafficking and human smuggling
        organizations.**
    -   Mexico is **increasing border checkpoints** and **deployed more
        than 12,000 security personnel to southern Mexico**.
    -   Mexico **received 31,800 asylum requests** from January to
        April, compared to 18,500 during the same period in 2019.
    -   State has nearly **quadrupled the number of radio ads in Central
        America** to discourage irregular migration compared to
        January.  State continues to run a comprehensive digital
        marketing campaign in the region, emphasizing the value of
        staying with family and building a better life at home.  
-   **Addressed the Root Causes of Migration**
    -   Demonstrated a strong U.S. commitment to good governance by
        **redirecting funding for certain Salvadoran government
        institutions** in response to democratic backsliding.
    -   On her trip to Guatemala, the Vice President announced that the
        Department of Justice, with support from the Department of
        State, will create an **anticorruption task force** that will

        investigate and prosecute corruption cases with a nexus in the
        United States, Guatemala, and the region. 
    -   On her trip to Guatemala, the Vice President announced that
        USAID and DFC will provide up to **$48M in U.S. government
        resources to advance economic opportunity in Guatemala** through
        support for entrepreneurs and innovators, expanding access to
        affordable housing, agricultural businesses, and development of
        micro, small, and medium enterprises.
    -   USAID launched a three-year regional initiative to support local
        partners in the Northern Triangle to **increase community
        resilience** in the face of poverty, violence, poor governance,
        corruption, and climate change.  
    -   To increase security in the region, **USAID trained police
        officers** on domestic violence procedures, trained
        investigators and analysts on the prosecution of human smuggling
        cases, and State Department-supported partners **identified 19
        human smugglers** with outstanding warrants in the United
        States.

        opportunities in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras by
        fostering agricultural development and youth empowerment
        programs** in these countries to address the root causes of
        migration.
