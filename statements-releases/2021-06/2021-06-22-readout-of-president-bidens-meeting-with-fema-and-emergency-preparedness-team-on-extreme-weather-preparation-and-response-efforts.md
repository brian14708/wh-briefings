title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with FEMA and Emergency Preparedness\
  \ Team on Extreme Weather Preparation and Response\_Efforts"
---
 
President Biden met today with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell,
Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, FEMA Acting Associate
Administrator for Response and Recovery David Bibo, and other members of
his emergency preparedness team to discuss FEMA’s ongoing efforts to
prevent, prepare for and respond to extreme weather events, including
hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme heat, and wildfires, as well as how to
expedite delivery of support to communities in need of Federal help.

The President emphasized the importance of ensuring that the Federal
government is prepared to respond quickly to a range of extreme weather
scenarios and to support Americans when disasters strike. The President
and his team also discussed how to enable communities across our country
to build greater resilience in the face of extreme weather, which has
been exacerbated by climate change. The President thanked FEMA and other
frontline agencies for all they have done to respond to COVID-19 and
help vaccinate Americans, and for their support in response to this
year’s brutal winter storms and early fire season.

Next week, President Biden will convene Cabinet officials, Governors
from Western States, and private sector partners to discuss the
devastating intersection of drought, heat, and wildfires in the Western
United States, and strengthening prevention, preparedness and response
efforts this season. The 2020 wildfire season alone burned over 10
million acres across the United States, resulting in the loss of dozens
of lives and tens of billions of dollars in economic damage. Next week’s
meeting hosted by the President will focus on how departments and
agencies across the Federal Government, in close coordination with State
and local governments and the private sector, can most effectively
enhance public safety and deliver assistance to our people in times of
urgent need.
