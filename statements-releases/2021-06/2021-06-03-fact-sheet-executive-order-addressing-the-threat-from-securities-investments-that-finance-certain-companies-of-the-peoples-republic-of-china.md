title: "FACT SHEET: Executive Order Addressing the Threat from Securities Investments\
  \ that Finance Certain Companies of the People\u2019s Republic of\_China"

Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) to further
address the ongoing national emergency declared in E.O. 13959 of
November 12, 2020 with respect to the threat posed by the
military-industrial complex of the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
President Biden also expanded the scope of this national emergency by
finding that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC,
as well as the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to
facilitate repression or serious human rights abuses, constitute unusual
and extraordinary threats. This E.O. allows the United States to
prohibit – in a targeted and scoped manner – U.S. investments in Chinese
companies that undermine the security or democratic values of the United
States and our allies.  
  
Specifically, the E.O. the President is signing today will:  
  
**Solidify and strengthen a previous E.O to prohibit U.S. investments in
the military-industrial complex of the People’s Republic of
China: **This E.O. will amend E.O. 13959 by creating a sustainable and
strengthened framework for imposing prohibitions on investments in
Chinese defense and surveillance technology firms. The E.O. prohibits
United States persons from engaging in the purchase or sale of any
publicly traded securities of any person listed in the Annex to the E.O.
or determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, and, as the Secretary of the Treasury deems
appropriate, the Secretary of Defense:

-   To operate or have operated in the defense and related materiel
    sector or the surveillance technology sector of the economy of the
    PRC; or
-   To own or control, or to be owned or controlled by, directly or
    indirectly, a person who operates or has operated in any sector
    described above, or a person who is listed in the Annex to this E.O.
    or who has otherwise been determined to be subject to the
    prohibitions in this E.O.

**Ensure that U.S. investments are not supporting Chinese companies that
undermine the security or values of the United States and our allies**:
This E.O. prevents U.S. investment from supporting the Chinese defense
sector, while also expanding the U.S. Government’s ability to address
the threat of Chinese surveillance technology firms that contribute —
both inside and outside China — to the surveillance of religious or
ethnic minorities or otherwise facilitate repression and serious human
rights abuses. It signals that the Administration will not hesitate to
prevent U.S. capital from flowing into the PRC’s defense and related
materiel sector, including companies that support the PRC’s military,
intelligence, and other security research and development programs; or
into Chinese companies that develop or use Chinese surveillance
technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse. 
Tackling these challenges head-on is consistent with the Biden
Administration’s commitment to protecting core U.S. national security
interests and democratic values, and the Administration will continue to
update the list of PRC entities as appropriate.  At the same time, the
E.O.’s prohibitions are intentionally targeted and scoped.   
  
**The President listed the following 59 entities as subject to the
E.O.’s prohibitions.** The prohibitions against the entities listed in
the Annex to this E.O. shall take effect beginning at 12:01 a.m. eastern
daylight time on August 2, 2021. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) will also list these 59 entities
on its new Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List
(NS-CMIC List).
