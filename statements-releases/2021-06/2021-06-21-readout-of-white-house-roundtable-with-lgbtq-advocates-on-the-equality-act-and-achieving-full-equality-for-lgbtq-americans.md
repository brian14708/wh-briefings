title: Readout of White House Roundtable with LGBTQ+ Advocates on the Equality Act
  and Achieving Full Equality for LGBTQ+ Americans
---
 
Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, Senior Advisor and Director
of the Office of Public Engagement Cedric Richmond, and Executive
Director of the Gender Policy Council Jen Klein hosted a roundtable in
the Roosevelt Room with LGBTQ+ leaders who are coordinating the national
movement to pass the Equality Act. Advocates shared their perspectives
on the urgency and importance of Congress extending long overdue civil
rights protections to LGBTQ+ Americans by passing the Equality Act and
shared the efforts their organizations are undertaking to get the bill
to the President’s desk.

During the meeting, LGBTQ+ advocates and leaders also briefed senior
White House officials on the alarming increase in anti-LGBTQ+
legislation in state legislatures across the country, in particular
legislation that targets transgender children. They discussed the
detrimental impacts these bills are having on the health, safety, and
well-being of children and families across the United States.

Senior White House officials expressed their gratitude for the
participants’ leadership and impactful advocacy. They reiterated the
President’s strong commitment to achieving full equality for every
LGBTQ+ American and his calls for the Senate to quickly pass the
Equality Act. Finally, they underscored that the President has the backs
of LGBTQ+ Americans, especially transgender youth.

Participants in today’s roundtable included:

-   Alphonso David, President, Human Rights Campaign
-   Fatima Goss Graves, President and CEO, National Women’s Law Center
-   Fran Hutchins, Executive Director, Equality Federation
-   Mara Keisling, Executive Director, National Center for Transgender
    Equality
-   Kasey Suffredini, CEO and National Campaign Director, Freedom for
    All Americans
