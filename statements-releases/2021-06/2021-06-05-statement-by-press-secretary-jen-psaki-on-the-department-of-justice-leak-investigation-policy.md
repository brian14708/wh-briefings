  \ Investigation\_Policy"

As appropriate given the independence of the Justice Department in
specific criminal cases, no one at the White House was aware of the gag
order until Friday night. While the White House does not intervene in
criminal investigations, the issuing of subpoenas for the records of
reporters in leak investigations is not consistent with the Presidentâ€™s
policy direction to the Department, and the Department of Justice has
reconfirmed it will not be used moving forward.
