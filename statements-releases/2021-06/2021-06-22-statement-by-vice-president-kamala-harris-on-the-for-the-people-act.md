title: Statement by Vice President Kamala Harris on the For the People Act
---
 
When we cast a ballot, we not only decide our leaders. We determine our
future.  
  
The right to vote is fundamental. It gives Americans a voice in what
happens in our nation—whether that is in our economy or our national
security, our education system or our healthcare system. When more
people have a voice, our democracy becomes more representative, and our
nation becomes stronger.  
  
Today, across our nation, we are witnessing unprecedented attacks on
voting rights. There are unjust bills in dozens of state legislatures
that would limit early voting and vote by mail and otherwise make it
harder for the American people to vote. Make no mistake: While these
attacks are meant to silence some Americans, the impact is felt by all
Americans.  
  
At this critical moment, the United States Senate had a critical
opportunity to make voting more accessible nationwide. The For The
People Act has the broad support of the American people. Yet, as Senate
Democrats united around the legislation, this afternoon, Senate
Republicans voted against advancing it.  
  
The President and I are undeterred, and I know the American people are
as well. Like generations before, we will not give up, we will not give
in, and we will continue the fight to strengthen the right to vote. We
will fortify and expand the nationwide coalition on voting rights, and
promote voter engagement and registration nationwide. We will lift up
leaders in the states who are working to stop anti-voter legislation,
and work with leaders in Congress to advance federal legislation that
will strengthen voting rights.  
  
I want to be clear that our Administration remains determined to work
with Congress to pass the For The People Act, and we will keep working
with Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  
  
Here is the bottom line: Our democracy is stronger when everyone
participates—and it is weaker when people are denied meaningful access
to participation. And that is why the right to vote is neither
Democratic nor Republican. The right to vote is an American right.  
  
It is our duty, at every opportunity, to protect and strengthen the
right to vote.
