title: "Readout of Meeting with Speaker Pelosi and Leader\_Schumer"

Today, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer met with Office of Management
Budget Acting Director Shalanda Young, National Economic Council
Director Brian Deese, and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice to
discuss the President’s legislative priorities, including the American
Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. They agreed that Congress must
meet the President’s goal of investing in creating a generation of good
paying jobs, addressing the climate crisis, and ensuring American
workers and businesses can compete globally, while not raising taxes on
anyone who makes under $400,000. They underscored the importance of
extending the child tax credit, and investing in the care economy,
including expanding child care, to help ensure that women can return to
the workforce. They discussed the two-track approach, and the importance
of a budget resolution to meeting the full range of the President’s
priorities.
