On behalf of the American people, I congratulate Prime Minister Naftali
Bennett, Alternate Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, and
all the members of the new Israeli cabinet.  I look forward to working
with Prime Minister Bennett to strengthen all aspects of the close and
enduring relationship between our two nations. 

Israel has no better friend than the United States.  The bond that
unites our people is evidence of our shared values and decades of close
cooperation and as we continue to strengthen our partnership, the United
States remains unwavering in its support for Israel’s security.  My
administration is fully committed to working with the new Israeli
government to advance security, stability, and peace for Israelis,
Palestinians, and people throughout the broader region.
