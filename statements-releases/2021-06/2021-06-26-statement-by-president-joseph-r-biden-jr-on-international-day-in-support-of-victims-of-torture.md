title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on International Day in Support\
  \ of Victims of\_Torture"

Today, on the anniversary of the United Nations Convention Against
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
coming into effect, I reaffirm the United States’ unequivocal ban on
torture and opposition to all forms of inhumane treatment. Torture goes
against everything we stand for as a nation, and we must never again
resort to its use. The late-Senator John McCain, my friend and a torture
survivor, put it best: “the use of torture compromises that which most
distinguishes us from our enemies—our belief that all people, even
captured enemies, possess basic human rights, which are protected by
international conventions the U.S. not only joined, but for the most
part authored.”  
   
Here are the facts. We know that torture is an ineffective method for
gaining reliable intelligence. We know that it is prohibited
universally, and violates U.S. and international law. We know that it
spurs terrorist recruitment and violent extremism. And we know that it
compromises our moral standing in the world.  
   
On this International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, we recognize
the individuals and communities who endured the pain of torture, and I
pledge the full efforts of the United States to eradicate torture in all
its forms. As part of this effort, the United States has nominated a
leading American legal expert to sit on the Committee Against Torture,
which monitors implementation of the UN Convention, and I have requested
the largest ever budget for the U.S. Survivors of Torture Program in
HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement. The United States also remains the
largest contributor to the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture to
aid human rights defenders, refugees, migrants and other groups, and we
urge other governments to join us in supporting this critical lifeline
for torture survivors.  
   
Torture, wherever it occurs, is a stain on our moral conscience. We all
must redouble our efforts to end such inhumane practice for good.
