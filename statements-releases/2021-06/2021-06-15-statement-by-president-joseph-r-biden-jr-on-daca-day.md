title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on DACA\_Day"

Dreamers are Americans.  Many have spent most of their lives in the
United States.  They live, study, work, and worship in our communities. 
They have served on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 

In 2012, the Obama-Biden Administration created the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy.  Since that date, DACA has allowed
more than 800,000 immigrant youth who came to the United States as
children to temporarily remain in our country, work lawfully, pursue
their education and long for the day they could become citizens.

Twenty years ago, Congress introduced the first version of the
bipartisan Dream Act, led by Senator Durbin (D-IL) and former Republican
Senator Hatch.  And over the years, bipartisan coalitions of lawmakers
championed this bill.  The  American public overwhelmingly supports this
legislation. But time and time again, the Senate has failed to act.

Only Congress can provide a permanent legislative fix to provide lasting
stability for these young people and their families.  My immigration
bill, the U.S. Citizenship Act, creates a pathway to citizenship for
undocumented individuals in our country, including Dreamers.  In March,
the House took a critical first step and passed the American Dream and
Promise Act.   Congress must find a way to pass these legislative
solutions and I will continue to work towards passage of legislation
protecting Dreamers and creating a path to citizenship for  undocumented
immigrants. These young people represent the best of America and we
can’t let them down.
