title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Hong Kong\u2019s Apple\_Daily"
---
 
It is a sad day for media freedom in Hong Kong and around the world.
Intensifying repression by Beijing has reached such a level that Apple
Daily, a much-needed bastion of independent journalism in Hong Kong, has
now ceased publishing. Through arrests, threats, and forcing through a
National Security Law that penalizes free speech, Beijing has insisted
on wielding its power to suppress independent media and silence
dissenting views.  
   
Independent media play an invaluable role in resilient and prosperous
societies. Journalists are truth-tellers who hold leaders accountable
and keep information flowing freely—and that is needed now more than
ever in Hong Kong, and in places around the world where democracy is
under threat. Beijing must stop targeting the independent press and
release the journalists and media executives that have been detained.
The act of journalism is not a crime.   
   
People in Hong Kong have the right to freedom of the press. Instead,
Beijing is denying basic liberties and assaulting Hong Kong’s autonomy
and democratic institutions and processes, inconsistent with its
international obligations. The United States will not waver in our
support of people in Hong Kong and all those who stand up for the basic
freedoms all people deserve.
