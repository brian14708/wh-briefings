title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces Support for the Bipartisan Infrastructure\_\
  Framework"
---
 
Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris announced their support
for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, the largest long-term
investment in our infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century
– an investment that will make our economy more sustainable, resilient,
and just.

The President came into office promising to find common ground to get
things done – and he’s delivering on that promise.

The $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework is a critical step
in implementing President Biden’s Build Back Better vision. The Plan
makes transformational and historic investments in clean transportation
infrastructure, clean water infrastructure, universal broadband
infrastructure, clean power infrastructure, remediation of legacy
pollution, and resilience to the changing climate. Cumulatively across
these areas, the Framework invests two-thirds of the resources that the
President proposed in his American Jobs Plan.

President Biden believes that we must invest in our country and in our
people, creating good-paying union jobs, tackling the climate crisis,
and growing the economy sustainably, and equitably for decades to come.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework is a critical step in
accomplishing these objectives.

President Biden believes that we are at inflection point between
democracy and autocracy. At this moment in our history, President Biden
believes we must demonstrate to the world that American democracy can
deliver for the American people. Today, the President is showing that
democracy can deliver results. The Framework will position American
workers, farmers, and businesses – small and large alike – to compete
and win in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

Still, there is more work to do – to grow our economy, create jobs,
improve living standards, reduce climate pollution, and ensure more
Americans can participate fully and equally in our economy. President
Biden remains committed to the comprehensive agenda laid out in the
American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan. He will work with
Congress to build on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework in
legislation that moves in tandem, and he is encouraged that both the
House and Senate are working on budget plans that would do so.

But democracy requires compromise. The historic Bipartisan
Infrastructure Framework will make life better for millions of
Americans, create a generation of good-paying union jobs and economic
growth, and position the United States to win the
21<sup>st</sup> century, including on many of the key technologies
needed to combat the climate crisis. That’s what President Biden and
Vice President Harris were elected to do.

The President calls on Congress to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Framework and send it to his desk, and pass a budget resolution and
legislation that makes his full Build Back Better vision a reality.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework will:

-   Improve healthy, sustainable transportation options for millions of
    Americans by modernizing and expanding transit and rail networks
    across the country, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The
    Plan is the largest federal investment in public transit in history
    and is the largest federal investment in passenger rail since the
    creation of Amtrak.  
     
-   Repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate
    change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all users,
    including cyclists and pedestrians. The Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Framework is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since
    the construction of the interstate highway system.  
     
-   Build a national network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers along
    highways and in rural and disadvantaged communities. The largest
    investment in EV infrastructure in history, the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Framework will accomplish the President’s goal of
    building 500,000 EV chargers.  
     
-   Electrify thousands of school and transit buses across the country
    to reduce harmful emissions and drive domestic manufacturing of zero
    emission vehicles and components.  
     
-   Eliminate the nation’s lead service lines and pipes, delivering
    clean drinking water to up to ten million American families and more
    than 400,000 schools and child care facilities that currently don’t
    have it, including in Tribal nations and disadvantaged communities.
    The Plan is the largest investment in clean drinking water and waste
    water infrastructure in American history.  
     
-   Connect every American to reliable high-speed internet, just as the
    federal government made a historic effort to provide electricity to
    every American nearly one hundred years ago. The Framework will also
    drive down prices for internet service and close the digital
    divide.  
     
-   Upgrade our power infrastructure, including by building thousands of
    miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the
    expansion of renewable energy, including through a new Grid
    Authority. The Plan is the single largest investment in clean energy
    transmission in American history.  
     
-   Create a first of its kind Infrastructure Financing Authority that
    will leverage billions of dollars into clean transportation and
    clean energy.  
     
-   Make the largest investment in addressing legacy pollution in
    American history, a cleanup effort that will create good-paying
    union jobs and advance environmental justice.  
     
-   Prepare more of our infrastructure for the impacts of climate
    change, cyber attacks, and extreme weather events. The Framework is
    the largest investment in the resilience of physical and natural
    systems in American history.

The Framework, which will generate significant economic benefits and
returns, is financed through a combination of closing the tax gap,
redirecting unspent emergency relief funds, targeted corporate user
fees, and the macroeconomic impact of infrastructure investment.
