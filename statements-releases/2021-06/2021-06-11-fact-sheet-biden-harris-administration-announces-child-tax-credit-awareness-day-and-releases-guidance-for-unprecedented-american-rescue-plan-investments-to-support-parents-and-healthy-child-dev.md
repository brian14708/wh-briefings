title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Child Tax Credit Awareness\
  \ Day and\_Releases Guidance for Unprecedented American Rescue Plan  Investments\
  \ to Support Parents and Healthy Child\_Development"
---
 
President Biden’s American Rescue Plan included historic investments to
support low- and middle-income parents – who have long faced increasing
financial strain, worsened by the pandemic. 

Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing Child Tax Credit
Awareness Day on Monday, June 21st to ensure parents know about the
American Rescue Plan’s historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit and
how it will benefit their families. Critically, as part of Child Tax
Credit Awareness Day, the administration will encourage elected
officials, organizations that fight for children, and faith-based
organizations, to help low-income families—who may have such low-incomes
that they are not required to file taxes—to use a new, easy Child Tax
Credit sign-up tool to help give their children a lifeline out of
poverty. And, the administration is releasing guidance for three
elements of the American Rescue Plan that will support families,
including: $15 billion for the [Child Care and Development Block
Grant](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/policy-guidance/ccdf-acf-im-2021-03),
an historic expansion of the [Child and Dependent Care Tax
Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-tax-credit-faqs),
and six months of extended support for small and midsize employers
offering paid sick and family leave in response to the pandemic through
the [Paid Leave Tax
Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-credits-for-paid-leave-under-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-for-leave-after-march-31-2021).

These measures will help parents by helping them with the costs of
raising children – measures that experts project could contribute to
cutting child poverty in half. They will also help defray the costs of
child care, provide more child care options, and support return to work
for those who have lost their jobs or income — especially mothers. And,
they will do all of this while investing in the future of the nation’s
children.

While the American Rescue Plan is providing historic investments to
confront the effects of the pandemic and help provide immediate relief
from COVID-19, President Biden is calling to extend historic tax relief
for working families and increase high quality child care and available
paid family and medical leave through the American Families Plan and
American Jobs plan.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Families need support to
power an equitable economic recovery and to support healthy development
for children who most need it</span>  
**  
We are experiencing a record-setting economic recovery, with historic
growth in employment and wages. And, in the first four months of the
Biden administration, more than 2 million jobs were created—an average
of 540,000 jobs a month. But, our economy remains about 7.6 million jobs
below its pre-pandemic level, and labor force participation remains more
than 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. Women were also
particularly hard hit by the pandemic. More than one-half of the lost
jobs—nearly 4.2 million—were once held by women, and 1.8 million women
remain out of the labor force.

And, the pandemic has exacerbated many families’ distress. According to
the [latest U.S. Census Pulse survey in
May,](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-recessions-effects-on-food-housing-and#_ftnref8)
one third of all adults with children are struggling to pay their usual
expenses like food, rent, health care, and transportation. One in eight
adults living with children report their household doesn’t have enough
food to eat. One in five renters living with children reported that they
are not caught up on rent. Black and brown families and women are
disproportionately feeling the strain of the pandemic. And, financial
hardship has [long-term
consequences](/Users/KGLandrieu/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/FWH13A5H/•%09Extends%20the%20Child%20Tax%20Credit%20in%20the%20American%20Rescue%20Plan,%20which%20helps%20families%20raising%20children%20make%20ends%20meet)
for the healthy development of children.

Families need economic relief. And, many parents need support to be able
to return to work or continue working so they can provide economic
security for their families.

In part, lack of high-quality, affordable child care can make it
logistically difficult for parents to work. Indeed, many
parents—particularly
mothers—[report](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2019/03/28/467488/child-care-crisis-keeping-women-workforce/) that
they work fewer hours than they would prefer or need to in order to care
for their young children. For some parents there is no choice but to
find outside care if they want or need to work: as found in a
recent [analysis](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202046.pdf),
one in five workers live in households with a child under 14, but do not
live with a non-working adult who could potentially serve as a
caregiver. And, this problem is most acute for single mothers.

According to the latest U.S. Census Pulse Survey in May, about 7.6
million adults had someone in their household who took paid or unpaid
leave, left their job, lost their job, or did not look for a job in the
last month because child care arrangements remain disrupted due to the
pandemic—three in four of whom were women and half of whom were women of
color. Another 1.2 million women continued to work-from-home while they
or another family member cares for their children.  

And, the pandemic laid bare the fact that the majority of  low-wage
workers have [no
access](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2020/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-march-2020.pdf)
to paid sick leave or paid family and medical leave. Ninety-five percent
of low-wage workers have no access to paid family and medical leave and
69 percent have no access to paid sick leave. This meant workers were
left with few options to protect their own and their families’ health
and well-being at the beginning of COVID. Paid leave is a critical
policy for ensuring workers stay connected to the jobs when a health
need or crisis arises, and thereby, not lose needed income or a job.

The American Rescue Plan is taking several steps to support family
economic security and the healthy development of children.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Help is Here: Child Tax
Credit Awareness Day</span>  
**  
The American Rescue Plan delivered major tax relief for working families
with children through a historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit. In
2021, for most families, the Child Tax Credit is increased to $3,000 for
each child between 6 and 17 years old and to $3,600 for each child under
age 6. For example, a married couple making less than $150,000 with two
children under age 6 will be eligible for a Child Tax Credit of $7,200
in 2021–at least $3,200 more than they would have received prior to the
American Rescue Plan.

While tax relief is typically available only when you file your taxes,
thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Child Tax Credit payments will be
provided monthly for the first time ever, beginning in July. This means
needed relief will reach families sooner, and they can count on it each
month to help make ends meet. To help with the costs of raising
children, families will begin to receive monthly payments of up to $250
for each child 6 to 17 years old and $300 for each child under age 6.
Under the American Rescue Plan, the Child Tax Credit will be fully
refundable, meaning that if a family’s income tax bill is less than the
amount of their Child Tax Credit, they will get a payment for the
difference. This will ensure for the first time that even the most
hard-pressed families will get at least as much support as more affluent
families.

The IRS estimates that roughly 39 million households — covering almost
90 percent of children in the United States — are slated to begin
receiving monthly payments without any further action required. Other
eligible families— those who have not yet filed taxes in 2019 or 2020
and who did not sign-up for Economic Impact Payments like the $1,400
rescue payments included in the American Rescue Plan—can still sign-up
to receive monthly Child Tax Credit payments beginning this summer.
Experts project that the expanded Child Tax Credit could potentially
help lift one-half of all children out of poverty if all eligible
families sign-up to receive the monthly payments.

Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing that Monday, June
21st will be Child Tax Credit Awareness Day—a day of action to get the
word out far and wide on the upcoming monthly payments that will benefit
nearly all families. It is also important that we extend these benefits
beyond 2021 as the President has proposed in his American Families Plan.
The administration will be calling on elected officials, faith-based
groups, organizations that fight for children and families, and other
partners to join us on June 21st to raise awareness that help is on the
way.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Child Care Development Block
Grant Guidance</span>  
**  
The Biden Administration has provided states with unprecedented funding
for expansions and improvements for child care, providing states with a
tremendous opportunity to invest in early care and learning. The
American Rescue Plan’s $39 billion investment in child care is historic
on its own, and the administration has gone further to encourage state
and local governments to finance quality child care options for parents
and increase wages for the early childhood workforce. The Administration
of Children and Families released
[guidance](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/policy-guidance/ccdf-acf-im-2021-03)
to States, Territories, and Tribes for the American Rescue Plan’s $15
billion in discretionary Child Care and Development Block Grants
(CCDBG). The guidance strongly recommends that lead agencies focus
resources on investing in child care in ways that strengthen the child
care system and ensure that families have equal access to quality,
affordable child care to support them during and after the pandemic. To
do that, it:

-   Strongly recommends that lead agencies prioritize increasing
    provider payment rates and workforce compensation so that child care
    providers can retain a skilled workforce and deliver higher-quality
    care to children receiving subsidies.
    -   While the economy has added
        [45,000](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES6562440001) child
        care jobs since January, more than [one in
        eight](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES6562440001) child
        care jobs have yet to return since the start of the pandemic.
        And, because of the lack of resources in the child care
        industry, annual turnover rates for child care workers were high
        even before the pandemic. The inability of providers to recruit
        and retain a high-quality workforce hinders access to care in
        many communities. And, for those who can access care, high
        turnover often disrupts the stable relationships between
        children and providers that are important to child development
        and wellbeing. The [quality of the classroom
        environment](https://daneshyari.com/article/preview/353687.pdf)
        and interactions between teachers and students are linked to
        children’s school readiness skills, and [higher
        compensation](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED477480.pdf)
        for the child care workforce is associated with better quality
        literacy environments. But, [nearly
        half](https://cscce.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/ReportFINAL.pdf)
        of child care workers – who are disproportionately women of
        color — rely on public income supports. Child care workers
        experiencing [economic
        stress](https://cscce.berkeley.edu/educator-work-environments-are-childrens-learning-environments-how-and-why-they-should-be-improved/)
        have a more difficult time fully engaging with children and
        offering a quality learning experience.
    -   Using these funds to increase payment rates to providers and
        workers’ compensation will improve care quality, give parents a
        wider range of options from which to choose, boost wages for a
        chronically underpaid workforce, and better support the small
        businesses that comprise the child care sector.
    -   The guidance reminds lead agencies that the CCDBG Act requires
        that payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access for
        eligible children to child care services that are comparable to
        those provided to children whose parents are not eligible to
        receive assistance, and it notes that many states will need to
        make progress to meet equal access requirements in the CCDBG
        Act.  
-   Recommends that, secondarily, lead agencies implement policies that
    will:
    -   Build the supply of child care in low-income communities,
        especially for historically underserved populations
    -   Provide child care assistance to families who have lost
        employment or income during the pandemic

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Child and Dependent Care Tax
Credit</span>  
**  
The American Rescue Plan’s historic expansion of the Child and Dependent
Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) will make child care more affordable for
millions of working families in 2021. Today, the Internal Revenue
Service released
[guidance](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-tax-credit-faqs)
providing additional details on this critical assistance.

Reducing the cost of child care increases labor force participation
among mothers of young children— which expands the workforce, provides
additional income to parents, and grows the economy. A
recent [review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9331-3) of
research on child care costs and women’s labor supply finds that a 10
percent decrease in the cost of child care to families leads to a 0.5 to
2.5 percent increase in mother’s employment.

Thanks to the historic expansion of the CDCTC in the American Recovery
Plan, child care is more affordable for families this year, helping
parents work and supporting economic security of families. Specifically:

-   A median income family with two kids under age 13 will receive up to
    $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they file taxes for
    2021, compared with a maximum of $1,200 previously.
-   All families with incomes up to $125,000 will save up to one-half
    the cost of their eligible child care expenses, getting back up to
    $4,000 for one child and $8,000 for two or more children when they
    file taxes for 2021. By comparison, the same families in 2020 would
    have had only up to one-fifth of their eligible expenses covered,
    receiving no more than $600 for one child or $1,200 for two or more
    children. And, in 2021, families making between $125,000 and
    $400,000 can still receive a partial credit at least as generous as
    the credit they would have received in 2020.
-   And, for the first time, the CDCTC will be fully refundable, making
    the credit fairer by allowing low-income working families to receive
    the full value of the credit towards their eligible child care
    expenses regardless of how much they owe on their 2021 taxes.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Paid Leave Tax
Credit</span>  
**  
Today, the Internal Revenue Service is also releasing
[guidance](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-credits-for-paid-leave-under-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-for-leave-after-march-31-2021)
for the American Rescue Plan’s paid leave tax credit. The advanceable,
refundable tax credit offsets the cost for employers who voluntarily
provide eligible employees paid sick or family leave, either for the
employee’s own health needs or to care for family members.

Employers with fewer than 500 employees and certain government employers
may receive up to $17,110 to provide employees with up to 10 days of
paid sick leave and up to 12 weeks of paid family leave, from April 1
through September 30, 2021. Certain self-employed individuals in similar
circumstances are entitled to similar credits. Roughly [6 million
businesses](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04144224/2020-Small-Business-Economic-Profile-US.)
and more than [30 million
workers](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04144224/2020-Small-Business-Economic-Profile-US.)
are eligible for this credit.

Tax credits can be claimed for employees who take time off because they
are:

-   exposed to COVID-19 or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking
    a diagnosis, or caring for someone who has been exposed to COVID-19
    or is experiencing COVID symptoms
-   caring for a child whose school or child care has been closed or
    unavailable due to COVID–19
-   getting a vaccine or recovering from it
-   subject to, or is caring for someone who is subject to, a COVID-19
    quarantine or isolation order

The Biden Administration strongly encourages employers to provide paid
leave and take advantage of these credits. They can help ensure safe and
healthy workplaces, while also ensuring that Americans can reenter or
stay in the workforce as we continue to fight the virus and recover from
the economic effects of COVID-19. Research has shown that states where
employees gained access to paid sick leave through this tax credit
experienced a [slow-down in the spread of
COVID](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00863).

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Investing in Child Care and
Paid Leave for the Long-Term</span>  
**  
Finally, President Biden is calling to permanently increase access to
economic relief for families, high quality child care, and available
paid family and medical leave. Even before the pandemic, a middle-class
life – the ability to buy a home, afford child care, send a kid to
college, save up to retire with dignity – was increasingly out of reach
for families, and especially for women and people of color. While the
American Rescue Plan is providing historic investments to confront the
effects of the pandemic and help provide immediate relief from COVID-19,
the [American Families
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/)
and [American Jobs
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/)
will reimagine and rebuild a new, stronger economy that leaves no one
behind. They will:

-   **Extend the historic increase in the Child Tax Credit included in
    the American Rescue Plan**, continuing major, monthly tax relief for
    families of up to $3,600 for each child to help parents meet the
    costs of raising children.
-   **Guarantee low- and middle-income families will spend no more than
    7 percent of their income on high-quality child care for young
    children**. The President’s Council of Economic Advisers estimates,
    based on a recent literature review, that this cost reduction could
    increase employment for parents that benefit by between four and 20
    percent. High-quality child care also can provide lifetime benefits
    for children as they grow up healthier, do better in school, and
    earn more over the course of their lifetimes.
-   **Make permanent the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the Child
    and Dependent Care Tax Credit**, so that families can continue to
    get back up to $8,000 of their child care expenses.
-   **Build the supply of child care** including by building and
    upgrading facilities across the country.
-   **Invest in training and professional development of the child care
    workforce.**
-   **Establish a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave
    program** that will bring America in line with competitor nations
    that offer paid leave programs. This new benefit, provided by the
    federal government, will ensure workers partial wage replacement to
    take time to bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved
    one; deal with a loved one’s military deployment; find safety from
    sexual assault, stalking, or domestic violence; heal from their own
    serious illness; or take time to deal with the death of a loved one.
    It will be available to workers regardless of employer size, sector,
    or type of employment.

These investments will help build on the momentum of the American Rescue
Plan to create a stronger, more equitable economy that supports families
and strengthens the middle class.
