The idea that we have held back security assistance to Ukraine is
nonsense. Just last week—in the run-up to the U.S.-Russia Summit—we
provided a $150 million package of security assistance, including lethal
assistance. We have now provided the entire amount appropriated by
Congress through the Ukraine security assistance initiative. Two days
before the Summit, President Biden stood on the stage before the entire
world at NATO and said that we would keep putting Ukraine “in the
position to be able to continue to resist Russian physical aggression.”
We have also prepared contingency funds in the event of a further
Russian incursion into Ukraine. As President Biden told President Putin
directly, we will stand unwavering in support for Ukraine’s sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
