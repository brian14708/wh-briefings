title: "Letter to the Speaker of the House and President Pro Tempore of the Senate\
  \ Regarding the War Powers\_Report"
---
 
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)  
  
I am providing this supplemental consolidated report, prepared by my
Administration and consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148), as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed about
deployments of United States Armed Forces equipped for combat.  
  
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF UNITED STATES COUNTERTERRORISM
EFFORTS  
  
In furtherance of counterterrorism efforts, the United States continues
to work with partners around the globe, with a particular focus on the
United States Central and Africa Commands’ areas of responsibility.  In
this context, the United States has deployed forces to conduct
counterterrorism operations and to advise, assist, and accompany
security forces of select foreign partners on counterterrorism
operations.  In the majority of these locations, the mission of United
States military personnel is to facilitate counterterrorism operations
of foreign partner forces and does not include routine engagement in
combat.  In many of these locations, the security environment is such
that United States military personnel may be required to defend
themselves against threats or attacks, and, to that end, the United
States may deploy United States military personnel with weapons and
other appropriate equipment for force protection.  Specific information
about counterterrorism deployments to select countries is provided
below, and a classified annex to this report provides further
information.  
  
Military Operations Against al-Qa’ida, the Taliban, and Associated
Forces and in Support of Related United States Counterterrorism
Objectives  
  
Since October 7, 2001, United States Armed Forces, including Special
Operations Forces, have conducted counterterrorism combat operations
against al-Qa’ida, the Taliban, and associated forces.  Since August
2014, these operations have targeted the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
(ISIS), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),
which was formerly known as al-Qa’ida in Iraq.  In support of these and
other overseas operations, the United States has deployed
combat-equipped forces to several locations in the United States
Central, European, Africa, Southern, and Indo-Pacific Commands’ areas of
responsibility.  Such operations and deployments have been reported
previously, consistent with Public Law 107-40, Public Law 107-243, the
War Powers Resolution, and other statutes.  These ongoing operations,
which the United States has carried out with the assistance of numerous
international partners, have been successful in seriously degrading ISIS
capabilities in Syria and Iraq.  If necessary, in response to terrorist
threats, I will direct additional measures to protect the people and
interests of the United States.  It is not possible to know at this time
the precise scope or the duration of the deployments of United States
Armed Forces that are or will be necessary to counter terrorist threats
to the United States.  
  
**Afghanistan.**  On April 14, 2021, I directed the withdrawal of United
States forces from Afghanistan starting on May 1, 2021, and concluding
by September 11, 2021.  Since May 1, 2021, we have been withdrawing
United States forces in a safe, deliberate, and responsible manner and
in full coordination with our partners and allies in Afghanistan. 
Additionally, we are making plans to ensure the security of our
diplomats who may remain in Afghanistan, while also re-organizing our
counterterrorism capabilities outside Afghanistan to address threats to
the United States homeland and United States interests that may arise
from inside Afghanistan.   
  
**Iraq and Syria.**  As part of a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS,
United States Armed Forces are working by, with, and through local
partners in conducting airstrikes and other necessary operations against
ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria and against al-Qa’ida in Syria.  A small
presence of United States Armed Forces remains in strategically
significant locations in Syria to conduct operations, in partnership
with indigenous ground forces, to address continuing terrorist threats
emanating from Syria.  United States Armed Forces in Iraq continue to
advise, coordinate with, and provide support to select elements of the
Iraqi security forces, including Iraqi Kurdish security forces.  Support
to Iraqi security forces includes training, equipment, communications
support, and intelligence support.  United States Armed Forces also
provide limited support to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
mission in Iraq.  Actions in Iraq are being undertaken in coordination
with the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government, and
in conjunction with coalition partners.  
  
As reported in February 2021, I directed a targeted military strike
against infrastructure in eastern Syria used by Iran‑supported non-state
militia groups.  Those non-state militia groups were involved in attacks
against United States and Coalition personnel in Iraq.  These groups
were also engaged in ongoing planning for future such attacks.  I
directed this action consistent with my responsibility to protect United
States citizens both at home and abroad and in furtherance of United
States national security interests, pursuant to my constitutional
authority to conduct United States foreign relations and as Commander in
Chief and Chief Executive.   
  
**Arabian Peninsula Region. ** A small number of United States military
personnel are deployed to Yemen to conduct operations against al-Qa’ida
in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS.  The United States military continues
to work closely with the Government of the Republic of Yemen and
regional partner forces to degrade the terrorist threat posed by those
groups.  
  
I have directed an end to United States support for the Saudi‑led
Coalition’s offensive military operations against the Houthis in Yemen. 
United States Armed Forces, in a non‑combat role, continue to provide
military advice and limited information to regional forces for defensive
and training purposes only as they relate to the Saudi-led Coalition’s
campaign against the Houthis in Yemen.  Such support does not involve
United States Armed Forces in hostilities with the Houthis for the
purposes of the War Powers Resolution.  
  
United States Armed Forces are deployed to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
to protect United States forces and interests in the region against
hostile action by Iran or Iran-backed groups.  These forces, operating
in coordination with the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
provide air and missile defense capabilities and support the operation
of United States fighter aircraft.  The total number of United States
forces in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is approximately 2,742.  
  
**Jordan. ** At the request of the Government of Jordan, approximately
2,976 United States military personnel are deployed to Jordan to support
Defeat-ISIS operations, to enhance Jordan’s security, and to promote
regional stability.  
  
**Lebanon. ** At the request of the Government of Lebanon, approximately
83 United States military personnel are deployed to Lebanon to enhance
the government’s counterterrorism capabilities and to support the
counterterrorism operations of Lebanese security forces.  
  
**Turkey. ** United States Armed Forces remain deployed to Turkey, at
the Turkish government’s request, to support Defeat-ISIS operations and
to enhance Turkey’s security.  
  
**East Africa Region. ** At the direction of the prior administration,
the majority of United States forces in Somalia redeployed or
repositioned to neighboring countries prior to my inauguration as
President.  United States Armed Forces based outside Somalia continue to
counter the terrorist threat posed by ISIS and al-Shabaab, an associated
force of al-Qa’ida, in Somalia.  Since the last periodic report, United
States forces have conducted a small number of airstrikes against
al-Shabaab, and remain prepared to conduct airstrikes against ISIS and
al‑Shabaab terrorists.  United States military personnel conduct
periodic engagements in Somalia to train, advise, and assist regional
forces, including Somali and African Union Mission in Somalia forces,
during counterterrorism operations.  United States Armed Forces are
deployed to Kenya to support counterterrorism operations in East Africa.
 United States military personnel continue to partner with the
Government of Djibouti, which has permitted use of Djiboutian territory
for basing of United States Armed Forces.  United States military
personnel remain deployed to Djibouti, including for purposes of staging
for counterterrorism and counter-piracy operations in the vicinity of
the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and to provide contingency
support for embassy security augmentation in East Africa, as
necessary.  
  
**Lake Chad Basin and Sahel Region.**  United States military personnel
in the Lake Chad Basin and Sahel Region continue to conduct airborne
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations and to provide
support to African and European partners conducting counterterrorism
operations in the region, including by advising, assisting, and
accompanying these partner forces.  Approximately 808 United States
military personnel remain deployed to Niger.  
  
**Cuba. ** United States Armed Forces continue to conduct humane
and secure detention operations for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, under the authority provided by the 2001 Authorization for the Use
of Military Force (Public Law 107-40), as informed by the law of war. 
There are 40 such detainees as of the date of this report.  
  
**Philippines. ** United States Armed Forces deployed to the Philippines
are providing support to the counterterrorism operations of the armed
forces of the Philippines.  
  
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN EGYPT IN SUPPORT OF THE MULTINATIONAL FORCE AND
OBSERVERS  
  
Approximately 379 United States military personnel are assigned to or
supporting the United States contingent of the Multinational Force and
Observers, which have been present in Egypt since 1981.  
  
UNITED STATES AND NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION OPERATIONS IN
KOSOVO  
  
The United States continues to contribute forces to the Kosovo Force
(KFOR), led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in cooperation
with local authorities, bilateral partners, and international
institutions, to deter renewed hostilities in Kosovo.  Approximately 707
United States military personnel are among KFOR’s approximately 4,000
personnel.  
  
I have directed the participation of United States Armed Forces in all
of the above-described operations pursuant to my constitutional and
statutory authority as Commander in Chief and as Chief Executive
(including the authority to carry out Public Law 107-40, Public Law
107-243, and other statutes), as well as my constitutional and statutory
authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States. 
Officials of my Administration and I communicate regularly with
congressional leadership, relevant congressional committees, and other
Members of Congress with regard to these deployments, and we will
continue to do so.

        Sincerely,  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
