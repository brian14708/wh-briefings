title: "FACT SHEET: United\_States and G7+ Plan to Defeat the COVID-\u206019 Pandemic\
  \ in 2022 and Prevent the Next\_Pandemic"
---
 
**Today, President Biden welcomed the historic commitment of the leaders
of the G7 and guest countries to provide more than 1 billion additional
COVID-19 vaccines for the world, starting this summer, of which the
United States will contribute half a billion doses.**  
  
This commitment forms the basis of a comprehensive set of G7+ actions
towards ending this global pandemic in 2022. The G7+ action plan that
will be agreed to by leaders in Cornwall includes vaccinating the
world’s most vulnerable, providing emergency supplies, bolstering
world-wide economic recovery, and positioning the international
community to prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to future
biological catastrophes.   
  
The United States will lead the G7+ in a global COVID-19 vaccination
campaign, providing 500 million safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for
the world through COVAX, with delivery starting in August 2021.
This donation, which President Biden announced yesterday, is the largest
single donation of vaccines in history and comprises half of the G7+
commitment to provide an additional 1 billion safe and effective
COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next 12 months, especially to the
world’s most vulnerable.  
  
In addition, we are taking concrete and tangible steps to meet the
ambition of the G7+ and drive action to end this pandemic and prevent
the next. We call on other countries and private sector partners to join
us.   
  
To end the global COVID-19 pandemic, the United States and the G7+ will:

-   **<u>Accelerate Vaccination of the World’s Most Vulnerable</u>**  
    **We are fully committed to working towards the ambitious goal of
    ending the pandemic. **Yesterday’s announcement of half a billion
    new vaccine doses comes on top of both the at least 80 million
    vaccine doses previously announced by President Biden and the $2
    billion in funding which the United States has previously provided
    to Gavi to support COVAX. We call on countries to donate additional
    doses of safe and effective vaccines, strengthen vaccine readiness,
    and work with private sector partners to vaccinate the world.   
     
-   **<u>Support Last Mile Vaccination and Getting Shots into
    Arms</u>**  
    The Biden-Harris Administration will be providing hundreds of
    millions in support for programs that provide assistance to help
    countries and health systems prepare for vaccination around the
    world, including in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. That assistance
    comes on top of longstanding U.S. support for countries and
    communities around the world for immunization and strengthening
    health systems.   
     
-   **<u>Save Lives Now with PPE and Emergency Medical Supplies</u>**  
    The Biden-Harris Administration is investing in efforts to help
    fragile countries with their emergency response,
    including lifesaving medical and other supplies to tackle COVID-19
    surges while strengthening their health systems, building capacity
    to manage surges, and preventing disease spread. We must expand our
    emergency responses, including by delivering lifesaving medical
    supplies, oxygen, diagnostics, therapeutics, and PPE. We are
    providing emergency assistance in 2021 to regions that need it most,
    including sending multiple flights and more than $100 million in
    health assistance to India, and supporting responses in South Asia
    and Latin America as countries experience surges in COVID-19
    cases.   
      
    Through the $11.5 billion provided in the American Rescue Plan (ARP)
    for the global COVID-19 response, we will continue to strengthen our
    global response to and recovery from COVID-19, including by
    expanding investments in lifesaving medical supplies, including
    oxygen, diagnostics, therapeutics, and PPE. We urge the World Bank
    Group and the other Multilateral Development Banks to increase the
    speed of their financial support to the response.  
     
-   **<u>Boosting Global Supply and Supporting Surge Capacity</u>**  
    We must increase our investments in local production capacity for
    safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, raw materials,
    diagnostics, and medical supplies. We will help develop and sustain
    a global vaccine supply network for this pandemic and the next.  
      
    The Biden-Harris Administration is investing, through the
    U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), in local
    production capacity for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, which
    will support at least 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022.
    This includes our efforts through the Quad Vaccine Partnership of
    the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, and with peer
    Development Finance Institutions including the IFC, Proparco, and
    DEG to support vaccine manufacturing in Africa – for Africa. We
    strongly support the aim of developing a regional network of surge
    capacity to produce medical countermeasures, PPE, and other
    lifesaving treatments and supplies.

We recognize that the above immediate actions to end the pandemic
contribute to our collective longer-term preparedness. We are committed
to developing sustainable surge capacity in every region to scale up
medical countermeasures and supply production on a “no regrets” basis at
the first sign of a health crisis.

Simultaneously, we will work expeditiously to advance global health
security to prevent future biological catastrophes:

-   **<u>Transform Disease Surveillance and Early Warning</u>**  
    We must substantially strengthen the rapid detection of infectious
    disease threats. We will support the establishment of a
    coordinated global surveillance network to improve disease
    forecasting and surveillance, enable swift detection of pathogens,
    and translate early detection into action. We commit to accelerate
    development, production, and deployment of safe and effective
    countermeasures within 100 days.  
      
    The Biden-Harris Administration is investing $500 million from the
    ARP to modernize public health data and infrastructure including
    establishing a new Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Outbreak
    Analytics at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
    which will help lead a new global pandemic early warning network.
    The American Jobs Plan (AJP) includes $30 billion toward building
    U.S. pandemic readiness, including by accelerating our ability
    to develop, produce, and deploy safe and effective countermeasures
    within 100 days.   
     
-   **<u>Advance Global Health Security</u>**  
    We must work with other countries and private sector partners to
    reach agreement by the 2021 UN General Assembly on the creation of a
    catalytic global health security financing mechanism and for its
    sustainable funding. We also commit to establishing the needed
    governance, oversight, accountability and transparency for future
    health security threats. The Biden-Harris Administration is
    spearheading an effort, building a coalition of public and private
    partners around the world, to come to consensus and establish and
    sustainably fund a global health security financing mechanism
    in 2021. We have also requested at least $250 million through the
    President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request to support seed funding
    for this mechanism this year. We look forward to progress before
    this year’s United Nations General Assembly, including consensus on
    the governance and transparency required for future health
    emergencies. In this regard, the Biden-Harris Administration
    welcomes the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and
    Response (IPPPR) recommendation to establish a Global Health Threats
    Council at the UN. 

And we will go further to Build Back Better:

-   **<u>Build Resilience to Recover</u>**  
    We will not stop with ending the pandemic: we must also invest in
    the global recovery from COVID-19. The Biden-Harris Administration
    strongly supports assisting countries in recovering from the
    pandemic’s aftershocks. We seek to reorient our development finance
    tools to strengthen health systems, catalyze infrastructure
    investment in for low-and middle-income countries and reverse
    the secondary impacts that have sent millions into poverty and
    hunger, disrupting and destabilizing education, political, economic,
    and social systems. We strongly support the effort to
    recycle Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to further support health
    needs. We will also maintain our strong commitment to global
    education and strengthening the resiliency of food systems,
    including by mitigating the disproportionate disruptions experienced
    by women and girls.

The United States remains committed to saving lives and ending
the COVID-19 pandemic now. We look forward to the adoption of the G7+
action plan this weekend. We call on other countries and private sector
partners to support this ambition.
