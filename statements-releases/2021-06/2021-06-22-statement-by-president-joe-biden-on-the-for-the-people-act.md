title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the For the People Act
---
 
Today, Democrats in Congress unanimously came together to protect the
sacred right to vote.

In supporting the For the People Act and defending the rights of voters,
they stood united for democracy. They stood against the ongoing assault
of voter suppression that represents a Jim Crow era in the 21st Century.

Unfortunately, a Democratic stand to protect our democracy met a solid
Republican wall of opposition. Senate Republicans opposed even a
debate—even considering—legislation to protect the right to vote and our
democracy.

It was the suppression of a bill to end voter suppression—another attack
on voting rights that is sadly not unprecedented.

The creed “We Shall Overcome” is a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights
Movement. By coming together, Democrats took the next step forward in
this continuous struggle—not just on Capitol Hill, but across the
country—and a step forward to honor all those who came before us, people
of all races and ages, who sacrificed and died to protect this sacred
right.

I’ll have more to say on this next week. But let me be clear. This fight
is far from over—far from over. I’ve been engaged in this work my whole
career, and we are going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome
again—for the people, for our very democracy.
