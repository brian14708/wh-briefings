  \ House Members on\_USICA"
---
 
This morning, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with a
bipartisan group of House members – led by Foreign Affairs Committee
Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member McCaul – at the White House to discuss
the vital importance of investing in domestic sources of strength that
will allow us to grow our economy, bolster the middle class, and
out-compete China and the rest of the world.  
  
During the meeting – which also included Rep. Gallagher, Rep. Matsui,
Rep. Bera, Rep. Slotkin, and Rep. Turner – National Security Advisor
Sullivan discussed a range of issues, including the success of the
President’s recent trip to Europe in rallying democracies around a
shared agenda.  
  
Sullivan also stressed the importance of linking our foreign policy
objectives with making vital investments to grow our economy, including
through passing bipartisan legislation like the U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act (USICA) and the National Science Foundation for the
Future Act – which incorporates key components of the vision the
President laid out through the American Jobs Plan, including in
bolstering R&D in areas like climate technology, and strengthening
advanced manufacturing, supply chain resiliency, and the American
semiconductor industry.
