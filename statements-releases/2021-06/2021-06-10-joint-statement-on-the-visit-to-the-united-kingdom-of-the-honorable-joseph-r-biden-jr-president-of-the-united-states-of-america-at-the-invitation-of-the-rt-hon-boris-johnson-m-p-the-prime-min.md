title: "Joint Statement on the Visit to the United Kingdom of the Honorable Joseph\
  \ R. Biden, Jr., President of the United\_States of America at the Invitation of\
  \ the Rt. Hon. Boris Johnson, M.P., the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of\
  \ Great Britain and Northern\_Ireland"
---
 
Today, President Biden visited the U.K. at the invitation of the Prime
Minister and in advance of the G7 Summit. The President and the Prime
Minister set out a global vision in a new Atlantic Charter to deepen
cooperation in democracy and human rights, defence and security, science
and innovation, and economic prosperity, with renewed joint efforts to
tackle the challenges posed by climate change, biodiversity loss, and
emerging health threats.

**DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, & MULTILATERALISM**

1.  Building on the U.K. G7 Presidency’s focus on open societies, and
    looking ahead to the U.S.-hosted Summit for Democracy, the U.S. and
    U.K. will continue to make practical efforts to support open
    societies and democracy across the globe. We will do this by
    defending media freedom, advancing a free and open internet,
    combatting corruption, tackling disinformation, protecting civic
    space, advancing women’s political empowerment, protecting freedom
    of religion or belief, and promoting human rights of all people. 
    The United Nations remains the cornerstone of the international
    system, and its foundational principles reflect our shared values. 
    In the 75 years since the UN’s creation, international security has
    been increasingly challenged by threats that do not recognise
    borders: climate change, pandemics, famine, migration, organised
    crime, and terrorism. The U.K. and U.S. will work with the UN and
    our international partners to continue to adapt and reform the
    international system to tackle these evolving threats and to build
    back better for the 21st century, while remaining true to the
    universal founding principles of the UN and the core values of its
    Charter. We commit to promoting peaceful and inclusive societies to
    reduce injustice, inequality, poverty, and hunger worldwide. We
    carry responsibility for creating sustainable and viable conditions
    to global economic challenges through our commitment to the G7
    Agenda and 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, and we will work
    together to address pre-existing inequities and inequalities being
    exacerbated by COVID-19, ensuring they no longer go unaddressed. The
    U.S. and U.K. are committed to promoting the advancement of
    gender equity and equality as a key pillar of foreign policy and
    national security, including through educating girls, empowering
    women socially, economically, and politically, and ending violence
    against women and girls. 

**DEFENCE & SECURITY**

1.  We commit to enhance further the world’s strongest bilateral
    defence, security, and intelligence partnership to overcome the
    evolving threats of the twenty-first century. This includes threats
    and challenges associated with: cyberspace, foreign interference,
    harmful influence campaigns, illicit finance, violent conflict and
    extremism, and terrorism in all its forms. To this end, we will
    continue our partnership on those challenges, including working
    together closely on cyber security, countering illicit finance, and
    tackling all forms of terrorism by working together to address it
    online and enhance international collaboration on thwarting violent
    extremism that is racially, ethnically or ideologically motivated,
    including a range of hateful and white supremacist ideologies.  
     
2.  Through strong and principled leadership we will work to shape and
    secure the international order of the future with NATO as the
    bedrock of our collective defence. We will work together to further
    strengthen and modernise NATO, and increase its common funding, so
    the Alliance can harness the full range of military and non-military
    capabilities to contest existing and new threats, including
    malicious cyber activity and attacks that test the resiliency of our
    societies. We intend to take operational measures to modernise and
    integrate our armed forces, and strengthen bilateral cooperation on
    next generation capabilities. Last month, the U.K.’s new aircraft
    carrier, HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH, sailed on her first operational
    mission with U.S. and U.K. F-35 aircraft on board – a demonstration
    of the unique interoperability of our Armed Forces.  As we maintain
    close alignment on our nuclear deterrence and modernisation
    programs, we reaffirm our commitment to effective arms control and
    nuclear security, and to the goal of a world without nuclear
    weapons. We will draw on our extensive diplomatic, defence,
    security, civil and scientific cooperation to ensure Space is a safe
    and secure environment for all.   
     
3.  We look forward to bringing into force a robust bilateral data
    access agreement, to be based on a mutual recognition that both
    countries have an appropriately high level of data protection, that
    allows law enforcement investigations on both sides of the Atlantic
    to obtain the evidence needed to bring offenders to justice, whilst
    maintaining rigorous privacy standards. We will work together to
    maintain tightly-controlled lawful access to communications content
    that is vital to the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes
    including terrorism and child abuse. And we will work in partnership
    with technology companies to do this, protecting the safety of our
    citizens.

**SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY**

1.  We will develop a new landmark bilateral technology partnership in
    2021/22. It will enable a new era of strategic cooperation to
    guarantee: the safety and security of our citizens; that we continue
    to lead the world in R&D; wealth creation and tackling inequality;
    the values of liberal democracies, open societies and open markets;
    and that all of these are codified in and threaded throughout the
    design and use of technology globally We will strengthen cooperation
    in areas such as: ensuring the diversity, resilience and security of
    our critical supply chains; enabling our industries and research
    institutions to develop and apply existing and emerging technologies
    such as AI, quantum, and battery technologies; and reducing barriers
    to the accessibility and flow of data to support economic growth,
    public safety and scientific & technological progress.  
     
2.  We will continue to strengthen collaboration in science and
    technology. This will facilitate increased joint world-class
    research, as well as encourage the development of rules, norms and
    standards governing data sharing, technology, and the digital
    economy that reflect our values and principles. We will cooperate on
    the basis of openness, transparency, and reciprocity, and in hope of
    ensuring that our collaborative research benefits our people. We
    will combine our expertise to tackle global challenges, such as
    cancer, antimicrobial resistance, climate change, and pandemic
    preparedness. We will do this through closer coordination between
    the Prime Minister’s Council for Science and Technology and the
    President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and
    through closer collaboration between U.S. and U.K. senior science
    and technology advisers.

**TRADE & PROSPERITY**

1.  We commit to deepening and strengthening our vital economic and
    trading partnership. We commit to the rapid settlement of the Large
    Civil Aircraft dispute.  Both countries recognise that trade, when
    done right, can support our mutual interest in sustainable and green
    growth, good jobs for our workers, new opportunities for our
    innovators and businesses, and high labour and environmental
    standards.  We will therefore work closely to identify and pursue
    opportunities to deepen our already extensive trade
    relationship.                
     
2.  We reaffirm our commitment to spur economic regeneration and build
    back better in a way that benefits all communities that have
    experienced the pain of economic change and advances equality for
    all – not just in cities, but also small towns and post-industrial
    areas.  Mindful of the distributional consequences of economic
    policy and that current economic models do not serve all equally in
    society or adequately tackle issues such as the climate crisis, and
    recognising the need for equality of opportunity, we intend to
    launch a new joint initiative that brings together experts,
    practitioners and officials to advance a new “common sense” about
    how the economy works and the goals it should promote; the
    initiative will share best practice and review the evidence around
    public policies to tackle structural inequalities across the economy
    and deliver prosperity across society.  
     
3.  We are proud to welcome G7 leaders’ discussions around a
    values-driven, high-standard
    and transparent, infrastructure partnership that seeks
    to collectively mobilise private-sector capital through catalytic
    investments      in low- and middle-income countries from our
    development finance tools. We look forward to discussing the outline
    of this new partnership with our G7 partners in Carbis Bay.  
     
4.  We also welcome the efforts underway through the G20/OECD Inclusive
    Framework to address the tax challenges arising from globalisation
    and the digitalisation of the economy and to adopt a global minimum
    tax. We commit to reaching an equitable solution on the allocation
    of taxing rights, with market countries awarded taxing rights on at
    least 20% of profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most
    profitable multinational enterprises. We will provide for
    appropriate coordination between the application of the new
    international tax rules and the removal of all Digital Services
    Taxes, and other relevant similar measures, on all companies. We
    also commit to a global minimum tax of at least 15% on a country by
    country basis. We agree on the importance of progressing agreement
    in parallel on both Pillars and look forward to reaching an
    agreement at the July meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central
    Bank Governors.

**CLIMATE & NATURE**

1.  Together we will work to: rally all countries to strengthen their
    climate ambitions; achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement; keep
    within reach the goal of limiting global average temperature rise to
    no more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels; and bend the
    curve of biodiversity loss by 2030.  We will champion the best
    available science – particularly reports from the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy
    Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services – and welcome
    global partnerships, including  the COP26 Policy Dialogue on a
    Transition to Sustainable Agriculture and the Agriculture Innovation
    Mission for Climate to increase and accelerate research and
    development for innovation in agricultural food systems; and support
    a resilient transition to decarbonised economies with quality job
    opportunities; and make progress on climate action in a gender
    responsive manner.  We underscore our commitment to achieving net
    zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and call on all other
    countries to do likewise.  We welcome the G7’s creation of an
    Industrial Decarbonisation Agenda (IDA), which will help drive
    innovation in, and lower costs of, the decarbonisation of heavy
    industrial sectors around the world.   
     
2.  We are committed to achieving an ambitious outcome at COP26 and to
    the collective developed country goal of mobilising $100 billion
    annually through to 2025 from a wide variety of public and private
    sources in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and
    transparency on implementation.  We are both increasing our climate
    finance from 2020, including for adaptation, and are continuing to
    pursue additional opportunities to increase climate finance
    mobilisation.  We intend to provide support to countries to enable
    adaptation, and address the effects of climate impacts, including
    through finance for nature-based solutions, and by scaling up
    disaster risk-management, including through the Risk-Informed Early
    Action Partnership. We are committed to mainstreaming nature across
    all sectors and into economic decision-making.   We also commit to
    working even more closely together on forests, including through the
    Forest Agriculture, and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue, the ocean,
    and finance for nature to conserve, protect and restore natural
    ecosystems including by championing an ambitious post-2020 Global
    Biodiversity Framework.   
     
3.  Recognising the impact that energy has on our national security,
    economy, net-zero ambitions, and shared prosperity, we are launching
    a new ‘Strategic Energy Dialogue’, led by the U.K. Department for
    Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the U.S. Department of
    Energy. This dialogue aims to deepen our cooperation in areas such
    as the development and deployment of innovative, clean energy
    technologies, industrial decarbonisation, nuclear energy, energy
    security and resilience, joint priorities in multilateral energy
    forums, and shared science, research, and innovation cooperation.

**HEALTH**

1.  We are determined to work together to overcome the current pandemic,
    which has reversed progress on improving the human condition, and to
    be better prepared in the future.  Reflecting our shared strength in
    science and technology, we commit to enhancing our cooperation on
    tackling variants of concern and emerging infectious disease threats
    with pandemic or epidemic potential. This will be underpinned by
    collaboration between the new U.K. Health Security Agency (U.K.HSA)
    Centre for Pandemic Preparedness and the new U.S. National Center
    for Epidemic Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics.  Our collective
    strength in science will allow us to: scale up surveillance and
    genomic sequencing capacity, as well as variant assessment
    capabilities; adopt a One Health approach to account for animal
    health, and zoonotic and environmental risk; and support others
    without these capabilities.  We welcome the plan to establish an
    integrated global surveillance system – the Global Pandemic Radar –
    and commit to working with the WHO and other partners to take this
    forward. Enhancing global surveillance is critical to achieving our
    collective ambition to deliver safe, effective and affordable
    vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics within 100 days of a future
    pandemic threat being identified.  We are committed to working
    together with fellow G7 chief scientists to drive progress toward
    the bold 100 day ambition and report back to G7 leaders on next
    steps later this year.  We will strengthen collaboration on G7
    action on clinical trials for vaccines and therapeutics, through
    more coordinated research agendas and better sharing of data and
    results.    
     
2.  We look forward to normalising two-way travel between our two
    countries.  We will establish a joint U.K.-U.S. Experts’ Working
    Group, which will share expertise and provide recommendations to
    leaders on the return of safe and sustainable international travel,
    demonstrating the commitment of both countries to tackle COVID-19
    together.  
     
3.  We will work together to help increase global vaccine supply through
    investments in manufacturing of safe and effective vaccines and the
    materials needed to produce them.    We will promote the timely
    availability of vaccines, key components and equipment by
    encouraging bilateral trade and investment and avoiding export
    restrictions or other supply chain disruption. We will work together
    to strengthen multilateral vaccine initiatives, in particular COVAX
    and its partner organisations CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO. We will
    support resource mobilisation for partner financing needs, and work
    with international financial institutions to build delivery capacity
    in-country and develop long term, sustainable financing models to
    increase pandemic preparedness and response and global health
    security. To this end, the U.K. and U.S. will work together with
    likeminded countries to explore options for a new sustainable,
    catalytic health security financing mechanism. We will bring
    together government and industry to encourage further investment to
    tackle COVID-19 and prepare for the next health security threat,
    including by strengthening preparedness and resilience, increasing
    R&D spending, and tackling new variants. We will continue to help
    allies and partners accelerate implementation of, and compliance
    with, the International Health Regulations (IHR). To move towards
    this goal, we will both strive to promote and advance the Global
    Health Security Agenda and its bold 2024 target, including through
    capacity building to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious
    disease threats.  
     
4.  The U.K. and U.S. recognise the central importance of the WHO in
    global health security. The U.K. and the U.S. will work together and
    with like-minded Member States to implement the WHO strengthening
    resolution adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2021. We will
    also support a timely, transparent and evidence-based independent
    process for the next phase of the WHO-convened COVID-19 origins
    study, including in China, and for investigating outbreaks of
    unknown origin in the future. We will take account of the
    recommendations of the International Panel for Pandemic Preparedness
    and Response as we work together to learn the lessons from the
    pandemic and strengthen future preparedness.  We commit to advancing
    critical areas in global health, including strengthening health
    systems and building regional and country capacity to better
    withstand future shocks; expanding the availability, accessibility,
    and quality of essential health services among the world’s most
    vulnerable, marginalized, and inadequately-served; and prioritizing
    maternal, neonatal and child health, nutrition, malaria,
    tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.  We will also establish an
    institution-to-institution partnership to strengthen our approach to
    reducing health inequalities.   We will elevate our partnership on
    Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights advancing our renewed
    commitment throughout the 76<sup>th</sup> United Nations General
    Assembly. .  We call on regional, local and national actors to
    support these efforts.  
     
5.  We will convene the first U.S.-U.K. Bilateral Cancer Summit and
    bring together researchers, patients, and other stakeholders to
    share ideas and identify opportunities for collaboration to
    accelerate advances in lifesaving approaches to cancer, which
    remains a leading cause of death worldwide.

**COMMITMENT TO NORTHERN IRELAND**

1.  Northern Ireland has taken huge strides forward since its courageous
    leaders put reconciliation and progress before violence and division
    23 years ago. We are proud of the achievements of the Belfast/Good
    Friday Agreement, and we remain fully committed to its three strand
    approach, that: established the democratic institutions in Northern
    Ireland; provided for consultation, co-operation and action across
    the island of Ireland; and created structures for British-Irish
    engagement. It took a deep partnership between the U.K., Ireland,
    and the U.S. to support the people of Northern Ireland in bringing
    the Troubles to an end, and it will take a continued and ongoing
    partnership to advance and safeguard Northern Ireland’s stability
    and prosperity into the future.  
     
2.  Today, the U.K. and U.S. reaffirm their commitment to working
    closely with all parties to the Agreement to protect its delicate
    balance and realise its vision for reconciliation, consent,
    equality, respect for rights, and parity of esteem. Unlocking
    Northern Ireland’s tremendous potential is a vital part of
    safeguarding the stability created by the Agreement, and the U.K.
    and the U.S. will continue working together towards that shared
    goal.
