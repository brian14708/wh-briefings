Earlier this week, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer
traveled to Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, and Mauritania. He was joined by
National Security Council Senior Director for Africa Dana Banks and
Deputy Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Michael Gonzales. The
trip underscored the Biden Administration’s commitment to partnering
with African nations to solve global challenges and advance shared
interests.  
  
In Nigeria, Mr. Finer met with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama, and other senior Nigerian officials.
Mr. Finer affirmed the importance of the bilateral relationship and
underscored our shared commitment to democratic values. The two
delegations discussed U.S. support for Nigerian efforts to address
regional security challenges, including maritime security in the Gulf of
Guinea. Mr. Finer expressed the U.S. commitment to work together to
combat climate change, terrorism, and corruption, and support human
rights and the rule of law. The delegations discussed the Build Back
Better World (B3W) initiative, a values-driven, high-standard, and
transparent G7 infrastructure partnership. Finally, they agreed to work
together to strengthen global health security and end the COVID-19
pandemic, an effort that includes the over 7.5 million vaccine doses
donated to Nigeria by the United States to date.  
  
In Equatorial Guinea, Mr. Finer met with President Teodoro Obiang Nguema
Mbasogo, Vice President Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, and other senior
officials to discuss ways to enhance maritime security and end the
COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
In Mauritania, Mr. Finer met with President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani,
Minister for Foreign Affairs Ismael Ould Cheikh Ahmed, Minister of
Defense Hanana Sidi, and other senior Mauritanian officials. He
expressed U.S. support for Mauritania’s efforts to combat terrorism,
address long-standing human rights concerns, combat corruption, and
defeat COVID-19. They also discussed the B3W initiative. While in
Mauritania, Mr. Finer met with the Executive Secretary and the staff of
the G5 Sahel. He also met with alumni of the Young African Leaders
Initiative (YALI).
