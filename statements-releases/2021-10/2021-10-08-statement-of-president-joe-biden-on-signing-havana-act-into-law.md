title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on Signing HAVANA Act Into\_Law"
---
 
Today, I was pleased to sign the HAVANA Act into law to ensure we are
doing our utmost to provide for U.S. Government personnel who have
experienced anomalous health incidents.  I want to thank Congress for
passing it with unanimous bipartisan support, sending the clear message
that we take care of our own.  Civil servants, intelligence officers,
diplomats, and military personnel all around the world have been
affected by anomalous health incidents.  Some are struggling with
debilitating brain injuries that have curtailed their careers of service
to our nation.  Addressing these incidents has been a top priority for
my Administration.  We are bringing to bear the full resources of the
U.S. Government to make available first-class medical care to those
affected and to get to the bottom of these incidents, including to
determine the cause and who is responsible.  Protecting Americans and
all those who serve our country is our first duty, and we will do
everything we can to care for our personnel and their families.
