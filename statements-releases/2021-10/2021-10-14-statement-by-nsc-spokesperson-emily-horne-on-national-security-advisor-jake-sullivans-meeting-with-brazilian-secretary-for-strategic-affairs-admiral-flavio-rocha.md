Today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Brazilian
Secretary for Strategic Affairs Admiral Flávio Rocha at the White House
to build on the bilateral agenda established in Brasilia in August. They
committed to coordinate on multilateral priorities at the UN Security
Council in advance of Brazil’s 2022-2023 term. A bilateral interagency
working group was established to expand security cooperation in advance
of Brazil hosting the UNITAS multinational maritime exercise in 2022. On
migration, both Sullivan and Rocha reaffirmed bilateral commitments to
advance regional cooperation on migration management. Mr. Sullivan
applauded Brazil for fully vaccinating 47 percent of its population
against COVID-19, reiterated U.S. support for Brazil’s accession to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and emphasized
the need for concrete progress on climate by all parties at the upcoming
UN Climate Change Conference. The U.S. and Brazilian teams also engaged
in a follow-on meeting to revitalize bilateral cooperation on
information communications technology.
