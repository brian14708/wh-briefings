  \ the Build Back Better\_Act"

This afternoon, the President and Vice President joined a meeting with
chairs and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional
Hispanic Caucus, Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus,
Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, Congressional Women’s Caucus, and
White House senior staff to discuss continued progress on negotiations
for the Build Back Better Act.

Their conversations centered on momentum toward a final deal, and on
groundbreaking, long-sought provisions that each of the caucuses have
fought for over many years. The President, the Vice President, and the
Members agreed that the package they are closing in on would mean
unprecedented progress for the constituencies these caucuses represent.
They also discussed the fight to ensure that the package delivers the
biggest investment in defeating climate change in history; game-changing
reforms to help families afford the costs of raising children like the
Child Tax Credit, paid family and medical leave, and universal
pre-school; and historic strides in terms of making health care more
affordable.

They agreed to keep pushing for an agreement as soon as possible, so
that each component of the President’s economic vision—the Build Back
Better Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal—can become law and
start giving middle class families breathing room as soon as possible.
