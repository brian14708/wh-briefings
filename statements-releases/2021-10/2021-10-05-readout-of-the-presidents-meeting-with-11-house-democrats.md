title: "Readout of the President\u2019s Meeting with 11 House\_Democrats"
---
 
Following yesterday’s virtual meeting with progressive members of the
House, this morning the President met virtually with 11 additional House
members about the pathway forward for the bipartisan Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act as well as his Build Back Better agenda. They
had a productive discussion about how each of these economic growth
packages, both physical and human infrastructure, are central to how we
ensure our economy delivers for the middle class and secure our
competitiveness in the world. The group renewed their commitment to
getting each bill passed so that we can make investing in families the
heart of our economic growth strategy. They also discussed how much it
resonated with the American people that Build Back Better’s investments
in our economic growth are paid for by undoing tax breaks for the rich
and big corporations that are holding us back from making the
investments we need to compete in the world, with a price tag of zero.
They agreed to stay in touch about the way forward on both bills.
