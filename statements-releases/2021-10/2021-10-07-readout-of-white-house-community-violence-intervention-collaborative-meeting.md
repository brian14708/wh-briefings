title: "Readout of White\_House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative\_Meeting"
---
 
Yesterday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House
Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez convened a meeting of
The White House Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Collaborative, a
cohort of 16 jurisdictions committed to using American Rescue Plan
funding or other public funding to scale and strengthen their CVI
infrastructure. Investing in evidence-based community violence
interventions to reduce gun violence is a key pillar of President
Biden’s comprehensive strategy to prevent and respond to gun crime.
Mayors, law enforcement leaders, CVI experts, and representatives from
more than a dozen philanthropic institutions participated in today’s
meeting, along with the four lead training and technical assistance
(TTA) providers—Cities United, Community Based Public Safety Collective,
Health Alliance for Violence Intervention (HAVI), and the National
Institute of Criminal Justice Reform—and Hyphen, which anchors the
initiative.  
  
Announced in June, the Collaborative is an 18-month initiative to
enhance partnerships and coordination in each jurisdiction and to
facilitate peer-to-peer learning around effective community-based public
safety strategies. National experts and federal agencies are providing
training and technical assistance (TTA) to help communities assess their
existing public safety ecosystem, identify gaps, and build the capacity
to expand programming that saves lives and provides needed services to
communities impacted by gun violence.  
  
Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice stressed the continued urgency for
CVI in communities and channeling these resources to local
community-based organizations that engage Black and Brown communities
and those hardest hit by gun violence. Intergovernmental Affairs
Director Julie Rodriguez facilitated a discussion with mayors and city
officials who shared their on-going commitment to support community
violence interventions and described how the Collaborative is helping
them to strengthen and more effectively align their programs.  
  
During the meeting, Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul, Minnesota outlined
his belief that evidence-based community violence interventions have
already helped ensure public safety in his community and that the work
of the Collaborative, coupled with President Biden’s strategy to reduce
and prevent gun crime, should serve as a blueprint for communities
around the country.  
  
White House staff shared updates on other Biden-Harris administration’s
efforts to invest in and support CVI, including recent
[guidance](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/CDBG-CV-Community-Violence-Intervention-Quick-Guide.pdf)
issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that explains
how communities can apply to use funds from the $3.4 billion Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to support CVI strategies and
