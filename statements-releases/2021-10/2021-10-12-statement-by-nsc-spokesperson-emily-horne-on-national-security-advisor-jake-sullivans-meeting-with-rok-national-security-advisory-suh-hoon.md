National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with the Republic of
Korea (ROK) National Security Advisor Suh Hoon, and both emphasized the
important role of the U.S.-ROK alliance as the linchpin of peace,
prosperity and security in northeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific.
Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Suh held detailed discussions on the current
security situation in the region and called on the DPRK to enter into
serious and sustained diplomacy towards the complete denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Sullivan stressed the need for the DPRK to
refrain from escalatory actions and also reaffirmed U.S. support for
inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation. They acknowledged the important
steps taken to broaden and expand the U.S.-ROK relationship following
President Moonâ€™s visit to Washington in May, and committed to deepening
cooperation in critical areas such as advanced technology, secure and
trustworthy 5G, resilient supply chains, and global health.
