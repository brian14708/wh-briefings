National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan hosted Israeli National Security
Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata and a senior Israeli interagency delegation at
the White House on October 5 for a meeting of the U.S.-Israel Strategic
Consultative Group. The meeting was attended by senior U.S. and Israeli
defense, military, intelligence, and diplomatic officials. The two sides
exchanged views on the most pressing challenges impacting the security
and stability of the region, and expressed their shared determination to
address the threats facing Israel and regional partners. Mr. Sullivan
emphasized President Biden’s fundamental commitment to Israel’s security
and to ensuring that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. Mr. Sullivan
explained that this administration believes diplomacy is the best path
to achieve that goal, while also noting that the President has made
clear that if diplomacy fails, the United States is prepared to turn to
other options. The National Security Advisors agreed to maintain an open
and constructive dialogue, and to expand the close coordination between
their respective interagency teams on vital issues impacting Israel’s
national security and regional stability.
