This week, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will travel to
Zurich, Switzerland, Brussels, Belgium and Paris, France.

In Zurich, Mr. Sullivan will meet with Chinese Communist Party Politburo
Member and Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission Yang

President Xi as we continue to seek to responsibly manage the
competition between the United States and the People’s Republic of
China.

In Brussels and Paris, Mr. Sullivan will reaffirm the importance of the
Transatlantic alliance and consult on a range of shared interests. He
will also debrief his meeting with Director Yang to our European allies
and partners.

In Brussels, Mr. Sullivan will meet with NATO Allied National Security
Advisors in the North Atlantic Council to discuss ongoing implementation
of the June Summit decisions to modernize the Alliance and address a
range of strategic challenges. While in Brussels, Mr. Sullivan will also
meet with European Commission and European Council officials. He will be
joined by Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh for additional
European Union meetings on trade, technology, and global economic
issues.

In Paris, Mr. Sullivan will meet with National Security Advisor Emmanuel
Bonne as part of our ongoing consultations on shared bilateral and
regional interests, including preparations for the meeting of President
Biden and President Macron in Europe later this month.
