President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Mario
Draghi of Italy to affirm the strength of the U.S.-Italy bilateral
relationship and thank the Prime Minister for his personal leadership of
the G20 during a year of overlapping global challenges. Both leaders
recognized the historic achievement of a global minimum tax, building
resilience against future pandemics, and the commitment to rapidly
decarbonize how we produce electricity. President Biden thanked Prime
Minister Draghi for all Italy has done to support the people of
Afghanistan, including by convening an extraordinary G20 session to
address counter-terrorism efforts and humanitarian aid, and by
temporarily housing over 4,000 Afghans en route to the United States
last August.  The leaders discussed challenges to security in the
Mediterranean Sea region and reaffirmed the importance of NATO’s efforts
to deter and defend against threats from every strategic direction. The
leaders also reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to the bilateral
relationship and to the Transatlantic bond, including through NATO. They
emphasized the importance of the U.S.-EU partnership, including ongoing
work to ensure the rules governing the 21st century economy are based in
shared democratic values.
