  \ Synagogue\_Shooting"

In our country, everyone has the right to go to work, to go to school,
to walk down the street, to pray – not as the other, not as them, but as
us. When a white supremacist murdered and injured innocent people at the
Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, a harm was committed against all
of us. It was an unspeakable act fueled by antisemitic hate, the
deadliest attack on the American Jewish community in our Nation’s
history. As we remember the victims, we also honor the courage of the
first responders.  
  
Today, we know that silence is not an option. More hate crimes were
committed in the U.S. last year than at any point in the last 20
years. Our Administration has laid out a comprehensive strategy to
address domestic terrorism, and we are working to reduce gun violence.
President Joe Biden has taken executive action to protect houses of
worship, and he has signed legislation to bolster our capacity to
counter unlawful acts of hate.  
  
We stand in solidarity with the Squirrel Hill community and the entire
Jewish community. We will never forget those lives that were taken. And
we recommit to combat antisemitism wherever it exists.
