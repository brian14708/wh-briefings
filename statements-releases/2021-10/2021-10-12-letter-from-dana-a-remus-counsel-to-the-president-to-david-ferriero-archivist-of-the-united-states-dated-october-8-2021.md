David Ferriero  
Archivist of the United States  
National Archives and Records Administration 700 Pennsylvania Ave.,
N.W.  
Washington, D.C., 20408

Dear Mr. Ferriero,

I write in response to your notification of September 8, 2021, regarding
a set of documents requested by the House Select Committee to
Investigate the January 6<sup>th</sup> Attack on the United States
Capitol (the “Documents”), and provided to the White House for review
pursuant to the Presidential Records Act. After my consultations with
the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, President
Biden has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in
the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified
as to any of the Documents.

As President Biden has stated, the insurrection that took place on
January 6, and the extraordinary events surrounding it, must be subject
to a full accounting to ensure nothing similar ever happens again.
Congress has a compelling need in service of its legislative functions
to understand the circumstances that led to these horrific events. The
available evidence to date establishes a sufficient factual predicate
for the Select Committee’s investigation: an unprecedented effort to
obstruct the peaceful transfer of power, threatening not only the safety
of Congress and others present at the Capitol, but also the principles
of democracy enshrined in our history and our Constitution. The
Documents shed light on events within the White House on and about
January 6 and bear on the Select Committee’s need to understand the
facts underlying the most serious attack on the operations of the
Federal Government since the Civil War.

These are unique and extraordinary circumstances. Congress is examining
an assault on our Constitution and democratic institutions provoked and
fanned by those sworn to protect them, and the conduct under
investigation extends far beyond typical deliberations concerning the
proper discharge of the President’s constitutional responsibilities. The
constitutional protections of executive privilege should not be used to
shield, from Congress or the public, information that reflects a clear
and apparent effort to subvert the Constitution itself.

The President’s determination applies solely to the Documents as
described herein, which were provided to the White House on September 8,
2021. We continue to review materials you provided to the White House
after that date and will respond at an appropriate time.

We understand that the former President believes that executive
privilege should be asserted with respect to a subset of the Documents.
When you notify us of such an assertion, we will respond accordingly.

Sincerely,  
  
Dana A. Remus  
Counsel to the President
