  \ Respect to\_Sudan"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan declared in
Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997, is to continue in effect
beyond November 3, 2021.

Sudan made strides in its transition toward democracy since 2019, but
the military takeover of the government and arrest of civilian leaders
now threaten those positive gains.  The crisis that led to the
declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13067; the
expansion of that emergency in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006;
and the taking of additional steps with respect to that emergency in
Executive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006, Executive Order 13761 of
January 13, 2017, and Executive Order 13804 of July 11, 2017, has not
been resolved.  The situation in Darfur continues to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to
continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, as
expanded by Executive Order 13400, with respect to Sudan.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
October 28, 2021.
