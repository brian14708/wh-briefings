---
 
Today, we celebrate National Coming Out Day and the courage of LGBTQ+
people who live their lives with pride, create community with open arms
and hearts, and showcase the strength of being your authentic self.
Today and every day, I want every member of the LGBTQ+ community to know
that you are loved and accepted just the way you are – regardless of
whether or not you’ve come out.  
  
My Administration is committed to ensuring that LGBTQ+ people can live
openly, proudly, and freely in every corner of our nation. I am proud to
lead an Administration with LGBTQ+ officials serving openly at the
highest levels of government — and prouder that together we have made
historic progress advancing protections and equal opportunities for the
LGBTQ+ community. From acting on Day One to prevent and combat
discrimination, to enabling all qualified Americans – including
transgender Americans – to serve their country in uniform, to defending
the human rights of LGBTQ+ people around the world, my Administration
has been clear that we will continue to champion the dignity, equality,
and wellbeing of the LGBTQ+ community.  
  
Despite the extraordinary progress our nation has made, our work to
ensure the full promise of equality is not yet done. Anti-LGBTQ+ bills
still proliferate in state legislatures. Bullying and harassment —
particularly of young transgender Americans and LGBTQ+ people of color —
still abounds, diminishing our national character. We must continue to
stand together against these acts of hate, and stand up to protect the
rights, opportunities, physical safety, and mental health of LGBTQ+
people everywhere. From defeating discriminatory bills to passing the
Equality Act, we have more work to do to ensure that every American can
live free of fear, harassment, and discrimination because of who they
are or whom they love.  
  
To LGBTQ+ people across the country, and especially those who are
contemplating coming out: know that you are loved for who you are, you
are admired for your courage, and you will have a community — and a
nation — to welcome you. My Administration will always have your back,
and we will continue fighting for the full measure of equality, dignity,
and respect you deserve.
