Vice President Kamala Harris met today with Israeli Foreign Minister and
Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid. Vice President Harris reaffirmed
the United States’ strong support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, and
our unwavering commitment to Israel’s security.  The two leaders also
discussed the importance of advancing peace, security, and prosperity
for Palestinians and Israelis, in particular the need to improve living
conditions and ensure calm in Gaza.  They discussed a number of other
important regional issues, including efforts to ensure Iran never
acquires a nuclear weapon, and the need to counter its regional
aggression.  The Vice President affirmed U.S. support for the Abraham
Accords and welcomed recent progress in Israel’s relations with the
United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco.  They also discussed global
challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent need to enhance
efforts to address the climate crisis in advance of the upcoming United
Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26).  The two leaders also
discussed the challenges of global migration and the need to address its
root causes.  In this regard, the Vice President thanked the Minister
for Israel’s collaboration with the U.S. Agency for International
Development to improve access to water in Central America and to train
farmers in climate-smart agriculture.
