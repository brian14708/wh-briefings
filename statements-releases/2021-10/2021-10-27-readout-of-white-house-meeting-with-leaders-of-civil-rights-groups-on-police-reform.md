title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Leaders of Civil Rights Groups on Police\_\
  Reform"
---
 
Yesterday, senior officials from the White House and the Department of
Justice met with leaders from civil rights organizations to discuss
police reform.  This meeting was part of a broader effort by the
Biden-Harris Administration to consult with members of the civil rights
and law enforcement communities, members of Congress, and victims’
families to define a path forward on meaningful police reform, including
through executive actions.  
  
Officials from the Biden-Harris Administration taking part in the
meeting included Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, Senior Advisor
Cedric Richmond, and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. The
administration officials stressed the President’s belief that this
moment demands action that includes accountability for law enforcement
officers who violate their oaths.  
  
The civil rights leaders, representing a broad array of constituencies,
stressed the urgent need for action, including through broader
investments in communities.    They also highlighted the need for
increased and more detailed data collection on interactions between law
enforcement and the public, and stressed the continued need for
Congressional action to ensure comprehensive, lasting changes that
cannot be made by executive action alone.    
  
The meeting participants included:

-   Dr. Melina Abdullah, Original Organizer of Black Lives Matter
-   Bishop William Barber, National Co-Chair of the Poor People’s
    Campaign
-   Curt Decker, Executive Director of the National Disability Rights
    Network (NDRN)
