October 8, 2021

David Ferriero  
Archivist of the United States  
National Archives and Records Administration 700 Pennsylvania Ave.,
N.W.  
Washington, D.C., 20408

Dear Mr. Ferriero,

I write in response to your communication of October 8, 2021, informing
us that former President Trump has asserted executive privilege with
regard to a subset of documents requested by the House Select Committee
to Investigate the January 6<sup>th</sup> Attack on the United States
Capitol, and requesting President Biden’s views. President Biden has
considered the former President’s assertion, and I have engaged in
additional consultations with the Office of Legal Counsel at the
Department of Justice. For the same reasons described in my earlier
letter, the President maintains his conclusion that an assertion of
executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States,
and therefore is not justified as to any of the documents provided to
the White House on September 8, 2021. Accordingly, President Biden does
not uphold the former President’s assertion of privilege.

The President instructs you, in accord with Section 4(b) of Executive
Order 13489, to provide the pages identified as privileged by the former
President to the Select Committee. In light of the urgency of the Select
Committee’s need for the information, the President further instructs
you to provide those pages 30 days after your notification to the former
President, absent any intervening court order.

Sincerely,

Dana A. Remus  
Counsel to the President
