President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan of Turkey on the margins of the G20 Summit. President Biden
underscored his desire to maintain constructive relations, expand areas
of cooperation, and manage our disagreements effectively. He expressed
appreciation for Turkey’s nearly two decades of contributions to the
NATO mission in Afghanistan. The leaders discussed the political process
in Syria, the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Afghans in need,
elections in Libya, the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, and
diplomatic efforts in the South Caucasus. President Biden reaffirmed our
defense partnership and Turkey’s importance as a NATO Ally, but noted
U.S. concerns over Turkey’s possession of the Russian S-400 missile
system. He also emphasized the importance of strong democratic
institutions, respect for human rights, and the rule of law for peace
and prosperity.
