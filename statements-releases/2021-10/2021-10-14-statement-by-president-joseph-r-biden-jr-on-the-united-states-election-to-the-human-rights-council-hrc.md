  \ to the Human Rights Council\_(HRC)"

Today, I am proud that the United States was elected to serve on the UN
Human Rights Council for a three year term. I am grateful for the
support of nations from around the world for our campaign, and I look
forward to the United States once more being a constructive voice that
works to help push the Human Rights Council to live up to its mandate
and to protect the values we hold dear for all people.

As I said at the UN General Assembly last month, we stand at an
inflection point in history. The choices we make in the years ahead will
determine the kind of world we leave to future generations. The United
States stands ready to work with partners and allies to help lead the
world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future, grounded in respect for
human dignity. Together, we will stand up for the rights of all,
including women and girls, members of LGBTQI+ communities, members of
ethnic and religious minorities, those living with disabilities, and
members of other marginalized groups. We will promote accountability for
governments that abuse human rights. And we will stand in solidarity
with, and continue to work tirelessly in support of, the activists,
human rights defenders, and peaceful protestors on the front lines of
the struggle between freedom and tyranny.  
  
Defending human rights and demonstrating that democracies deliver for
their people is a fundamental challenge of our time. It’s at the center
of my administration’s foreign policy and it goes to the heart of who we
are as a nation—and as a people. And, this December, I look forward to
welcoming a diverse group of government, civil society, and private
sector actors at a virtual Summit for Democracy to affirm the power of
democratic governance as the best and most powerful tool we have to meet
the challenges of today and unleash our full human potential.
