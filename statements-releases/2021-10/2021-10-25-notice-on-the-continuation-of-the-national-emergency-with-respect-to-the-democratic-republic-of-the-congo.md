title: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to The Democratic
  Republic of the Congo
---
 
On October 27, 2006, by Executive Order 13413, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *etseq.*) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States
constituted by the situation in or in relation to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and
atrocities that continue to threaten regional stability.  The President
took additional steps to address this national emergency in Executive
Order 13671 of July 8, 2014.

The situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo
continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign
policy of the United States.  For this reason, the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13413 of October 27, 2006, as amended by
Executive Order 13671 of July 8, 2014, must continue in effect beyond
October 27, 2021.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year
the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation
to the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared in Executive Order
13413, as amended by Executive Order 13671.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                            JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

 THE WHITE HOUSE,  
October 25, 2021.
