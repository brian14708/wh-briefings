title: "President\_Biden Announces the Build Back Better\_Framework"
---
 
Joe Biden believes that there’s no greater economic engine in the world
than the hard work and ingenuity of the American people. But for too
long, the economy has worked great for those at the top, while working
families continually get squeezed. President Biden promised to rebuild
the backbone of the country – the middle class – so that this time
everyone comes along. He also campaigned on a promise to make government
work for working people again.  
  
Today, the President is delivering on these promises**. After hearing
input from all sides and negotiating in good faith with Senators Manchin
and Sinema, Congressional Leadership, and a broad swath of Members of
Congress, President Biden is announcing a framework for the Build Back
Better Act.** President Biden is confident this is a framework that can
pass both houses of Congress, and he looks forward to signing it into
law. He calls on Congress to take up this historic bill – in addition to
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act – as quickly as
possible.  
  
This framework will guide the drafting of legislative language. When
enacted, this framework will set the United States on course to meet its
climate goals, create millions of good-paying jobs, enable more
Americans to join and remain in the labor force, and grow our economy
from the bottom up and the middle out. Specifically, the Build Back
Better Act will be:

-   **The most transformative investment in children and caregiving in
    generations**. The framework will save most American families more
    than half of their spending on child care, deliver two years of free
    preschool for every 3- and 4-year-old in America, give more than 35
    million families a major tax cut by extending the expanded Child Tax
    Credit, and expand access to high-quality home care for older
    Americans and people with disabilities.  
-   **The largest effort to combat climate change in American history.**
    The framework will cut greenhouse gas pollution by well over one
    gigaton in 2030, reduce consumer energy costs, give our kids cleaner
    air and water, create hundreds of thousands of high-quality jobs,
    and advance environmental justice by investing in a 21<sup>st</sup>
    century clean energy economy – from buildings, transportation,
    industry, electricity, and agriculture to climate smart practices
    across our lands and waters.  
-   **The biggest expansion of affordable health care coverage in a
    decade**. The framework will reduce premiums for more than 9 million
    Americans by extending the expanded Premium Tax Credit, deliver
    health care coverage to up to 4 million uninsured people in states
    that have locked them out of Medicaid, and help older Americans
    access affordable hearing care by expanding Medicare.  
-   **The most significant effort to bring down costs and strengthen the
    middle class in generations.** The framework will make the single
    largest and most comprehensive investment in affordable housing in
    history, expand access to affordable, high-quality education beyond
    high school, cut taxes for 17 million low-wage workers by extending
    the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, and advance equity through
    investments in maternal health, community violence interventions,
    and nutrition, in addition to better preparing the nation for future
    pandemics and supply chain disruptions.

The framework will also improve and reform our broken immigration system
consistent with the Senate’s reconciliation rules.  
  
**And, it is fully paid for and will reduce the deficit** by making sure
that large, profitable corporations can’t zero out their tax bills, no
longer rewarding corporations that shift jobs and profits overseas,
asking more from millionaires and billionaires, and stopping rich
Americans from cheating on their tax bills. Under this historic
agreement, nobody earning less than $400,000 per year will pay a penny
more in taxes.  
  
**<u>The most transformative investment in children and caregiving in
generations</u>**:

Too many working families struggle to afford the growing cost of raising
children and too many older Americans and Americans with disabilities
cannot access affordable home care. The Build Back Better framework will
make the most transformative investment in children and caregiving in
generations. Specifically, the framework will:

-   **Provide universal and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds,
    the largest expansion of universal and free education since states
    and communities across the country established public high school
    100 years ago**. Preschool in the United States costs about $8,600
    per year. The Build Back Better framework will enable states to
    expand access to free preschool for more than 6 million children per
    year and increase the quality of preschool for many more children
    already enrolled.  Importantly, parents will be able to send
    children to high-quality preschool in the setting of their choice –
    from public schools to child care providers to Head Start. The
    program will lead to lifelong educational and economic benefits for
    children and parents, and is a transformational investment in
    America’s future economic competitiveness. In fact, research shows
    that every $1 invested in high-quality early childhood care and
    education can yield
    [$3](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23215/w23215.pdf)
    to [$7](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/705718)
    over the long-run, as they [do better in
    school](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.dartmouth.edu/dist/d/1987/files/2020/09/cascio_prek_latest.pdf),
    [are more likely to graduate high-school and
    college](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28756/w28756.pdf),
    and [earn more as
    adults](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29004/w29004.pdf).  
-   **Make the largest investment in child care in the nation’s history,
    saving most working American families more than half of their
    spending on child care.** For decades, child care prices in the
    United States have risen faster than family incomes, yet the United
    States still invests 28 times less than its competitors on helping
    families afford high-quality care for toddlers. The Build Back
    Better framework will ensure that the vast majority of working
    American families of four earning less than $300,000 per year will
    pay no more than 7 percent of their income on child care for
    children under 6. Parents who are working, looking for work,
    participating in an education or training program, and who are
    making under 2.5 times their states median income will receive
    support to cover the cost of quality care based on a sliding scale,
    capped at 7% of their income. The framework will help states expand
    access to high-quality, affordable child care to about 20 million
    children per year – covering 9 out of 10 families across the country
    with young children. For two parents with one toddler earning
    $100,000 per year, the framework will produce more than $5,000 in
    child care savings per year. Better access to high-quality child
    care can increase the likelihood that parents, especially mothers,
    are
    [employed](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9331-3)
    or
    [enroll](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775711000495)ed
    in education and training beyond high school, while also providing
    [lifetime
    benefits](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/689478)
    for children, especially those who are [economically
    disadvantaged.](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/689478https:/www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/705718)  
-   **Deliver affordable, high-quality care for older Americans and
    people with disabilities in their homes, while supporting the
    workers who provide this care.** Right now, there are hundreds of
    thousands of older Americans and Americans with disabilities on
    waiting lists for home care services or struggling to afford the
    care they need, including [more than
    800,000](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/waiting-lists-for-hcbs-waivers/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D)
    who are on state Medicaid waiting lists. A family paying for home
    care costs out of pocket currently pays around $5,800 per year for
    just four hours of home care per week. The Build Back Better
    framework will permanently improve Medicaid coverage for home care
    services for seniors and people with disabilities, making the most
    transformative investment in access to home care in 40 years, when
    these services were first authorized for Medicaid. The framework
    will improve the quality of caregiving jobs, which will, in turn,
    help to improve the quality of care provided to beneficiaries.  
-   **Provide more than 35 million households up to $3,600 (or $300 per
    month) in tax cuts per child by extending the American Rescue Plan’s
    expanded Child Tax Credit.** The Build Back Better framework will
    provide monthly payments to the parents of nearly 90 percent of
    American children for 2022 – $300 per month per child under six and
    $250 per month per child ages 6 to 17. This historic tax cut will
    help cover the cost of food, housing, health care, and
    transportation and will continue the largest one-year reduction in
    child poverty in history. And critically, the framework includes
    permanent refundability for the Child Tax Credit, meaning that the
    neediest families will continue to receive the full Child Tax Credit
    over the long-run.

**<u>The largest effort to combat climate change in American
history:</u>**

Scientists have warned for years that extreme weather will only worsen
in the wake of climate change. Millions of Americans are living this
reality in real time. In addition to the lives shattered and lost,
extreme weather fueled by climate change destroys homes, schools, and
small businesses, and cost America more than $100 billion last year
alone. Delayed action on climate also sets us back in the global race on
manufacturing and innovation and keeps us from harnessing the economic
opportunity that this moment represents.

The Build Back Better framework is the largest effort to combat the
climate crisis in American history. The framework will start cutting
climate pollution now, and deliver well over one gigaton, or a billion
metric tons, of greenhouse gas emissions reductions in 2030 – at least
ten times larger than any legislation Congress has ever passed. The
framework’s $555 billion investment represents the largest single
investment in our clean energy economy in history, across buildings,
transportation, industry, electricity, agriculture, and climate-smart
practices across lands and waters.  The framework will set the United
States on course to meet its climate targets, achieving a 50-52%
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels in 2030 in a way
that grows domestic industries and good, union jobs — and advances
environmental justice.  
  
Specifically, the Build Back Better framework will:

-   **Deliver substantial consumer rebates and ensure middle class
    families save money as they shift to clean energy and
    electrification.** The consumer rebates and credits included in the
    Build Back Better framework will save the average American family
    hundreds of dollars per year in energy costs.  These measures
    include enhancement and expansion of existing home energy and
    efficiency tax credits, as well as the creation of a new,
    electrification-focused rebate program.  The framework will cut the
    cost of installing rooftop solar for a home by around 30 percent,
    shortening the payback period by around 5 years; and the framework’s
    electric vehicle tax credit will lower the cost of an electric
    vehicle that is made in America with American materials and union
    labor by $12,500 for a middle-class family. In addition, the
    framework will help rural communities tap into the clean energy
    opportunity through targeted grants and loans through the Department
    of Agriculture.  
-   **Ensure clean energy technology – from wind turbine blades to solar
    panels to electric cars – will be built in the United States with
    American made steel and other materials**, creating hundreds of
    thousands of good jobs here at home. The Build Back Better
    legislation will target incentives to grow domestic supply chains in
    solar, wind, and other critical industries in communities on the
    frontlines of the energy transition.  In addition, the framework
    will boost the competitiveness of existing industries, like steel,
    cement, and aluminum, through grants, loans, tax credits, and
    procurement to drive capital investment in the decarbonization and
    revitalization of American manufacturing.  
-   **Advance environmental justice through a new Clean Energy and
    Sustainability Accelerator that will invest in projects around the
    country,** while delivering 40% of the benefits of investment to
    disadvantaged communities, as part of the President’s Justice40
    initiative. The framework will also fund port electrification;
    facilitate the deployment of cleaner transit, buses, and trucks; and
    support critical community capacity building, including grants to
    environmental justice communities.  In addition, the framework will
    create a new Civilian Climate Corps – with over 300,000 members that
    look like America. This diverse new workforce will conserve our
    public lands, bolster community resilience, and address the changing
    climate, all while putting good-paying union jobs within reach for
    more Americans.  
-   **Bolster resilience and natural solutions to climate change through
    a historic investment in coastal restoration, forest management, and
    soil conservation.** The framework will provide resources to
    farmers, ranchers, and forestland owners, supporting their efforts
    to reduce emissions. At its peak, the increased investments in
    climate smart agriculture alone could reach roughly 130 million
    cropland acres per year, representing as many as 240,000 farms.
    Farmers, ranchers, and forestland owners have long demonstrated
    leadership in environmental stewardship with strategies that provide
    benefits for the farm, the environment, and the public. These
    investments will help meet the demand from the farming community for
    conservation support and enable producers to realize the full
    potential of climate benefits from agriculture.

**<u>The biggest expansion of affordable health care in a
decade:</u>**  
  
Health care should be a right, not a privilege, and Americans facing
illness should never have to worry about how they are going to pay for
their treatment. While the historic Affordable Care Act (ACA) reduced
the number of uninsured Americans by more than 20 million, extended
critical consumer protections to more than 100 million people, and
strengthened and improved the nation’s health care system, too many
Americans continue to struggle to afford care. About 30 million people
were uninsured in 2019 before President Biden took office, and coverage
under the ACA (even with the premium subsidies) was too expensive for
many families. In addition to investing in protecting Americans from
future pandemics, the Build Back Better framework will expand access to
affordable coverage. In all, the framework will be the largest expansion
of health care coverage since the Affordable Care Act. Specifically, the
framework will:

-   **Strengthen the Affordable Care Act and reduce premiums for 9
    million Americans.** The framework will reduce premiums for more
    than 9 million Americans who buy insurance through the Affordable
    Care Act Marketplace by an average of $600 per person per year. For
    example, a family of four earning $80,000 per year would save nearly
    $3,000 per year (or $246 per month) on health insurance premiums.
    Experts predict that more than 3 million people who would otherwise
    be uninsured will gain health insurance.  
-   **Close the Medicaid coverage gap, leading 4 million uninsured
    people to gain coverage.** The Build Back Better framework will
    deliver health care coverage through Affordable Care Act premium tax
    credits to up to 4 million uninsured people in states that have
    locked them out of Medicaid. A 40-year old in the coverage gap would
    have to pay $450 per month for benchmark coverage – more than half
    of their income in many cases. The framework provides individuals $0
    premiums, finally making health care affordable and accessible.  
-   **Expand Medicare to cover hearing benefits.** Only 30% of seniors
    over the age of 70 who could benefit from hearing aids have ever
    used them. The Build Back Better framework will expand Medicare to
    cover hearing services, so that older Americans can access the
    affordable care they need.

**<u>The most significant effort to bring down costs and strengthen the
middle class in generations:</u>**  
  
In addition to major investments in children and care, climate, and
health, the Build Back Better framework includes targeted investments
that will reduce costs that hold back middle-class families and grow our
economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Specifically, the
framework will:

-   **Make the single largest and most comprehensive investment in
    affordable housing in history.** The framework will enable the
    construction, rehabilitation, and improvement of more than 1 million
    affordable homes, boosting housing supply and reducing price
    pressures for renters and homeowners. It will address the capital
    needs of the public housing stock in big cities and rural
    communities all across America and ensure it is not only safe and
    habitable but healthier and more energy efficient as well. It will
    make a historic investment in rental assistance, expanding vouchers
    to hundreds of thousands of additional families. And, it includes
    one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in
    history, enabling hundreds of thousands of first-generation
    homebuyers to purchase their first home and build wealth. This
    legislation will create more equitable communities, through
    investing in community-led redevelopments projects in historically
    under-resourced neighborhoods and removing lead paint from hundreds
    of thousands of homes, as well as by incentivizing state and local
    zoning reforms that enable more families to reside in higher
    opportunity neighborhoods.  
-   **Extend the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for around 17
    million low-wage workers.** Before this year, the federal tax code
    taxed low-wage childless workers into poverty or deeper into poverty
    — the only group of workers it treated this way. The Build Back
    Better framework will extend the American Rescue Plan’s tripling of
    the credit for childless workers, benefiting 17 million low-wage
    workers, many of whom are essential workers, including cashiers,
    cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation workers, and childcare
    providers. For example, a childless worker who works 30 hours per
    week at $9 per hour earns income that, after taxes, leaves them
    below the federal poverty line. By increasing her EITC to more than
    $1,100, this expansion helps pull such workers out of poverty.  
-   **Expand access to affordable, high-quality education beyond high
    school.** Education beyond high school is increasingly important for
    economic growth and competitiveness in the 21st century, even as it
    has become unaffordable for too many families. The Build Back Better
    framework will make education beyond high school – including
    training for high-paying jobs available now – more affordable.
    Specifically, the framework will increase the maximum Pell Grant by
    $550 for more the more than 5 million students enrolled in public
    and private, non-profit colleges and expand access to DREAMers. It
    will also make historic investments in Historically Black Colleges
    and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs),
    and minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to build capacity,
    modernize research infrastructure, and provide financial aid to
    low-income students. And, it will invest in practices that help more
    students complete their degree or credential. The framework will
    help more people access quality training that leads to good, union,
    and middle-class jobs. It will enable community colleges to train
    hundreds of thousands of students, create sector-based training
    opportunity with in-demand training for at least hundreds of
    thousands of workers, and invest in proven approaches like
    Registered Apprenticeships and programs to support underserved
    communities. The framework will increase the Labor Department’s
    annual spending on workforce development by 50% for each of the next
    5 years.  
-   **Promote nutrition security to support children’s health.** The
    Build Back Better framework will help children reach their full
    potential by investing in nutrition security year-round. The
    legislation will expand free school meals to 8.9 million children
    during the school year and provide a $65 per child per month benefit
    to the families of 30 million children to purchase food during the
    summer.   
-   **Strengthen the middle class through a historic investment in
    equity, safety, and fairness.** The legislation makes a
    transformative investment in Rural America through a new Rural
    Partnership Program that will empower rural regions, including
    Tribal Nations and territories, by providing flexible funding for
    locally-led projects. The Build Back Better framework will also make
    an historic investment in maternal health and establish a new and
    innovative community violence intervention initiative, in addition
    to investing in small businesses and preparing the nation for future
    pandemics and supply chain disruptions.

The Build Back Better framework includes a $100 billion investment that
will improve our immigration system by providing long awaited relief to
millions through reconciliation, and making enhancements to reduce
backlogs, expand legal representation, and make the asylum system and
border processing more efficient and humane.  
  
**<u>Fully Paying for Historic Investments</u>**  
  
The plan is fully paid for by asking more from the very largest
corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and by repealing the Trump
Administration’s rebate rule. The framework will help reverse the
windfall delivered to wealthy Americans and large corporations in the
2017 tax cut and invest the revenue in American families and workers. No
one making under $400,000 will pay a penny more in taxes.  
  
Specifically, the framework will:

-   **Stop large, profitable corporations from paying zero in tax and
    tax corporations that buyback stock rather than invest in the
    company.** In 2019, the largest corporations in the United States
    paid just 8 percent in taxes, and many paid nothing at all.
    President Biden believes this is fundamentally unfair. The Build
    Back Better framework will impose a 15% minimum tax on the corporate
    profits that large corporations—those with over $1 billion in
    profits—report to shareholders.  This means that if a large
    corporation says it is earning a billion dollars, then it can’t
    avoid paying taxes. The framework also includes a 1% surcharge on
    corporate stock buybacks, which corporate executives too often use
    to enrich themselves rather than investing workers and growing their
    businesses.  
-   **Stop rewarding corporations for shipping jobs and profits
    overseas.** President Biden has led the world to stop the race to
    the bottom in corporate taxes, while also calling for an end to
    incentives that encourage corporations to ship jobs and profits
    overseas. That’s why the President won an agreement among 136
    countries on a 15% global minimum tax. This framework will help
    finish the job. Consistent with that agreement, it’d adopt a 15%
    country-by-country minimum tax on foreign profits of U.S.
    corporations, so that they no longer receive massive tax benefits
    from shifting profits and jobs abroad.  And, these reforms would
    ensure that other countries abide by the agreement by imposing a
    penalty rate on any foreign corporations based in countries that do
    not.  Other countries will not be able to take advantage by pursuing
    a race to the bottom.  
-   **Ask the highest income Americans to pay their fair share.** The
    Build Back Better framework includes a new surtax on the income of
    multi-millionaires and billionaires – the wealthiest 0.02 percent of
    Americans. It would apply a 5 percent rate above income of $10
    million, and an additional 3 percent surtax on income above $25
    million. The Build Back Better framework will also close the
    loopholes that allows some wealthy taxpayers to avoid paying the
    3.8% Medicare tax on their earnings.  
-   **Invest in overhauling tax administration, so the wealthy finally
    pay what they owe.** Regular workers pay the taxes they owe on their
    wages and salaries—with a 99 percent compliance rate—while too many
    wealthy taxpayers hide their income from the IRS so they don’t have
    to pay. Yet, the IRS does not have the resources it needs to pursue
    wealthy tax cheats. As a result of budget cuts, audit rates on those
    making over $1 million per year fell by over 60 percent over the
    last decade, and the IRS audits only 75,000 of the 4.2 million
    partnership returns filed each year. The result of a gutted IRS is a
    two-tiered tax system, where wage earners pay all the taxes they
    owe, but the top 1 percent evades over $160 billion per year in
    taxes. The framework will create a fairer tax system through
    transformation investments in the IRS: hiring enforcement agents who
    are trained to pursue wealthy evaders, modernizing outdated IRS
    technology, and investing in taxpayer service, so regular Americans
    can get their questions answered and access to the credits and
    benefits they are entitled to. Additional enforcement resources will
    be focused on pursuing those with the highest incomes; not Americans
    with income less than $400,000.
