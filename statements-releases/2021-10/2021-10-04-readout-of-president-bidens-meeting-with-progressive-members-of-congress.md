title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with Progressive Members of\_Congress"

This afternoon, the President had a constructive virtual meeting with 12
progressive members of Congress about how critical the Build Back Better
Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill are to his vision for
ensuring our economy delivers for middle-class families, and not just
those at the very top. The group discussed their shared commitment to
seizing this moment to make investing in families the heart of our
economic growth and competitiveness strategy, paid for by repealing
failed tax giveaways for the rich and big corporations that have been
holding us back from reaching our full potential in the global economy.
They also covered the immense benefits that the infrastructure bill will
mean for communities all across this nation in terms of public transit,
climate and clean energy leadership, ensuring safe drinking water for
kids, and cleaning up pollution that disproportionately harms
communities of color. There was agreement that what mattered most with
respect to Build Back Better was following through on key priorities in
a final legislative package to make a difference in real lives.
Tomorrow, the President will host another virtual meeting with moderate
House Democrats.
