title: "Statement by the Press Secretary on the Memorandum of Understanding Between\
  \ New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut on Reciprocal Sharing of Crime\
  \ Gun\_Data"
---
 
We applaud today’s announcement by the Governors of New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut that the states’ law enforcement
agencies will share crime gun data across state lines to bolster law
enforcement operations and improve public safety. This data-sharing
agreement recognizes the reality that firearms cross state lines, and we
therefore need a multijurisdictional approach to tackling gun
violence.  
   
President Biden shares these Governors’ commitment to cross-state
collaboration to tackle the gun violence public health epidemic. In
support of the President Biden‘s [comprehensive
strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/)
to combat the epidemic of gun crime, and as a further concrete step to
implement the Department’s Comprehensive Violent Crime Reduction
Strategy, the Justice Department launched 5 multijurisdictional firearms
trafficking strike forces focused on addressing significant firearms
trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York and four other
major United States cities.  
   
We encourage other state and local officials to follow these Governors’
lead and collaborate to reduce our shared challenge of gun violence.
