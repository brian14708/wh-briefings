On September 30–October 1, Assistant Secretary of State for Western
Hemisphere Affairs Brian A. Nichols traveled to Haiti in his first
official visit as Assistant Secretary to underscore U.S. commitment to
the people of Haiti. He was accompanied by National Security
Council Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez and
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mark Wells.

As part of the U.S. Government’s ongoing engagement with a broad range
of stakeholders invested in Haiti’s future, the delegation met
with representatives from Haitian civil society, including the Montana
Group, as well as political stakeholders to reaffirm U.S. support for
inclusive Haitian-led solutions to Haitian challenges that strengthen
Haiti’s institutions. The delegation also met with Prime Minister Ariel
Henry and Foreign Minister Claude Joseph to reiterate U.S. commitment to
humane repatriation of migrants, a desire for a full and transparent
investigation into President Moise’s assassination, and to recognize
that improving the security situation in Haiti is of critical importance
to both Haiti and the United States.

The United States is a steadfast partner to Haiti, and the Biden-Harris
Administration remains committed to supporting the Haitian people during
this challenging time. As President Biden has said, the United States
remains as committed, as ever, to Haiti’s future.
