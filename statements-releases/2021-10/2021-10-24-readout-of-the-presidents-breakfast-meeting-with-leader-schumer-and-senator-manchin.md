title: "Readout of the President\u2019s Breakfast Meeting with Leader Schumer and\
  \ Senator\_Manchin"
---
 
This morning, the President hosted Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Joe
Manchin for breakfast at his home in Wilmington for what was a
productive discussion about the Build Back Better Agenda, including
equipping Americans to get back to work and making our economy deliver
for the middle class — not just those at the top. They continued to make
progress, will have their staffs work on follow-ups from the meeting,
and agreed to stay in close touch with each other and the wide range of
members who have worked hard on these negotiations.
