title: "FACT SHEET:\_ Biden Administration Releases Agency Climate Adaptation and\
  \ Resilience Plans from Across Federal Government"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration released plans developed by more
than 20 federal agencies that outline the steps each agency will take to
ensure their facilities and operations adapt to and are increasingly
resilient to climate change impacts. The plans reflect President Biden’s
whole-of-government approach to confronting the climate crisis as
agencies integrate climate-readiness across their missions and programs
and strengthen the resilience of federal assets from the accelerating
impacts of climate change. The climate adaptation and resilience plans
were previously submitted to and reviewed by the National Climate Task
Force, White House Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) Federal
Chief Sustainability Officer, and the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) in response to President Biden’s [Executive Order on Tackling the
Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/).   
  
Agencies face a multitude of risks caused by climate change, including
rising costs to maintain and repair damaged infrastructure from more
frequent and extreme weather events, challenges to program effectiveness
and readiness, and health and safety risks to federal employees who work
outside. By taking action now to better manage and mitigate climate
risks, we will minimize disruptions to federal operations, assets and
programs while creating safer working conditions for employees.  
  
To address these challenges, President Biden prioritized the
revitalization of federal agency climate adaptation and resilience
planning efforts. Through this approach, large agencies developed
adaptation and resilience plans to address their most significant
climate risks and vulnerabilities. The plans leverage procurement
decisions to drive innovation and increase resilience against supply
chain disruptions and deliver on President Biden’s commitment to invest
climate and clean energy dollars in environmental justice communities
through his [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/).  
  
As part of these efforts, agencies will embed adaptation and resilience
planning and implementation throughout their operations and programs,
and will continually update their adaptation plans. In addition to these
plans, President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda and the [Bipartisan
Infrastructure
Deal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/02/updated-fact-sheet-bipartisan-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act/)
include bold, historic, and transformational investments that will
strengthen our nation’s resilience to climate change and extreme weather
events, including upgrading power infrastructure, rebuilding America’s
roads and bridges, and more.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is making available more than 20
climate **adaptation and resilience** plans from major federal agencies.
Highlights from this year’s plans include:

-   **Safeguarding federal investments.** Agencies identified which
    programs and missions are most at risk from climate change. This
    first step is critical to ensuring the best use of taxpayer dollars
    in response to changing climatic conditions. For example, the
    **Department of Transportation** will incorporate resilience
    criteria into transportation discretionary grant and loan programs
    wherever appropriate. The **Department of Justice** will incorporate
    resilience into the design and construction specifications for new
    construction and modernization projects and the solicitation of
    future leases. Additionally, the **Department of Defense (DOD)** has
    committed to using climate intelligence, including from its
    [recently-released DoD Climate Assessment
    Tool](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/05/2002614579/-1/-1/0/DOD-CLIMATE-ASSESSMENT-TOOL.PDF),
    to inform and educate military planners and other key decision
    makers on where and how military installations are at risk from
    climate change hazards.  
-   **Identifying leadership and accountability.** For the first time,
    agencies identified senior leadership and created new accountability
    structures so that adaptation and resilience is led from the top.
    For example, several agencies, including the **Department of
    Education**, have now identified their Deputy Secretaries as Chief
    Resilience Officers. DOD [commissioned a new Climate Working
    Group](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2572605/official-describes-impacts-of-climate-change-standup-of-working-group)
    comprised of the Department’s most senior leadership to coordinate
    DOD’s climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts.  
-   **Developing a more resilient supply chain**. Agencies are revamping
    supply chain policies and operations to create a more
    climate-resilient system. For example, the **National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration (NASA)** will modify use of an existing
    tool to screen its top mission-critical supplies of goods and
    services to identify those at risk due to disruption by acute
    extreme weather events or long-term climate change. The **Department
    of Treasury** is developing contingency plans for sustaining
    critical supply chains for operational mission requirements,
    including materials needed for currency and coinage production.
    Additionally, the **Department of Energy** is identifying
    opportunities to establish clear climate adaptation requirements for
    their contractors and suppliers to employ climate adaptation and
    resilience practices.  
-   **Enhancing protections for workers and communities.** The greatest
    asset to our country and federal government is our people. Agencies
    recognize the need to better support America’s workers from the
    impacts of climate change. For example, the **Departments of
    Agriculture** and **the Interior**, together with the **Office of
    Personnel Management**, are fulfilling President Biden’s commitment
    that [federal wildland firefighters will earn a minimum of $15 per

    for their critical work. Additionally, the **Centers for Disease
    Control (CDC)** [developed a
    tool](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/heatTracker/) that
    provides real-time heat data paired with local vulnerability data
    for state and local emergency and public health planners to better
    prepare for and respond to extreme heat events.  
-   **Building a more equitable future**. Climate change and its impacts
    may exacerbate existing health and socioeconomic inequities, placing
    certain populations at particular risk. To tackle this challenge,
    agencies outlined their actions in support of this Administration’s
    environmental justice objectives. For example, the **Department of
    Transportation** will advance climate equity by committing to
    consider the impacts of heat, poor air quality, vector-borne
    disease, and other hazards more likely to affect environmental
    justice communities when siting and designing projects.

The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and OMB also seek public
input on the agency climate adaptation plans. Members of the public may
submit comments via the docket at <https://www.regulations.gov/> (Docket
ID: CEQ–2021–0003) until Nov. 6, 2021. CEQ also will hold a virtual
convening this fall with national organizations with expertise in
climate adaptation and resilience or have expressed interest in the
agency plans.
