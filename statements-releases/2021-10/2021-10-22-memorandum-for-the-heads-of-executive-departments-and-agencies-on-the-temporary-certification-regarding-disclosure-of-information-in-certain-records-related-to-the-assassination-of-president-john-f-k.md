title: Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on the Temporary
  Certification Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to
  the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy
---
 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Policy.</span>  In the President John
F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107
note) (the “Act”), the Congress declared that “all Government records
concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . . . should
be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed
about the history surrounding the assassination.”  The Congress also
found that “most of the records related to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy are almost 30 years old, and only in the
rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection of
such records.”  Almost 30 years since the Act, the profound national
tragedy of President Kennedy’s assassination continues to resonate in
American history and in the memories of so many Americans who were alive
on that terrible day; meanwhile, the need to protect records concerning
the assassination has only grown weaker with the passage of time.  It is
therefore critical to ensure that the United States Government maximizes
transparency, disclosing all information in records concerning the
assassination, except when the strongest possible reasons counsel
otherwise.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">2.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Background.</span>  The Act permits
the continued postponement of disclosure of information in records
concerning President Kennedy’s assassination only when postponement
remains necessary to protect against an identifiable harm to the
military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the
conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs
the public interest in disclosure.  Since 2018, executive departments
and agencies (agencies) have been reviewing under this statutory
standard each redaction they have proposed that would result in the
continued postponement of full public disclosure.  This year, the
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has been reviewing
whether it agrees that each redaction continues to meet the statutory
standard.  The Archivist of the United States (Archivist), however, has
reported that “unfortunately, the pandemic has had a significant impact
on the agencies” and NARA and that NARA “require\[s\] additional time to
engage with the agencies and to conduct research within the larger
collection to maximize the amount of information released.”  The
Archivist has also noted that “making these decisions is a matter that
requires a professional, scholarly, and orderly process; not decisions
or releases made in haste.”  The Archivist therefore recommends that the
President “temporarily certify the continued withholding of all of the
information certified in 2018” and “direct two public releases of the
information that has” ultimately “been determined to be appropriate for
release to the public,” with one interim release later this year and one
more comprehensive release in late 2022.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">3.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Temporary Certification.</span>  In
light of the agencies’ proposals for continued postponement under the
statutory standard, the Archivist’s request for an extension of time to
engage with the agencies, and the need for an appropriate review and
disclosure process, I agree with the Archivist’s
recommendation. Temporary continued postponement is necessary to protect
against identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence
operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is
of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate
disclosure.  Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by
the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including
section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act, I hereby certify that all information
within records that agencies have proposed for continued postponement
under section 5(g)(2)(D) shall be withheld from full public disclosure
until December 15, 2022.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">4.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Interim Release.</span>  Any
information currently withheld from public disclosure that agencies have
not proposed for continued postponement shall be reviewed by NARA before
December 15, 2021, and shall be publicly released on that date.  Out of
respect for the anniversary of President Kennedy’s assassination, such
release shall not occur before December 15, 2021.  
  
Sec. 5.  Intensive 1-Year Review.  (a)  Over the next year, agencies
proposing continued postponement and NARA shall conduct an intensive
review of each remaining redaction to ensure that the United States
Government maximizes transparency, disclosing all information in records
concerning the assassination, except when the strongest possible reasons
counsel otherwise.  This review shall include documents within the
assassination records collection designated as “not believed relevant”
by the Assassination Records Review Board established under the Act, but
nonetheless placed within the collection by the Assassination Records
Review Board.  
     (b)  Any information that an agency proposes for continued
postponement beyond December 15, 2022, shall be limited to the absolute
minimum under the statutory standard.  An agency shall not propose to
continue redacting information unless the redaction is necessary to
protect against an identifiable harm to the military defense,
intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign
relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest
in disclosure.  In applying this statutory standard, an agency shall:  
           (i)   Accord substantial weight to the public interest in
transparency and full disclosure of any record that falls within the
scope of the Act; and  
           (ii)  Give due consideration that some degree of harm is not
grounds for continued postponement unless the degree of harm is of such
gravity that it outweighs the public interest.  
      (c)  For any record containing information that an agency proposes
for continued postponement beyond December 15, 2022, the agency shall
provide, no later than December 15, 2021:  
           (i)    an unclassified letter, to be signed by the head of
the agency, providing a written description of the types of information
for which the agency is proposing continued postponement and reasons for
which the agency is proposing continued postponement of such
information;  
           (ii)   an unclassified index identifying for each such record
the reasons for which the agency is proposing continued postponement of
information in such record; and  
           (iii)  a specific proposed date identifying for each such
record when the agency reasonably anticipates that continued
postponement of information in such record no longer would be necessary
or, if that is not possible, a specific proposed date for each such
record identifying when the agency would propose to next review again
after December 15, 2022, whether the information proposed for continued
postponement in such record still satisfies the statutory standard for
postponement.  
      (d)  NARA shall review each proposed redaction, no later than
September 1, 2022, in consultation with:  
          (i)    The Department of Defense if the agency proposing the
redaction asserts an anticipated harm to the military defense;  
          (ii)   The Office of the Director of National Intelligence if
the agency proposing the redaction asserts an anticipated harm to
intelligence operations;  
          (iii)  The Department of Justice if the agency proposing the
redaction asserts an anticipated harm to law enforcement; and  
           (iv)   The Department of State if the agency proposing the
redaction asserts an anticipated harm to the conduct of foreign
relations.  
      (e)  The relevant consulting agency, as designated pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section, shall provide its assessment to NARA as
to whether the information proposed for continued postponement satisfies
the statutory standard for such postponement.  In reviewing a proposed
redaction, NARA or the relevant consulting agency, as designated
pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, should consult with the
agency that proposed the redaction.  
      (f)  If NARA does not agree that a proposed redaction meets the
statutory standard for continued postponement, it shall inform the
agency that proposed the redaction.  After consultation with NARA, the
agency that proposed the redaction may, no later than October 1, 2022:  
           (i)   withdraw the proposed redaction; or  
           (ii)  refer the decision on continued postponement to the
President through the Counsel to the President, accompanied by an
explanation of why continued postponement remains necessary to protect
against an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence
operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is
of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.    
      (g)  If NARA agrees that a proposed redaction meets the asserted
statutory standard for continued postponement, the Archivist shall
recommend to the President, no later than October 1, 2022, that
continued postponement from public disclosure of the information is
warranted after December 15, 2022.  
      (h)  At the conclusion of the 1-year review, any information still
withheld from public disclosure that agencies do not propose for
continued postponement beyond December 15, 2022, shall be released to
the public on that date.  
      (i)  At the conclusion of the 1-year review, each unclassified
letter described in subsection (c)(i) of this section and each
unclassified index described in subsection (c)(ii) of this section shall
be disclosed to the public on December 15, 2022, with any updates made
to account for any information initially proposed for continued
postponement that is not postponed from public disclosure beyond
December 15, 2022.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">6.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Digitization and Democratization of
Records.</span>  (a)  Since the 1990s, more than 250,000 records
concerning President Kennedy’s assassination — more than 90 percent of
NARA’s collection — have been released in full to the public.  Only a
small fraction of the records contains any remaining redactions.  But
many records that have been fully disclosed are inaccessible to most
members of the public unless they travel to NARA’s location in College
Park, Maryland.  
      (b)  The Archivist shall issue a plan, no later than December 15,
2021, to digitize and make available online NARA’s entire collection of
records concerning President Kennedy’s assassination.  
      (c)  The Archivist shall provide additional context online about
the records that have been withheld in full under sections 10 and 11 of
the Act — primarily documents containing tax-related information of the
Internal Revenue Service or the Social Security Administration — that
are not subject to the Presidential certification requirement under
section 5 of the Act.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">7.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Publication.</span>  The Archivist is
hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the
*Federal Register*.
