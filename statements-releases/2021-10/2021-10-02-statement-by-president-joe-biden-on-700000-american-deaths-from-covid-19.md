To heal we must remember, and as our nation mourns the painful milestone
of 700,000 American deaths due to COVID-19, we must not become numb to
the sorrow. On this day, and every day, we remember all those we have
lost to this pandemic and we pray for their loved ones left behind who
are missing a piece of their soul.

As we do, the astonishing death toll is yet another reminder of just how
important it is to get vaccinated. The vaccines are safe, free, and
easy—and we have made extraordinary progress in our fight against
COVID-19 over the last eight months because of the vaccines. More than
three-quarters of all Americans age 12 and up have now received at least
one vaccine dose—including nearly 94 percent of all seniors. Hundreds of
thousands of families have been spared the unbearable loss that too many
Americans have already endured during this pandemic.

If you haven’t already, please get vaccinated.

It can save your life and the lives of those you love.

It will help us beat COVID-19 and move forward, together, as one nation.
