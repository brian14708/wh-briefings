title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Latino Communities Across the Country"
---
 
President Biden knows that America’s future prosperity and global
leadership is tied to the success of Latino families and communities.
Latinos must receive equitable opportunities to share in the recovery
from the pandemic and the investments we are making to build back better
than before. After four years of attacks on Latino families and
communities, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic actions
to advance civil rights, racial equity, and economic prosperity for
Latino communities across the country. The President has also re-opened
the doors of the White House, so Latino community leaders and community
members have a seat at the table.  This National Hispanic Heritage
Month, the Biden-Harris Administration celebrates the progress made
towards equity for Latino communities since President Biden took office
and recommits to lifting up Latino families and communities.

**Providing Immediate Relief to Latino Individuals and Families through
the American Rescue Plan.** When President Biden signed the American
Rescue Plan (ARP) into law, it provided a lifeline to millions of
families who were struggling from the economic fallout of the pandemic.
In addition to the Child Tax Credit and Affordable Care Act subsidies,
the ARP also provided benefits that include:

-   ***Substantially Cutting Latino Child Poverty.*** The American
    Rescue Plan (ARP) expanded the Child Tax Credit to help families
    with the costs of raising their kids and provided the first ever
    monthly payments for a major tax credit. Before the ARP, half of all
    Latino children
    [lived](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/5cda0024be4e5b0001c6bdc7/1557790757313/Poverty+%26+Social+Policy+Brief_Who+Is+Left+Behind+in+the+Federal+CTC.pdf)
    in families with too little in income to qualify for the full Child
    Tax Credit. This year no child is denied the full credit because
    their family is low-income. As a result, Treasury
    [estimates](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/Treasury-and-IRS-Announce-Families-of-Nearly-60-Million-Children-Receive-%2415-Billion-Dollars-in-First-Payments-of-Expanded-and-Newly-Advanceable-Child-Tax-Credit)
    that 26 million kids who were not previously eligible will receive
    the full credit. Research from Columbia and the [Center on Budget
    and Policy
    Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/recovery-package-should-permanently-include-families-with-low-incomes-in-full#_ftnref4)
    reflects that these children are disproportionately Black and
    Latino.
-   ***Expanding Relief for Mixed-status Families.*** More than 1.4
    million spouses and nearly 3.7 million children who have a Social
    Security number in mixed-status families were eligible for $1400
    each in cash relief. For the first time, this relief applied to all
    spouses and children with Social Security numbers in mixed status
    families, meaning that 2.2 million more children received cash
    payments under this bill than 2020 CARES Act.
-   ***Supporting Latino-owned Small Businesses.*** The ARP has
    supported small businesses, including through a $28.6 billion
    Restaurant Revitalization Fund that has helped restaurants and bars
    recover from the pandemic, and an additional $7.25 billion for the
    Paycheck Protection Program. The ARP also made changes to the COVID
    Economic Injury Disaster Loan program – including raising the cap
    from $500,000 to $2 million, and created a $100 million Community
    Navigator pilot program that works with community groups to connect
    eligible business owners with American Rescue Plan and other
    pandemic-relief programs.
-   ***Expanding Access to Health Care.*** The ARP allocated $7.6
    billion for Community Health Centers (CHCs), which predominately
    serve Latino and communities of color. Through ARP investments, [69
    percent of Latino uninsured
    adults](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/265041/trends-in-the-us-uninsured.pdf)
    have access to a zero-premium plan and 80 percent have access to a
    plan for less than $50 a month. According to the [latest uninsured
    data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur202108-508.pdf)
    from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National
    Center for Health Statistics, Exchange-based coverage was higher
    among Latino persons (4.2 percent) than non-Latino Caucasians (3.7
    percent) and non-Latino Blacks (2.6 percent).
-   ***Safely Reopening Schools.*** The ARP has provided more than $122
    billion to help K-12 schools reopen safely and $39.6 billion to
    support institutions of higher education, including Hispanic-Serving
    Institutions (HSIs). Nearly 14 million students in our Nation’s
    public elementary and secondary school system and nearly 4 million
    students in post-secondary education are Hispanic.  Hispanic
    students constitute more than 27 percent of all pre-kindergarten
    through 12th grade students and nearly 20 percent of college
    students.
-   ***Support College Students.*** The ARP provided more than $36
    billion in support to institutions of higher education, including
    HSIs, to serve students and ensure learning continues during the
    COVID-19 pandemic. All students, regardless of citizenship, who met
    the appropriate criteria were eligible to receive financial aid from
    the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF).
-   ***Keeping families housed.*** The ARP and Consolidated
    Appropriations Act of 2021 allocates over $46 billion to keep
    families safely home with emergency rental assistance and culturally
    and linguistically relevant outreach and stability services. In
    addition, the ARP includes funding for housing counseling and
    homeless prevention services. These programs are critical to
    supporting Latino renters who face eviction.

**Safeguarding Latinos from COVID-19.** Because of systemic inequities
in our economy and healthcare system, Latino communities have been
disproportionately burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since his first
day in office, President Biden has used every lever and tool to ensure
every person in our country can access safe, free, and convenient
vaccines; expand testing eligibility; and invest in more equitable
public health infrastructure to better serve communities of color. That
includes working with pharmacies to extend their hours to ensure working
people have a chance to get their shot. In September, President Biden
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/) a six-pronged,
comprehensive national strategy that employs the same science-based
approach that was used to successfully combat previous variants of
COVID-19 earlier this year. This plan ensures that the Biden-Harris
Administration is using every available tool to combat COVID-19 and save
lives in the months ahead, while also keeping schools open and safe, and
protecting our economy from lockdowns and damage. Fortunately, Latinos
are now vaccinating at the same rate as their white counterparts as a
result of targeted and strategic outreach to address questions and
dispel misinformation targeted at the Latino community. While there is
more work to do, [recent data
shows](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-september-2021/)
that 73 percent of Latinos have received at least their first shot –
that compares to 71 percent of white Americans and 70 percent of Black
Americans.

**Re-Establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational
Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics.** On
September 13, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/13/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for-hispanics/)
re-establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational
Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics. The
Executive Order helps to ensure that from early childhood to entering
the workforce, Latino students, including DREAMers, can reach their
highest potential. The Initiative will address the systemic inequities
Latino students continue to face in our nation’s public education
system, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis; will help to
build capacity at institutions serving Latino students, including
Hispanic Serving Institutions; and will advance educational equity and
economic opportunity for Latino students, families, and communities.

**Leveraging Federal Procurement to Narrow the Racial Wealth Gap for
Latino Entrepreneurs and Families.**  Today, the typical Latino family
has just nineteen cents for every dollar in wealth held by the typical
white family**.** Federal procurement is one of our most powerful tools
to advance equity and build wealth in underserved communities, but only
around 10 percent of federal agencies’ total eligible contracting
dollars typically go to small disadvantaged businesses, a category under
federal law for which Latino-owned businesses are presumed to qualify.
Recognizing the importance of using the government’s purchasing power to
advance opportunity and equity, the Biden-Harris Administration has
launched an all-of-government effort to expand contracting opportunities
for underserved small businesses, setting a new goal of increasing the
share of contracts going to small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent
over the next five years.

**Launching a Whole-Of-Government Initiative to Advance Equity and
Justice for Underserved Communities, Including Latino Communities.** On
his first day in office, President Biden signed a historic [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/) establishing
a cross-government initiative to advance equity and justice for
communities that have been historically underserved, marginalized, and
adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality, including many
Latino communities. The President directed all agencies to advance
equity by taking comprehensive action to root out bias from federal
programs and policies, engage with underserved communities, and ensure
that federal resources equitably reach all Americans, including Latinos.

**Advancing Immigration Reform.** Given the 4 years of chaos and cruelty
under the previous Administration, President Biden has been focused on
rebuilding our immigration system and ensuring it is more fair, humane,
and orderly, including by:

-   ***Pushing for Immigration Reform Legislation in Congress.*** On his
    first day in office, the President sent Congress the United States
    Citizenship Act – comprehensive legislation that seeks to create a
    pathway to permanent residence and eventual citizenship for the
    nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in and contributing
    to our country. The President’s plan also modernizes our immigration
    system and responsibly manages our borders, while addressing the
    root causes of migration. President Biden and Vice President Harris
    have repeatedly expressed their strong support for including
    immigration reform in reconciliation legislation moving through
    Congress to enable DREAMers, TPS recipients, farmworkers, and
    essential workers to gain long-awaited pathways to permanent
    residence and eventual citizenship. 
-   ***Promoting Naturalization****.* President Biden is committed to
    making the naturalization process more accessible for eligible
    noncitizens. He has directed the Attorney General, the Secretary of
    Homeland Security and the Secretary of State to improve the
    naturalization processing, including identifying and removing
    barriers to naturalization, and reducing backlogs for naturalization
    applications. The President also established an Interagency Working
    Group to Promote Naturalization.
-   ***Protecting DACA Recipients and Dreamers*.**  On his first day in
    office, President Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum directing
    the Secretary of Homeland Security to, in consultation with the
    Attorney General, to take appropriate actions to preserve and
    fortify the 2012 DACA policy, under which eligible undocumented
    immigrant youth could be permitted to work and study in our
    communities on a temporary basis, and the Department of Homeland
    Security recently published a new proposed rule on DACA.
-   ***Reinstating and Expanding Central American Minors (CAM)
    Program*.** The Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship
    and Immigration Services and Department of State’s Bureau of
    Population, Refugees, and Migration have taken steps to reinstate
    and improve the Central American Minors (CAM) program. As part of
    this phased approach, DHS and DOS have continued to reopen cases
    that were closed when CAM was terminated in 2018 and have expanded
    eligibility of those able to petition for their children’s access to
    the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.
-   ***Extending TPS for El Salvador and Honduras.*** The Department of
    Homeland Security announced the extension of TPS (Temporary
    Protected Status) designations for El Salvador and Honduras. The
    extension of TPS-related documentation includes Employment
    Authorization Documents (EADs) through Dec. 31, 2022.
-   ***Designating Venezuela for TPS*.** DHS created a new designation
    of TPS for Venezuela for 18 months, until September 2022. This
    enables Venezuelan nationals (and individuals without nationality
    who last resided in Venezuela) currently residing in the United
    States to file initial applications, so long as they meet
    eligibility requirements.
-   ***Supporting Immigrant Veterans*.** The Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA) is partnering with DHS to provide needed care and
    services to deported Veterans, including timely and accurate
    information on immigration services.

**Protecting the Integrity of the Census. ** Afteryears of attempts to
politicize the decennial Census count, President Biden gave career
professionals at the Census Bureau the time and space they needed to
deliver an accurate count of every American.  The 2020 Census results
reflect the [historic diversity of the
country](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html),
and the Census Bureau has made improvements to data collection so
they’re better able to reveal the multifaceted nature of growing Latino
communities.

**Supporting Recovery, Opportunity, and Equity for Puerto Rico.**
President Biden is delivering on his commitment to treat Puerto Rico and
all Puerto Ricans with dignity and respect. In the first 100 days, the
Biden-Harris Administration unlocked more than 9 billion dollars in
federal disaster funds for Puerto Rico that are helping to rebuild from
natural disasters and strengthen the island against future storms. To
make sure Puerto Ricans have they support they need to get ahead, the
American Rescue Plan permanently fixed Puerto Rico’s unequal treatment
under the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, providing
workers and families with thousands of dollars in tax relief. In July,
the White House convened the Federal Working Group on Puerto Rico, an
all-of-government Cabinet-level initiative to partner with Puerto Rico
to invest in modern and resilient infrastructure, support inclusive
economic development, expand education and workforce opportunities, and
set the island on a course for future prosperity. In September, the
Biden Administration announced that Puerto Rico will receive $3 billion
per year in Medicaid funding from the federal government in perpetuity,
supporting the provision of affordable, quality health care for
residents of Puerto Rico.

**Advancing Safety for Latino Communities Through Community Violence
Interventions and Commonsense Gun Control.** Cities across the country
are experiencing a spike in homicides, violence that is greatest in
racially segregated, high-poverty neighborhoods and significantly
impacts too many Latino communities. As part of the Administration’s
plan to reduce gun violence, the Biden-Harris Administration [announced
historic
investments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-more-details-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-investments-in-community-violence-interventions/)
in community violence intervention programs to combat the gun violence
epidemic and keep underserved communities and neighborhoods safe.

**Appointing a Historically Diverse Cabinet and Administration.** The
Biden-Harris Administration includes barrier-breaking Latino leaders.
Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the first Latino and immigrant to serve
as Secretary of Homeland Security, and Secretary Xavier Becerra is the
first Latino to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Administrator Isabella Guzman leads the Small Business Administration,
and Secretary Miguel Cardona leads the Department of Education. Once
confirmed, Robert Santos will be the first Latino and the first person
of color to be Director of the United States Census Bureau.

President Biden has assembled the most diverse Administration in our
nation’s history, and is proud to serve alongside the [15
percent](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/29/fact-sheet-100-days-in-biden-harris-administration-makes-history-with-presidential-appointees/)
of all appointees who identify as Latino or Hispanic, and the 32 percent
of all appointees who are naturalized citizens or the children of
immigrants.

**Protecting and Empowering Latino Workers.** The Department of Labor
(DOL) has taken a number of steps to promote safe working environments
and empower Latino workers all across the country, including:

-   ***Boosting farmworker wages.*** Boosting the national average wage
    for farmworkers to $13.99 per hour, a 4.5 percent pay increase over
    the prior year, and reversing a harmful 2-year “wage freeze” policy
    put in place by the prior administration.
-   ***Expanding workers outreach.*** Launching an initiative that
    provides outreach and education to protect front-line, essential
    workers during and after the pandemic.  
-   ***Protecting Latino workers from heat exposure.*** Combating
    hazards associated with extreme heat exposure **–** both indoors and
    outdoors – through enhanced OSHA measures that better protect
    workers. This initiative will disproportionately benefit Latino
    workers who are more likely to face weather exposure. OSHA is
    implementing an [enforcement
    initiative](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osha.gov%2Flaws-regs%2Fstandardinterpretations%2F2021-09-01&data=04%7C01%7CBarnes.Taylor.A%40dol.gov%7C5d1629300bd04641b81308d97d352440%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C637678489493995678%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=euGQaAi8gu0xk%2FmiZaY%2Bo9KcILUYxgb6YV2nPnrjBew%3D&reserved=0)
    on heat-related hazards, developing a [National Emphasis

    on heat inspections, and launching a rulemaking process to develop a
    workplace heat standard. In addition, the agency is forming a
    [National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and
    Health](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osha.gov%2Fadvisorycommittee%2Fnacosh&data=04%7C01%7CBarnes.Taylor.A%40dol.gov%7C5d1629300bd04641b81308d97d352440%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C637678489494005641%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=pyGefSVmdSH%2F8BA1%2B2qXV4WvX0zFIgftbP42Eo9ELJ8%3D&reserved=0)
    Heat Injury and Illness Prevention Work Group to provide better
    understanding of challenges and to identify and share best practices
    to protect workers.
-   ***Expanding job training opportunities for migrant and seasonal
    farmworkers.*** Using the National Farmworkers Job Training Program
    (NFJP), a nationally-directed, locally-administered program, to
    provide services for migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their
    dependents. As part of this program, Career Services and Training
    grant recipients help farmworkers and their dependents acquire
    necessary skills to either stabilize or advance in their
    agricultural jobs or obtain employment in new industries. For
    Program Year 2021, the Employment and Training Administration has
    committed to providing more than $87 million through the NFJP, where
    more than 75 percent of participants identify as Hispanic of Latino.

**Providing Resources to Help Latino Owned Small Businesses Grow and
Thrive.** The Small Business Administration (SBA) has leveraged new and
existing resources to provide Latino owned small businesses with
resources and support.

-   SBA Office of Capital Access has provided more than $2.5 billion in
    loans to Latino owned small business in FY2021. These loans consist
    of [SBA
    7(a)](https://www.sba.gov/category/lender-navigation/sba-loan-programs/7a-loan-programs)
    loans, the [SBA 504
    loan](https://www.sba.gov/brand/assets/sba/sba-lenders/504-Loan-Fact-Sheet-Borrower-Version.pdf),
    and [SBA micro
    loan](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/microloans). The
    SBA Office of International Trade has also provided 66 loans to
    Latino-owned small business exporters, worth $95 million which
    generated $344 million in export sales and supported 1,057 jobs in
    FY2021. 
-   Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), a resource partner of
    the SBA, have provided training and counseling to more than 60,000
    clients who identified as Latino or Hispanic entrepreneurs or
    would-be entrepreneurs. SCORE, another SBA resource partner,
    renovated a centralized educational hub called SCORE for Hispanic
    Entrepreneurs which offers personalized support and resources.
-   SBA’s Boots to Business program empowers service members, military
    spouses, and veterans through business ownership training. In
    FY2021, 1,629 out of 14,044 participants in the program identified
    as Hispanic or Latino. B2B provides an entrepreneurship training
    course focused on Transitioning Service Members and Military Spouses
    as part of DoD’s Transition Assistance Program (TAP).

In the weeks and months ahead, President Biden is committed to
delivering event more results for Latinos, including:

**Making Generational Investments in Latino Families Through the
President’s Proposed Build Back Better Agenda.**

-   ***Extending the Child Tax Credit.*** The expanded Child Tax Credit
    in the American Rescue Plan has helped millions of families meet the
    costs of raising children with the security and dignity they
    deserve, delivering $250 per month or $3,000 per year for children
    between 6 and 17 and $300 per month or $3,600 per year for children
    under 6. President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda will extend this
    critical tax cut for working families for years to come.
-   ***Lower Prescription Drug Costs.*** [Latino individuals use 10 to
    40 percent fewer
    medications](https://www.nashp.org/states-curb-racial-inequities-in-rx-drug-affordability-with-targeted-legislation/) than
    their white counterparts for the same illnesses because prescription
    medications are too costly. President Biden’s agenda will lower
    prescription drug costs for Americans by letting Medicare negotiate
    drug prices, so consumers are no longer at the whim of
    pharmaceutical companies.**
-   ***Lower Child Care Costs.*** Only [59.4 percent of all three- and
    four-year-old Hispanic
    children](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-children-attend-preschool-us/) are
    enrolled in preschool or kindergarten programs. President Biden’s
    agenda lowers child care costs and makes universal preschool a
    reality, providing all parents, including Latino parents, access to
    high-quality programs in the setting of their choice. 
-   ***Lower Health Care Costs**.*** **Almost [10.9 million Hispanic
    people](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/) were
    uninsured in 2019 before President Biden took office, and coverage
    under the Affordable Care Act (even with the ACA’s premium
    subsidies) was too expensive for many families. President Biden’s
    agenda lowers health care costs for those buying coverage through
    the ACA by extending the American Rescue Plan’s cost savings, which
    helps [730,000 Latino
    people ](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/265581/aspe-uninsured-trends-aapi-ib.pdf)save
    an average of $50 per person per month, and allowing 580,000
    uninsured Latinos to gain coverage. The plan also adds dental,
    vision, and hearing coverage to Medicare, benefiting the more
    than [5 million Hispanic people
    enrolled,](https://www.kff.org/medicare/state-indicator/medicare-beneficiaries-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) and
    closes the Medicaid gap for low-income Americans. The Biden-Harris
    Administration continues to encourage states that have not yet
    expanded Medicaid coverage to their eligible populations to do so.
    If those remaining states were to expand Medicaid under the ACA, an
    additional million uninsured Latino adults would gain eligibility
    for health coverage.
-   ***Lower Higher Education Costs**. *The Build Back Better Agenda
    would provide two years of free community college—boosting the
    earnings of low-wage high school graduates by nearly $6,000 per
    year. President Biden’s agenda also invests billions in subsidized
    tuition for low- and middle-income students at minority-serving
    institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions.
-   ***Lower Housing Costs*****.** More than [55 percent of Latino
    renters](https://curs.unc.edu/2019/11/26/calling-it-home-latino-rental-housing-affordability/) pay
    over 30 percent of their income in rent. The Plan’s investments help
    lower housing costs and increase the supply of affordable housing
    through tax credits and government financing.
-   ***Increase Access to Capital*****.** The Build Back Better Agenda
    includes nearly $25 billion dollars to support small business
    lending and technical assistance, including those in communities of
    color, to ensure that Latino small business owners and entrepreneurs
    have the resources they need to start up and grow.
-   ***Create a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave
    program.*** Seventy-three percent of Latino adults are either
    ineligible for or cannot afford to take unpaid leave compared to 60
    percent of white adults. Additionally,
    [survey](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2019/article/racial-and-ethnic-disparities-in-access-to-and-use-of-paid-family-and-medical-leave.htm)
    research finds that Hispanic workers have lower rates of access to
    paid leave compared to white non-Hispanic workers. The Build Back
    Better Agenda will create a national, comprehensive paid family and
    medical leave program to ensure workers receive partial wage
    replacement from the government to bond with a new child, care for a
    sick loved one, heal themselves, or grieve a loss without being
    forced to choose between a needed paycheck and their caregiving
    responsibilities.
-   ***Increase Access to Workforce Training.*** The Build Back Better
    Agenda will invest in workforce training programs that will prepare
    millions of workers, especially from underserved communities, for
    high-quality jobs in fast-growing sectors, make historic investments
    in Registered Apprenticeship programs, and invest in middle and high
    school career and technical education programs.

**Advancing Equity and Economic Opportunity for Latinos Through Historic
Infrastructure Investments.** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act [addresses economic
