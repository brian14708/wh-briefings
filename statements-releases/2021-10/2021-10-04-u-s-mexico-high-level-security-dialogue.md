The United States and Mexico remain committed partners on security
cooperation to protect our citizens and to make our nations safer and
stronger. On October 8, a U.S. delegation, led by Secretary of State
Blinken, will travel to Mexico City to take part in the first
U.S.-Mexico High-Level Security Dialogue (HLSD), in recognition of the
enduring partnership, mutual respect, and respect for sovereignty that
compels us to face security challenges together. Members of the
delegation will also include Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro
Mayorkas, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Assistant Secretary for
Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols, and National Security Council
Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez. This Dialogue
comes at a time when the threats of the 21<sup>st</sup> century become
more complex, and know no borders. The Dialogue will build on
discussions in previous months on protecting our people, preventing
transborder crime, and pursuing criminal networks, while promoting human
rights and the rule of law.
