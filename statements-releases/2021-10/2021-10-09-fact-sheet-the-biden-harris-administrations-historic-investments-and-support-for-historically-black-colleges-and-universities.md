title: "Fact Sheet: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Historic Investments\
  \ and Support for Historically Black Colleges and\_Universities"
---
 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have a proud
history and legacy of achievement. In the face of discrimination against
Black Americans by many institutions of higher education, HBCUs fostered
academic excellence and created pathways to opportunity for Black
students throughout our Nation. HBCUs vary in size and academic focus
and serve a range of diverse students and communities in urban, rural,
and suburban settings.  
  
HBCU graduates are leaders in every field and include barrier-breaking
public servants, scientists, artists, lawyers, engineers, educators, and
business owners. There are several HBCU graduates serving in senior
roles in the Biden-Harris Administration, including Director of the
White House Office of Public Engagement Cedric Richmond, Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, and Vice President Kamala
Harris – the first HBCU graduate ever to serve as Vice President of the
United States.  
  
Despite this record of success, disparities in resources and
opportunities for HBCUs and their students persist, and the COVID-19
pandemic has highlighted continuing and new challenges for HBCUs. In
order to promote our shared prosperity and advance equity for all
Americans, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized and delivered
historic levels of investment in and support for HCBUs. Those actions
include:  

***<u>Historic Investments in Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs)</u>***

-   **American Rescue Plan.** The American Rescue Plan and other
    pandemic relief funds provided nearly $3.7 billion in relief funding
    to HBCUs. This is in addition to approximately $1.6 billion in debt
    relief to 45 HBCUs (13 public institutions and 32 private
    institutions) earlier this year.
-   **FY 21 Grant Funding.** In FY21, the Department of Education
    awarded a total of $1 billion to build the capacity of institutions
    that serve large numbers of students of color and low-income
    students. $500 million of this funding went directly to HBCUs.
-   **FY 22 Budget Request.** The President’s FY22 budget requests a
    total of $1.06 billion for HBCU-specific funding in Higher Education
    Act (HEA)—an increase of $239 million over last year’s level. The
    budget would triple the mandatory Title III funding at the
    Department of Education— for a total of $252 million. Title III
    mandatory funds provide formula grants to all HBCUs to invest in
    capacity-building initiatives and student success programs. The
    President’s budget request includes funding for research
    opportunities at HBCUs, labs, IT infrastructure, workforce
    development programs in STEM, and DOJ funding for Violence Against
    Women Act programs at HBCUs, among other priorities.
-   **Teacher Quality Funding.** Through the FY22 budget request and the
    Build Back Better plan, President Biden has proposed $60 million for
    the Augustus Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program to support
    teacher preparation programs at HBCUs and minority-serving
    institutions (MSIs).

***<u>Strengthening the White House Initiative on HBCUs</u>***

-   In September, President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/03/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-through-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/)
    to re-establish the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational
    Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs and
    issued a
    [proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/03/a-proclamation-on-national-historically-black-colleges-and-universities-week-2021/)
    recognizing National HBCU Week.
-   The President’s Executive Order calls for a whole of government
    approach to support HBCUs in responding to and recovering from the
    COVID-19 pandemic and bolster HBCUs in a number of ways, including
    by breaking down barriers and improving access to Federal funding
    and other programs, particularly in areas of research and
    development.
-   The Order specifically directs senior officials in the Executive
    Office of the President and the Office of the Vice President to
    consult and collaborate with the Initiative on policy priorities for
    HBCUs.
-   Federal agencies must submit plans by February 1st of each year to
    describe how they are increasing HBCU access to Federal programs and
    improving Federal recruitment activities at HBCUs to build pathways
    to Federal employment.
-   During HBCU week, President Biden also named Tony Allen, President
    of Delaware State University, as Chair of the President’s Board of
    Advisors on HBCUs. The Board, originally established by the Carter
    Administration, is meant to engage key stakeholders in fields such
    as education, business, and philanthropy to advance the goals of the
    HBCU Initiative.

***<u>Ensuring Continued Support for HBCUs through the Build Back Better
Plan</u>***

-   The President’s Build Back Better plan would provide tuition
    subsidies to students who attend HBCUs with a family income below
    $125,000. It would also provide free community college to students
    who attend one of the 11 HBCUs that are also community colleges.
-   Build Back Better also includes a $5 billion increase in funding for
    HEA Title III and Title V, which can be used by HBCUs, Tribal
    colleges and universities (TCUs), and MSIs to strengthen their
    academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities, including by
    creating or expanding educational programs in high-demand fields
    (e.g., STEM, computer sciences, nursing, and allied health). Build
    Back Better would direct an additional $2 billion toward building a
    pipeline of skilled health care workers with graduate degrees from
    HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs.
-   Recognizing the historic underfunding of HBCUs and other
    institutions that serve large numbers of students of color, the
    President’s plan also would invest $40 billion in upgrading research
    infrastructure, half which would be reserved for HBCUs, TCUs, and
    MSIs.
-   The President also proposed creating a new national lab focused on
    climate that would be affiliated with an HBCU.
