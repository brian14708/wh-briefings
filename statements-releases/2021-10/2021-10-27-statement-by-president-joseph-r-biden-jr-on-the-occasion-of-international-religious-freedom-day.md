  \ Religious Freedom\_Day"

Twenty-three years ago, I was honored to support the passage of the
International Religious Freedom Act, groundbreaking legislation that
established the United States as the world’s leader in promoting and
defending freedom of religion or belief for all people across the globe.
Today, on International Religious Freedom Day, I’m proud to recommit the
United States to this freedom—enshrined in our First Amendment—and to
lead our global effort to press for freedom of religion or belief for
everyone, everywhere.

Promoting and defending religious freedom for all is as important now as
it has ever been. Tragically, repressive governments, violent
extremists, and other societal actors continue to persecute and
abuse individuals and groups simply because of their religious identity,
practices, or beliefs. Such abhorrent acts abuse human rights and human
dignity. And, the repression that stifles religious freedom undermines
political stability and economic development. We stand in defense of
religious freedom not only as an expression of our deepest values but
also because it is a vital national security priority. The United States
will continue to rally the globe to protect and promote the right of
freedom of religion or belief, including through multilateral coalitions
such as the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance.

Every faith is in the minority somewhere in the world, and we can only
fully realize the freedom we wish for ourselves by helping to ensure
that liberty for everyone. On International Religious Freedom Day 2021,
my Administration pledges to make that aspiration a reality around the
world.
