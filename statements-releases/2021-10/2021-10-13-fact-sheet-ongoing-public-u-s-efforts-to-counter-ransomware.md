title: 'FACT SHEET: Ongoing Public U.S. Efforts to Counter Ransomware'
---
 
This week the National Security Council is facilitating an international
counter-ransomware event with over 30 partners to accelerate cooperation
on improving network resilience, addressing the financial systems that
make ransomware profitable, disrupting the ransomware ecosystem via law
enforcement collaboration, and leveraging the tools of diplomacy to
address safe harbors and improve partner capacity.  
  
Ransomware incidents have disrupted critical services and businesses
worldwide – schools, banks, government offices, emergency services,
hospitals, energy companies, transportation, and food companies have all
been affected. Ransomware attackers have targeted organizations of all
sizes, regardless of where they are located. The global economic losses
from ransomware are significant. Ransomware payments reached over $400
million globally in 2020, and topped $81 million in the first quarter of
2021, illustrating the financially driven nature of these activities.  
  
The Biden Administration has pursued a focused, integrated effort to
counter the threat. Yet, government action alone is not enough. The
Administration has called on the private sector, which owns and operates
the majority of U.S. critical infrastructure, to modernize their cyber
defenses to meet the threat of ransomware. The Administration has
announced specific efforts to encourage resilience, including voluntary
cyber performance goals, classified threat briefings for critical
infrastructure executives and the Industrial Control Systems
Cybersecurity Initiative. And, the Administration has stepped up to lead
international efforts to fight ransomware. International partnership is
key since transnational criminal organizations are often the
perpetrators of ransomware crimes, leveraging global infrastructure and
money laundering networks to carry out their attacks.  
  
The Administration’s counter-ransomware efforts are organized along four
lines of effort:

-   **Disrupt Ransomware Infrastructure and Actors:** The Administration
    is bringing the full weight of U.S. government capabilities to
    disrupt ransomware actors, facilitators, networks and financial
    infrastructure;
-   **Bolster Resilience to Withstand Ransomware Attacks:** The
    Administration has called on the private sector to step up its
    investment and focus on cyber defenses to meet the threat. The
    Administration has also outlined the expected cybersecurity
    thresholds for critical infrastructure and introduced cybersecurity
    requirements for transportation critical infrastructure;
-   **Address the Abuse of Virtual Currency to Launder Ransom
    Payments:** Virtual currency is subject to the same Anti-Money
    Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
    controls that are applied to fiat currency, and those controls and
    laws must be enforced. The Administration is leveraging existing
    capabilities, and acquiring innovative capabilities, to trace and
    interdict ransomware proceeds; and
-   **Leverage International Cooperation to Disrupt the Ransomware
    Ecosystem and Address Safe Harbors for Ransomware Criminals:**
    Responsible states do not permit criminals to operate with impunity
    from within their borders. We are working with international
    partners to disrupt ransomware networks and improve partner capacity
    for detecting and responding to such activity within their own
    borders, including imposing consequences and holding accountable
    those states that allow criminals to operate from within their
    jurisdictions.

Actions to date within these lines of effort include:  
  
**Disrupt Ransomware Infrastructure and Actors**

-   The Department of Justice established a Task Force to enhance
    coordination and alignment of law enforcement and prosecutorial
    initiatives combating ransomware. Law enforcement agencies, working
    through the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF)
    and with the support of the interagency, are surging investigations,
    asset recovery, and other efforts to hold ransomware criminals
    accountable.  
-   The Department of the Treasury levied its [first-ever sanctions
    against a virtual currency
    exchange](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364). The
    exchange, SUEX, was responsible for facilitating ransomware payments
    to ransomware criminals associated with at least eight ransomware
    variants.  Treasury will continue to disrupt and hold accountable
    these ransomware actors and their money laundering networks to
    reduce the incentive for cybercriminals to continue to conduct these
    attacks.
-   The Department of the Treasury [published an updated sanctions
    advisory](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf)
    encouraging and emphasizing the importance of reporting ransomware
    incidents and payments to U.S. Government authorities.
-   US Cyber Command and National Security Agency are dedicating people,
    technology, and expertise to generate insights and options against
    ransomware actors. Their technical expertise and insights enable and
    support whole-of-government efforts, including actions against
    criminals, their infrastructure, and their ability to profit from
    their crimes.
-   The Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) Office has
    [offered a $10 million
    reward](https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/malicious_cyber_activity.html)
    for information leading to the identification or location of any
    person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a
    foreign government, engages in, or aids or abets, certain malicious
    cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure, to include
    ransomware activities.

**Bolster Resilience against Ransomware**

-   The President launched an Industrial Control System Cybersecurity
    (ICS) Initiative in April – a voluntary, collaborative effort
    between the federal government and the critical infrastructure
    community.  The ICS Initiative has led to over 150 electricity
    utilities representing almost 90 million residential customers to
    deploy or commit to deploy control system cybersecurity
    technologies, bolstering the security and resilience of these
    facilities.  The ICS Initiative has been expanded to natural gas
    pipelines, and will shortly be expanded to the water sector.   
-   In July, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S.
    Department of Justice (DOJ) established the
    [StopRansomware.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware) website to
    help private and public organizations access resources to mitigate
    their ransomware risk.  
-   The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at the Department
    of Homeland Security issued two Security Directives, requiring
    critical pipeline owners and operators to bolster their cyber
    defenses, enabling DHS to better identify, protect against, and
    respond to threats to critical companies in the pipeline sector.
-   Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology,
    Anne Neuberger, [sent an open letter to
    CEOs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Memo-What-We-Urge-You-To-Do-To-Protect-Against-The-Threat-of-Ransomware.pdf)
    in June communicating best practices to defend against and prepare
    for ransomware incidents, including backing up data, implementing
    multi-factor authentication, and testing incident response plans.
-   In August, President Biden met with private sector and education
    leaders to discuss the whole-of-nation effort needed to address
    cybersecurity threats – and leaders [announced ambitious
    initiatives](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/25/fact-sheet-biden-administration-and-private-sector-leaders-announce-ambitious-initiatives-to-bolster-the-nations-cybersecurity/)
    to bolster the Nation’s cybersecurity.
-   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), within
    the Department of Commerce, is working with industry to improve
    current and emerging standards, practices, and technical approaches
    to address ransomware. Their efforts include the development of the
    Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Ransomware Risk Management,
    which builds off the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to provide
    organizations a guide to prevent, respond to, and recover from
    ransomware events.   
-   Treasury and the Department of Homeland Security’s CISA are engaging
    the cyber insurance sector to explore incentives to enhance
    implementation of cyber hygiene and improve visibility of ransomware
    activity.

**Combat Virtual Currency Misuse to Launder Ransom Payments**

-   The United States remains at the forefront of applying anti-money
    laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
    requirements on virtual currency businesses and activities. We
    continue to hold U.S. virtual currency exchanges accountable to our
    regulatory requirements, and we have shared indicators and
    typologies of virtual currency misuse with the virtual currency and
    broader financial sector through venues like the Financial Crimes
    Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Exchange program.
-   Treasury is leading efforts to drive implementation of international
    standards on financial transparency related to virtual assets at the
    Financial Action Task Force and to build bilateral partnerships
    designed to strengthen AML/CFT controls for virtual currency
    exchanges overseas. Uneven implementation of international AML/CFT
    virtual currency standards creates vulnerabilities ransomware actors
    exploit and inhibits the U.S. Government’s ability to disrupt
    ransomware-associated money laundering.
-   Led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Administration is
    building an Illicit Virtual Asset Notification (IVAN) information
    sharing partnership and supporting platform to improve timelines of
    detection and disruption of ransomware and other illicit virtual
    currency payment flows.

**Bolster International Cooperation**

-   The Administration is working closely with international partners to
    address the shared threat of ransomware and galvanize global
    political will to counter ransomware activities – as reflected in
    the recent G7 and North Atlantic Treasury Organization (NATO) joint
    statements, and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) efforts, among
    others. The Administration continues to advocate for expanded
    membership in, and implementation of, the Budapest Convention and
    its principles.
-   Departments and Agencies continue to engage with States to improve
    their capacity for addressing ransomware threats, including through
    capacity building that promotes cybersecurity best practices and
    combats cybercrime, such as trainings on network defense and
    resilience, cyber hygiene, virtual currency analysis, and other
    training and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement
    partners to combat criminal misuse of information technologies. 
-   The United States remains committed to eliminating safe harbors for
    ransomware criminals through a more direct diplomatic approach.
     President Biden has directly engaged President Putin, and
    established the White House and Kremlin Experts Group to directly
    discuss and address ransomware activity. The Experts Group continues
    to meet to address the ransomware threat and to press Russia to act
    against criminal ransomware activities emanating from its territory.
    The President has made clear the United States will act to protect
    our people and critical infrastructure.
