President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Emmanuel
Macron of France. The two leaders reviewed ongoing efforts by their
teams to support stability and security in the Sahel and to enhance
cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. They also discussed efforts to enable a
stronger and more capable European defense while ensuring
complementarity with NATO.Â President Biden looks forward to the meeting
with President Macron in Rome later this month, where they will continue
the conversation, take stock of the many areas of U.S.-France
cooperation, and reinforce our shared interests and common values as we
take on challenges and opportunities together. President Biden also
noted the November visit by Vice President Harris to Paris as a key
opportunity to further enhance U.S.-France cooperation on a range of
global challenges.
