President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with European Commission
President Ursula von der Leyen and reaffirmed his support for the
European Union, a fundamental partner for the United States, and his
commitment to continue implementing the outcomes from the June U.S.-EU
Summit.  They discussed the important work of the U.S.-EU Trade and
Technology Council, which met in Pittsburgh on September 29, to ensure
rules governing global trade and critical and emerging technologies are
rooted in democratic values and market principles and address shared
supply chain concerns.  He emphasized the importance of enabling
cross-border data flows and leveling the playing field in the
international tax system. President Biden welcomed renewed U.S.-EU
cooperation on COVID-19 and taking steps to address the climate crisis,
including ahead of COP-26 in Glasgow later this month. The leaders also
discussed the Western Balkans and President Biden conveyed strong
support for continuing the accession process with countries in this
region.  President Biden also underscored the importance of close
U.S.-EU cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.
