***President Biden announces new domestic steps to continue building
supply chain resilience***

President Biden has made resilient supply chains a top priority of his
Administration since Day One. Today, the President is holding a Summit
on Global Supply Chain Resilience with the European Union and 14
like-minded countries to foster greater international cooperation on
near-term supply chain disruptions and chart a course to strengthen and
diversify the entire supply chain ecosystem over the long term—from raw
materials, intermediate and finished goods, manufacturing, to shipping,
logistics, warehousing, and distribution. The President’s Summit builds
on recent Biden-Harris Administration actions including the [expansion

the launching of an [Early Warning

for potential disruptions in semiconductor manufacturing, including in
Asia, and this week’s Department of Energy announcement establishing
Li-Bridge — a new public-private alliance committed to accelerating
development of a robust and secure domestic supply chain for
lithium-based batteries. Today’s announcements build on the Biden-Harris
Administration’s ongoing work under [Executive Order (E.O.)
14017](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/)
to build resilient supply chains that the President issued in February.

Joining the President at the Summit are Leaders and representatives from
Australia, Canada, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the European Union,
Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Italy, Republic of Korea,
Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. They will discuss
how we tackle the immediate supply chain challenges from this
unprecedented economic recovery and build long-term supply chain
reliance for the future.

Today, the President also announced new domestic steps he will take to
continue building supply chain resilience:

-   **Streamlined U.S. Stockpiling Efforts:** The President will issue
    an Executive Order to streamline U.S. stockpiling efforts by
    delegating authority to the Department of Defense to make material
    releases from the National Defense Stockpile—allowing a speedier
    response to material shortfalls within the defense industrial base.
    This follows through on a recommendation made in Executive Order
    14017 on *America’s Supply Chains* 100-day Report. The President
    will call for countries around the world to redouble their efforts
    to address shortfalls—especially those with national security
    concerns.

-   **Increased Funding for Trade Facilitation Activities to Cut Red
    Tape:** The President announced increased funding for two important
    initiatives to promote international supply chain resilience among
    U.S. partners and allies. First, the State Department will allot
    additional funding to provide technical assistance to Mexico and
    Central America counterparts to alleviate supply chain disruptions
    and bottlenecks. Second, earlier this week at the U.S.-ASEAN Summit,
    the President announced millions in funding for new U.S.-ASEAN
    initiatives, which includes funding to link the ASEAN Single Window,
    a customs facilitation program, with the U.S. Single Window
    System. Both of these initiatives will improve and simplify customs
    and clearance procedures, reducing delays and encouraging
    sustainable and efficient supply chains. 

<!-- -->

-   **Future Multi-Stakeholder Summit:** Recognizing that supply chains
    have many stakeholders—from private companies to workers and labor
    organizations to indigenous communities to academic
    institutions—Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of
    Commerce Gina Raimondo will hold a multi-stakeholder summit next
    year along with their foreign counterparts. The summit will be a
    follow-on dialogue to establish next steps among these parties to
    build greater global supply chain resilience.
