title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen Psaki on the Senate\u2019s Vote on the Debt\
  \ Limit"
---
 
Tonight’s votes are welcome steps forward in averting a default that
would have been devastating for our economy and for working families.
President Biden looks forward to signing this bill as soon as it
passes the House and reaches his desk. His focus remains on the task
before us of swiftly passing his economic agenda and making vital
investments in jobs, competitiveness, and lower prices for the middle
class.  
   
These votes underscore that raising the debt limit is a shared
responsibility to pay for debts incurred in the past by Presidents and
Congresses of both parties – debt that has nothing to do with President
Biden’s fully paid-for economic agenda. As we move forward, there must
be no question of whether America will pay its bills; Congress must
address the debt limit in December and beyond – just as we’ve done
almost 80 times over the last 60 years. Eleven Republicans did their
part tonight, ending the filibuster and allowing Democrats to do the
work of raising the debt limit. As we approach the coming months, we
hope that even more Republicans will join Democrats in responsibly
addressing the debt limit instead of choosing default or obstruction.  
   
We cannot allow partisan politics to hold our economy hostage, and we
can’t allow the routine process of paying our bills to turn into a
confidence-shaking political showdown every two years or every two
months.
