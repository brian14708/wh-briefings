title: "The Biden Administration Continues Its Work to Expand Access to\_Justice"
---
 
President Biden knows that timely and affordable access to the legal
system can make all the difference in a person’s life—including by
keeping an individual out of poverty, keeping an individual in his or
her home, helping an unaccompanied child seek asylum, helping someone
fight a consumer scam, or ensuring that an individual charged with a
crime can mount a strong defense.  But low-income people have long
struggled to secure quality access to the legal system.  Those
challenges have only increased during the public health and economic
crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  At the same time, civil legal
aid providers and public defenders have experienced unprecedented
challenges in reaching people in greatest need of their services. 

On May 18, 2021, President Biden issued a Memorandum directing the
reinvigoration and expansion of the Federal government’s role in
expanding access to justice.  The Presidential Memorandum called for
Attorney General Merrick Garland to submit a report to the President
outlining the Department of Justice’s plan to expand its access to
justice work.  The Presidential Memorandum also re-established the White
House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable—co-chaired by White House Counsel
Dana Remus and Attorney General Merrick Garland—to convene federal
agencies and identify ways to address some of the most pressing legal
services challenges that we face today, including those posed by the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the release of both
reports submitted pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum:

-   Attorney General Garland released his [Report to the
    President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Report-to-the-President-from-the-Attorney-General-September-15-2021.pdf),
    which describes a phased strategic plan to restore and expand the
    emphasis on access to justice within the Department of Justice.  As
    part of the strategic plan, Attorney General Garland today announced
    the restoration of a standalone Office for Access to Justice within
    the Department of Justice dedicated to improving the federal
    government’s understanding of and capacity to address the most
    urgent legal needs of communities across America.  
-   The White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable released its report
    entitled *[Access to Justice in the Age of
    COVID-19](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/White-House-Legal-Aid-Interagency-Roundtable-Report.pdf)*,
    which examines the impact of the pandemic on access to various
    programs, initiatives, and services across federal government.  The
    Report describes significant challenges faced during the pandemic,
    including in the areas of housing and evictions, healthcare,
    consumer protection, immigration, and criminal justice.  The Report
    also describes key lessons learned, creative innovations in access
    to justice, and areas of continued collaboration for the Roundtable.

This is the Biden-Harris Administration’s latest action to protect
vulnerable Americans, reform the justice system, and advance racial
equity.  On his first day in office, the President issued an executive
order establishing a government-wide initiative to put equity at the
heart of each agency’s priorities and management agenda.  The
Biden-Harris Administration has also taken concrete actions to reform
the criminal justice system, including by prohibiting certain harmful
practices in federal law enforcement and investing in community-based
public strategies, stopping harmful prosecution practices, and
supporting the reentry of formerly incarcerated individuals.  Improving
access to counsel, the courts, and federal programs builds on each of
these efforts.
