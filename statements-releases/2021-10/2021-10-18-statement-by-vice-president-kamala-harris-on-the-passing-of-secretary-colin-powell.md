title: Statement by Vice President Kamala Harris on the Passing of Secretary Colin
  Powell
---
 
Secretary Colin Powell dedicated his life to defending our nation. As
National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
Secretary of State, he was an independent thinker and a barrier breaker
who inspired leaders in our military and throughout our nation. 

Secretary Powell served our nation with courage, unwavering in his
belief in its principles and its promise. The son of
immigrants, Secretary Powell rose through the ranks of the United States
Army. He was a decorated veteran and a devoted patriot.

I last saw and spoke with Secretary Powell in July, at a dinner honoring
German Chancellor Angela Merkel. I was reminded then how he always
showed the world the best of who we are. He upheld the highest
standards, representing our nation with dignity, grace, and strength.

The legacy that he leaves behind – on America’s national security and on
the leaders he mentored – can be seen every day across our nation and
the world. 

Douglas and I send our deepest condolences to Secretary Powell’s wife,
Alma Powell, and their children and grandchildren.
