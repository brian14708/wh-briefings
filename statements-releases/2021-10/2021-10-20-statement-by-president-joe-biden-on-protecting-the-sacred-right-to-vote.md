title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Protecting the Sacred Right to\_Vote"
---
 
The United States Senate needs to act to protect the
sacred constitutional right to vote, which is under unrelenting
assault by proponents of the Big Lie and Republican Governors,
Secretaries of State, Attorneys-General, and state legislatures across
the nation.

It is urgent. Democracy – the very soul of America – is at stake.  

Today, Senate Democrats would like to start debate on the Freedom to
Vote Act. Senate Democrats have worked hard to ensure this bill includes
traditionally bipartisan provisions. But Senate Republicans are likely
to block even debate on the bill, as they have before on previous voting
rights bills. It’s unconscionable. 

The right to vote – to vote freely, to vote fairly, and to have your
vote counted – is fundamental. It should be simple and
straightforward. Let there be a debate and let there be a vote.
