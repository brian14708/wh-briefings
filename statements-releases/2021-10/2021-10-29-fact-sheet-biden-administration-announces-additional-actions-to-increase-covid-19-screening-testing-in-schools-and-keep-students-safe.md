title: "Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Announces Additional Actions to Increase\
  \ COVID-\u206019 Screening Testing in Schools and Keep Students\_Safe"
---
 
A top priority for the Biden Administration since Day One has been to
reopen schools safely and keep them open. The Administration has taken
significant actions to get our students back in the classroom – and it
is working, with more than 96% of school districts open for full-time
in-person for all students this fall.  
  
We know how to keep students safe in schools by taking the right steps
to prevent or reduce transmission in schools—including getting staff and
eligible students vaccinated, implementing universal indoor masking,
maintaining physical distancing, improving ventilation, and performing
regular screening testing of students and school staff. Schools should
consistently implement science-based prevention strategies recommended
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) so that they can
remain open for in-person learning and maintain the health and safety of
all students, staff, and families.  
  
As part of President Biden’s COVID-19 Action Plan announced in
September, the Administration called on all schools to set up regular
testing in schools for students, teachers, and staff consistent with CDC
guidance. The Administration provided $10 billion in funding for
COVID-19 screening testing for teachers, staff, and students in K-12
schools, in addition to the $130 billion provided to states and school
districts that may also be used for testing. Screening testing is a
critical strategy to identify positive cases of COVID-19 in students and
staff and ensure K-12 schools can operate safely during the COVID-19
pandemic.  
  
The Administration has been assisting states and schools in implementing
screening testing since awarding American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to
states last spring, and today, is announcing additional actions to help
states, schools, and school districts establish screening testing
programs in more schools:

-   **ED and CDC to partner with The Rockefeller Foundation to
    accelerate school-based screening testing for students and staff**:
    The U.S. Department of Education (ED) and the CDC plan to partner
    with The Rockefeller Foundation to help ensure that all schools can
    access and set up screening testing programs as quickly as possible.
    This partnership will further expand the reach of federal and state
    partners in helping more school and district leaders navigate the
    set-up and ongoing operations of school testing programs. The
    Rockefeller Foundation has been providing resources to schools on
    setting up testing programs since the early days of the pandemic –
    including by piloting screening testing programs to gather insights
    on how best to structure testing in K-12 schools; establishing a
    K-12 National Testing Action Program to connect school leaders and
    parents together with labs and manufacturers; and issuing a school
    playbook to offer step-by-step guidance to design and implement
    effective testing programs in schools (resources can be found on The
    Rockefeller Foundation’s
    [website](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/covid-19-response/reopening-k-12-schools/)).
    ED, CDC, and The Rockefeller Foundation will collaborate on
    initiatives to make it easier for schools to set up testing,
    including by:  
      
    **Holding weekly “office hours” to connect schools to national
    testing experts to set up and sustain screening testing programs**:
    Starting November 2, ED, CDC, and The Rockefeller Foundation will
    host a learning network with twice weekly sessions through December
    aimed at helping schools set up screening testing programs. The
    series will feature experts from CDC, ED, and outside of the U.S.
    Government to help schools develop and execute a plan for screening
    testing with trusted partners. Building on existing engagement from
    CDC and ED in providing technical assistance to schools, this new
    series is designed to help schools no matter where they are in
    setting up testing programs – from those who are just starting, to
    those who are looking to sustain or expand participation in their
    existing programs. The series will launch on November 2, and more
    details can be found at [The Rockefeller
    Foundation](http://rockefellerfoundation.org/covid19learningnetwork)
    website.  
      
    **Publishing a start-up guide for schools on how to launch screening
    testing programs:** Today, The Rockefeller Foundation released a new
    one-page start-up guide that schools can use to begin testing. This
    guide seeks to simplify the process by identifying key steps for
    schools to take in launching testing – and identifies resources
    available to help schools navigate the process. This includes
    connecting to a testing provider; learning about different testing
    options available; developing a plan and the team to administer
    testing; communicating with parents on consent and what the testing
    process will look like for their child; and planning for how to
    isolate individuals who test positive during school hours. The guide
    can be found at [The Rockefeller
    Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Start-Up-Guide-for-Testing-in-Schools-1-Pager.pdf)
    website.  
-   **Additional personnel available to help state health departments
    coordinate school-based screening testing through the CDC
    Foundation**: In addition to the resources already provided to
    states and school districts from the ARP, the CDC Foundation is
    making staff available to state health departments through the COVID
    Workforce Initiative to coordinate, execute, and expand on
    school-based COVID-19 testing, contact tracing/case investigation,
    and other public health activities. These staff can help in taking
    on roles like leading school-based testing expansion, hiring
    liaisons to support local school districts, and deploying disease
    investigation specialists, case investigators, and nurses to support
    outbreak and case investigations. This additional support from the
    CDC Foundation can be obtained by [contacting CDC at this
    link](mailto:eocevent375@cdc.gov).  
-   **Directory for schools to identify a provider and get started with
    testing**: Today, the CDC launched a new directory and
    [website](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dpei/elc/covid-response/index.html)
    to make it easy for schools to identify testing providers within
    their state.  CDC has distributed $10 billion in ARP funding to help
    states launch screening testing programs in their schools. Most
    states have used that funding to set up centrally-supported state
    contracts with testing providers, making it easier for schools to
    tap into testing programs and established supports underway across
    their state. The directory will point schools to the contracted
    provider(s) their state is working with, the state’s landing page
    for how to get started with provider(s) and a point of contact with
    clear contact information for schools and districts to reach out to
    if they have any questions.  
-   **Guidance for school districts on providing incentives to parents
    and guardians to participate in screening testing programs:** ED is
    releasing a fact sheet on how funding from ARP Elementary and
    Secondary School Emergency Relief funds can be used to provide
    incentives to parents or guardians whose children participate in
    school-based COVID-19 screening testing. Strong school-based
    screening testing programs rely on robust participation from the
    school community to ensure that they can identify and remove
    infected individuals from the school before any COVID-19 infection
    can spread. The resource can be found on the [ED
    website](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2021/10/ARP-Fact-Sheet_Screening-Testing.pdf).
