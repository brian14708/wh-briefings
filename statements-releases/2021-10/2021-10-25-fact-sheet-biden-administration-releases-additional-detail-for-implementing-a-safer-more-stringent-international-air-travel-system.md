title: "Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Releases Additional Detail for Implementing\
  \ a Safer, More Stringent International Air Travel\_System"
---
 
As we continue to work to protect people from COVID-19, today, the Biden
Administration is releasing additional detail around implementation of
the new international air travel policy requiring foreign national
travelers to the United States to be fully vaccinated. This updated
policy puts in place an international travel system that is stringent,
consistent across the globe, and guided by public health.  
  
Starting on November 8, non-citizen, non-immigrant air travelers to the
United States will be required to be fully vaccinated and to provide
proof of COVID-19 vaccination status prior to boarding an airplane to
fly to the U.S., with only limited exceptions. The updated travel
guidelines also include new protocols around testing. To further
strengthen protections, unvaccinated travelers – whether U.S. Citizens,
lawful permanent residents (LPRs), or the small number of excepted
unvaccinated foreign nationals – will now need to test within one day of
departure.  
  
Today, the Administration is releasing the following documents to
implement these requirements: 1) a Presidential Proclamation to Advance
the Safe Resumption of Global Travel During the COVID-19 Pandemic; 2)
three Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) Orders on
vaccination, testing, and contact tracing; and 3) technical instructions
to provide implementation details to the airlines and their
passengers.   
  
With science and public health as our guide, the United States has
developed a new international air travel system that both enhances the
safety of Americans here at home and enhances the safety of
international air travel. The additional detail released today provides
airlines and international air travelers with time to prepare for this
new policy ahead of the November 8 implementation date. As previously
announced, fully vaccinated foreign nationals will also be able to
travel across the Northern and Southwest land borders for non-essential
reasons, such as tourism, starting on November 8. Additional detail on
amendments to restrictions with respect to land borders will be
available in the coming days.  
  
Travelers can find full details about today’s air travel announcement on
the
[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel/index.html)
and [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html)
websites.  A summary is below:  
  
**Fully Vaccinated Status:**

-   Starting on November 8, non-citizen, non-immigrant air travelers to
    the United States will be required to be [fully
    vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html#annex)
    and to provide proof of vaccination status prior to boarding an
    airplane to fly to the U.S.

**Proof of Vaccination:**

-   For foreign nationals, proof of vaccination will be required – with
    very limited exceptions – to board the plane.  
-   Passengers will need to show their vaccination status, and the
    airlines will need to:
    -   Match the name and date of birth to confirm the passenger is the
        same person reflected on the proof of vaccination;
    -   Determine that the record was issued by an official source
        (e.g., public health agency, government agency) in the country
        where the vaccine was given;
    -   Review the essential information for determining if the
        passenger meets CDC’s definition for fully vaccinated such as
        vaccine product, number of vaccine doses received, date(s) of
        administration, site (e.g., vaccination clinic, health care
        facility) of vaccination.  
-   The Biden Administration will work closely with the airlines to
    ensure that these new requirements are implemented successfully.

**Accepted Vaccines:**

-   CDC has determined that for purposes of travel to the United States,
    vaccines accepted will include FDA approved or authorized and World
    Health Organization (WHO) emergency use listed (EUL) vaccines.

<!-- -->

-   Individuals can be considered fully vaccinated ≥2 weeks after
    receipt of the last dose if they have received any single dose of an
    FDA approved/authorized or WHO EUL approved single-dose series
    (i.e., Janssen), or any combination of two doses of an FDA
    approved/authorized or WHO emergency use listed COVID-19 two-dose
    series (i.e. mixing and matching).  
-   More details are available in the CDC Annex
    [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html).

**Enhanced Testing:**

-   Previously, all travelers were required to produce a negative viral
    test result within three days of travel to the United States.  
-   Both nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as a PCR test,
    and antigen tests qualify.  
-   As announced in September, the new system tightens those
    requirements, so that unvaccinated U.S. Citizens and LPRs will need
    to provide a negative test taken within one day of traveling.  
-   That means that all fully vaccinated U.S. Citizens and LPRs
    traveling to the United States should be prepared to present
    documentation of their vaccination status alongside their negative
    test result.  
-   For those Americans who can show they are fully vaccinated, the same
    requirement currently in place will apply – they have to produce a
    negative test result within three days of travel.  
-   For anyone traveling to the United States who cannot demonstrate
    proof of full vaccination, they will have to produce documentation
    of a negative test within one day of departure.

**Requirements for Children:**

-   Children under 18 are excepted from the vaccination requirement for
    foreign national travelers, given both the ineligibility of some
    younger children for vaccination, as well as the global variability
    in access to vaccination for older children who are eligible to be
    vaccinated.  
-   Children between the ages of 2 and 17 are required to take a
    pre-departure test.  
-   If traveling with a fully vaccinated adult, an unvaccinated child
    can test three days prior to departure (consistent with the timeline
    for fully vaccinated adults). If an unvaccinated child is traveling
    alone or with unvaccinated adults, they will have to test within one
    day of departure.

**Limited Exceptions from the Vaccination Requirement:**

-   There are a very limited set of exceptions from the vaccination
    requirement for foreign nationals. These include exceptions for
    children under 18, certain COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial
    participants, those with medical contraindications to the vaccines,
    those who need to travel for emergency or humanitarian reasons (with
    a US government-issued letter affirming the urgent need to travel),
    those who are traveling on non-tourist visas from countries with
    low-vaccine availability (as determined by the CDC), and other very
    narrow categories.  
-   Those who receive an exception will generally be required to attest
    they will comply with applicable public health requirements,
    including, with very limited exceptions, a requirement that they be
    vaccinated in the U.S. if they intend to stay here for more than 60
    days.

**Contact Tracing:**

-   The CDC is also issuing a Contact Tracing Order that requires all
    airlines flying into the United States to keep on hand – and
    promptly turn over to the CDC, when needed – contact information
    that will allow public health officials to follow up with inbound
    air travelers who are potentially infected or have been exposed to
    someone who is infected.  
-   This is a critical public health measure both to prevent the
    introduction, transmission, and spread of new variants of COVID-19
    as well as to add a critical prevention tool to address other public
    health threats.
