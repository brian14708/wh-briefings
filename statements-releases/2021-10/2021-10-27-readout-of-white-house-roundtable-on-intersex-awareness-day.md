title: Readout of White House Roundtable on Intersex Awareness Day
---
 
Yesterday, White House officials Jennifer Klein, Deputy Assistant to the
President and Executive Director of the Gender Policy Council, and
Chiraag Bains, Deputy Assistant to the President for Racial Justice and
Equity, as well as Assistant Secretary of Health Admiral Rachel Levine,
hosted the first-ever White House roundtable with intersex advocates.
The roundtable celebrated Intersex Awareness Day, which promotes
dignity, visibility, and equal rights for the millions of people in
America and around the world who are born with variations in physical
sex characteristics.  
   
Participants discussed the invisibility, stigma, and discrimination that
far too many intersex Americans continue to face. They discussed the
toll that non-consensual medical interventions and surgeries performed
on intersex children often have on people’s mental and physical health.
Participants also discussed the importance of advancing health equity
and full equality for intersex Americans, including investing in
research, securing non-discrimination protections, and advancing their
visibility. Finally, participants highlighted the strength and
resilience of the intersex rights movement and recent progress in
advancing intersex equality at the state level.  
   
The administration officials thanked participants for their advocacy and
courage. They reiterated that the Biden-Harris Administration is
committed to advancing justice, opportunity, and safety for intersex
Americans. And they highlighted a new resource released today by the
Department of Education on [protecting the rights of intersex
students](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-factsheet-intersex-202110.pdf).
