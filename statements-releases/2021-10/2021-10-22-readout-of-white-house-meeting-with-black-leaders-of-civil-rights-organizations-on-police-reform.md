title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Black Leaders of Civil Rights Organizations\
  \ on Police\_Reform"
---
 
Yesterday, senior officials from the White House and the Department of
Justice met with Black leaders of Civil Rights organizations to discuss
police reform.  The meeting is part of broader outreach and engagement
by the Biden-Harris Administration with members of the civil rights and
law enforcement communities, members of Congress, and victims’ families
to define a path forward on meaningful police reform, including through
executive actions.  
  
Officials from the Biden-Harris Administration taking part in the
meeting included Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, Senior Advisor
Cedric Richmond, White House Counsel Dana Remus, Deputy Attorney General
Lisa Monaco, and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. The
administration officials stressed the President’s belief that this
moment demands action to hold accountable law enforcement officers who
violate their oaths, and that we cannot be deterred by individuals who
are trying to block progress.  
  
The civil rights leaders underscored the urgency for action given the
lack of progress in Congress, and proposed a number of ideas for
advancing meaningful reforms through executive actions, including to
advance accountability for police misconduct, and to improve data
collection about interactions between police and individuals. The
leaders stressed to Administration officials that federal law
enforcement should serve as a model and that steps should be taken to
encourage reforms at the state and local levels.

The meeting participants included:

-   Melanie Campbell, National Coalition on Black Civic Participation
-   Joi Chaney, National Urban League
-   Alicia Garza, Black Futures Lab
-   Wade Henderson, Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights
-   Damon Hewitt, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law
