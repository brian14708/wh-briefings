title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with G20\_Leaders"
---
 
President Biden met virtually with G20 Leaders today to discuss
Afghanistan. The G20 Leaders were joined by Leaders of G20 guest
countries and international financial institutions. The Leaders
discussed the critical need to maintain a laser-focus on our enduring
counterterrorism efforts, including against threats from ISIS-K, and
ensuring safe passage for those foreign nationals and Afghan partners
with documentation seeking to depart Afghanistan. The Leaders also
reaffirmed their collective commitment to provide humanitarian
assistance directly to the Afghan people through independent
international organizations, and to promote fundamental human rights for
all Afghans, including women, girls, and members of minority groups. The
United States remains committed to working closely with the
international community and using diplomatic, humanitarian, and economic
means to address the situation in Afghanistan and support the Afghan
people.
