title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on the Occasion of Archbishop\
  \ Desmond Tutu\u2019s Birthday"
---
 
I send my best wishes to Archbishop Desmond Tutu on his 90<sup>th</sup>
birthday and join the world in celebrating his life of service and
contributions to humanity.  I’ve been honored to meet and spend time
with Archbishop Tutu on several occasions over the years, and like so
many others, I am inspired by his personal commitment to championing
human rights and to always speaking out for what is right.  The world
first came to know Archbishop Tutu as he modeled the highest tenets of
his faith in challenging the injustice of Apartheid in South Africa. His
courage and moral clarity at that time helped inspire my own commitment
as a United States Senator to change American policy toward the
Apartheid regime in South Africa. And in the years since, the world has
continued to learn from Archbishop Tutu’s message of justice, equality,
and reconciliation.  
  
In honor of Archbishop Tutu, let us all recommit ourselves to the work
that has animated his life: advancing respect for human rights,
strengthening equality, protecting fundamental freedoms, and fighting
for racial justice, both at home and around the world.
