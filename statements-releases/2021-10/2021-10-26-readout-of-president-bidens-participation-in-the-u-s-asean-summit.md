President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. today joined leaders of the Association
of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) member states and the ASEAN Secretary
General for the annual U.S.-ASEAN Summit.  He reaffirmed the U.S.
commitment to strengthening our partnership with ASEAN as well as to its
centrality and applauded the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.

The President underscored the enduring commitment of the United States
to the region and pledged to deepen our cooperation to take on the
challenges of our time, which includes working with our allies and
partners to defend against threats to the international rules-based
order and to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific.

The President announced the intent to provide up to $102 million in new
initiatives to expand the U.S.-ASEAN Strategic Partnership to support
the region’s recovery from COVID-19, address the climate crisis, promote
economic growth, and develop human capital. Additionally, President
Biden underlined the importance of the strategic partnership between the
United States and ASEAN, highlighting new efforts to expand high-level
U.S.-ASEAN cooperation in health, climate, energy, transportation, and
gender empowerment. He reiterated the U.S. commitment to ending the
COVID-19 pandemic and building back better to prepare for the next,
including making available more than 40 million vaccine doses and more
than $200 million in emergency health and humanitarian assistance to
ASEAN member states to fight COVID-19.  He urged bold action to
strengthen health systems and health security, mitigate the climate
crisis and reaffirmed U.S. support to build back better and drive a
green recovery.

He also expressed grave concerns about the military coup and horrific
violence in Burma and called on the country’s military regime to
immediately end the violence, release those unjustly detained, and
restore Burma’s path to democracy.  He expressed support for ASEAN
efforts to hold the Burmese military regime accountable to the Five
Point Consensus.
