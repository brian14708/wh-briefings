I send my congratulations to Kishida Fumio on his election by the Diet
to be Prime Minister of Japan. The U.S.-Japan Alliance is the
cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and
the world, and I look forward to working closely with Prime Minister
Kishida to strengthen our cooperation in the months and years ahead. The
historic partnership between our two democracies and our two peoples
will continue to be a critical asset as we work together to take on the
challenges of our time. I also want to commend former Prime Minister
Suga for a successful tenure and thank him for his partnership to
advance the U.S.-Japan Alliance.
