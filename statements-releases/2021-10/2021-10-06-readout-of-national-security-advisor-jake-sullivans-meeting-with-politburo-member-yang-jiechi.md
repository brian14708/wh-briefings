National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan today met with Chinese Communist
Party Politburo Member and Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs
Commission Yang Jiechi in Zurich, Switzerland. Their meeting followed up
on the September 9 phone call between President Biden and President Xi
in which the leaders discussed the importance of maintaining open lines
of communication to responsibly manage the competition between the
United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Mr. Sullivan
also raised areas where the United States and the PRC have an interest
in working together to address vital transnational challenges, and ways
to manage risks in our relationship. Mr. Sullivan raised a number of
areas where we have concern with the PRC’s actions, including actions
related to human rights, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, and
Taiwan. Mr. Sullivan made clear that while we will continue to invest in
our own national strength and work closely with our allies and partners,
we will also continue to engage with the PRC at a senior level to ensure
responsible competition.
