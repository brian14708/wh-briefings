title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden and First Lady Jill\_Biden on the Passing\
  \ of General Raymond\_Odierno"

We are devastated to learn of the death of General Raymond Odierno, US
Army, retired. Ray was a giant in military circles—dedicated first and
always to the service members he commanded and served alongside. And
through almost four decades of service to our nation in uniform, he
helped grow the United States Army into the modern fighting force it is
today—an Army, in Odierno’s words, that is “admired and deeply respected
by our Allies” and “feared by our adversaries.”  
  
When we think back on our time as Vice President and Second Lady, Ray
was part of some of our most poignant memories—ones that will be with us
for the rest of our lives. Ray welcomed us to Camp Victory in Iraq
where, to honor July 4th, we helped to swear in as American citizens
immigrants to our country who were already serving, fighting, and
sacrificing on behalf of our nation. He was there to pass his wisdom on
to West Point graduates as a fellow member of the Long Gray Line. Ray
and his wife Linda were partners and fierce advocates for military
children and families. And we will be forever grateful for the words and
the kindness that Ray shared when he spoke at the funeral of our beloved
son Beau and awarded him with the Legion of Merit.  
  
We can think of no person who better encapsulated that basic creed of
duty, honor, country than General Ray Odierno. He made our entire nation
better, stronger, and more secure. We are keeping his beloved wife
Linda, their children Tony, Mike, and Katie, and their grandchildren in
our prayers.  Ray was Beau’s commander in Iraq, and he was there in our
moment of deepest grief. We stand with the Odierno family and all our
brave service members who were shaped and molded by General Odierno over
his lifetime of service, and who are grieving today as well. Today is a
sad day for our nation. We have lost a hero of great integrity and
honor.
