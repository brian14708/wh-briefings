After a day of constructive meetings, the President is more confident
this evening about the path forward to delivering for the American
people on strong, sustained economic growth that benefits everyone. The
discussions focused around a shared commitment to the care economy,
ensuring working families have more breathing room, addressing the
climate crisis, and investing in industries of the future so that we can
compete globally. There was broad agreement that there is urgency in
moving forward over the next several days and that the window for
finalizing a package is closing.
