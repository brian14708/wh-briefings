title: Statement by Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Build Back Better Framework and Bipartisan
  Infrastructure Deal
---
 
After decades of inaction on some of the most pressing issues for
American families, today the President put forward a historic economic
growth framework that will make the biggest investment in tackling the
climate crisis in history, cut the cost of child care in half for a
majority of middle class families, make universal pre-K a reality, and
make the biggest progress in lowering the cost of health care in over 10
years.

Out of the gate, this unprecedented framework was welcomed across the
country—including by organized labor, civil rights groups, business, and
the climate community—and by every kind of Democrat in Congress.
Legislative text is starting to become public, and the road to passing
both critical parts of the President’s plan to make our economy deliver
for middle class families—not just the wealthy—is clearer than ever.

As the President said this morning, we are proud of the hard work we’ve
done with Members of Congress over these last months, and we’re
confident that soon we’ll pass both the Build Back Better Act and the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
