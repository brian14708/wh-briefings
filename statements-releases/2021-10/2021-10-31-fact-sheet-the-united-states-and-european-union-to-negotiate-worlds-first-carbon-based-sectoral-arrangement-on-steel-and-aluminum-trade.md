title: "FACT SHEET: The United\_States and European Union To Negotiate World\u2019\
  s First Carbon-Based Sectoral Arrangement on Steel and Aluminum\_Trade"
---
 
***Arrangement Will Remove European Union tariffs and lower costs for
American families***

***Arrangement will counter flood of cheap steel by other countries,
including the People’s Republic of China (PRC), that harms our
industries and our workers***

Today, the United States and the European Union announced their
commitment to negotiate the world’s first carbon-based sectoral
arrangement on steel and aluminum trade by 2024. This announcement
delivers a major win in the fight to address the climate crisis while
protecting our workers and industry, and enabling them to compete in the
global marketplace. The President believes that climate action must mean
good jobs – and today’s announcement demonstrates that we can work with
our partners and allies to both reduce emissions, and protect and create
good-paying union jobs at home.

The United States and the European Union also used the strength of their
partnership to come to an interim arrangement for trade in the steel and
aluminum sectors that modifies tariffs on European Union steel and
aluminum providers, addresses global overcapacity, and toughens
enforcement mechanisms to prevent leakage of Chinese steel and aluminum
into the U.S. market. As a result of the arrangement, the Europe Union
will remove its tariffs on a wide range of products, protecting American
jobs, reducing costs for middle-class families, and maintaining U.S.
export competitiveness.

Together, the United States and European Union will work to restrict
access to their markets for dirty steel and limit access to countries
that dump steel in our markets, contributing to worldwide over-supply.
This arrangement will be open to any interested country that wishes to
join and meets criteria for restoring market orientation and reducing
trade in high-carbon steel and aluminum products.

This arrangement will: 

-   **Be a global first in the fight against climate change and
    countering distortive economic practices that harm our interests**.
    Never have two global partners aligned their trade policies to
    confront the threats of climate change and global market
    distortions, ensuring that trade works to solve the challenges of
    the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The deal demonstrates President Biden’s
    commitment to putting U.S. workers and communities at the center of
    our trade agenda.   
      
-   **Protect American jobs and industry and provide them with an
    advantage. **American-made steel and aluminum is produced with far
    fewer emissions than dirtier alternatives made in the PRC and
    elsewhere. To date, American steel companies and workers have
    received no benefit for their low-carbon production. Low-carbon
    steel across all production types —and the workers who make it—will
    be incentivized and rewarded going forward.**  
      
    **
-   **Results in lower prices for American consumers and families **by
    providing relief for American manufacturers who rely on readily
    accessible, affordable steel and aluminum to make their products.
    Steel and aluminum are essential components of many manufactured
    goods, including automobiles, household appliances, building
    materials, and more.

-   **Demonstrate the climate ambition and global leadership of the
    Biden-Harris Administration.** Steel and aluminum production are two
    of the most carbon-intensive industrial sectors, accounting for
    roughly 10 percent of all carbon emissions —comparable to the total
    emissions of India. A carbon-based sectoral arrangement will drive
    investment in green steel production in the United States, Europe,
    and around the world, ensuring a competitive U.S. steel industry for
    decades to come.

-   **Showcase the strength of the U.S.-EU relationship**. The United
    States and European Union pledged at the U.S.-EU Summit in June to
    use the size of their collective economies to update the rules of
    the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Today’s announcement delivers on that
    promise and builds on the successful resolution of the 17-year
    Boeing-Airbus dispute and the creation of the US-EU Trade &
    Technology Council.
