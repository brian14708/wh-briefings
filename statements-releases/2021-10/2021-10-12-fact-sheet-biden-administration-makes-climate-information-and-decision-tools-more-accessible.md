title: "FACT SHEET: Biden Administration Makes Climate Information and Decision Tools\
  \ More\_Accessible"
---
 
Today, the Biden Administration is launching a whole-of-government
initiative to deliver accessible and actionable information to
individuals and communities that are being hit by flooding, drought,
wildfires, extreme heat, coastal erosion, and other intensifying climate
impacts. This effort will put authoritative and useful information into
the hands of more Americans—from broadcast meteorologists sharing
climate information with communities, to farmers checking drought
outlooks, to businesses planning for extreme weather, to families making
decisions about their homes and neighborhoods. The initiative answers
President Biden’s call in his [Executive Order on Tackling the Climate
Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/)
to enhance understanding of climate risks and empower communities to
better prepare and become more resilient.  
  
With the climate crisis impacting every region and economic sector,
federal agencies are working together to launch a coordinated effort to
provide more robust information services that reach all communities. The
federal government started down this path with web-accessible maps that
show [extreme heat hot
spots](https://nihhis.cpo.noaa.gov/vulnerability-mapping) and areas
impacted by [wildfire smoke](https://fire.airnow.gov/). Now, with the
new resources and interagency strategies announced today, public
officials and others who are making important decisions—about starting a
business, finding a home, or running a neighborhood program—will have
access to the kind of science and data-based planning and response tools
they need to make sound, climate-smart decisions.  
  
Administration officials are announcing these new efforts during a
Climate and Equity Roundtable in Detroit, Michigan, hosted by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The roundtable
is focused on hearing on-the-ground experiences related to this summer’s
severe flooding—particularly in urban neighborhoods with aging
infrastructure not built to handle increasingly heavy rainfall events.
By continuing to strengthen partnerships with community stakeholders,
state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, and businesses, the
Biden Administration will ensure that federal information services
respond to evolving needs, particularly those of disadvantaged
communities. And through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the
Build Back Better Agenda, President Biden has proposed additional,
historic investments to build resilience across our transportation
systems, housing, water infrastructure, and energy grid.  
  
Today’s announcements include:

-   **A launch by NOAA of a redesigned**
    [**Climate.gov**](https://climate.gov/) **that integrates artificial
    intelligence (AI) to improve the accessibility of accurate and
    timely climate information.** The upgrades to this flagship website,
    including search tools enhanced by artificial intelligence and a
    suite of user experience and accessibility improvements, will better
    connect Americans to climate explainers, data dashboards, and
    classroom-ready teaching resources. NOAA is also awarding more than
    $171 million in new [climate research
    grants](https://cpo.noaa.gov/Funding-Opportunities/FY2021-Recipients)
    and hosting additional Climate and Equity Roundtables across the
    country to receive recommendations on improving its products and
    services to better meet the needs of all communities.  
-   **The release of two new reports delivered to the National Climate
    Task Force outlining the ways the federal government will improve
    access to climate tools and services.** These reports lay out a
    comprehensive roadmap for the federal government to further increase
    open-access delivery of climate tools and services. The White House
    Office of Science & Technology Policy (OSTP), NOAA, and the Federal
    Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) led a
    [report](https://downloads.globalchange.gov/reports/eo-14008-211-d-report.pdf)
    on holistically expanding and improving climate information and
    services for the public. A second
    [report](https://www.fgdc.gov/resources/key-publications/2021-climate-mapping-report),
    developed by the member agencies of the Federal Geographic Data
    Committee, focuses on opportunities to enhance geospatial data and
    mapping tools to inform climate planning.  
-   **The initiation of a process by FEMA to assess** **the National
    Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) standards to help communities align
    their construction and land**–**use practices with the latest
    understandings of flood risk reduction.** The NFIP’s minimum
    floodplain management standards—which communities adopt and enforce
    to become eligible for federal flood insurance—have not been
    substantially updated since 1976. Through a new [Request for
    Information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/12/2021-22152/request-for-information-on-the-national-flood-insurance-programs-floodplain-management-standards-for),
    FEMA will gather stakeholder input to inform potential revisions
    that make communities more resilient and save lives, homes, and
    money.

This whole-of-government effort builds on FEMA’s
[announcement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/09/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-nearly-5-billion-in-resilience-funding-to-help-communities-prepare-for-extreme-weather-and-climate-related-disasters/)
earlier this year of nearly $5 billion in funding available for
community projects to prepare for extreme weather and other
climate-related disasters. It will improve climate information and
services in ways that will allow communities to more effectively enhance
their resilience to climate change, equitably deploy increased
resilience resources, and mitigate climate change-related risks to the
financial and economic security of America’s families, businesses, and
workers—a [key Administration
priority](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-directs-agencies-to-analyze-and-mitigate-the-risk-climate-change-poses-to-homeowners-and-consumers-businesses-and-workers-and-the-financial-system-and-federal-government/).  
  
The Biden Administration is today announcing:  
  
**New-and-Improved Climate Website**  
NOAA’s Climate Program Office launched a newly redesigned version of
[Climate.gov](https://climate.gov/), NOAA’s award-winning, flagship
website that provides the public with clear, timely, and science-based
information about climate. The redesign expands the site’s already
significant capacity to connect Americans with the resources they need
to understand and plan for climate-related risks.  
  
The site’s redesigned [Global Climate
Dashboard](https://www.climate.gov/climatedashboard) gives a data-driven
readout on the state of the climate system with public-friendly
explainers and answers to [frequently asked
questions](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa).
Climate.gov also provides access to commonly requested [climate data and
tools](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data) hosted by NOAA’s [National
Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) and
Regional Climate Centers.  
  
Other updates include:

-   Using an artificial intelligence platform to improve the search
    tool, allowing queries based on location so that users can find city
    and state-specific maps and data;
-   Cross-linking content to highlight all available resources sitewide
    that are relevant to each visitor’s unique interests;
-   Improving the mobile experience on tablets and smartphones; and
-   Redesigning pages with user experience and accessibility in mind.

**Interagency Reports on Climate Information Services**  
As directed by President Biden’s [Executive Order on Tackling the
Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/),
agencies have developed two reports to the National Climate Task Force
on climate information services to help governments, communities, and
businesses prepare for and adapt to climate impacts.  
  
*Expanding Climate Information and Services for the Public*  
The first report, titled  “[Opportunities for Expanding and Improving
Climate Information and Services for the
Public](https://downloads.globalchange.gov/reports/eo-14008-211-d-report.pdf),”
charts a course for expanding accessibility and use of the federal
government’s climate information to support all communities, including
those who have been historically underserved, on climate planning and
resilience activities.  
  
Developed by OSTP, NOAA, and FEMA, with inputs from other federal
experts, this report outlines a plan to provide more robust and
actionable “climate services”—science-based information and products
that enhance understanding of climate impacts—to meet the needs of a
diversity of users. The report lays out priority opportunities to: 

-   Focus climate services on the challenges that pose the greatest
    risks and opportunities to society;
-   Foster interagency coordination and strategic public-private
    partnerships to develop, deliver, and continually advance climate
    services;
-   Enhance the usability, translation, and relevance of climate
    services to support use by all Americans; and
-   Strengthen core science capabilities needed to expand and improve
    climate services.

The report builds off of the federal government’s existing
climate-related information, tools, and services, such as the
interagency [U.S. Climate Resilience
Toolkit](https://toolkit.climate.gov/); [FEMA’s National Risk Index for
Natural
Hazards](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/national-risk-index);
and the [AirNow Fire and Smoke Map](https://fire.airnow.gov/) developed
by the EPA, CDC, and U.S. Forest Service.  
  
*Federal Mapping Services for Climate Planning and Resilience*  
The second report, titled “[Advancing the Nation’s Geospatial
Capabilities to Promote Federal, State, Local, and Tribal Climate
Planning and
Resilience](https://www.fgdc.gov/resources/key-publications/2021-climate-mapping-report),”
focuses on the role the federal government plays in providing geospatial
data and mapping tools, and the potential for a collaborative federal
mapping service to make climate data more accessible.

The Department of the Interior and the Office of Management and Budget
led an interagency team that developed the report, in their roles as
chair and vice chair of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).
The report recommends:

-   Building on the FGDC’s existing GeoPlatform, which provides public
    access to federal geospatial data, by ensuring that all agencies
    register their climate-related datasets;
-   Making this data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and
    reusable; and
-   Exploring potential enhancements to the GeoPlatform model with new
    software, services, or tools to help agencies and public-private
    partnerships develop specialized climate information products.

**Potential Revisions to Minimum Floodplain Management Standards**  
Flood and coastal storm events are increasing in frequency and severity,
with billion-dollar events up 50% by the end of 2020, compared to the
previous decade—and 70% of those costs were incurred in just the last
three years. The foundation for national efforts to protect lives and
homes from flood disasters is FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP), which makes flood insurance available in communities that adopt
and enforce floodplain management ordinances to reduce future flood
risk.  
  
While FEMA has provided ongoing updates to NFIP policies and technical
guidance, the minimum floodplain management standards themselves have
not been revised since being initially implemented in 1976. Today, FEMA
is publishing a [Request for
Information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/12/2021-22152/request-for-information-on-the-national-flood-insurance-programs-floodplain-management-standards-for)
that kicks off the process of revising these standards to better address
current and future conditions. FEMA will gather public comments to
inform potential revisions that protect households from flood damage,
make communities more resilient, and reduce a major source of financial
risk to the country.   
  
**Climate Research Funding and Community Roundtables**  
To further support innovative and impactful climate science, NOAA is
[awarding](https://cpo.noaa.gov/Funding-Opportunities/FY2021-Recipients)
more than $171 million in five-year grants to support 72 research
projects—the highest five-year investment in the history of NOAA’s
Climate Program Office. Climate research areas will include advancing
environmental justice; improvements in climate models; advances in the
use and understanding of ocean observations to enhance NOAA’s climate
modeling; and advances in resilience planning for future flooding
impacts and other coastal stressors.  
  
NOAA is also gathering input directly from local stakeholders, by
hosting a series of Climate and Equity Roundtables to receive
recommendations on how to make improvements to its policies, products,
and services to better meet the needs of underserved communities. In
addition to today’s roundtable in Detroit, Michigan on neighborhood
flooding, future roundtables will focus on heat resilience in Arizona
and Nevada. These follow prior roundtables on coastal inundation in
Louisiana, equitable climate resilience in the Pacific Islands, flooding
and resilience in Mississippi River communities, coastal flood risk in
Connecticut, and climate risks in Alaska conducted with the Alaska
Native Tribal Health Consortium.  
  
**Social Science Support from the National Science Foundation**  
The National Science Foundation (NSF) will leverage its [Societal
Experts Action Network
(SEAN)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/societal-experts-action-network)
to support the work of National Climate Task Force’s Interagency Working
Groups on Drought, Flood, Coastal, Extreme Heat, and Wildfire
Resilience. The SEAN consists of experts in the social, behavioral, and
economic sciences who develop evidence-based recommendations to support
decision-makers at all levels of government. As part of this new
initiative, SEAN will work to quickly generate reports on the latest
science about the usability, translation, and relevance of climate
services to support mission agencies’ work in building resilience.
