*Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Homeland Security
Alejandro N. Mayorkas, and White House Coordinator for Operation Allies
Welcome Jack Markell led a roundtable with CEOs to discuss the role of
the private sector in effectively welcoming and resettling our Afghan
allies.*

Today, White House Coordinator for Operation Allies Welcome Jack
Markell, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Homeland
Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas, convened a conversation with CEOs and
other senior executives from 28 companies engaged in private sector
efforts to welcome Afghan allies and at-risk Afghans in the United
States. The White House hosted the roundtable along with Welcome.US, a
new hub working to channel the outpouring of support from Americans and
institutions eager to get involved in welcoming and resettling Afghans
across the United States. Participants in today’s roundtable included
leaders in the airline, housing, banking, consumer goods, financial
services, and other industries who have been engaged in the historic
resettlement effort known as Operation Allies Welcome (OAW).

During the meeting, Biden Administration officials shared updates on the
historic effort to resettle our Afghan allies. Participants shared
private sector efforts underway to support resettlement by bringing
their resources, networks, and expertise to bear.  The participants
discussed opportunities to equip Afghans for success by accelerating
resettlement and reducing barriers to employment, affordable housing,
education, health care, and other needs. Administration officials
highlighted the widespread national support for welcoming Afghans as
part of a long proud American tradition of offering a safe haven to
newcomers.

Operation Allies Welcome is the Biden Administration’s effort to provide
a safe, secure, and dignified welcome to our Afghan allies. OAW aims to
marshal a whole-of-America response to resettlement, serving as a strong
partner to every American and every organization that wants to help.
