title: Statement from Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Texas S.B. 8 Court Ruling
---
 
Tonight’s ruling is an important step forward toward restoring the
constitutional rights of women across the state of Texas. S.B. 8 not
only blatantly violates the right to safe and legal abortion established
under *Roe v. Wade*, but it creates a scheme to allow private citizens
to interfere with that right and to evade judicial review.

The fight has only just begun, both in Texas and in many states across
this country where women’s rights are currently under attack. That’s why
the President supports codifying *Roe v. Wade*, why he has directed a
whole-of-government response to S.B. 8, and why he will continue to
stand side-by-side with women across the country to protect their
constitutional rights.
