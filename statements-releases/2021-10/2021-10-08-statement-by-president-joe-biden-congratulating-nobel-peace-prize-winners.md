title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden Congratulating Nobel Peace Prize\_Winners"
---
 
I congratulate Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov of
Russia for the much-deserved honor of being named this year’s winners of
the Nobel Peace Prize. Like so many journalists around the world, Ressa
and Muratov have pursued the facts—tirelessly and fearlessly. They have
worked to check the abuse of power, expose corruption, and demand
transparency. They have been tenacious in founding independent media
outlets and defending them against forces that seek their silence. And,
for their commitment to the basic principles of the free
press—principles that are indispensable to a healthy democracy—they have
faced constant threats, harassment and intimidation, legal action, and
even, in the case of Muratov, the death of his colleagues. Ressa,
Muratov, and journalists like them all around the world are on the front
lines of a global battle for the very idea of the truth, and I, along
with people everywhere, am grateful for their groundbreaking work to
“hold the line,” as Ressa so often says.

I applaud the Nobel Committee for honoring Ressa and Muratov’s
incredible work and bringing greater attention to the increasing
pressure on journalists, the free press, and freedom of expression all
around the world.
