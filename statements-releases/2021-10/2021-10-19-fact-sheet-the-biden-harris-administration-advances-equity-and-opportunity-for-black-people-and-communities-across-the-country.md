title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Black People and Communities Across the\_Country"
---
 
From the first day in office and every day since, the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken a historic approach to advancing racial equity,
including directing every agency across the whole of the federal
government to address the lasting impacts of systemic racism on Black
communities. For generations, entrenched disparities in our society and
economy, at times facilitated by the federal government, have made it
harder for Black Americans to have a fair shot at the American dream.
Centuries of injustice and decades of disinvestment in Black communities
not only undermine the American promise of equal opportunity, but also
keep our entire nation from reaching its potential.  
  
Today, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/10/19/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for-black-americans/)
on the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity,
Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Black Americans. This is just
the latest action taken by President Biden and Vice President Harris to
tackle systemic racism and make investments to rebuild our economy and
our social safety net so all people, including Black Americans, can
thrive. Already, the Administration has delivered generation-defining
outcomes for Black Americans.  
  
**Economic Opportunity for Black Families and Communities. **By signing
into law the historic American Rescue Plan (ARP) and implementing robust
regulatory reform, President Biden has helped Black Americans own and
stay in homes. The ARP has expanded access to wealth creation through
small business ownership in Black communities, and President Biden has
directed agencies to use federal contracting authority to increase its
procurement from small disadvantaged businesses, including Black-owned
businesses, by 50%. Under President Biden, federal agencies are also now
working to ensure that projects proposed for federal funding are
reviewed for disparate impacts before they are awarded and that federal
funding does not go to grant applicants with a record of racial
discrimination. These transformative policies and programs include:

-   ***Providing Immediate Relief to Black People and Families through
    the American Rescue Plan**.*** The
    [ARP](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/American-Rescue-Plan-Fact-Sheet.pdf)
    provides cash relief directly to low- and middle-income Americans,
    and is projected to cut the Black child poverty rate by [more than
    50%](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/03/23/covid-19-has-exacerbated-the-economic-inequality-and-caregiving-crisis-facing-women-of-color-heres-how-the-american-rescue-plan-helps/)
    this year and has already [cut Black child poverty by
    40.1%](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/612014f2e6deed08adb03e18/1629492468260/Monthly-Poverty-with-CTC-July-CPSP-2021.pdf),
    lifting approximately 420,000 Black children out of poverty between
    June and July alone. In addition, the Plan increased Supplemental
    Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by 15% through
    September 2021. Through this Plan, the President has [reduced food
    insecurity in Black
    households](https://www.cbpp.org/blog/after-child-tax-credit-payments-begin-many-more-families-have-enough-to-eat)
    – which had been double the White household rate – between
    one-fourth and one-third since early July.
-   ***Leveraging Federal Procurement to Narrow the Racial Wealth Gap
    for Black Entrepreneurs and Families.***  Recognizing that the
    Federal government spends more than $650 billion each year on
    purchasing goods and services, President Biden has directed agencies
    to use federal purchasing power to grow federal contracting with
    small disadvantaged businesses, including Black-owned businesses, by
    50%, translating to an additional $100 billion over five years, and
    helping more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams.
-   ***Extending a Lifeline to Struggling Small Businesses.*** The
    American Rescue Plan provided emergency grants, lending, and
    investment to hard-hit small businesses – including Black businesses
    – so they can rehire and retain workers and purchase the health and
    sanitation equipment they need to keep workers safe. This includes a
    Small Business Opportunity Fund to provide growth capital to main
    street small businesses in economically disadvantaged areas,
    including minority-owned businesses.
-   ***Ensuring Black Homeowners Get Full Value for their Homes.*** In
    June, President Biden directed the launch of a first-of-its-kind
    interagency effort to address inequity in home appraisals and
    conduct rulemaking to aggressively combat housing discrimination.
    The effort, led by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD) Secretary Marcia Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice,
    is developing a set of policy recommendations and actions for
    President Biden to redress racial bias in home appraisals.
-   ***Protecting Black Americans’ Access to Housing by Combating
    Housing Discrimination.*** Following President Biden’s Presidential
    Memorandum directing his Administration to address racial
    discrimination in the housing market, HUD published a rule in the
    Federal Register entitled “Restoring Affirmatively Furthering Fair
    Housing Definitions and Certifications” that requires HUD funding
    recipients to complete an assessment of fair housing issues,
    identify fair housing priorities and goals, and then commit to
    meaningful actions to meet those goals and remedy identified issues.
-   ***Helping Black Americans Stay in their Homes.*** President Biden’s
    American Rescue Plan has helped Americans stay in their homes by
    providing emergency aid to cover back rent. In addition, the ARP
    helps struggling homeowners catch up with their mortgage payments
    and utility costs through the Homeowners Assistance Fund. And, it
    provided additional funding for families and individuals who are
    recovering from or at risk of homelessness.
-   ***Assisting Black Land Owners in Resolving Title Issues.*** An
    estimated 60% of Black-owned land in the South is heirs’
    property—property that passes through inheritance without a will and
    that, as a result, has historically rendered owners ineligible for
    USDA programs, including lending. In July, the U.S. Department of
    Agriculture (USDA) rolled out the Heirs’ Property Relending Program,
    which primarily aids underserved communities, including Black
    Americans. The new program provides funds to assist heirs in
    resolving ownership and succession issues on farmland with multiple
    owners.
-   ***Dismantling Barriers to Accessing Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) Programs and Services.*** The ARP provides funding for USDA
    to establish one or more equity commissions to address historical
    discrimination and disparities in the agricultural sector. In
    September, USDA began requesting nominations for membership on the
    Equity Commission Advisory Committee and Equity Commission
    Subcommittee on Agriculture. The Equity Commission Advisory
    Committee will advise the Secretary of Agriculture by identifying
    USDA programs, policies, systems, structures, and practices that
    contribute to barriers to inclusion or access, systemic
    discrimination, or exacerbate or perpetuate racial, economic, health
    and social disparities
-   ***Ensuring that Federal Grants Don’t Support Discriminatory
    Activities**.*** In June, the Department of Transportation (DOT)
    [issued an
    Order](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/Final-for-OST-C-210312-002-signed.pdf)
    requiring its offices to review the potential discriminatory impact
    of grantees’ proposed activities before awarding federal funds.
    Under the Order, the agency won’t award federal financial assistance
    until that is satisfactorily completed.

**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity in K-12 Schools and Higher
Education.** As we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,
President Biden has delivered the support necessary to enable every
school to [safely
reopen](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/02/fact-sheet-reopening-schools-and-rebuilding-with-equity/#:~:text=The%20President%20made%20clear%20on%20Day%20One%20of,Services%20to%20safely%20reopen%20schools%20for%20in-person%20instruction)
for full-time, in-person instruction; accelerate academic achievement;
address the mental health needs of students; and build school
communities where all students feel they belong. At the same time,
President Biden has worked to ensure equitable access to high-quality
education for Black students. These policies and programs include:

-   ***Historic Investments to Safely Reopen Schools and Address the
    Needs of Students.*** The ARP provided $130 billion to help schools
    safely reopen and address the academic, social and emotional and
    mental health needs of all students, with funding set-aside to
    address the needs of students disproportionately impacted by the
    pandemic, including Black students. The Administration’s efforts to
    encourage all schools to adopt the CDC’s recommendations on masking,
    vaccinations and other COVID-19 protocols, have been particularly
    critical to the safe reopening of schools in Black communities hit
    hard by COVID-19.  In addition to funding the implementation of
    COVID-19 protocols, these funds are being used to hire counselors
    and social workers, provide tutors, establish and expand summer and
    after-school programming, and provide a wide range of supports that
    address the needs of Black students.
-   ***Protecting Students from Funding Cuts.*** The ARP’s Elementary
    and Secondary School Emergency Relief program includes a first of
    its kind maintenance of equity requirement to ensure that
    high-poverty school districts and schools are protected in the event
    of future funding cuts***.*** The Department of Education has
    provided resources and technical assistance to states and school
    districts as they implement this new requirement, which will ensure
    that school districts and schools serving a large share of students
    from low-income backgrounds will not experience disproportionate
    cuts, and that school districts with the highest poverty levels do
    not experience any decrease in state per-pupil funding below their
    pre-pandemic level.   
-   ***Historic Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities
    (HBCUs).***
    -   The ARP and other pandemic relief programs provided
        approximately $3.7 billion to HBCUs.
    -   Additionally, HBCUs received approximately $1.6 billion in debt
        relief to 45 HBCUs, including 13 public institutions and 32
        private institutions.
    -   President Biden signed an [Executive
        Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/03/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-through-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/)
        establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational
        Equity, Opportunity, and Excellence through HBCUs, which will
        create a government-wide approach to support the needs of HBCUs
        and the communities they serve and eliminate systemic barriers
        impeding HBCU participation in Federal programs. 
    -   During HBCU week, President Biden named Tony Allen, President of
        Delaware State University, as Chair of the President’s Board of
        Advisors on HBCUs. The Board, established by the Carter
        Administration, is meant to advance the goals of the HBCU
        Initiative.

**Improving Health Outcomes for Black Communities.** Facing a once-in a
century pandemic that highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing racial
disparities in our health care system, President Biden took swift action
to promote better health access and outcomes for Black families. The ARP
lowered health care costs for millions of lower- and middle-income Black
families and invested billions to promote equitable vaccine distribution
and provide critical supplies to stop the spread of COVID-19. These
policies and programs include:

-   ***Lowering Health Care Costs.*** Millions of lower- and
    middle-income Black families enrolled in health insurance
    marketplaces saw their premiums lowered or eliminated as a result of
    the ARP. Nationwide, existing consumers saved an average of
    [$67](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2021-sep-final-enrollment-report.pdf)
    per person per month on their premiums.  These monthly savings were
    even higher in 20 states and the District of Columbia where existing
    consumers saved, on average, over $75 per month. In addition,
    millions of uninsured Americans gained coverage during the
    Administration’s 2021 Special Enrollment Period (SEP).  Of those
    newly signing up for HealthCare.gov coverage who attested to race or
    ethnicity, 15% were Black Americans, up over 60% from 2019.
-   ***Improving Black Maternal Health.*** The President and Vice
    President are also committed to improving maternal health outcomes,
    including addressing the unacceptably high rates of maternal
    mortality and morbidity that disproportionately impact Black mothers
    and families.  In April, President Biden issued the first ever
    [Presidential Proclamation on Black Maternal Health
    Week](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/13/a-proclamation-on-black-maternal-health-week-2021/),
    calling on all Americans to recognize the importance of addressing
    the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity.  In addition,
    the President’s FY 22 budget request includes more than $200 million
    to bolster Maternal Mortality Review Committees, implement implicit
    bias training for health care providers, and create State pregnancy
    medical home programs, among other actions. It also includes $6
    billion for the critical Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
    Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program to help vulnerable
    families put healthy food on the table and address racial
    disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.  The
    Administration has also approved various Medicaid demonstrations to
    expand postpartum coverage, including in Illinois, which was the
    first state to provide full Medicaid benefits for 12 months
    postpartum (other states have expanded to six months postpartum
    coverage or expanded coverage to 10 months for those with substance
    use disorders). The ARP gives states an easier pathway to extend
    coverage for pregnant women from 60 days to 12 months postpartum;
    the Administration is working to encourage all states to take up
    this option so women can get the care they need to stay healthy.
-   ***Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response.*** Nationwide, Black
    people have died from COVID-19 at 1.4 times the rate of White
    people. The ARP provided $160 billion for the vaccines, tests,
    personal protective equipment, and public health workforce needed to
    address the spread of COVID-19, an investment that is helping to
    drive down racial disparities in prevention and care.  Due to the
    ARP and the President’s other investments in equitable access to the
    COVID-19 vaccine, multiple studies show that the gap in COVID
    vaccination rates in Black Americans compared to Whites and Latinos
    has closed. Data show that more than 70% of Black Americans, 73% of
    Latinos and 71% of White Americans have received at least one shot,
    compared to 56%, 57%, and 65%, respectively, in May. Additionally:
    -   FEMA surged resources to vaccinate all eligible Americans,
        including by standing up 500 vaccine sites in underserved
        communities. These emergency measures have helped deliver
        community-based and culturally competent care. In fact, over 50%
        of vaccines administered at the federally-run community
        vaccination centers went to Black Americans and other people of
        color, and more than 75% of people vaccinated at Community
        Health Centers are people of color.  
    -   In January, President Biden
        [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/21/executive-order-ensuring-an-equitable-pandemic-response-and-recovery/)
        an [Executive
        Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/21/executive-order-ensuring-an-equitable-pandemic-response-and-recovery/)
        on Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery,
        creating a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to provide specific
        recommendations to the President for mitigating the health
        inequities caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and
        for preventing such inequities in the future. Since February,
        there have been over 300 interim recommendations that the task
        force has developed on topics including interpersonal stress
        linked to racism, addressing the behavioral health consequences
        of the pandemic in communities of color, and vaccine access and
        acceptance. Some recommendations have already been implemented
        by the Administration, and final recommendations are slated for
        release in October.

**Taking Strong Action to Reform Our Criminal Justice System.** From
enhancing police accountability, to reforming law enforcement and
investing in community-based public strategies, to stopping harmful
prosecution and incarceration practices, to supporting reentry, the
Biden-Harris Administration has taken concrete actions to reform the
criminal justice system and root out racial disparities. These policies
and programs include:

-   ***Reforming Law Enforcement Practices.*** In September, the
    Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a ban on use of chokeholds and
    carotid restraints except where deadly force is necessary, and new
    restrictions on no-knock warrants—implementing reforms for federal
    law enforcement administratively that the President had called on
    Congress to enact nationwide through the George Floyd Justice in
    Police Act. The Department also implemented a new policy requiring
    federal agents to wear body cameras when executing search warrants
    and pre-planned arrests. These changes make real the policy reform
    the country must undertake to prevent tragic killings like those of
    George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the future. The directives apply
    to all agencies overseen by the Department including the FBI, Drug
    Enforcement Agency, and U.S. Marshal’s Service. In September, the
    Department of Homeland Security announced the formation of the Law
    Enforcement Coordination Council (LECC)—the Department’s first
    unified law enforcement coordination body, chaired by the
    Secretary—to comprehensively review and revise its policies and
    training on use of force, compliance with civil rights and privacy
    interests, and other matters. In July, the Department of the
    Interior created a task force to study and recommend reforms for the
    its law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Park Police. 
-   ***Restoring the Use of Consent Decrees to End Systemic Police
    Misconduct.*** The DOJ rescinded guidance from the previous
    Administration curtailing the use of consent decrees to reform
    police departments with a pattern or practice of discrimination and
    misconduct. During this Administration, DOJ has opened
    pattern-or-practice investigations of the Minneapolis, Louisville,
    and Phoenix police departments.
-   ***Improving Prosecutorial Guidance to Prevent Unduly Harsh
    Sentencing.*** The DOJ withdrew guidance issued in the previous
    Administration that required prosecutors to always charge the
    harshest sentences, replacing it with guidance that restored
    discretion to make decisions about charging, plea agreements, and
    advocacy at sentencing based on an individualized assessment of
    relevant facts.
-   ***Supporting Legislation to Reform Racist Disparities in
    Sentencing.*** The President endorsed the EQUAL Act, which would
    eliminate the racist crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity once
    and for all and make the change fully retroactive.
-   ***Executive Order Limiting Use of Private Prisons.*** The President
    ordered DOJ not to renew contracts for privately-operated criminal
    detention facilities, covering the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and U.S.
    Marshals Service (USMS). When completed, this will result in up to
    14,000 people in BOP custody and 10,000 people in USMS custody being
    moved out of private prisons.
-   ***Support for Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs.***
    Black boys and young men ages 15-34 make up 2% of the population but
    are 37% of homicide victims, and homicide is the leading cause of
    death for Black men under the age of 45. Until this Administration,
    however, CVI programs like violence interrupters and hospital-based
    programs, which are demonstrated to reduce violence by up to 60%,
    have been badly underfunded.  Under President Biden, the Treasury
    Department and Education Department issued guidance stating that CVI
    programs are eligible uses of American Rescue Plan funds—both the
    $350 billion in aid to state, Tribal, and local governments and the
    $122 billion to school districts. The Administration pivoted 26
    existing grant programs across five agencies to support CVI. And
    President Biden continues to seek $5 billion in dedicated funding
    for CVI programs through his Build Back Better legislation. These
    historic funds would help curtail the epidemic of gun violence that
    hits Black communities hardest.
-   ***Support for Reentry of Returning Citizens.*** In February,
    President Biden expanded access to Paycheck Protection Program loans
    by removing restrictions for entrepreneurs with certain past
    criminal records, bringing long overdue help to small businesses
    previously unable to access these funds. In June, the Department of
    Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly incarcerated adults and
    young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal
    justice system and connect with quality jobs. The President issued
    an Executive Order directing the Office of Personnel Management to
    evaluate the existence of any barriers that formerly incarcerated
    individuals face in accessing federal employment, and to expand
    federal employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated
    individuals. The Labor and Treasury Departments announced they would
    produce resources to help employers leverage tax credits to
    incentivize the hiring of formerly incarcerated persons. HUD
    clarified that returning citizens are eligible for the 70,000
    emergency housing vouchers created by the ARP.
-   ***Addressing Domestic Violent Extremism.*** President Biden
    directed the U.S. government to assess the threat of domestic
    violent extremism in the United States. In January, Secretary of the
    Department of Defense (DOD) Lloyd J. Austin III ordered a DOD-wide
    stand down to discuss the problem of extremism in the ranks, and in
    April he established a countering extremism working group, directing
    DOD officials to review and update the definition of extremism
    contained in [DOO Instruction
    1325.06](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2567179/austin-orders-immediate-changes-to-combat-extremism-in-military/),
    and calling on the services to update transition instructions to
    prevent those leaving the military from being recruited by extremist
    groups. In March, the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence released the unclassified executive summary of the
    comprehensive assessment acknowledging that enduring domestic
    violent extremism motivations stem from biases against minority
    populations. In April, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
    Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ordered an internal review to root out
    white supremacy and extremism within DHS.

**Using Executive Authority to Protect Voting Rights, Democracy, and
Access to Justice.** These policies and programs include:

-   ***Fighting Laws that Make it Harder to Vote.*** The President has
    appointed some of the nation’s leading civil rights leaders to top
    positions in agencies across his Administration. Importantly, the
    DOJ has doubled its staff devoted to voting rights – an investment
    that is already paying off, as evidenced by the Department issuing
    formal guidance on the federal laws that protect the right to vote
    and bringing enforcement actions against recent threats to voting
    rights, including a
    [lawsuit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-against-state-georgia-stop-racially-discriminatory)
    against Georgia’s new attempt to target the Black electorate. DOJ
    also launched a task force to help combat threats against election
    officials and election workers.
-   ***Signing Executive Order Promoting Access to Voter Registration
    and Voting.*** On the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Biden
    [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/)
    an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/)
    to leverage the resources of the federal government to provide
    access to voter registration. Agencies across the federal government
    have [announced
    steps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/28/fact-sheet-biden-administration-promotes-voter-participation-with-new-agency-steps/)
    they are taking to respond to the President’s call for an
    all-of-government action to enhance the ability of all eligible
    Americans to participate in our democracy.
-   ***Reviewing Agency Practices to Promote Civil Rights Compliance.***
    In September, the DOJ launched a broad 90-day internal review to
    assess how it enforces prohibitions on racial discrimination by law
    enforcement agencies that receive federal funding, building on
    administration efforts to combat systemic racism in policing,
    prisons and courts.
-   ***Issuing a Presidential Memorandum on Access to Justice.***
    President Biden issued a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/18/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-presidential-memorandum-to-expand-access-to-legal-representation-and-the-courts/)
    requiring the Attorney General to submit a plan to expand the
    Justice Department’s access to justice work, and reinvigorating the
    White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable to identify ways to
    prioritize civil legal aid and expand access to federal programs.

**President Biden has reduced barriers for Black communities facing
natural disasters.** In
[September](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/09/02/dhs-announces-changes-individual-assistance-policies-advance-equity-disaster),
FEMA implemented policy changes to reduce barriers that contributed to
disparities experienced by Black Americans through programs that provide
individual assistance to disaster survivors. These included changes to
FEMA policies to make it easier for people living on heirs’ property –
which is estimated to be the majority of Black-owned land in the South –
to apply for disaster aid.  
  
**The President is not done.** The Biden-Harris Administration will
continue promoting equity and racial justice, including for Black
Americans, as we build back better. These policies and programs
include: 

-   ***President Biden’s Proposed Build Back Better Plan Will Promote
    Investment and Economic Opportunity in Black Communities.*** The
    President’s proposed Build Back Better Plan will reverse decades of
    disinvestment and wealth extraction in Black communities, other
    communities of color and rural communities, and drive good jobs and
    opportunity to every corner of the country, making long needed,
    once-in-a-generation investments in underserved communities: It will
    make universal preschool a reality, reduce housing costs and
    increase the supply of affordable housing, lower health care costs,
    improve maternal health, expand coverage to millions of low-income
    Americans by closing the Medicaid coverage gap, and extend the ARP’s
    historic child tax credit expansion, facilitating a 29% reduction in
    Black poverty relative to the projected poverty rate for 2022. The
    Build Back Better Plan also includes a $3 billion investment focused
    on improving maternal health in this country.
-   ***Investing in HBCUs.***  The President’s FY22 budget requests a
    total of $1.06 billion for HBCU-specific funding in Higher Education
    Act (HEA)—an increase of $239 million over last year’s level. The
    budget would triple the mandatory Title III funding at the
    Department of Education— for a total of $252 million. Title III
    mandatory funds provide formula grants to all HBCUs to invest in
    capacity-building initiatives and student success programs. The
    President’s budget request includes funding for research
    opportunities at HBCUs, labs, IT infrastructure, workforce
    development programs in STEM, and DOJ funding for Violence Against
    Women Act programs at HBCUs, among other priorities.
-   ***Transforming Public Education*** ***with Historic Funding
    Increases.*** Black students are less likely to have access to
    high-quality preschool, resulting in disparate outcomes before
    students even enter kindergarten. They are more likely to attend
    rundown and unsafe schools. They are taught by less experienced
    teachers. And they have lower college completion rates and higher
    student loan debt burdens than their white peers. The President has
    outlined a [far-reaching
    agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/23/fact-sheet-how-the-biden-harris-administration-is-advancing-educational-equity/)
    that will transform public education, advancing equity for Black
    students and prepare all students to succeed.
    -   The President’s proposed Build Back Better Plan would provide
        universal, high-quality preschool for all three- and
        four-year-olds; invest in school infrastructure so all students
        learn in safe and healthy school buildings with the technology
        and labs they need to prepare for the jobs of the future; and
        strengthen and diversity the teacher pipeline.
    -   The President’s FY22 budget proposal includes a $20 billion
        increase in Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title
        I funding, which would more than double funds available under
        the flagship program for students in high-poverty schools, while
        providing meaningful incentives for states to address
        inequitable school funding systems and close gaps in access to
        rigorous coursework, like advanced math and science courses.
        Over 80% of Black students attend a Title I-eligible school, and
        there is a $23 billion annual funding gap between majority white
        and majority non-white school districts.
    -   The President’s proposed Build Back Better Plan would also
        provide two years of tuition-free community college. It would
        also provide tuition subsidies for students that attend
        four-year HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs whose families make less than
        $125,000 per year. Through Build Back Better and the FY22
        budget, the President has requested a $1,875 increase to the
        maximum Pell Grant, benefitting the [58% of all Black
        students](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019487.pdf) who receive
        Pell grants.
-   ***Unwavering Support for the Fundamental and Sacred Right to
    Vote.*** President Biden has firmly and repeatedly called for
    Congress to enact the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and
    the Freedom to Vote Act, which would together set national standards
    that make it easier to vote, and deliver new tools to prevent voting
    discrimination. And the President will continue to use every tool at
    his disposal protect the right to vote in free, fair, and secure
    elections.
-   ***Addressing Police Misconduct.*** The President strongly supports
    the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. He is disappointed that
    legislation has not yet reached his desk, and he will not wait to
    advance meaningful police reform through executive action. The White
    House is currently consulting with the families of those killed in
    acts of police violence, civil rights groups, law enforcement, and
    others to determine further steps to advance police reform.
