title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Freedom to Vote\_Act"
---
 
Today, the United States Senate had an opportunity to uphold the
importance of every American’s right to exercise their fundamental right
in a democracy, which is the right to vote. When presented with this
opportunity, Senate Democrats unanimously upheld the importance of that
right. And the Republicans unanimously failed to do so.  
   
The President and I remain undeterred. But there’s still a lot of work
to do. Those of us who have fought for the right of every American to be
able to express their voice through their vote are not going to give up.
We’re going to continue to do the work.
