---
 
President Biden will announce the intent to provide up to $102 million
in new initiatives to expand the U.S.-ASEAN Strategic Partnership during
the October 26 U.S.-ASEAN Summit, reflecting the Biden-Harris
Administration’s deep commitment to ASEAN’s central role in the U.S.
vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.   
  
**U.S.-ASEAN Health Futures:**  The United States is committed to
leading the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.  The United
States intends to provide up to $40 million in new efforts to accelerate
joint research, strengthen health system capacity, and develop the next
generation of human capital in health through the U.S.-ASEAN Health
Futures initiative.  These efforts build on the more than $3.5 billion
the United States has invested in supporting public health in ASEAN over
the past 20 years. The Health futures initiative will both help address
the current pandemic and strengthen ASEAN’s ability to prevent, detect,
and respond to future zoonotic and other infectious disease outbreaks. 
The Initiative’s activities may include the following:       

-   Expand USAID’s ASEAN Public Health Emergency Coordination System
    (APHECS) to support ASEAN member states’ response to COVID-19 and
    other public health emergencies through a regional framework to
    guide coordination and communication in public health emergencies.  
-   Provide grants for emerging infectious disease research in ASEAN
    between U.S. scientists and early-career scientists in Southeast
    Asia, including a focus on promoting gender equity in this field.  
-   Support projects to help control tuberculosis transmission related
    to cross-border and migration issues by developing transnational
    reporting systems and national action plans on tuberculosis.  
-   Partner with regional hospitals through a new CDC cooperative
    agreement to detect and contain emerging infectious disease threats
    before spread occurs.  
-   Promote cooperation to develop, implement, and enforce regulations
    and best practices to reduce risks of disease transmission from
    wildlife and strengthen mechanisms for monitoring, early warning,
    surveillance, prevention, and control of zoonotic diseases.  
     
-   Expand the U.S.-ASEAN Health Futures Alumni Network through capacity
    building with programs including the flagship skills training
    program for young leaders (YSEALI), the Department of Health and
    Human Services Public Health Emergency Management Fellowship, and
    Fulbright U.S.-ASEAN programs.   
-   Provide USAID assistance to strengthen convergence of pharmaceutical
    standards and product quality in ASEAN.  
-   Share information and strengthen networks to detect and combat
    high-threat antibiotic-resistant pathogens and vectors, prevent
    antimicrobial resistance, and enhance technical exchanges on health
    and emerging pandemic threats.   
-   Transform ASEAN states’ health workforces and university public
    health curricula and train the next generation of health
    professionals through multi-disciplinary approaches through the One
    Health Workforce – Next Generation project.  
-   Enhance engagement through an ASEAN-U.S. Health Ministerial. 

**U.S.-ASEAN Climate Futures:**  The United States intends to provide up
to $20.5 million for a new U.S.-ASEAN Climate Futures initiative
dedicated to tackling the climate crisis and keeping the urgent goal of
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach.  The
Initiative’s activities may include the following:

    environment and sustainable development through climate change
    research, coordination, and innovation and improved Nationally
    Determined Contributions implementation.  
-   Partner with ASEAN member state communities through the USAID Clean
    Air Catalyst program to better understand local pollution sources
    and identify solutions that lead to sustained progress on cleaner,
    healthier air.  
-   Enhance climate adaptation through the USAID SERVIR Mekong
    initiative with NASA, which harnesses remote sensing technology and
    open data to help address development challenges related to a
    changing climate.  
     
-   Expand smart power efforts through USAID’s new Southeast Asia Smart
    Power Program to decarbonize and strengthen the region’s power
    system by increasing regional energy trade and accelerating the
    deployment of clean energy technologies.  
     
-   Invest in USAID’s new Sustainable Fish Asia project to strengthen
    ASEAN’s regional role in fisheries, address gender and labor
    concerns, enhance fisheries trade and compliance, and promote tools
    for combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.  
     
-   Launch the Smart Transport Asia program to support best practices
    and state-of-the-art techniques to improve transportation systems
    and fuel economy standards, increase the use of clean transport
    technologies, and reduce energy consumption and emissions.  
     
-   Establish a Smart Cities Business Innovation Fund to help cities in
    ASEAN develop and adopt innovations that support the transformative
    changes needed to address current and future urban challenges.  
-   Elevate engagement through an ASEAN-U.S. Environment and Climate
    Change Ministerial and continued ASEAN-U.S. Energy Ministerials. 
    The first ASEAN-U.S. Energy Ministerial was held in September 2021. 

**U.S.-ASEAN Economic Futures:**  The Biden Administration continues
efforts to promote economic growth and opportunity and build back better
from the economic damage wrought from the COVID-19 pandemic. The United
States plans to provide $10 million in new loans and the intent to
provide up to an additional $10 million in new funding to support
U.S.-ASEAN cooperation on trade and innovation. The Initiative’s
activities may include the following:

    global development of interoperable Single Window systems to

-   Provide funds through the U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation (DFC) to Integra Partners Fund II L.P., a venture
    capital fund focused on making impact investments in Southeast Asia
    in early-stage, impact-oriented technology investments that address
    a significant supply and demand gap in financial services,
    insurance, and healthcare.  
-   Enhance transportation engagement through an ASEAN-U.S.
    Transportation Ministerial. 

**Billion Futures:**  The United States is committed to our combined one
billion people and is announcing plans to provide $16 million in

    Gender Mainstreaming Strategic Framework and ASEAN’s Women, Peace,
