title: Statement of President Joe Biden on Signing the K-12 Cybersecurity Act Into
  Law
---
 
Today, I was pleased to sign the K-12 Cybersecurity Act into law to
enhance the cybersecurity of our Nation’s K-12 educational institutions.
This law highlights the significance of protecting the sensitive
information maintained by schools across the country, and my
Administration looks forward to providing important tools and guidance
to help secure our school’s information systems. I want to thank
Congress for passing it with bipartisan support.  
  
The global pandemic has impacted an entire generation of students and
educators and underscores the importance of safeguarding their sensitive
information, as well as for all Americans. This law is an important step
forward to meeting the continuing threat posed by criminals, malicious
actors, and adversaries in cyberspace. My Administration is marshalling
a whole-of-nation effort to confront cyber threats. Recognizing how much
work remains to be done and that maintaining strong cybersecurity
practices is ongoing work, the advancements we have put in place during
the first months of my Administration will enable us to build back
better, modernize our defenses, and protect our children, families, and
communities.
