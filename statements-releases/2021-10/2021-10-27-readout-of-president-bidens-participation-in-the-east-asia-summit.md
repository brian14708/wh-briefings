President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. today virtually joined leaders of ASEAN
member states and representatives from Australia, the Peopleâ€™s Republic
of China (PRC), India, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and
Russia during the annual East Asia Summit (EAS), where they discussed
regional and international challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic
and the climate crisis.

President Biden reaffirmed the enduring U.S. commitment to the
Indo-Pacific, and he outlined his vision for the region, which seeks a
region that is open, connected, prosperous, resilient, and secure.

President Biden also announced that the United States will explore with
partners the development of an Indo-Pacific economic framework that will
define our shared objectives around trade facilitation, standards for
the digital economy and technology, supply chain resiliency,
decarbonization and clean energy, infrastructure, worker standards, and
other areas of shared interest.

The President also reiterated the U.S. commitment to the international
rules-based order and expressed concern over threats to that order. He
made clear that the United States will continue to stand with allies and
partners in support of democracy, human rights, rule of law, and freedom
of the seas.
