title: Readout of White House Meetings with Leaders of Law Enforcement Groups on Police
  Reform
---
 
This week, senior officials from the White House and the Department of
Justice met with leaders from major law enforcement groups to discuss
police reform. The meetings were part of a broader effort by the
Biden-Harris Administration to consult with members of the civil rights
and law enforcement communities, members of Congress, and victims’
families to define a path forward on meaningful police reform, including
through executive actions.

Officials from the Biden-Harris Administration taking part in the
meetings included Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, Senior Advisor
Cedric Richmond, White House Counsel Dana Remus, Deputy Attorney General
Lisa Monaco, and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. The
administration officials stressed the President’s support for more
federal funding to support local law enforcement and his belief that
this moment demands action to enhance accountability and repair trust
between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

The law enforcement groups presented a number of ideas for potential
reforms they would support and resources that the federal government can
provide, including promoting officer wellness initiatives and improving
recruitment and training.
