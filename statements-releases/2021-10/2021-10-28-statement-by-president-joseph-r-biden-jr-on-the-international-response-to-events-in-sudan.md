  \ to Events in\_Sudan"

Leaders and organizations from around the world, including the African
Union, Arab League, European Union, International Monetary Fund,
Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and World Bank have come together
to condemn the military takeover in Sudan and violence against peaceful
demonstrators.  Today, the UN Security Council added its voice to this
international chorus.  Together, our message to Sudan’s military
authorities is overwhelming and clear: the Sudanese people must be
allowed to protest peacefully and the civilian-led transitional
government must be restored.   
   
I urge Sudan’s military leaders to immediately release all those
detained and restore the institutions associated with the transitional
government, in line with the 2019 Constitutional Declaration and the
2020 Juba Peace Agreement.  Then, with the support of the international
community, I believe all parties in Sudan can reclaim a shared vision
for completing Sudan’s transition to democracy. The United States is
committed to helping the Sudanese people achieve this goal.  We believe
strongly in Sudan’s economic potential and the promise of its future—if
the military and those who oppose change do not hold it back.    
   
I have admired the courage of the Sudanese people in demanding their
voices be heard and helping their country make strides toward a new,
democratic Sudan.  The events of recent days are a grave setback, but
the United States will continue to stand with the people of Sudan and
their non-violent struggle to advance the goals of Sudan’s revolution.
 Freedom, equality, government under rule of law, and respect for human
rights must be the foundation for future security and prosperity in
Sudan, just as they are all around the world.
