Today, Vice President Harris, Secretary Buttigieg and Director Deese met
with the leaders of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, as well as
representatives of labor and the business community, to discuss
solutions to the congestion at the two ports. The two ports discussed
moving to 24/7 operations.

Labor leaders made clear their support for this effort, and business
leaders announced new commitments to move their cargo during the newly
available night time and weekend hours. Participants discussed how the
movement of cargo during less congested times will allow trucks to move
more quickly on highways during less crowded night time hours, and
truckers at the ports can drop off and pick up loads more quickly. These
commitments from some of the nation’s biggest companies during off-peak
hours should increase small businesses’ ability to move their goods
during the peak hours, including those exporting their goods.

The Vice President raised the historic and global nature of the current
challenges facing the transportation and logistics supply chain,
including disruptions due to the delta variant shutting down port
operations in key trading partners such as in Southeast Asia, causing
backups and delays throughout the world’s ports. She called attention to
the Biden-Harris Administration’s focus on unclogging the short-term
disruptions as well as making investments to increase long-term supply
chain resilience.

Participants also discussed the record setting cargo moving through the
nation’s ports this past year, where workers at the ports risked their
lives to make sure essential goods like food and medicine were available
for American families. They noted that the system is almost entirely in
the hands of private businesses, who operate and control the ships, the
docks, the trucks, the warehouses, and the rails that move goods from
ships to stores to houses.

Participants agreed to continue to work together, with the support of
Port Envoy Porcari,

on 24/7 operations at the two ports and across the entire supply chain.
 They discussed additional solutions to alleviate congestion and improve
efficiency. This included a temporary expansion of warehousing and rail
service, improving data tools and data sharing at the ports, and
increasing both recruitment of truck drivers while improving the quality
of trucking jobs. They discussed the importance of the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act and Build Back Better legislation, which would
make a generational investment in our workers, our infrastructure, and
our supply chains and create a more resilient and globally competitive
goods movement system in the U.S.
