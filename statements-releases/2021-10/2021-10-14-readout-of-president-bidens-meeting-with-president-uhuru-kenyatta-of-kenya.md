President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Uhuru Kenyatta
of Kenya to address the strong U.S.-Kenyan partnership.  Together they
discussed their shared commitment to defending democracy and human
rights, advancing regional peace and security, and accelerating economic
prosperity through climate smart solutions and the use of renewable
energy resources. They also discussed greater cooperation on vaccine
manufacturing and production on the African continent in responding to
the Covid-19 pandemic and preparing for future health security threats,
as President Biden announced today’s donation of over 17 million doses
of Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the African Union.  Kenya has received
2.8 million vaccines and is slated to get additional Pfizer doses in the
next few months as part of the pledge President Biden made at the G7
earlier this year to donate 500 million vaccine doses globally. 
Together, President Biden and President Kenyatta underscored the need to
bring additional transparency and accountability to domestic and
international financial systems and to advance peaceful resolutions to
the conflicts in Somalia and Ethiopia.
