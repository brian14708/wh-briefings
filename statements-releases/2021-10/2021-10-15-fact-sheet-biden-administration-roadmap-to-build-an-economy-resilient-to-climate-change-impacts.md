*Agency Actions Will Protect Retirement Plans, Homeowners, Consumers,
Businesses and Supply Chains, Workers, and the Federal Government from
Financial Risks of Climate Change*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration released a [comprehensive,
government-wide
strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Climate-Finance-Report.pdf)
to measure, disclose, manage and mitigate the systemic risks climate
change poses to American families, businesses, and the economy –
building on actions already taken by the Biden-Harris Administration
including just this week: [a redesigned National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) Climate.gov site](https://climate.gov/) to better
connect Americans to climate explainers, data dashboards, and
classroom-ready teaching resources; the [Department of Labor’s new
proposed
rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/14/2021-22263/prudence-and-loyalty-in-selecting-plan-investments-and-exercising-shareholder-rights)
to safeguard life savings and pensions from climate risk; as well as
[the Federal Acquisition Council’s advanced notice of proposed
rulemaking](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2021-22266/federal-acquisition-regulation-minimizing-the-risk-of-climate-change-in-federal-acquisitions)
to consider greenhouse gas emissions when making procurement
decisions.  
  
This year alone, extreme weather has upended the U.S. economy and
affected one in three Americans. Both international and domestic supply
chains have been disrupted by climate change – whether it’s floods in
China and Texas, or wildfires that have burned nearly six million acres
of land, supply chains across critical industries including housing,
construction, semiconductors, and agriculture have been affected,
causing delays and shortages for both consumers and businesses. American
families are paying the costs. Extreme weather has cost Americans an
additional $600 billion in physical and economic damages over the past
five years alone. Climate-related risks hidden in workers’ retirement
plans have already cost American retirees billions in lost pension
dollars. Climate change poses a systemic risk to our economy and our
financial system, and we must take decisive action to mitigate its
impacts.  
  
By addressing the costs of the climate crisis head-on, the federal
government will safeguard the life savings of workers and families, spur
the creation of good-paying, union jobs, and ensure the long-term
sustainability of U.S. economic prosperity. The roadmap makes clear that
protecting the financial health of American households, deploying clean
energy in United States, and building an economy from the bottom-up and
the middle-out go hand-in-hand.     
  
The Administration’s whole-of-government strategy includes six main
pillars to achieve the goals of the President’s May 2021 [Executive
Order on Climate-Related Financial
Risks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-directs-agencies-to-analyze-and-mitigate-the-risk-climate-change-poses-to-homeowners-and-consumers-businesses-and-workers-and-the-financial-system-and-federal-government/),
including several major announcements this week demonstrating concrete
actions to protect American families, the federal government, and the
economy from climate-related financial risk:  
  
**Promoting the resilience of the U.S.financial system to
climate-related financial risks.**

-   A forthcoming report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council
    (FSOC) will kick off the first step in a robust process of U.S.
    financial regulators developing the capacity and analytical tools to
    mitigate climate-related financial risks.
-   The Treasury Department’s Federal Insurance Office has launched a
    process to address climate-related risks in the insurance sector,
    with a focus on assessing the availability and affordability of
    insurance coverage in high-risk areas for traditionally underserved
    communities.
-   Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) staff is developing recommendations to the
    Commission for a mandatory disclosure rule for public issuers that
    is intended to bring greater clarity to investors about the material
    risks and opportunities that climate change poses to their
    investments. This rule is expected to be proposed in the coming
    months.    

**Protecting life savings and pensions from climate-related financial
risk.**

-   This week, the [Department of Labor announced it is proposing a
    rule](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20211013) that
    protects workers’ hard-earned life savings by making clear that
    investment managers can consider climate change and other ESG
    factors in making investment decisions. The proposed rule – which,
    if finalized, would help safeguard the more than half of American
    workers who participate in a retirement plan through their job,
    representing over 140 million Americans and more than $12 trillion
    in retirement savings and pensions – would protect workers by making
    sure that retirement managers don’t turn a blind eye to climate
    risks and other important factors. It would also make clear that
    retirement managers can take important environmental, social, and
    governance factors into account when making investment decisions, so
    that workers can share in the gains that come from sustainable
    investments.
-   The Department of Labor is also working to protect the nearly 6.5
    million participants in the Thrift Savings Plan – the largest
    defined-benefit contribution plan in the world – by analyzing how to
    further factor in climate-related risks.

**Using federal procurement to address climate-related financial risk.**

-   The federal government is the world’s single largest purchaser of
    goods and services, spending over $650 billion in contracts in
    fiscal year 2020 alone. This week, the [Office of Management and
    Budget (OMB) announced that the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR)
    Council will begin the process of exploring amendments to Federal
    procurement
    regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2021-22266/federal-acquisition-regulation-minimizing-the-risk-of-climate-change-in-federal-acquisitions)
    to require agencies to consider a supplier’s greenhouse gas
    emissions when making procurement decisions and to give preference
    to bids from companies with lower greenhouse gas emissions. As part
    of this work, the FAR Council published this week an Advanced Notice
    of Proposed Rulemaking to gather information to help major Federal
    agency procurements minimize the risk of climate change.
-   The FAR Council is also actively exploring an amendment to federal
    procurement regulations that would improve the disclosure of
    greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in federal contracting and set
    science-based GHG targets. By identifying and mitigating climate
    risks through procurement, the Federal government is leading by
    example, deploying public procurement policy as a tool to
    strategically shape markets and promote a more resilient economy.

**Incorporating climate-related financial risk into federal financial
management and budgeting.**

-   OMB, federal agencies, and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory
    Board are taking steps to develop robust climate-related risk
    assessments and disclosure requirements for federal agencies.
-   Next year, the Fiscal Year 2023 President’s Budget will include an
    assessment of the Federal Government’s climate risk exposure and
    impacts on the long-term budget outlook, along with additional
    assessments.
-   In addition, agencies will further incorporate climate-related
    financial risk in both the Budget and agency financial reports to
    increase transparency and promote accountability.

**Incorporating climate-related financial risk intofederal lending and
underwriting.**

-   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the
    Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Agriculture
    (USDA), and the Treasury Department are each working to enhance
    their federal underwriting and lending program standards to better
    address the climate-related financial risks to their loan
    portfolios, while ensuring the safety and security of communities
    most impacted by climate change.
-   HUD is working to meet the challenges that climate change poses to
    American homes, beginning by identifying options to incorporate
    climate-related considerations into the origination of single-family
    mortgages.
-   The VA, which has nearly $913 billion in loan volume outstanding to
    U.S. Veterans, is conducting a review of climate-related impacts to
    its home loan benefit program.
-   USDA is addressing climate risk in its own single-family guaranteed
    loan programs, with the goal of applying lessons learned across its
    entire range of loan programs.  

**Building resilient infrastructure and communities**

-   This week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) began the
    process of updating its National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
    standards to help communities align their construction and land use
    practices with the latest data on flood risk reduction. Through a
    new Request for Information, FEMA will gather stakeholder input to
    make communities more resilient and save lives, homes, and money
    through potential revisions to standards that have not been formally
    updated since 1976.
-   In addition, agencies have come together to build resilience from
    other types of more severe and extreme weather events, such as heat
    waves, droughts, storms, and wildfires.
-   Also this week, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) released a suite of products to make the Federal government’s
    climate information more accessible to Americans. NOAA upgraded its
    website to make it easier for governments, communities, and
    businesses to access the data they need to prepare for and adapt to
    climate risks. And Federal agencies also delivered two reports that
    lay out a comprehensive plan to further increase open-access
    delivery of climate tools and services for the public.
-   More than 20 agencies released climate adaptation and resilience
    plans to safeguard federal investments – and taxpayer dollars – from
    the costs of climate change. The plans reflect President Biden’s
    whole-of-government approach to confronting the climate crisis as
    agencies integrate climate-readiness across their missions and
    programs and strengthen the resilience of federal assets from the
    accelerating impacts of climate change.

 These steps will help safeguard the life savings of workers and
families, spur the creation of good-paying jobs, and ensure the
long-term sustainability of U.S. economic prosperity in the decades to
come. Together, they will help usher in a new era where climate-related
financial risks are thoroughly understood – where they are measured,
disclosed, managed, and mitigated across the economy to the benefit of
American workers, families, and businesses.
