title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on the Unprecedented OECD Agreement\
  \ for a Global Minimum\_Tax"
---
 
Today’s agreement shows how American leadership and diplomacy is
advancing the economic interests of American working families. For
decades, American workers and taxpayers have paid the price for a tax
system that has rewarded multinational corporations for shipping jobs
and profits overseas. This race to the bottom hasn’t just harmed
American workers, it’s put many of our allies at a competitive
disadvantage as well.

Establishing, for the first time in history, a strong global minimum tax
will finally even the playing field for American workers and taxpayers,
along with the rest of the world. Secretary Yellen and the rest of my
administration have rallied more than 130 countries representing more
than 90% of the world’s GDP to bring us one step closer to finally
ending that race to the bottom, to ensure that profitable corporations
pay their fair share, and provide governments with the resources to
invest in their workers and economies.

My Build Back Better agenda, now being considered by Congress, will
build on this agreement. It will eliminate incentives to shift jobs and
profits abroad, and ensure that multinational corporations pay their
fair share here at home. This international agreement is proof that the
rest of the world agrees that corporations can and should do more to
ensure that we build back better.
