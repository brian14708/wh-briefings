title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to the Situation\
  \ in and in Relation to\_Syria"
---
 
On October 14, 2019, by Executive Order 13894, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the situation in and in relation to Syria. 

The situation in and in relation to Syria, and in particular the actions
by the Government of Turkey to conduct a military offensive into
northeast Syria, undermines the campaign to defeat the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, endangers civilians, and further threatens to
undermine the peace, security, and stability in the region, and
continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this reason, the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 of October 14,
2019, must continue in effect beyond October 14, 2021.  Therefore, in
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13894 with respect to the situation in and
in relation to Syria. 

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

 THE WHITE HOUSE,  
October 6, 2021.
