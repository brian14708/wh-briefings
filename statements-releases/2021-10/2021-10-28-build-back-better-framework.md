title: Build Back Better Framework
---
 
The Build Back Better Act will create millions of good-paying jobs,
enable more Americans to join and remain in the labor force, spur
long-term growth, reduce price pressures and set the United States on
course to meet its clean energy ambitions.  
  
***Investments in Children, Families and Caregiving that Grow the
Economy’s Capacity***

    children. This is a long-term program, with funding for six years.  
-   **<u>Affordable High Quality Child Care:</u>** Limit child care
    costs for families to no more than 7% of income, for families
    earning up to 250% of state median income. It enables states to
    expand access to about 20 million children. Parents must be working,
    seeking work, in training or taking care of a serious health issue.
    This is a long-term program, with funding for six years.

    current expanded Child Tax Credit for more than 35 million American
    households, with monthly payments for households earning up to
    $150,000 per year. Make refundability of the Child Tax Credit
    permanent.

***Investments in Clean Energy and Combatting Climate Change***

-   **<u>Clean Energy Tax Credits ($320 billion)</u>**: Ten-year
    expanded tax credits for utility-scale and residential clean energy,
    transmission and storage, clean passenger and commercial vehicles,
    and clean energy manufacturing.  
-   **<u>Resilience Investments ($105 billion)</u>**: Investments and
    incentives to address extreme weather (wildfires, droughts, and

-   **<u>Investments and Incentives for Clean Energy Technology,
    Manufacturing, and Supply Chains ($110 billion)</u>**: Targeted

    solar, batteries, and advanced materials, while boosting the
    competitiveness of existing industries, like steel, cement, and
    aluminum.  
-   **<u>Clean Energy procurement ($20 billion)</u>**: Provide
    incentives for government to be purchaser of next gen technologies,
    including long-duration storage, small modular reactors, and clean
    construction materials.

***Affordable Care for Millions of Hardworking Americans***

-   **<u>Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits:</u>** Extend the
    expanded Affordable Care Act premium tax credits through 2025.
    Experts predict that more than 3 million people who would otherwise
    be uninsured will gain health insurance. Also make Affordable Care
    Act premium tax credits available through 2025 to 4 million
    uninsured people in uncovered states.  
-   **<u>Allow Medicare to cover the cost of hearing.</u>**  Establish a
    hearing benefit in Medicare, a crucial benefit to our seniors for a
    reasonable cost.

***Bringing Down Costs, Reducing Inflationary Pressures, and
Strengthening the Middle Class***

-   **<u>Housing:</u>** $150 billion investment in housing affordability
    and reducing price pressures, including in rural areas. Funds go
    towards building, preserving, and improving more than 1 million
    affordable rental and single-family homes, including public housing,
    plus rental and down payment assistance.  
-   **<u>Education Beyond High School and Workforce Development:</u>**
    Reduce costs and expand access to education beyond high school by
    raising the maximum Pell grant, providing support to Historically
    Black Colleges & Universities (“HBCUs”), Hispanic Serving
    Institutions (HSIs), Minority Serving Institutions (“MSIs”), and
    Tribal Colleges and Universities (“TCUs”), and investing in
    workforce development, including community college workforce
    programs, sector-based training, and apprenticeships.  
-   **<u>Earned Income Tax Credit for 17 Million Low-Wage Workers:</u>**
    Extend for one year the current expanded Earned Income Tax Credit
    for childless workers.

    preparedness, supply chain resilience, and other areas.

**<u>Offsets: Ask Largest Corporations and Highest Income Americans to
Pay Fair Share and Reduce Cost of Prescription Drugs</u>**

The plan is more than fully paid for by asking the wealthiest Americans
and most profitable corporations to pay their fair share. It does not
raise taxes on small business and anyone making less than $400,000 per
year. It will also generate economic growth that will increase tax
revenue and contribute to deficit reduction.

***Stop Profitable Corporations from Paying Zero in Tax and Stop
Rewarding Corporations That Buyback Stock Rather than Invest in the
Company***

-   15% Corporate Minimum Tax on Large Corporations
-   1% Surcharge on Corporate Stock Buybacks

***Stop Rewarding Corporations for Shipping Jobs and Profits Overseas***

-   Global Minimum Tax: Consistent with OECD and with appropriate
    effective date for 15%, Country-by-Country
-   Penalty Rate for Foreign Corporations Based in Non-Compliant
    Countries (i.e. Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax)

***Ask Highest Income Americans to Pay Their Fair Share***

-   New Surtax on Multi-Millionaires and Billionaires
-   Close Medicare Self-Employment Tax Loophole by Strengthening the Net
    Investment Income Tax for Those Making Over $400,000
-   Continue Limitation on Excess Business Losses

***Tax Compliance***

-   Invest in IRS Enforcement.

***Repeal of Trump Administration Rebate Rule, Which Would Have
Increased Seniors’ Drug Premiums***
