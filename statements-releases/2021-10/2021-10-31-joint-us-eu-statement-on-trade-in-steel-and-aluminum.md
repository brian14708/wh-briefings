title: "JOINT US-EU STATEMENT ON TRADE IN STEEL AND\_ALUMINUM"
---
 
WASHINGTON – The United States and the EU have today taken joint steps
to re-establish historical transatlantic trade flows in steel and
aluminium and to strengthen their partnership and address shared
challenges in the steel and aluminium sector.  As a part of that
partnership, they intend to negotiate for the first time, a global
arrangement to address carbon intensity and global overcapacity.

The European Union and the United States have a shared commitment to
joint action and deepened cooperation in these sectors and are taking
joint steps to defend workers, industries and communities from global
overcapacity and climate change, including through a new arrangement to
discourage trade in high-carbon steel and aluminum that contributes to
global excess capacity from other countries and ensure that domestic
policies support lowering the carbon intensity of these industries. 

In a demonstration of renewed trust, and reflecting long-standing
security and supply chain ties, the United States will not apply section
232 duties and will allow duty-free importation steel and aluminium from
the EU at a historical-based volume and the EU will suspend related
tariffs on U.S. products.

As a first step, the United States and the EU will create a technical
working group charged with sharing relevant data and developing a common
methodology for assessing the embedded emissions of traded steel and
aluminum.

The global arrangement reflects a joint commitment to use trade policy
to confront the threats of climate change and global market distortions,
putting their workers and communities at the center of the trade agenda.
The global arrangement will be open to any interested country that
shares our commitment to achieving the goals of restoring
market-orientation and reducing trade in carbon intensive steel and
aluminium products.
