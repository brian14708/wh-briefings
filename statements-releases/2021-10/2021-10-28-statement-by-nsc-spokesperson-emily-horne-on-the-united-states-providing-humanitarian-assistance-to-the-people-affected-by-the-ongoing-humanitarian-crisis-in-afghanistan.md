title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on the United\_States Providing\
  \ Humanitarian Assistance to the People Affected by the Ongoing Humanitarian Crisis\
  \ in\_Afghanistan"
---
 
The United States is providing nearly $144 million in new humanitarian
assistance to the people affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis in
Afghanistan. This brings total U.S. humanitarian aid in Afghanistan and
for Afghan refugees in the region to nearly $474 million in 2021, the
largest amount of assistance from any nation.  
Â   
This assistance will flow through independent humanitarian organizations
who provide support directly to more than 18.4 million vulnerable
Afghans in the region, including Afghan refugees in neighboring
countries. Our partners provide lifesaving protection, shelter,
livelihoods support, essential health care, winterization assistance,
emergency food aid, water, sanitation, and hygiene services in response
to the growing humanitarian needs exacerbated by healthcare shortages,
drought, malnutrition, and the impending winter.
