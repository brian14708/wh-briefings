Today, we learned that annual inflation fell to its lowest level since
March 2021 and monthly inflation was zero. Alongside yesterday’s news
that our economy grew by more than 5% last quarter, this flat inflation
is helping deliver the breathing room families need right now,
especially around the holidays. Our actions have mended supply chains
and helped bring inflation down to its lowest level in two years. But we
still have more work to do: prices are still too high for too many
families. That’s why I’m fighting every single day and calling on
corporations to lower costs for middle-class families, even as
Republicans in Congress focus on lowering taxes for the wealthy and
largest corporations.
