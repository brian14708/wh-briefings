title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Leaders of Veteran-Serving Organizations"
---
 
On Tuesday, the White House Office of Public of Engagement and Domestic
Policy Council hosted leaders of several national veteran-serving
organizations ahead of Veterans Day. During the meeting, the leaders
acknowledged President Biden’s record of supporting our nations
veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors — a core pillar of
his Unity Agenda for the nation — and shared their top policy priorities
for the coming year.     
  
The leaders praised the Administration for ‘leaning into’ the
implementation of the once-in-a- generation expansion of benefits and
services, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise
to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act. Since President Biden signed
the PACT Act into law last year, more than 478,000 veterans and
survivors are already receiving benefits — ensuring that veterans
exposed to burn pits and other harmful substances and their loved ones
get access to the care and support they need.  
  
The veteran serving organization leaders shared their perspectives and
priorities regarding the military to civilian transition, advancing
equity, improving access to mental health care, reducing veteran suicide
and homelessness, safeguarding veteran benefits, and ensuring access to
world class care for veterans with severe disabilities.

Administration Participants Included:

-   Stephen Benjamin, Assistant to the President, Senior Advisor to the
    President and Director of the Office of Public Engagement
-   Terri Tanielian, Special Assistant to the President for Veteran
    Affairs
