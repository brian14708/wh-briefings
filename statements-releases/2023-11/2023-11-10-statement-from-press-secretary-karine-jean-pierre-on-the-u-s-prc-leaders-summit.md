President Biden will meet with President Xi Jinping of the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) on November 15. The Leaders will discuss issues
in the U.S.-PRC bilateral relationship, the continued importance of
maintaining open lines of communication, and a range of regional and
global issues. Building on their last meeting in November 2022 in Bali,
Indonesia, the Leaders will also discuss how the United States and the
PRC can continue to responsibly manage competition and work together
where our interests align, particularly on transnational challenges that
affect the international community.
