title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Passing of Henry\_Kissinger"
---
 
I’ll never forget the first time I met Dr. Kissinger. I was a young
Senator, and he was Secretary of State—giving a briefing on the state of
the world. Throughout our careers, we often disagreed. And often
strongly. But from that first briefing  — his fierce intellect and
profound strategic focus was evident. Long after retiring from
government, he continued to offer his views and ideas to the most
important policy discussion across multiple generations. Jill and I send
our condolences to his wife Nancy, his children Elizabeth and David, his
grandchildren, and all those who loved him.
