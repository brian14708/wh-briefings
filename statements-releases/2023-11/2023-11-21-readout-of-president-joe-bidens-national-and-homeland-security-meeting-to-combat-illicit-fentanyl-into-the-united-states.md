title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden\u2019s National and Homeland Security Meeting\
  \ to Combat Illicit Fentanyl into the United\_States"
---
 
Today, President Biden met with his national and homeland security
leadership to ensure that his administration drives progress to address
the deadly scourge of illicit fentanyl and to discuss efforts underway
to tackle the global crisis posed by synthetic drugs.  The President and
his team discussed how to build upon last week’s significant commitments
from China and Mexico to crack down on the precursors, production, and
trafficking of illicit fentanyl.   
  
President Biden was briefed by Secretary Blinken, Secretary Mayorkas,
Attorney General Garland, and DEA Administrator Milgram.  The President
underscored how critical it is to our understanding of foreign drug
trafficking organizations—and ability to fight illicit fentanyl — that
Congress reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act before it expires at the end of next month, and he
reiterated his commitment to do everything he can to counter the illicit
fentanyl crisis in the United States, which is the number one cause of
death for people aged 18-44.  
  
President Biden has made beating the overdose epidemic a key priority in
his Unity Agenda for the Nation, including a focus on cracking down on
global illicit drug trafficking and disrupting the flow of illicit
fentanyl and its precursors. To advance President Biden’s Unity Agenda,
the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic action to address the
overdose epidemic and save lives. President Biden is also calling on
Congress for immediate action to help provide [$1.55 billion to
strengthen addiction treatment, overdose prevention measures, and
recovery support services across the

and more than [$1.2 billion to crack down on drug

keep dangerous drugs like illicit fentanyl out of our communities.
