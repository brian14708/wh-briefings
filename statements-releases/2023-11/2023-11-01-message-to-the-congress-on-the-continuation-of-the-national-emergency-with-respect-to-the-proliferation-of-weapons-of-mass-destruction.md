title: "Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency With\
  \ Respect to the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass\_Destruction"

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction declared in Executive Order 12938 of
November 14, 1994, is to continue in effect beyond November 14, 2023.

                               
  
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

  
  
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
November 1, 2023.
