Today, Chief of Staff Jeff Zients hosted a meeting of President Biden’s
Investing in America Cabinet. During the meeting, members of the Cabinet
and senior administration officials discussed how Bidenomics is driving
record investment and opportunity in communities across the country,
marked the two year anniversary of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
and discussed key progress on implementing the President’s historic
Investing in America agenda.  
   
During the meeting, officials reviewed how President Biden’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law is repaving roads, rebuilding bridges, and bringing
clean water to families through over 40,000 projects across 4,500
communities in all 50 states, and how his Investing in America Agenda
has unleashed over $600 billion in private sector manufacturing and
clean energy investments since the beginning of the Administration.
Officials also discussed key progress in the implementation of the
various projects and initiatives under the President’s agenda –
including today’s release of a proposal to strengthen the Lead and
Copper rule – an integral step towards accomplishing President Biden’s
goal of replacing all lead service lines.
