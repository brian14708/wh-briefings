title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Highlights Nearly $200 Billion\
  \ of Private Sector Investments from the Asia-Pacific into the United\_States Since\
  \ Taking\_Office"
---
 
Bidenomics and President Biden’s Investing in America agenda – including
historic legislation signed into law, such as the Inflation Reduction
Act, CHIPS and Science Act, and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, have
catalyzed companies from around the world—and especially the
Asia-Pacific— to make significant investments in American communities.
These investments, driven by a range of companies across APEC and
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) economies, not only facilitate
domestic economic growth, but help to tackle the climate crisis, build a
secure and resilient U.S. economy, and create good paying American jobs
that deliver on President Biden’s vision to grow the economy from the
middle out and the bottom up.

Today, as a part of APEC Economic Leaders’ Week and the APEC CEO Summit,
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Director of the White House
National Economic Council Lael Brainard, Chair of the U.S. Export–Import
Bank (EXIM) Reta Jo Lewis, and Deputy Assistant to the President &
Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific Kurt Campbell co-hosted an “Investing
in America” and SelectUSA event that highlighted examples of significant
job-creating investments in the United States by companies based in the
Asia-Pacific.

**BY THE NUMBERS**

-   **<u>Historic Investments:</u>** Foreign direct investment in U.S.
    manufacturing has almost **doubled** annually compared to
    pre-pandemic levels. Companies based in the Asia-Pacific have
    announced almost **$200 billion** of investments into the United
    States since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, which
    will support **tens of thousands of good new jobs** for American
    workers.  
-   **<u>Industries of the Future:</u>** Companies based in Asia-Pacific
    economies have contributed to roughly **one third of all major
    announced clean energy and semiconductors investments** in the
    United States. This is directly tied to investments President Biden
    and partners in Congress have made through the Inflation Reduction
    Act and the CHIPS and Science Act.  
-   **<u>Rising Exports:</u>** U.S. exports to Asia-Pacific economies
    have increased **25 percent** compared to pre-pandemic levels,
    helping U.S. businesses expand and hire more workers.

**RECENT & NEW INVESTMENTS**  
  
The “Investing in America” event highlighted recent and new investments,
including in the clean energy and semiconductor sectors, that
demonstrate how U.S. economic ties with the Asia-Pacific and President
Biden’s policies are helping to grow the American economy. They also
show that the U.S. economy is attracting investment from not only large,
global companies, but also smaller and medium-sized companies.

-   **CEO Joo Sun Choi of Samsung Display,** a South Korea-based
    technology company, highlighted Samsung’s investments of over **$17
    billion** to build a new semiconductor site in Texas and **$12
    billion** with partners to build electric vehicle (EV) battery
    plants in the U.S., creating **thousands of jobs**. He also
    highlighted Samsung’s recent acquisition of a New York-based company
    that specializes in advanced micro display technology, which is used
    in consumer and defense applications.  
-   ****Executive Chairman**** **Andrew Forrest of Fortescue,** a global
    green metals, energy and technology company, announced today new
    investments to drive innovation and create jobs across the U.S.
    clean energy ecosystem, including a new facility in Michigan to
    design and manufacture batteries for electric transport and heavy
    industry applications, and electrolysers for green hydrogen
    production, which is expected to create up to 600 jobs; a new New
    York-based green energy investment accelerator platform, Fortescue
    Capital, which intends to raise funds for projects focused on
    scaling green energy technologies; and details on a green hydrogen
    production facility in Washington that could help replace tens of
    millions of gallons of diesel per year with green energy, to power
    American industry and transportation.  
-   **CEO Thuy Le of VinFast,** a Vietnam-based automotive company,
    highlighted **$4 billion** in recent investments to build a factory
    in Chatham County, North Carolina to make all-electric SUVs creating
    **more than 7,000 jobs**. Today VinFast shared details about its
    plans to build a manufacturing complex in North Carolina that will
    produce both electric vehicles and batteries. In partnership with
    the local community colleges, the facility will train and develop
    U.S. workers for high-paying jobs in the clean transportation
    industry.  
-   **CEO Amanda Lacaze of Lynas Rare Earths,** an Australia-based
    supplier of sustainable rare earth materials, highlighted its
    partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense to invest **$258
    million** to build in Texas the only major Heavy Rare Earths
    separation plant outside of China, creating **100 well-paying
    skilled jobs**. The facility will help to establish a globally
    resilient, safe and environmentally responsible rare earths supply
    chain and provide inputs that the U.S. technology and national
    security sectors need.  
-   **Chief Business Officer Astrea Ocampo of Neolpharma,** a
    Mexico-based pharmaceutical company, highlighted its investment of
    **$16 million** to expand its pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in
    Puerto Rico, creating specialized local jobs and helping to develop
    a pipeline of skilled workers for the future.

Additionally, today the **U.S. Export–Import Bank (EXIM) announced a new
$169M export promotion loan to BETA Technologies**, a Burlington,
Vermont-based company, which will enable it to expand its U.S.-based
production of electric-powered aircraft and create an estimated **400
high-paying clean energy economy jobs**. The loan was approved in part
because of the company’s high growth trajectory, enabled by current and
potential customers in APEC and IPEF economies such as New Zealand,
India, Japan, and Canada. BETA Technologies demonstrates the importance
of the Asia-Pacific as an export market to growing American businesses,
while creating good jobs for American workers.
