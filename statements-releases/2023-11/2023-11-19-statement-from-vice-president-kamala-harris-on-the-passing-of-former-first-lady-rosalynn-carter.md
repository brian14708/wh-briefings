title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Former First\
  \ Lady Rosalynn\_Carter"
---
 
First Lady Rosalynn Carter lived a life of service, faith, compassion,
and unmatched moral leadership.

During her time in the White House, Rosalynn Carter redefined the role
of First Lady. Through her courageous advocacy, Mrs. Carter helped bring
the issue of mental health out from the shadows into the national
spotlight and served as a champion for America’s caregivers. On her
trips abroad, Mrs. Carter worked to advance human rights and human
dignity.

After leaving the White House, Mrs. Carter continued to serve our nation
and the world—in particular, through her leadership of the Carter
Center, which she founded with President Jimmy Carter to promote peace,
improve public health, and support freedom and democracy around the
globe. 

As a humanitarian, a public servant, and a global leader, Mrs. Carter
improved the lives of millions—and inspired countless more to dedicate
their lives to service. Her legacy will be a beacon for generations to
come.

Doug and I send our prayers to President Carter and the entire Carter
family.
