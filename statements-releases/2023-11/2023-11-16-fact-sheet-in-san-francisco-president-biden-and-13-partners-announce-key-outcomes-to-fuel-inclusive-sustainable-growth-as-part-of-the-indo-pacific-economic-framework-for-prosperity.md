title: "FACT SHEET: In San Francisco, President\_Biden and 13 Partners Announce Key\
  \ Outcomes to Fuel Inclusive, Sustainable Growth as Part of the Indo-Pacific Economic\
  \ Framework for\_Prosperity"
---
 
Today, President Biden announced key outcomes of the Indo-Pacific
Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) that will create a stronger,
fairer, more resilient economy for families, workers, and businesses in
the United States and in the Indo-Pacific region. The United States is
an Indo-Pacific economic power, and expanding U.S. economic leadership
in the region is good for American workers and businesses and for the
people of the region.   
  
IPEF partners Australia, Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic
of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
and Viet Nam represent 40 percent of the world’s GDP and are committed
to advancing workers’ rights, facilitating high-standard trade and
investment, and tackling pressing issues facing our countries, in
particular: vulnerable supply chains; clean energy transitions; and
corruption.  In record time, the United States and our IPEF partners
have negotiated first-of-their-kind agreements to help achieve these
goals:

-   The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement will help partners promote
    diversification and resiliency in their supply chains, better
    identify supply chain vulnerabilities, establish an emergency
    communications channel to respond to disruptions arising from crises
    such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and promote high labor standards that
    respect workers across regional supply chains.
-   The Clean Economy Agreement will help catalyze the economic
    opportunities arising from IPEF partners’ transitions to cleaner
    economies and, through cooperative work programs and the
    mobilization of public and private financing, will drive inclusive
    investment in the region and greater collaboration with the private
    sector.    
-   The Fair Economy Agreement will enhance IPEF partners’ efforts to
    prevent and combat corruption, including bribery, and support
    efforts to improve tax transparency and tax administration, which
    will strengthen the investment climate in the region and ensure the
    benefits of economic growth are broadly shared.

Each of the agreements includes novel provisions to protect labor
rights, empower workers, and promote a race to the top as we seek to
enhance our economic competitiveness.  These provisions include an
innovative tri-partite Labor Rights Advisory Board to promote labor
rights in supply chains and a reporting mechanism to identify
facility-specific labor rights inconsistency issues in the IPEF Supply
Chain Agreement; commitments to advance a just transition for workers in
the IPEF Clean Economy Agreement; and strong labor commitments to combat
corruption in labor law enforcement and to help prevent the exploitation
of migrant workers, a particularly vulnerable group, in the IPEF Fair
Economy Agreement.  
  
In addition to concluding these groundbreaking agreements, IPEF partners
have made progress on and are committed to continuing negotiations to
facilitate trade, advance workers’ rights through strong and enforceable
labor standards, strengthen environmental protections, align our
regulatory procedures, promote a fair and inclusive digital economy,
deepen our technical assistance and economic cooperation, and advance
inclusivity in our trade policy.   
  
The IPEF partners also agreed to establish the Agreement on the
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, which will establish a
ministerial-level IPEF Council in support of the durability of IPEF and
the IPEF agreements.  
  
The United States and our IPEF partners announced additional initiatives
that will establish IPEF as a dynamic forum committed to tackling
emerging, important issues in the future.

-   The United States announced the novel IPEF Investment Accelerator –
    which is based off of the U.S. Partnership for Global Infrastructure
    and Investment (PGI) and includes a new IPEF Project Preparation
    Facility run by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency – will
    strengthen the investment climate and promote high-standard
    investment outcomes that benefit workers and protect the environment
    in our IPEF partner economies. 
-   The IPEF Critical Minerals Dialogue will support U.S. expansion and
    development of our full critical mineral supply chain – from mining
    to processing – through efforts to strengthen the competitiveness
    and diversification of IPEF critical mineral supply chains.
-   The IPEF Networks initiative will expand people-to-people ties,
    promote small business-to-small business matchmaking, facilitate
    connections among entrepreneurs, expand connectivity among civil
    society groups, and facilitate scientific, academic, and other
    research collaboration to help ensure the benefits of IPEF reach all
    segments of society and to increase diverse stakeholder
    participation in the advancement of IPEF’s initiatives going
    forward.

Announced by President Biden while in Tokyo in May of 2022,
the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity
establishes high-standard commitments to create a stronger, fairer, more
resilient economy for families, workers, and businesses in the United
States and in the Indo-Pacific region. IPEF enables the United States
and our partners to decide on rules of the road to deepen our economic
engagement in the region and benefit American workers and businesses —
as well as the people of the region.
