title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Extension of Humanitarian Pause in\_\
  Gaza"
---
 
I have remained deeply engaged over the last few days to ensure that
this deal—brokered and sustained through extensive U.S. mediation and
diplomacy—can continue to deliver results. Thus far, more than 50
hostages have now been released and returned to their families.  Those
released include young children, mothers, and grandmothers.  One of them
was a little American girl, Abigail, who turned four years old while in
captivity after her parents were killed in front of her and she was
taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on October 7th.  I spoke with
Abigail’s family following her release, and we are working closely with
our Israeli partners to ensure she gets the care and support she needs
as she begins to recover from this unspeakable trauma.   
   
The humanitarian pause has also enabled a significant surge in
additional humanitarian assistance to the innocent civilians who are
suffering across the Gaza strip.  The United States has led the
humanitarian response into Gaza—building on years of work as the largest
funder of humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people. We are
taking full advantage of the pause in fighting to increase the amount of
humanitarian aid moving into Gaza, and we will continue our efforts to
build a future of peace and dignity for the Palestinian people.   
   
Today, I want to again thank Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, Amir
Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar, and President Abdel Fattah
Al-Sisi of Egypt for their commitment to this process and in reaching
the agreement for an extension over the next 48 hours.  We will not stop
until all of the hostages held by Hamas terrorists are released.
