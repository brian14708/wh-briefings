title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Extreme Republican Shutdown\_\
  Proposal"
---
 
This proposal is just a recipe for more Republican chaos and more
shutdowns—full stop. With just days left before an Extreme Republican
Shutdown—and after shutting down Congress for three weeks after they
ousted their own leader—House Republicans are wasting precious time with
an unserious proposal that has been panned by members of both parties.
An Extreme Republican Shutdown would put critical national security and
domestic priorities at risk, including by forcing service members to
work without pay. This comes just days after House Republicans were
forced to pull two of their own extreme appropriations bills from the
floor—further deepening their dysfunction. House Republicans need to
stop wasting time on their own political divisions, do their jobs, and
work in a bipartisan way to prevent a shutdown.
