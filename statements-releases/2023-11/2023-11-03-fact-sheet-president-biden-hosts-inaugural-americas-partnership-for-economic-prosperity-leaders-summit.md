title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Hosts Inaugural Americas Partnership for Economic\
  \ Prosperity Leaders\u2019\_Summit"
---
 
Today, President Biden hosted the inaugural Americas Partnership for
Economic Prosperity Leaders’ Summit to establish an enduring forum for
bolstering regional competitiveness and mobilizing high-standard
investment in our hemisphere.  
  
President Biden and Leaders of the eleven other inaugural Americas
Partnership countries – Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay –
announced their plan to drive inclusive growth and to strengthen
critical supply chains, with an initial focus on clean energy,
semiconductors, and medical supplies.  
  
The Americas Partnership will undertake these efforts in the following
concrete ways that deliver tangible benefits for our people:

-   Leaders directed their Ministers to stand up three distinct tracks –
    foreign affairs, finance, and trade – to collectively develop and
    implement a focused set of initiatives and actions;
-   Leaders committed to establishing a mechanism for robust
    consultations with a wide spectrum of stakeholders to help shape and
    inform the work of the Americas Partnership;
-   Ministers will meet yearly to ensure progress along each of the
    three tracks, with leaders reconvening every two years to update our
    collective priorities;
-   Leaders decided that in the intervening time, the Americas
    Partnership countries will develop a process to invite additional
    countries in our hemisphere to join and contribute to this
    initiative, while maintaining our high standards and shared values;
    and
-   Costa Rica offered to host the next Americas Partnership Leaders’
    Summit in 2025.

President Biden also announced a number of initiatives in support of the
Americas Partnership:

1.  **Launching a new investment platform to channel billions of dollars
    in financing for sustainable infrastructure:** The U.S.
    International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the
    Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Invest will establish an
    innovative joint investment platform that aims to channel billions
    of dollars in financing for sustainable infrastructure and critical
    economic sectors in the Americas. The investments of the Americas
    Partnership Platform will help build the modern ports, clean energy
    grids, and digital infrastructure necessary for a competitive and
    resilient economy. By adhering to high quality, labor, and
    environmental standards, these investments will ensure the benefits
    of these projects are broadly shared.  
2.  **Standing up a new accelerator program to** **support** **and**
    **steer investment to** **hundreds of up-and-coming entrepreneurs:**
    The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will
    establish a multi-year accelerator program that brings together
    cohorts of up-and-coming entrepreneurs from the Americas. The
    Americas Partnership Accelerator will help to support these
    entrepreneurs, providing them with training and connecting them with
    networks of potential private sector investors. The Accelerator aims
    to directly benefit hundreds of entrepreneurs, mobilize millions of
    dollars in additional capital, and showcase the untapped
    entrepreneurial talent across the region. Today, USAID is committing
    an initial investment of $5 million to launch this multi-year
    initiative, with Canada committing an additional CAD 3 million.
    Additionally, Uruguay has agreed to provide support to the
    Accelerator and to stand up an Americas Partnership angel investor
    network to mobilize global sources of venture capital for these
    entrepreneurs.  
3.  **Providing grants to expand infrastructure and social services for
    migrants and their host communities:** The United States, Canada,
    the Republic of Korea, and Spain are working with the IDB to make
    available a combined $89 million for IDB’s Grant Facility to support
    countries in the region most impacted by migration. These funds will
    help to stabilize refugee and migrant-hosting communities by funding
    infrastructure and social services, such as education, citizen
    security, and economic opportunities, as part of our shared
    commitments under the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and
    Protection and the Americas Partnership. Working with Congress,
    USAID intends to contribute $25 million to the Facility. Canada is
    contributing $10 million, in addition to its previous contribution
    in 2022 resulting in a total Canadian contribution of $16 million to
    the Grant Facility. The Republic of Korea will contribute $2
    million, adding to their previous contribution of $10 million
    in 2019. Spain will contribute $2 million, resulting in a total
    Spanish contribution of $7 million to the Grant Facility since 2019.
    These contributions, joined by $50 million from the IDB, demonstrate
    our shared commitment to better policies for improved living
    conditions of migrants in the Western Hemisphere.  
4.  **Helping develop a robust regional workforce in the digital
    technology sectors of the future:** The United States Department of
    State will begin an initiative to help develop a robust regional
    semiconductor workforce by organizing a series of Americas
    Partnership Semiconductor Workforce Symposiums. These symposiums
    will offer a forum for stakeholders, including governments,
    industry, organized labor, and academia, to identify the region’s
    workforce development needs and develop educational programming to
    meet those needs. Kicking off with the first symposium in Costa Rica
    in February 2024, this programming will directly support the new
    regional Center of Excellence that the Government of Costa Rica
    announced today. The Center of Excellence will educate individuals
    across the Americas to work in the digital technology sectors of the
    future – including on semiconductors, cybersecurity, 5G, and
    artificial intelligence – and work with industry and academia to
    create a pipeline of talent and employment opportunities in these
    sectors.  
5.  **Creating a new fund to catalyze investment in innovative climate
    financing solutions:** The United States Department of State
    announced plans to establish a new fund at the IDB to facilitate
    investments in innovative and scalable nature-based solutions, such
    as debt-for-nature swaps and blue/green bonds to help preserve our
    hemisphere’s rich biodiversity, reduce carbon emissions, and create
    good jobs. Investor demand and interest in nature-based solutions
    has grown steadily in recent years, as demonstrated by the recent
    IDB and DFC-facilitated [Galápagos Marine
    Bond](https://www.dfc.gov/media/press-releases/financial-close-reached-largest-debt-conversion-marine-conservation-protect).
    However, many projects fall through because of a shortage of
    early-stage funding to help design and pilot these complex
    solutions. To address this bottleneck, the Americas Partnership Fund
    for Nature will provide capital to support project design, capacity
    building, and financial analytics that will unlock private sector
    funding for these climate financing solutions. The Department of
    State, working with Congress, plans to provide $10 million to launch
    the fund and the Government of Canada has agreed to coordinate
    financing with its recently-established Nature Based Solutions
    Program at the IDB.

The Americas Partnership countries collectively host the majority of
migrants and refugees in the region, and the United States and our
partners believe that investing in these communities can be a catalyst
for innovation and growth, while also stabilizing migration flows. To
that end, the United States is providing nearly $485 million through the
Department of State and USAID to assist migrants and refugees, hosting
communities, and vulnerable populations in the Western Hemisphere.      
  
Governments alone cannot achieve the goals we have set forward, which is
why the Americas Partnership is collaborating with the IDB, a key
regional source of multilateral development financing, to help bring
those voices to the table. The IDB has already started this work,
including by hosting an Americas Partnership Responsible Investment
Forum on November 2, which brought together hundreds of regional leaders
from business, finance, civil society, international financial
institutions, and government to start building more competitive and
resilient value chains in the Americas. President Biden is also
delivering on a commitment he made at the Summit of the Americas in June
2022 to strengthen the IDB by jointly developing new financing tools and
positioning IDB Invest to strategically deploy new funds, after its
planned capital increase.
