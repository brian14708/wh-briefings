title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Continues Progress on Fight\
  \ Against Global Illicit Drug\_Trafficking"
---
 
President Biden has made beating the overdose epidemic a key priority in
his Unity Agenda for the Nation, including a focus on cracking down on
global illicit drug trafficking and disrupting the flow of illicit
fentanyl and its precursors.

During their November 15 meeting, President Biden and President Xi
Jinping of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) announced the resumption
of bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics, with a focus on reducing
the flow of precursor chemicals fueling illicit fentanyl and synthetic
drug trafficking. For years, bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics
has been suspended.  The PRC is now taking law enforcement action
against illicit precursor suppliers, has issued a notice to industry
warning Chinese companies against illicit trade in precursor chemicals
and pill presses equipment, and has committed to restart key law
enforcement cooperation.

Today’s progress is one of many actions that President Biden has taken
to counter the global threat posed by the trafficking of illicit drugs
into the United States that is causing the deaths of a hundred thousand
Americans annually, as well as countless more non-fatal overdoses.

The Biden-Harris Administration has initiated new measures to disrupt
the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its precursors into American
communities and dismantle the firearms trafficking networks that enable
drug traffickers to grow their enterprises. The U.S. government,
alongside our partners, will continue our efforts to prevent the
production and trafficking of illicit synthetic drugs through multiple
efforts, including the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug
Threats, which has brought together over 100 countries to collectively
address the scourge of fentanyl.

The Biden-Harris Administration also has taken historic action to expand
access to life-saving public health services and remove decades-long
barriers to treatment for substance use disorder. To help advance these
Administration efforts, President Biden has requested $26 billion for
prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services in
his FY24 budget request. In addition, President Biden is requesting
$1.55 billion in his supplemental budget request to strengthen these
support services across the country.

**The Biden-Harris Administration’s diplomacy with PRC has resulted in
concrete action:**

-   The PRC is issuing a notice to its domestic industry advising on the
    enforcement of laws and regulations related to trade in precursor
    chemicals and pill presses equipment.  A similar notice to industry
    in 2019 led to a drastic reduction in seizures of fentanyl shipments
    to the United States from China.  
-   The PRC has begun taking law enforcement action against Chinese
    synthetic drug and chemical precursor suppliers. As a result,
    certain PRC-based pharmaceutical companies have ceased operations
    and have had some international payment accounts blocked.  
-   At the beginning of this month, and for the first time in nearly
    three years, the PRC re-started submitting incidents to the
    International Narcotics Control Board’s global IONICS database,
    which is used to share real-time information internationally about
    things like suspicious shipments and suspected trafficking. This
    information will help global law enforcement agencies identify
    trends and conduct intelligence-driven investigations that disrupt
    illicit synthetic drug supply chains.

Together, the United States and China are now announcing the launch of a
counter-narcotics working group to create a platform for policy and
technical experts to discuss law enforcement efforts and exchange
information on counter-narcotics efforts going forward.  
These announcements build on the Administration’s comprehensive,
whole-of-government approach to tackling global illicit drug
trafficking. The Administration’s decisive actions to crack down on drug
trafficking include:

-   **Announcing a strategic approach to commercially disrupting the
    global illicit fentanyl supply chain.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration [announced a strengthened whole-of-government
    approach](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strengthened-approach-to-crack-down-on-illicit-fentanyl-supply-chains/) to
    save lives by disrupting the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its
    precursors into American communities. This approach builds on the
    President’s [*National Drug Control
    Strategy*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/21/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-2022-national-drug-control-strategy-that-outlines-comprehensive-path-forward-to-address-addiction-and-the-overdose-epidemic/#:~:text=The%20Strategy%20focuses%20on%20two,to%20guide%20all%20these%20efforts.) and
    helps deliver on his State of the Union call to beat the opioid and
    overdose epidemic by cracking down on the production, sale, and
    trafficking of illicit fentanyl to help save lives, protect the
    public health, and improve the public safety of our communities.
-   **Increasing security at the border.** Under President Biden’s
    leadership, this Administration has invested significant amounts of
    funding for law enforcement efforts to address illicit fentanyl
    trafficking and enabled historic seizures of illicit fentanyl on the
    border. Further, President Biden’s national security supplemental
    funding request includes more than $1.2 billion to stop the flow of
    illicit fentanyl into American communities; portions of this funding
    will support [an additional 1,300 border patrol
    agents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2023/10/20/white-house-calls-on-congress-for-immediate-action-to-continue-the-administrations-work-to-disrupt-fentanyl-trafficking/) to
    work alongside the 20,200 border patrol agents already funded in the
    FY24 budget.   
-   **Deploying detection technology.** President Biden’s FY24
    budget [called for $535 million in U.S. Customs and Border
    Protection for border
    technology](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/03/09/fact-sheet-president-bidens-budget-strengthens-border-security-enhances-legal-pathways-and-provides-resources-to-enforce-our-immigration-laws/),
    including $305 million for Non-Intrusive Inspection Systems, with a
    primary focus on fentanyl detection at ports of entry. Further,
    President Biden’s national security supplemental funding request
    includes more than $1.2 billion to stop the flow of illicit fentanyl
    into American communities; portions of this funding will [ensure
    deployment of more than 100 cutting-edge detection
    machines](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2023/10/20/white-house-calls-on-congress-for-immediate-action-to-continue-the-administrations-work-to-disrupt-fentanyl-trafficking/) that
    will help detect fentanyl at ports of entry at the southwest border.
-   **Expanding our High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA)
    Program.** The HIDTA program devotes more than $302 million to
    supporting federal, state, local, and Tribal law enforcement working
    to stop traffickers across all 50 states. Earlier this year, [the
    White House announced the designation of nine new counties to the
    HIDTA
    Program](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2023/07/06/the-white-house-announces-nine-newly-designated-counties-across-america-are-joining-the-high-intensity-drug-trafficking-areas-program/).
    The addition of these nine counties to the HIDTA program will allow
    additional resources to be deployed to areas hardest hit by drug
    trafficking and overdoses.
-   **Targeting the global illicit supply chain.** President Biden
    issued the [*Executive Order on Imposing Sanctions on Foreign
    Persons Involved in the Global Illicit Drug
    Trade*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/15/executive-order-on-imposing-sanctions-on-foreign-persons-involved-in-the-global-illicit-drug-trade/) to
    target the enablers of the global illicit synthetic drug supply
    chain including raw material brokers, financiers, and others. This
    allows the U.S. government to target not just drug kingpins but also
    those who operate their businesses.
-   **Launching the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug
    Threats.** The [Biden-Harris Administration launched the Global
    Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug
    Threats](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2023/07/07/dr-rahul-gupta-releases-statement-on-the-launch-of-the-global-coalition-to-address-synthetic-drug-threats/) that
    will help accelerate efforts against illicit synthetic drugs and
    employ coordinated approaches to prevent illicit drug manufacturing,
    detect emerging drug threats, disrupt trafficking, address illicit
    finance, and respond to public safety and public health impacts. The
    Administration brought together more than 100 countries and 11
    international organizations to take action knowing that countering
    illicit synthetic drugs must be a global policy priority.

<!-- -->

-   **Regulating “precursor” chemicals used to produce illicit
    fentanyl.** At the request of the United States, the UN Commission
    on Narcotic Drugs
    (CND) [voted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2022/03/16/at-urging-of-u-s-un-commission-acts-against-precursor-chemicals-used-to-produce-illicit-fentanyl/) to
    control three chemicals used by drug traffickers to produce illicit
    fentanyl.  In addition, the United States placed 28 chemicals and
    certain equipment used in the production of fentanyl,
    methamphetamine, PCP, LSD, and other controlled substances and
    listed chemicals on the Controlled Substances Act’s Special
    Surveillance List.  These additions include precursor chemicals used
    to make fentanyl as well as pill press punches and dies, which are
    used to press fentanyl into fake pills.  
-   **Bringing law enforcement actions against every aspect of the
    global illicit fentanyl supply chain.**  The United States has
    executed a network-focused strategy to attack every aspect of the
    global illicit fentanyl supply chain and dismantle the criminal
    organizations that operate it.  In just the last year, the U.S.
    government brought: criminal indictments against chemical companies
    for supplying precursor chemicals to be made into fentanyl; criminal
    charges against leaders, enforcers, and associates of the largest
    and most powerful drug cartel in the world and the one responsible
    for the vast majority of fentanyl entering the United
    States; criminal charges against more than 3,300 associates of the
    drug cartels responsible for the last mile of distribution of
    fentanyl on our streets and on social media.  As part of these
    criminal cases, law enforcement seized fentanyl precursor chemicals,
    fentanyl analogues, fentanyl additives, and finished fentanyl
    amounting to more than 263 million deadly doses of fentanyl.  
-   **Working with Mexico and Canada to counter illicit fentanyl, the
    Biden-Harris Administration established the Trilateral Fentanyl
    Committee in 2022.** This high level committee is strengthening
    regulatory frameworks associated with the manufacture, shipping, and
    sale of precursor chemicals and related equipment. Expanded
    bilateral collaboration with Mexico has also yielded significant
    achievements in 2023—including closer coordination on law
    enforcement investigations and actions, such as the September
    extradition of Ovidio Guzman Lopez (son of “El Chapo”) to the United
    States, multiple additional joint investigations to disrupt and
    interdict narcotics and arms trafficking, and coordinated public
    health and public safety initiatives.
