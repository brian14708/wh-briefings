title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Celebrates Historic Progress\
  \ in Rebuilding America Ahead of Two-Year Anniversary of Bipartisan Infrastructure\_\
  Law"
---
 
*Nearly $400 billion in funding and over 40,000 projects across 4,500
communities announced across the country through Bidenomics and
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda*

Two years ago, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
– a once-in-a-generation investment in America’s infrastructure and
competitiveness. Since then, the Biden-Harris Administration has been
breaking ground on projects to rebuild our roads and bridges, deliver
clean and safe water, clean up legacy pollution, expand access to
high-speed internet, and build a clean energy economy. Through his
Investing in America agenda, a core pillar of Bidenomics, President
Biden is delivering an “Infrastructure Decade” that is unlocking access
to economic opportunity, creating good-paying jobs, boosting domestic
manufacturing, and growing America’s economy from the middle up and
bottom out – not the top-down.   
  
To date, the Administration has announced nearly **$400 billion in
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, including over 40,000 specific
projects and awards,** across over 4,500 communities in all 50 states,
D.C the territories, and for Tribes. This comes as House Republicans are
turning their backs on American infrastructure – trying to slash funding
that would make our transportation safer, more reliable, and more
convenient.  
  
To highlight the wide-ranging impact of the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, the White House is also releasing updated [**state by state fact
sheets
today**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/build/resources/state-fact-sheets/),
along with [**an updated map
showcasing**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
the more than 40,000 projects and awards identified or now underway.  
  
Implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a key piece of
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, which has helped drive
**over $614 billion dollars in private sector manufacturing and clean
energy investments** in the United States since President Biden took
office. In particular, there have been major new private sector
manufacturing announcements in electric vehicle (EV) charging, EV
batteries, rail, buses, and fiberoptic cable manufacturing spurred by
infrastructure investments tied to our Made in America policies. These
investments are creating millions of good-paying jobs, **including a
record-high number of jobs in the construction sector.** Thanks to the
President’s Investing in America agenda — which also includes the
Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the American
Rescue Plan — the Biden-Harris Administration is boosting the economy
and delivering for all of America.  
  
**<u>HISTORIC PROGRESS BY THE NUMBERS</u>**  
  
Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Administration has
already:

-   Enabled more than 21 million low-income households to access free or
    discounted high-speed internet service through the Affordable
    Connectivity Program;
-   Started improvements on 135,800 miles of roads and launched over
    7,800 bridge repair projects, increasing safety and reconnecting
    communities across the country;
-   Provided funding to deploy over 2,900 low-and zero-emission
    American-made transit buses, doubling their number on America’s
    roadways, and funded approximately 2,400 clean school buses;
-   Delivered funding for 445 port and waterway projects to strengthen
    supply chains, speed up the movement of goods, lower costs, and
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
-   Deployed investments in over 190 airport terminal projects to
    modernize and expand terminals—18 of which are under construction
    and 8 more that are complete;
-   Launched seven world-class Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs with $50
    billion of public and private sector investment, a historic leap
    forward in growing the clean energy economy across the nation;
-   Launched over 2,300 projects to help communities build resilience to
    threats such as the impacts of climate change and cyber-attacks;
-   Financed over 1,200 drinking water and wastewater projects across
    the country, including projects that will replace hundreds of
    thousands of lead service lines;
-   Removed hazardous fuel material from 8.7 million acres of land
    through the Infrastructure Law and other sources to protect
    communities from wildfires;
-   Funded nearly 400 projects for water recycling, storage,
    conservation, desalination, and other purposes to improve drought
    resilience across the West;
-   Provided funding to over 100 states, tribes, and territories and
    launched over 60 projects to improve the resilience and reliability
    of America’s electric grid and deliver cheaper and cleaner
    electricity—representing the largest single investment in electric
    transmission and distribution infrastructure in the history of the
    United States;
-   Plugged over 6,000 orphaned oil and gas wells to address legacy
    pollution; and
-   Awarded funding to 70 previously unfunded Superfund projects,
    clearing a longstanding backlog of projects to clean up contaminated
    sites and advance environmental justice.

To highlight this progress and to connect with communities across the
country, the President, Vice President, Cabinet, and senior
Administration officials have taken nearly 400 trips across the nation
specifically highlighting investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law. Senior Advisor to the President and White House Infrastructure
Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu has traveled to over 130
cities and counties and traveled over 110,000 miles.  
  
**<u>ACCOMPLISHMENTS ACROSS KEY SECTORS</u>**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration has made notable progress implementing
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law across key sectors:

-   **Roads & Bridges**: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over
    $300 billion in repairing and rebuilding America’s roads and bridges
    – the largest investment since President Eisenhower’s investment in
    the interstate highway system. This funding is already improving
    safety, strengthening supply chains, and reconnecting communities
    across the country. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has
    launched over 7,800 bridge repair projects. In addition, since
    President Biden took office, improvements have started on 135,800
    miles of roads thanks to funding provided by the Department of
    Transportation. This includes the [**Brent Spence
    Bridge**](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/bip/largebridgegrants2022/Large_Bridge_Grant_Fact_Sheets.pdf)
    project in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky, which received
    over $1.6 billion and is expected to begin construction in the
    Spring of 2024. The Brent Spence Bridge project will upgrade the
    existing bridge and build a new bridge dedicated to interstate
    drivers to improve traffic along a critical freight route from
    Canada to Florida.

<!-- -->

-   **Rail:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $66 billion for
    rail, the largest investment in passenger rail since the inception
    of Amtrak and an unprecedented investment in rail safety. Since
    President Biden took office, Amtrak has upgraded 29 stations to full
    Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance, and 30 more
    stations will be made accessible in the next year, to ensure that
    all passengers can access Amtrak service. President Biden also
    recently announced $16.4 billion for 25 passenger rail projects on
    the Northeast Corridor to repair aging infrastructure, reducing
    delays and improving reliability and speed. This includes the
    [**Hudson River
    Tunnel**](https://railroads.dot.gov/sites/fra.dot.gov/files/2023-11/FY%2022-23%20FSP-NEC%20Program%20Selections%20-%20Project%20Summaries_PDFa_0.pdf)
    in New York, where the Biden Administration has committed $11
    billion to build a new tunnel to serve the 200,000 daily passengers
    between New York and New Jersey; and the [**Frederick Douglass
    Tunnel**](https://railroads.dot.gov/sites/fra.dot.gov/files/2023-11/FY%2022-23%20FSP-NEC%20Program%20Selections%20-%20Project%20Summaries_PDFa_0.pdf)
    in Baltimore, which will replace a 150-year old tunnel and will
    create good-paying union jobs to do so. On the national network, the
    Department of Transportation has made another $4.6 billion available
    through the Fed-State National Program to expand rail service
    outside of the Northeast Corridor. Another $1.4 billion has been
    awarded for 70 freight and passenger rail projects, which will
    improve safety and benefit the supply chain on our nation’s rail. In
    addition, earlier this year the Department of Transportation
    announced funding for projects that will improve safety and ease of
    access for 400 at-grade rail crossings in 32 states.  
-   **Airports:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion
    to modernize and upgrade airports and air traffic facilities
    nationwide, improving passenger experience through expanding
    capacity, increasing accessibility, and reducing delays. To date,
    the Biden-Harris Administration has awarded nearly $2 billion
    through the Airport Terminal Program to over 190 airport terminal
    projects across 48 states, Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of the
    Northern Marianas. Of these awards, eight projects are now complete—
    like the [**Boston Logan International
    Airport**](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2023-02/ATP_Final_FY22_07072022.pdf),
    where upgrades to expand, increase accessibility, and increase
    sustainability in the international terminal were completed this
    year. Sixty-seven of these projects are in construction— like the
    [**Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
    Airport**](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2023-02/ATP_Final_FY22_07072022.pdf),
    where construction is underway to upgrade and modernize the
    40-year-old Concourse D. Through the Airport Infrastructure Grants
    Program, the Biden-Harris Administration has announced 535 grants
    for airport pavement projects. Of those, 110 projects are under
    construction and 18 have already been completed.    
-   **Ports and Waterways:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests
    $17 billion to upgrade our nation’s ports and waterways. The
    Department of Transportation and Army Corps of Engineers have
    together funded 445 port and waterway projects to strengthen supply
    chain reliability, speed up the movement of goods, reduce costs, and
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Major projects are already under
    construction, including at [**Montgomery Locks and
    Dam**](https://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Releases/Article/3488879/us-army-corps-of-engineers-hosts-groundbreaking-to-kick-off-construction-at-mon/)
    in Pennsylvania and [**Soo
    Locks**](https://www.lre.usace.army.mil/About/Highlighted-Projects/New_Soo_Lock/)
    in Michigan, which received a combined $1.55 billion to modernize
    and expand aging locks on key rivers that are lynchpins of national
    supply chains, keeping critical goods flowing and lowering costs for
    families.  
-   **Transit and School Buses:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    makes the largest investment in public transit ever, at nearly $90
    billion – including billions to electrify or upgrade our bus,
    transit rail, and ferry fleets. To date, the Biden-Harris
    Administration has funded over 2,900 low- and zero- emission transit
    buses through the Department of Transportation and approximately
    2,400 clean school buses through the Environmental Protection
    Agency. Through the Capital Investment Grant program, the
    Administration is funding long-awaited capital projects – like the
    [**Mill Plains
    BRT**](https://www.transit.dot.gov/about/news/us-department-transportation-announces-249-million-grant-award-mill-plain-bus-rapid)
    in Vancouver, WA, that provides fast, reliable transit service, and
    which opened earlier this year; or the [**Phoenix Northwest Light
    Rail
    Extension**](https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2022-03/AZ-Northwest-Extension-Phase-II-Project-Profile-FY23.pdf),
    currently under construction, that will transport nearly 2 million
    Phoenix residents to new stations and employ transit-oriented
    development to develop new housing and retail along this route.  
-   **Electric Vehicle Charging, EV Batteries & Critical Materials**:
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest federal
    investment in EV charging with $7.5 billion in available funding. To
    date, almost $2.4 billion in funding has gone to states, and
    construction is underway to build out a network of chargers along
    our highways. Thanks to these investments, the number of publicly
    available charging ports on America’s roads has surpassed 161,000,
    nearly a 70% increase since President Biden took office. In
    addition, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $7 billion
    to support the domestic manufacturing of batteries and the
    extraction, refinement, and processing of the critical materials
    that power them. This investment, paired with the tax credits in the
    Inflation Reduction Act, will help accelerate our electric vehicle
    future, strengthen U.S. supply chains, and create good-paying jobs
    across the country. Four companies that received funding for battery
    manufacturing have broken ground, including [**Cirba
    Solutions**](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/DOE%20BIL%20Battery%20FOA-2678%20Selectee%20Fact%20Sheets.pdf)
    in Lancaster, OH, which is upgrading their existing lithium-ion
    recycling facility, and [**Group14
    Technologies**](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/DOE%20BIL%20Battery%20FOA-2678%20Selectee%20Fact%20Sheets.pdf)
    in Washington, which is developing a commercial-scale modular
    manufacturing facility that will reduce battery costs and greenhouse
    gas emissions.  
-   **Clean Water:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $50
    billion for the largest upgrade to the nation’s water infrastructure
    in history. This funding places us on a path to replace 100% of lead
    service lines in America and works to close the wastewater gap for 2
    million people who lack basic sanitation. These funds have already
    financed over 1,200 drinking and wastewater projects across the
    country. This includes projects that will replace hundreds of
    thousands of lead service lines, and 651 projects that will build
    sanitation facilities for Tribal communities that lack wastewater
    services. To date, EPA has awarded over $11 billion in clean water
    investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law under the State
    Revolving Funds, and at least 49% of this funding will go to
    disadvantaged communities. Major clean water projects under
    construction include the [**Arkansas Valley
    Conduit**](https://www.usbr.gov/gp/ecao/avc/) in Colorado and the
    [**Lewis & Clark Regional Water
    System**](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-420-million-rural-water-funding-president-bidens)
    in Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa, which received a combined $302
    million to build water pipelines that will deliver clean water to
    over 350,000 people.  
-   **High-Speed Internet:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests
    $65 billion to help ensure that every American has access to
    affordable, reliable high-speed internet—regardless of their income,
    race, religion, or zip code. The Affordable Connectivity Program is
    already saving more than 21 million households up to $30 a month on
    their internet bills, and more households enroll every day. The
    Administration is urging Congress to provide additional funding for
    this program so that low-income seniors, students, and families can
    continue to receive free and discounted internet service
    through 2024. In June, the Biden-Harris Administration announced
    over $40 billion in funding allocations to each U.S. state,
    territory, and D.C. for affordable, reliable high-speed Internet
    infrastructure. This funding comes atop $1 billion for middle-mile
    infrastructure, which will build more than 12,000 miles of fiber
    across 250 counties, and $2 billion for rural high-speed internet,
    with 121 awards going to 36 states across the country. In Missouri,
    Michigan, and Mississippi, construction is already underway on
    projects funded by the Department of Agriculture’s ReConnect
    Program. These projects, funded with $28 million from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law, will connect 7,100 people, 660 farms, and 149
    businesses directly to fiber networks. Commerce has also awarded 148
    Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP) grants, totaling more
    than $886 million, and serving over 280 Tribal Governments, which
    will connect more than 65,000 Tribal households. Together, these
    investments mirror federal government’s historic investment in rural
    electrification during the 1930s, when the US connected nearly every
    home and farm in America to electricity and millions of families and
    our economy reaped the benefits.  
-   **Modernizing the Grid and Deploying Clean Energy:** The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law includes more than $62 billion in funding at the
    Department of Energy to advance our clean energy future by investing
    in clean energy demonstration and deployment projects, developing
    new technologies, and modernizing our power grid. This includes an
    investment of over $20 billion to upgrade the nation’s grid—a
    critical component to achieve President Biden’s goal of delivering
    100% clean electricity by 2035. To date, the Department of Energy
    has announced over $5.5 billion in funding for over 60 projects and
    provided funding to over 100 states, tribes, and territories to
    [**improve the resilience and reliability of America’s
    grid**](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/grid-and-transmission-program-conductor).
    The Department of Energy has also announced $7 billion to launch
    [**seven regional clean hydrogen
    hubs**](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-7-billion-americas-first-clean-hydrogen-hubs-driving)
    to produce clean hydrogen for energy intensive sectors like
    industrial manufacturing and heavy-duty shipping.  
-   **Superfunds and Brownfields Cleanup**: The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law invests over $5 billion for Superfund sites and
    Brownfield projects to restore the health and economic vitality of
    communities that have been exposed to legacy pollution for far too
    long. The Environmental Protection Agency has already awarded $2.5
    billion of this funding, including awards for 70 Superfund projects
    that had not previously received funding, clearing the longstanding
    backlog. The EPA has also awarded 326 grants to communities to
    assess and clean up brownfields and restore these sites to hubs of
    economic growth. This year, 76% of Superfund funding went to
    communities with potential environmental justice concerns.  
-   **Orphaned Wells and Abandoned Mine Lands:** Orphaned oil and gas
    wells and abandoned coal mines left behind by industry continue to
    pollute millions of Americans’ air and water with methane and
    hazardous waste. Through a total investment of $16 billion from the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, projects are already completing
    cleanup efforts at these sites across the country. The Department of
    the Interior has awarded nearly $700 million to states and Tribes
    for plugging orphaned wells and $729 million for remediating
    abandoned mine lands. These investments are expected to contribute
    an additional $2 billion to the economy and support over 16,000 jobs
    reducing the harmful methane emissions and hazardous pollution from
    these sites in communities once dependent on the oil and gas
    industry. With this funding, over 6,000 wells have been plugged so
    far, with tens of thousands more to be plugged using Infrastructure
    Law funding.  
-   **Resilience:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $50
    billion in an “all hazards” approach to protect our infrastructure
    and communities from physical, climate, and cybersecurity-related
    threats. To date, the Administration has funded **over 2,300
    projects to build resilience to these threats**. That includes
    protecting communities from wildfires by removing flammable
    materials from 8.7 million of acres of land to date through the
    Infrastructure Law and other sources. The Department of the Interior
    has awarded $2.7 billion in funding for 384 water infrastructure and
    conservation projects to advance drought resilience in the West.
    This includes $118 million from the Infrastructure Law awarded to
    the [**Gila River Indian
    Community**](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-supports-580-million-investment-fulfill-indian-water),
    which has broken ground on a project to use reclaimed water for its
    agriculture, conserving a critical 200,000 acre-feet of water to
    help alleviate the drought in the Colorado River Basin. The Army
    Corps of Engineers has invested $4.4 billion for 277 resilience
    projects, FEMA has invested $800 million for 540 projects, and the
    Department of Transportation has allocated nearly $4.3 billion to
    protect our roads and bridges from climate impacts.

**<u>MAKING SURE NO COMMUNITY IS LEFT BEHIND</u>**  
  
The President is committed to rebuilding the infrastructure of the
entire country, leaving no community behind as we do so:

-   **Helping Non-Federal Partners Unlock Funding Opportunities**:
    States and territories have appointed over 50 Infrastructure
    Coordinators to facilitate clear communication, collaboration, and
    communication with the federal government and ensure that all
    communities can access federal funding in the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. The White House recently released an updated
    [Technical Assistance
    Guide](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/build/technical-assistance-guide/)
    that will help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments and
    other nongovernmental partners unlock the funding in President
    Biden’s Investing in America agenda. The updated technical
    assistance guide builds on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s
    Guidebook, Rural Playbook, and Tribal Playbook, and highlights
    resources that help communities navigate programs and tools that can
    help them deliver infrastructure, clean energy, and climate
    resilience projects. These resources complement the place-based
    technical assistance that the Administration is providing through
    the Thriving Communities Network and Rural Partners Network. The
    Thriving Communities Network aims to deploy a full range of Federal
    place-based technical assistance and capacity-building resources to
    urban, rural, and Tribal communities experiencing economic distress
    and a history of systematic disinvestment, and the Rural Partners
    Network is an all-of-government program that helps rural communities
    find resources and funding to create jobs, build infrastructure, and
    support long-term economic stability on their own terms.  
-   **Investing in Rural America:** Through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law, the Biden-Harris Administration is making record
    investments in our rural infrastructure to ensure that rural
    Americans have every opportunity to succeed and that no one has to
    leave home to find economic opportunity. The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law has invested billions of dollars in rural
    communities across the country—delivering affordable high-speed
    internet, safe roads and bridges, modern wastewater systems, clean
    drinking water, reliable and affordable electricity, and good paying
    jobs in every rural community. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded
    projects to expand high-speed internet access through the Department
    of Agriculture’s ReConnect Program are already underway in rural
    communities. The Department of Transportation’s ROUTES Initiative,
    codified in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, supports rural
    communities interested in improving their transportation networks to
    make sure rural families can get where they need to go safely,
    including through a $4.58 billion investment in Rural Area Formula
    Grants. This program is supporting 1,300 rural transit systems by
    enabling them to purchase transit vehicles and infrastructure, plan
    transit more effectively, and fund operations. And the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law’s transformative investment of over $50 billion
    in our water and wastewater infrastructure is fundamentally changing
    the quality of life for millions of people in rural America by
    breaking ground on projects to eliminate lead pipes, provide
    critical access to sanitation, ensure access to clean drinking
    water, and reduce drought.  
-   **Delivering for Tribal Communities:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law provides more than $13 billion directly to Tribal communities
    and makes Tribes eligible to apply for or request billions in
    additional funding. In total, this funding represents the single
    largest investment in Tribal infrastructure ever. For example, the
    Department of the Interior, in partnership with the Federal
    Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Denali Commission, has
    launched a voluntary community-driven relocation program, with an
    initial commitment of over $135 million to assist Tribal communities
    severely impacted by climate-related environmental threats.
    Additionally, the Department of Transportation has awarded more than
    $462 million in discretionary funding going directly to Tribes in 28
    states with a total of 247 grant awards to improve transportation on
    Tribal lands. This program is one of the first designed to
    coordinate closely with community leaders to help begin the process
    of relocating crucial community infrastructure away from imminent
    threats and build long-term resilience to climate impacts.  
-   **Advancing Environmental Justice**: The Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law is delivering clean air, clean water, and equitable access to
    opportunity for disadvantaged communities that have been
    overburdened by pollution and marginalized by underinvestment for
    far too long. Over 180 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law programs are
    included under President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which commits
    to delivering 40% of overall benefits of certain federal climate,
    clean energy, and other investments to disadvantaged communities.
    And many investments surpass this mark – at least 49% of funding for
    clean drinking water and lead pipe replacement must go to
    disadvantaged communities, 76% of funding for Superfund sites this
    year went to construction work in communities with potential
    environmental justice concerns, and 86% of Brownfields grants went
    to disadvantaged communities. In addition, approximately 98% of
    funding for clean school buses has gone to prioritized school
    districts (including low-income communities) to reduce roadway air
    pollution for children and families, and the Army Corps of Engineers
    has invested $1.3 billion in projects that will make disadvantaged
    communities more resilient to flooding and the impacts of climate
    change.  
-   **Economic Development for Distressed Communities:** The Bipartisan
    infrastructure Law roughly doubled the amount of funding available
    to six regional commissions over five years. These commissions
    promote rural vitality by investing in community capacity and
    spurring economic development in hundreds of distressed counties
    across the United States, from the Alabama Black Belt to the remote,
    rural communities of Northern Maine. For example, the Appalachian
    Regional Commission has invested more than $5 million to rebuild
    water and sewage infrastructure after the July 2022 flooding in
    eastern Kentucky that damaged and destroyed more than 9,000 homes.
    In addition, the Department of Transportation recently opened
    applications for more than $3 billion to reconnect communities that
    have been cut off from economic opportunity by highways, rail lines,
    or other transportation infrastructure, part of the $4 billion
    Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods Program.  
-   **Lowering Costs for Families:** Through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law, the Biden-Harris Administration is lowering
    everyday costs for the American people. The Affordable Connectivity
    Program is already saving more than 21 million households $30 per
    month on their internet bill. The Department of Health and Human
    Services has provided $300 million through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law to lower energy costs for families, saving
    households an average of nearly $1,000 on their energy bills
    annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has also provided $3.5
    billion for the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance
    Program to reduce energy costs for low-income households by
    increasing the energy efficiency of their homes, while ensuring
