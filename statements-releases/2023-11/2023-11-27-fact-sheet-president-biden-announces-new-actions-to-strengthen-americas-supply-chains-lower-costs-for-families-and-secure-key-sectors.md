*During the inaugural convening of the new White House Council on Supply
Chain Resilience, President Biden will unveil more than 30 new actions
to strengthen America’s supply chains*

As part of his Bidenomics agenda to lower costs for American families,
President Biden is announcing nearly 30 new actions to strengthen supply
chains critical to America’s economic and national security. These
actions will help Americans get the products they need when they need
them, enable reliable deliveries for businesses, strengthen our
agriculture and food systems, and support good-paying, union jobs here
at home. President Biden will announce these actions alongside members
of his Cabinet and other senior Administration officials at the
inaugural meeting of the new White House Council on Supply Chain
Resilience. The Council, which President Biden is establishing today,
will support the enduring resilience of America’s critical supply
chains.  
  
Robust supply chains are fundamental to a strong economy. When supply
chains smooth, [prices
fall](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/06/08/easing-supply-chains/) for
goods, food, and equipment, putting more money in the pockets of
American families, workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs. That is why
President Biden made supply chain resilience a priority from Day One of
his Administration—including by signing an Executive Order on America’s
Supply Chains and establishing a [Supply Chain Disruptions Task
Force](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-supply-chain-disruptions-task-force-to-address-short-term-supply-chain-discontinuities/) that
worked with states, Tribes, local governments, businesses, family farms,
labor, and allies and partners to address the acute supply chain crises
caused by the pandemic. Since then, the Administration has made historic
investments to strengthen supply chains and prevent future disruptions
by expanding production capacity in key sectors and building
infrastructure through the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation
Reduction Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  
  
These efforts helped unsnarl supply chains, re-normalize the flow of
goods, and lower inflation. From October 2021 to October 2023, supply
chain pressures as measured by the [New York
Fed](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/interactive) declined
from near-record highs to a record low, helping lower inflation, which
has fallen by 65% from its peak.

**Today, President Biden is building on this progress by announcing bold
new actions to further strengthen supply chains, lower costs for
families, and help Americans get the goods they need, including:**

-   **The creation of the Council on Supply Chain Resilience. **Today,
    President Biden will convene the inaugural meeting of the White
    House Council on Supply Chain Resilience, which will advance his
    long-term, government-wide strategy to build enduring supply chain
    resilience. The Council will be co-chaired by the National Security
    Advisor and National Economic Advisor, and include the Secretaries
    of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human
    Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the
    Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, the Treasury, and Veterans
    Affairs; the Attorney General; the Administrators of the
    Environmental Protection Agency and the Small Business
    Administration; the Directors of National Intelligence, the Office
    of Management and Budget, and the Office of Science and Technology
    Policy; the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; the U.S.
    Trade Representative; and other senior officials from the Executive
    Office of the President and other agencies.  
     
-   **Use of the Defense Production Act to make more essential medicines
    in America and mitigate drug shortages. **President Biden will issue
    a Presidential Determination to broaden the Department of Health and
    Human Services’ (HHS) authorities under Title III of the Defense
    Production Act (DPA) to enable investment in domestic manufacturing
    of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs
    that have been deemed by the President as essential to the national
    defense. HHS has identified $35 million for investments in domestic
    production of key starting materials for sterile injectable
    medicines. HHS will also designate a new Supply Chain Resilience and
    Shortage Coordinator for efforts to strengthen the resilience of
    medical product and critical food supply chains, and to address
    related shortages. HHS intends to institutionalize this coordination
    to advance the department’s supply chain resilience and shortage
    mitigation goals over the long term. The Department of Defense (DOD)
    will also soon release a new report on pharmaceutical supply chain
    resilience aimed at reducing reliance on high-risk foreign
    suppliers. These actions are a subset of the Administration’s
    broader work to increase access to essential medicines and medical
    products.  
     
-   **New cross-governmental supply chain data-sharing
    capabilities. **The Administration has developed several
    cross-government partnerships to improve supply chain monitoring and
    strategy, including:
    -   The Department of Commerce’s new, first-of-its-kind Supply Chain
        Center is integrating industry expertise and data analytics to
        develop innovative supply chain risk assessment tools, and is
        coordinating deep-dive analyses on select critical supply chains
        to drive targeted actions to increase resilience. This Center is
        building broad partnerships across government, industry, and
        academia, including collaborating with the Department of Energy
        (DOE) to conduct deep-dive analyses on clean energy supply.
        Additionally, Commerce is partnering with HHS to assess industry
        and import data that can help address foreign dependency
        vulnerabilities and points of failure for critical drugs.
    -   The Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Freight Logistics
        Optimization Works (“FLOW”) program is a public-private
        partnership that brings together U.S. supply chain stakeholders
        to create a shared, common picture of supply chain networks and
        facilitate a more reliable flow of goods. DOT is announcing a
        new milestone for FLOW, in which participants are beginning to
        utilize FLOW data to inform their logistics decision making,
        helping to avoid bottlenecks, shorten lead times for customers,
        and enable a more resilient and globally competitive freight
        network through earlier warnings of supply chain disruption. As
        the effort continues to mature, DOT will work with the
        Department of Agriculture (USDA) to increase data transparency
        for containerized shipments of agricultural products in the
        United States, efforts that can help producers and sellers avoid
        disruptions that can increase food prices.
    -   These new analytical capabilities will enable the Council to
        coordinate a more complete, whole-of-government critical supply
        chain monitoring function.

**Additional actions to support stronger supply chains and access to
affordable, reliable energy and critical technology:**  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Investing in critical supply
chains:</span>

-   DOE today announced $275 million in grant selections for its
    Advanced Energy Manufacturing and Recycling Grant Program,
    investments that will revitalize communities affected by coal mine
    or coal power plant closures through investment in clean energy
    supply chains, including production of critical materials,
    components for grid-scale batteries and electric vehicles, onshore
    wind turbines, and energy conservation technologies. DOE also
    announced up to $10 million of funding for a “critical material
    accelerator” and a $5.6-million prize to develop circular clean
    energy supply chains. These efforts build on action by President
    Biden to authorize DOE’s use of the DPA to increase domestic
    production of [five key clean energy
    technologies](https://www.energy.gov/articles/president-biden-invokes-defense-production-act-accelerate-domestic-manufacturing-clean)—including
    electric heat pumps—as well as DOE’s recently announced $3.5-billion
    investment through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to boost
    domestic production of advanced batteries and battery materials
    needed for essential clean energy technologies such as stationary
    storage and electric vehicles.
-   USDA is making investments worth $196 million to strengthen our
    domestic food supply chains and create more opportunity for farmers
    and entrepreneurs in 37 states and in Puerto Rico. These
    investments—which build on prior investments in diversified food
    processing, resilient agricultural markets, and fertilizer
    production—expand farmer income opportunities, create economic
    opportunities for people and businesses in rural areas, and lower
    food costs.
-   DOD, building on the $714 million in DPA investments it has made in
    2023 to support defense-critical supply chains, will publish the
    first ever National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS). The NDIS
    will guide engagement, policy development, and investment in the
    defense industrial base over the next three to five years. It will
    ensure a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to and focus on
    the multiple layers of suppliers and sub-suppliers that make up
    these critical supply chains.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Planning for long-term
industrial resilience and future supply chain investments:</span>

-   **Launch of the quadrennial supply chain review. **The Council will
    complete the first quadrennial supply chain review by December
    31, 2024. As part of the review, the Council will update criteria on
    industries, sectors, and products defined as critical to national
    and economic security. In addition, 12 months after the Council
    promulgates the criteria, and annually thereafter, the Council will
    apply the criteria to review and update the list of critical
    sectors, as appropriate.
-   **Smart manufacturing plan. **DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and
    Renewable Energy (EERE) Advanced Materials and Manufacturing
    Technologies Office (AMMTO) is sponsoring a study by the National
    Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to develop a
    nationwide plan for smart manufacturing. The report will establish
    key priorities for investment to support new digital and artificial
    intelligence technologies. These investments will enhance the
    productivity and security of the manufacturing systems that are
    critical for maintaining domestic supply chains.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deploying new capabilities to
monitor existing and emerging risks:</span>

-   **New Resilience Center and tabletop exercises for supply chain
    disruptions. **The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is
    announcing the launch of a new Supply Chain Resilience Center
    (SCRC), which will be dedicated to ensuring the resilience of supply
    chains for critical infrastructure needed to deliver essential
    services to the American people. Near-term priorities will include
    addressing supply chain risks resulting from threats and
    vulnerabilities inside U.S. ports. Additionally, in 2024, in
    collaboration with other federal agencies and foreign governments,
    DHS will facilitate at least two tabletop exercises designed to test
    the resilience of critical cross-border supply chains. Further, DHS
    and the Department of Commerce will collaborate to continue to
    strengthen the semiconductor supply chain and further the
    implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act.
-   **Launch of DOT Multimodal Freight Office.** As part of the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (“BIL”) implementation, DOT is
    launching its Office of Multimodal Freight Infrastructure and Policy
    (“Multimodal Freight Office”). This office is responsible for
    maintaining and improving the condition and performance of the
    nation’s multimodal freight network including through the
    development of the National Multimodal Freight Network, review of
    State Freight Plans, and the continued advancement of the FLOW
    initiative in partnership with the Bureau of Transportation
    Statistics.
-   **Monitoring of climate impacts. **The White House National Security
    Council, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Council of
    Economic Advisers will co-lead an interagency effort in partnership
    with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to monitor
    global developments related to El Niño, including this climate
    phenomenon’s impact on U.S. and global commodity prices, agriculture
    and fishery output, disruptions to global and trade supply chains,
    and resulting impacts on food security, human health, and social
    instabilities.
-   **Energy and critical mineral supply chain readiness. **To more
    consistently track risk and opportunity across energy supply chains,
    DOE is developing an assessment tool that accounts for raw
    materials, manufacturing, workforce, and logistics considerations.
    Additionally, to help assess the potential for trade disruptions of
    select critical minerals and materials, the Department of the
    Interior’s U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will map and develop
    geospatial databases for select global critical product supply
    chains, with a current focus on semiconductor components; and will
    seek designation by the Chief Statistician of the United States of a
    federal statistical unit providing the nation’s official minerals
    statistics. Additionally, the National Science and Technology
    Council’s Critical Minerals Subcommittee plans to launch a new
    criticalminerals.gov website in January 2024 that will highlight
    cross-governmental supply chain efforts.
-   **Defense supply chain mapping and risk management. **DOD is
    increasing supply chain visibility through the creation of a Supply
    Chain Mapping Tool to analyze supplier data for 110 weapon systems.
    This capability will be used to develop defense industrial base
    wargaming scenarios to identify vulnerabilities and develop
    mitigation strategies.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Engaging public and private
stakeholders to expand supply chain risk modeling:</span>

-   **Supply Chain Data and Analytics Summit. **The Department of
    Commerce will convene a diverse array of public and private
    stakeholders at a Supply Chain Data and Analytics Summit in 2024. A
    key aim of the summit will be to invite expert input into supply
    chain risk assessment models and tools. The summit will also assess
    data availability, utility, and limitations and consider actions to
    improve data flows.
-   **AI hackathons to strengthen critical mineral supply
    chains. **USGS, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
    (DARPA), and the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E),
    building on their 2022 prize
    challenges [announcement](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2022-08-15),
    will host a series of hackathons beginning in February 2024 to
    develop novel artificial intelligence approaches to assess domestic
    critical mineral resources.
-   **Risk mapping for labor rights abuses. **The Department of Labor
    (DOL) updated its Comply Chain guidance for identifying and
    addressing labor rights violations in global supply chains. In
    addition, DOL is providing $8 million for two four-year projects to
    identify supply chain traceability methods and technologies to
    address child labor or forced labor risks in diverse supply chains,
    such as the cobalt and cotton sectors. DOL will also undertake new
    supply chain research on mining and agriculture products across
    Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

**In addition to the announcements above, the Administration continues
to deepen engagement with allies and partners to strengthen global
supply chains, including:**  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deepening international early
warning systems to detect and respond to supply chain disruptions in
critical sectors with allies and partners, including:</span>

-   **With the European Union. **In May 2023, the United States and the
    EU established an early warning system for semiconductor supply
    chain disruptions under [the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology
    Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/31/u-s-eu-joint-statement-of-the-trade-and-technology-council-2/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20and%20the%20European%20Union%20have%20completed%20a,provided%20to%20the%20semiconductor%20sector.).
