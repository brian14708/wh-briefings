title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on Shooting of Palestinian Students in\
  \ Burlington,\_Vermont"
---
 
Doug and I join President Biden, the First Lady, and Americans across
the country in praying for the full recovery of the three Palestinian
students who were shot in Burlington, Vermont as they traveled to one of
their grandmotherâ€™s homes during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. We
send our deepest sympathies to their families and to all those who have
been impacted by this senseless violence.  
  
While the facts of this tragedy are still being investigated, we know
that far too many people live with the fear that they could be targeted
and attacked based on their beliefs or who they are. We are grateful for
the work of law enforcement and will continue to do all that we can to
keep our communities safe from both hate and gun violence.
