Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa of Bahrain. The leaders discussed
the latest developments in Gaza and their shared commitment to
facilitating the increased, sustained delivery of life-saving
humanitarian assistance to civilians. The Vice President reiterated the
importance of protecting civilian lives and respecting international
humanitarian law as Israel defends its citizens and combats terrorism
following Hamas’s horrific terrorist attack on October 7. The Vice
President made clear it is critical to ensure that Palestinians are not
forcibly displaced outside of Gaza and underscored that Israelis and
Palestinians must have equal measures of security, prosperity, and
freedom. The Vice President also discussed steps taken to strengthen
U.S. posture in the Middle East region to bolster regional deterrence
efforts.   The Vice President reaffirmed the close and enduring
bilateral relationship between the United States and Bahrain and
discussed ongoing implementation of the “Comprehensive Security
Integration and Prosperity Agreement” (C-SIPA) – a critical framework
for enhancing cooperation on defense, intelligence, technology, and
trade between the two countries.  They agreed to remain in close
contact, both directly and through their teams.
