**San Francisco, California**  
**November 16-17, 2023**

With regard to the war against Ukraine, we reiterated our respective
positions as expressed in other fora, including the UN Security Council
and the UN General Assembly, which, in Resolution No. ES-11/1 dated 2
March 2022 as adopted by majority vote deplores in the strongest terms
the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its
complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine.
Most members strongly condemn the aggression against Ukraine and
underscore the need to reach a just, and lasting peace based on the
principles of the United Nations Charter, including the territorial
integrity, sovereignty, and political independence of Ukraine. The war
in Ukraine has further aggravated the ongoing food security crisis
around the world, especially in developing and least developed
countries. We note with deep concern the adverse impact of the war in
Ukraine and stress that it is causing immense human suffering and
exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy – constraining
growth, increasing inflation, disrupting supply chains, heightening
energy and food insecurity, and elevating financial stability risks. In
this context, the use or threat of use of nuclear weapon is
inadmissible.  
  
We exchanged views on the ongoing crisis in Gaza. Leaders, including the
United States, shared their respective positions. Some Leaders also
shared the united messages of the Joint Arab-Islamic Summit in Riyadh on
11 November 2023.

Some Leaders objected to the inclusion of this language in the
accompanying 2023 APEC Leaders’ Golden Gate Declaration on the basis
that they do not believe that APEC is a forum to discuss geopolitical
issues.
