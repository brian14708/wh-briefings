title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 2024 Open Enrollment\_Period"
---
 
Health care should be a right — not a privilege — for all Americans.
Today, with the beginning of the open enrollment period on
HealthCare.gov, we can continue delivering on that fundamental promise.

Starting today and running through January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2024,
Americans across the country can gain the peace of mind that comes from
having quality, affordable health coverage. Signing up is easy — simply
go to HealthCare.gov and select the plan that works best for you and
your family.

Last year, over 16 million people signed up for health insurance through
the Affordable Care Act – more Americans than ever before.  Thanks to
the Inflation Reduction Act, coverage on HealthCare.gov and the
state-based Marketplaces continues to be more affordable and accessible
than ever, with consumers saving an average of $800 on their premiums
annually. In fact, four in five customers can find quality coverage for
less than $10 a month. If you don’t receive insurance through your
employer, there are a range of quality, affordable coverage options
available to you.

We’ve made record-breaking progress in expanding coverage and lowering
health care costs for American families, saving them money and giving
more Americans the peace of mind that comes with affordable health
insurance. I urge everyone to visit HealthCare.gov today to renew their
coverage or shop for a plan.
