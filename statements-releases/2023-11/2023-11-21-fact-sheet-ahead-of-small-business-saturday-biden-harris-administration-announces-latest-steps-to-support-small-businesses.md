title: "FACT SHEET: Ahead of Small Business Saturday, Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\
  \ Announces Latest Steps to Support Small\_Businesses"

*Department of the Treasury announces $50 million to help underserved
small businesses secure financing; Small Business Administration
delivers $50 billion to small businesses and sees record loans to
minority businesses*

In advance of Small Business Saturday on November 25<sup>th</sup>, the
Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to support small
businesses—a key pillar of Bidenomics—and releasing new data that
highlights the small business boom taking place during this
Administration. Under President Biden, Americans have filed a record
14.6 million applications to start businesses – a sign that the historic
investment in small businesses is driving confidence and optimism from
entrepreneurs, and generating more resilient and competitive markets.  
  
Entrepreneurs of color are particularly benefiting from the Biden-Harris
Administration’s increased lending and investments in small businesses.
Data from the [Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer
Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf)
shows that between 2019 and 2022, the share of families owning a
business increased by 9%, with particularly large increases among Black
and Hispanic households. The percent of Black households owning a
business during this same period more than doubled — after falling
between 2007 and 2019. These increases [support wealth building in Black
and Hispanic
communities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/12/01/the-benefits-of-increased-equity-in-federal-contracting/),
as business owners report more wealth as compared to non-business owners
in this survey. And under President Biden, we’ve achieved the fastest
growth in Black business ownership in over 30 years.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration celebrates the hardworking
Americans who run our small businesses and are the engines of our
economy by announcing the following new actions:

-   **$50 million in American Rescue Plan funds will help thousands of
    small businesses access historic investment opportunities from the
    President’s Investing in America agenda**. The U.S. Department of
    the Treasury is [announcing awards of more than $50
    million](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1923) to 20
    states to provide legal, financial, and other advisory services that
    are expected to help more than 10,000 small businesses owned by
    individuals from traditionally underserved communities secure loans
    and investments to grow and expand. These awards are being provided
    through the State Small Business Credit Initiative’s (SSBCI)
    Technical Assistance Grant Program – part of the American Rescue
    Plan’s historic support for underserved small businesses that is
    providing capital, building ecosystems of opportunity and
    entrepreneurship, and creating new jobs and economic opportunity.
    This announcement represents only a portion of the nearly $10
    billion SSBCI funds deployed to states, tribes, and territories to
    launch and expand capital access programs for roughly 100,000 small
    businesses. Each dollar of SSBCI funds catalyzes $10 of small
    business lending and investments – resulting in tens of billions of
    new small business financing across the country through 2030. To
    date, the Treasury Department has already approved more than $8
    billion in funding to all 50 states, and an additional $108 million
    in technical assistance grants to 32 states through the SSBCI
    Capital Grant and Technical Assistance Grant programs.   
-   **Small Business Administration (SBA) delivered $50 billion to small
    businesses in Fiscal Year 2023, with major increases in support for
    underserved businesses, including minority-owned businesses.**
    Today, the SBA released data on the performance of its lending
    programs in Fiscal Year 2023, including its signature 7(a) Loan
    Program, which supports financing to small business for working
    capital and a range of other uses, and its 504 Loan Program, which
    provides financing for major fixed asset purchases. That data shows
    SBA delivered a historic $50 billion in capital to small businesses
    across the country in Fiscal Year 2023. Highlights from the data
    include:  
-   Total SBA Lending: The SBA has backed $108 billion in 7(a) and 504
    loans to small businesses during the Biden Administration – 32% more
    than the same time in the prior administration.  
-   Minority Lending: Since 2020, the share of the SBA’s loan portfolio
    going to minority-owned businesses has increased from 23% to over
    32%. For example, the number and dollar value of SBA-backed loans to
    Black-owned businesses has more than doubled. The SBA backed $3
    billion in loans to Latino-owned businesses in FY23 – a
    record-breaking high. Lending to AAPI-owned small businesses is on
    the rise, with loan count and total loan dollars both increasing by
    over a third since 2020. Finally, loans to Native-owned small
    businesses are up 70% and total loan dollars have nearly doubled
    since 2020. These are just a few of the results of SBA’s efforts to
    expand access to its core capital programs for all small
    businesses.  
-   Women-Owned Small Businesses: Lending to women-owned small
    businesses is once again on the rise, with loan counts increasing by
    70% since 2020 and total loan dollars exceeding $5 billion in
    2023.  
-   Veteran-Owned Small Businesses: Loans to veteran-owned small
    businesses are up by a third since 2020, with total loan dollars
    exceeding $1 billion in 2023.  
-   Small dollar loans. Small businesses consistently voice the need for
    access to small dollar loans, with
    [survey](https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey/2022/report-on-employer-firms)
    results indicating over 50% seek loans of less than $100,000.
    According to another
    [survey](https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey/2023/report-on-employer-firms),
    only one-third of the smallest businesses – those with $100,000 or
    less in annual revenue – report receiving the full funding they
    request from banks. The SBA has worked to increase small dollar
    loans, and in FY23 delivered nearly $90 million in microloan funding
    – loans of $50,000 or less—with 35% of those loans going to
    Black-owned businesses and 15% going to Latino-owned businesses. SBA
    delivered more loans in its signature 7(a) loan program under
    $150,000 in FY23 than in FY22, FY21, and FY20 – an overall 45%
    increase since President Biden took office.  
-   **SBA and the Department of Agriculture strengthen partnership to
    invest in rural small businesses.** This week, [the SBA and USDA
    signed a memorandum of
    understanding](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/11/20/usda-and-us-small-business-administration-strengthen-partnership)
    to strengthen their long-standing partnership to create jobs and
    economic growth in small and underserved communities. Together, the
    agencies will provide trainings to rural businessowners, work with
    agricultural producers to identify ways to export products, and
    expand the collaboration between USDA’s Rural Partners Network and
    SBA’s Resource Partners Network to improve economic security for
    small businesses throughout rural America.

The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken significant steps to
support small businesses in the past few months. This includes:

-   **SBA expanded its lending program focused on underserved
    communities for the first time in 40 years.** This fall, the SBA
    issued new licenses to lenders in the Small Business Lending Company
    (SBLC) program [for the first time in 40
    years](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/11/01/biden-harris-administration-takes-historic-step-expanding-access-capital-filling-lending-gaps).
    The lenders in this program historically outperform banks and credit
    unions in lending to minority-owned businesses. The three new
    licensed lenders – Arkansas Capital Corporation, Alaska Growth
    Capital, and Funding Circle – have expertise and history lending to
    traditionally underserved communities. Arkansas Capital Corporation
    is a community development financial institution (CDFI) serving
    Arkansas and the bordering states, and since 2019 has delivered more
    than half of their lending to Persistent Poverty Counties – counties
    with at least a 20% poverty rate for over 30 years. Alaska Growth
    Capital is a certified Native CDFI with more than 60% of activities
    dedicated to serving Alaska Native, Native American, and Native
    Hawaiian businesses and communities. Funding Circle is an online
    lending platform that has originated more than $4.5 billion in loans
    to small businesses, with 33% of current loans going to small
    businesses in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods and 40% going to
    small businesses in rural areas.  
-   **Treasury released a Notice of Funding Opportunity for $75
    million** **SSBCI Investing in America Small Business Opportunity
    Program.**  In October, [Treasury announced a $75
    million](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Competitive-TA-NOFO-FINAL-Oct-25-2023.pdf)
    competitive grant program with American Rescue Plan funds for states
    to provide services to help very small and underserved businesses
    access opportunities created by the President’s Investing in America
    agenda – which includes the historic investments made by the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS and
    Science Act, and American Rescue Plan – by offering them technical
    assistance.  
-   **The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) awarded $100
    million through the Capital Readiness Program to invest in small
    business incubators and accelerators**. The MBDA [awarded 43
    non-profit community-based
    organizations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/04/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-to-announce-support-to-help-historically-underserved-entrepreneurs-tap-into-bidenomics-fueled-small-business-boom/)
    funding to support underserved entrepreneurs launch and scale their
    small businesses. This program, funded through the American Rescue
    Plan, is the largest-ever direct federal investment in small
    business incubators and accelerators of its kind.  
-   **SBA’s Community Navigators Program provides critical technical
    assistance.** This summer, the SBA announced that its more than 50
    American Rescue Plan-funded Community Navigators grantees had
    already helped to secure nearly $250 million in approved funding for
    small businesses, trained over 290,000 business owners, and
    conducted 145,000 hours of one-on-one counseling.  With funding set
    to expire by the end of this year, the Biden-Harris Administration
    [proposed additional
    funding](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/mar/09/statement-sba-administrator-guzman-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-budget)
    for the program in its FY24 Budget proposal and has called on
    Congress to continue the program.  
-   **Historic investments in small businesses have been provided
    through the federal procurement system.** [In
    2022](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/07/18/biden-harris-administration-sets-record-breaking-163-billion-federal-procurement-opportunities-small),
    the Biden-Harris Administration awarded a record-breaking $163
    billion in federal procurement opportunities to small businesses.
    These awards include a record $69.9 billion, or 11.4% of federal
    contracting spending, to Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) –
    exceeding the Administration’s FY22 goal – and over $28 billion to
    service-disabled Veteran-owned (SDVOB) small businesses, or 4.6% of
    federal contracting spending.
