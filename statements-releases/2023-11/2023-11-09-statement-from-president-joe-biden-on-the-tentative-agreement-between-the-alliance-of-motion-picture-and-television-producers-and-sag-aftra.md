title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Tentative Agreement Between the\
  \ Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and\_SAG-AFTRA"
---
 
Collective bargaining works. I applaud SAG-AFTRA and Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers for working together in good faith
towards an agreement that allows our entertainment industry to continue
telling the stories of America. When both sides come to the table to
negotiate in earnest they can make businesses stronger and allow workers
to secure pay and benefits that help them raise families and retire with
dignity. Over the last three years, workers have won historic victories
that ensure record pay, record benefits, and an economy that grows from
the middle out and bottom up. SAG-AFTRA members will have the final say
on this contract, but the sacrifices they’ve made will ensure a better
future for them, their families, and all workers who deserve a fair
share of the value they helped create.
