Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

As I have reported previously, militia groups affiliated with Iran’s
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have perpetrated a series of
attacks against United States personnel and facilities in Iraq and
Syria.  These attacks, including more than a dozen attacks over the last
week, have placed under grave threat the lives of United States
personnel and Coalition operating alongside United States forces.

As I reported on October 27, 2023, in response to this series of attacks
and continuing threats of future attacks, at my direction, United States
forces conducted targeted strikes against facilities in eastern Syria
used by the IRGC and IRGC‑affiliated groups.

On the night of November 8, 2023, at my direction, United States forces
conducted a precision strike against a facility in eastern Syria used by
the IRGC and IRGC-affiliated groups for weapons storage and other
purposes.  The strike was taken to establish deterrence and was
conducted in a manner designed to limit the risk of escalation and avoid
civilian casualties.  I directed the strike in order to protect and
defend our personnel, to degrade and disrupt the ongoing series of
attacks against the United States and our partners, and to deter Iran
and Iran-backed militia groups from conducting or supporting further
attacks on United States personnel and facilities.

I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to
protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in
furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief
and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations.  The
United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent
with international law and in the exercise of the United States’
inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action,
as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.

I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.  

                             Sincerely,   
  
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
