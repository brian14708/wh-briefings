title: "FACT SHEET: As President\_Biden Announces Historic Transportation Investments,\
  \ Extreme House Republicans Try to Slash Infrastructure\_Funding"
---
 
Thanks to President Biden’s leadership, the United States is making
historic investments in infrastructure needs so people and goods can get
where they need to be safely, quickly, and conveniently. Today, the
President is announcing $16.4 billion for passenger rail projects from
his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which makes the largest investment in
passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak.  
  
While the Biden-Harris Administration is trying to make travel faster,
safer and more reliable, House Republicans are trying to make it slower,
harder, and less safe.  
  
House Republicans are turning their backs on their communities—both
urban and rural—and undermining American infrastructure with an
appropriations bill that guts funding for Amtrak and makes draconian
cuts to transportation and infrastructure programs. As outlined in a
[Statement of Administration
Policy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/H.R.-4820-Transportation-Housing-and-Urban-Development-and-Related-Agencies-Appropriations-Act-2024-Final.pdf),
the President would veto this extreme bill that would slash support for
infrastructure in communities across the country, while at the same time
adding billions to the deficit with give-aways to wealthy tax cheats.  
  
Extreme House Republicans’ bill to defund infrastructure is just the
latest example of their brutal cuts that would hurt the American
people—following failed attempts to cut investments in infrastructure

and to
[eliminate](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/19/by-the-numbers-impacts-of-house-republicans-extreme-cr-8-cuts/)
hundreds of border patrol officers and tens of thousands of Head Start
slots for kids. Rather than putting forward these devastating cuts,
House Republicans need to follow the lead of the Senate and get to work
on a bipartisan funding agreement—and act immediately on the
Administration’s supplemental funding requests for urgent national
security and domestic needs.  
  
Extreme House Republicans’ draconian infrastructure defunding bill
would:

-   **Severely reduce Amtrak service and undermine critical maintenance
    work by slashing Amtrak funding by $1 billion.** This reduction in
    funding would require Amtrak to reduce most, if not all,
    long-distance services, reduce certain Northeast Corridor regional
    train frequencies, and reduce or defer nearly 400 capital projects
    across the country. The Northeast Corridor is the most heavily
    traveled rail corridor in the United States, supporting 800,000
    trips per day in a region that represents 20 percent of U.S. Gross
    Domestic Product.  
-   **Cut transit programs across the country with an 85% cut to** **the
    Capital Investment Grant program.** This critical program funds
    projects that provide transformative benefits for communities across
    the Nation by expanding convenient and accessible transportation
    options—while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving
    air quality.  
-   **Fail to make critical investments in improving the safety and
    efficiency of the Nation’s airspace,** including by funding National
    Airspace System technology $500 million below the President’s Budget
    request, risking increased delays and cancellations due to outages
    and lost opportunities to improve safety.  
-   **Cut aviation research funding by over 20 percent**, which would
    undermine the Federal Aviation Administration’s ability to promote
    innovations that would lower noise and emissions, improve
    efficiency, and help the industry keep flight costs under control.

The same extreme bill includes deep cuts to housing programs, which
would:

-   **Result in 20,000 fewer affordable homes being constructed,
    rehabbed, or purchased** in communities across the Nation due to a
    nearly 70% cut to the HOME Investment Partnerships Program at the
    Department of Housing and Urban Development.
-   **Put 78,000 children at greater risk of lead exposure** due a
    rescission of over $564 million for programs that mitigate
    housing-related risks of lead poisoning and other illnesses and
    hazards to lower income families, especially children.
