President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel to welcome the deal for the release of at least 50
hostages held by Hamas.  The two leaders discussed the pause in the
fighting, which will allow for surging in much needed humanitarian
assistance into Gaza.  The Prime Minister thanked the President for his
tireless efforts, and those of his team,  to help broker this deal.  The
two leaders agreed that the work is not yet done and the President
assured the Prime Minister that he will continue working to secure the
release of all remaining hostages.  The President further emphasized the
importance of maintaining calm along the Lebanese border as well as in
the West Bank.  The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact
directly and through their teams over the coming days.
