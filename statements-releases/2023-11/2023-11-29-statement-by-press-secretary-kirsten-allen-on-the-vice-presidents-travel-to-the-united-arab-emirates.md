Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Dubai, the United Arab
Emirates from December 1 to December 2 to attend the 28th Conference of
the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28).
Throughout her engagements, the Vice President will underscore the
Biden-Harris Administration’s success in delivering on the most
ambitious climate agenda in history, both at home and abroad. The Vice
President will be joined by dozens of senior U.S. officials representing
more than 20 U.S. departments and agencies. The Vice President’s
participation in COP28 will continue the Biden-Harris Administration’s
leadership on bold, global action to address the climate crisis, advance
U.S. climate goals, and help ensure a strong outcome at COP28. The
Biden-Harris Administration appreciates the work of the UAE and
President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed in organizing this critical global
event.
