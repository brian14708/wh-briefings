title: "Statement from President\_Biden Marking Five Years Since the Thousand Oaks\_\
  Shooting"
---
 
Five years ago today, twelve people lost their lives at a College Night
in Thousand Oaks, California, in an act of senseless gun violence. In
mere moments, a lone gunman armed with high-capacity magazines caused
untold pain for survivors and family members whose lives will never be
the same.   
   
No family or community should ever have to go through what the Thousand
Oaks community did that night. Yet, in the years since—from Lewiston to
Highland Park, Buffalo to Uvalde, Monterey Park to El Paso, and
thousands of communities impacted by daily acts of gun violence that do
not make national headlines—our country has been devastated by an
epidemic of gun violence again and again.   
   
I am doing everything in my power as President to end the scourge of gun
violence. Through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act — the most
meaningful gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years — through dozens of
executive actions, through the creation of the first-ever White House
Office of Gun Violence Prevention, I am taking every action that I can
to save lives. I’ve also continued to call on Republicans in Congress to
help pass commonsense gun safety policies – like banning assault weapons
and high-capacity magazines, and much more – that we know can save
lives.   
   
Today, our hearts are with all the victims and survivors of the Thousand
Oaks attack, and those who are grieving the loved ones they lost five
years ago. May we honor their memories by turning our heartbreak into
action and ending our nation’s gun violence epidemic once and for all.
