$16.4 Billion from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to Repair and Replace
Critical Rail Infrastructure Along Northeast Corridor to Provide Faster
and More Reliable Passenger Rail Experience, Create More than One
Hundred Thousand Construction Jobs

Bidenomics and President Biden’s Investing in America agenda are
tackling long-standing infrastructure needs, supporting communities
nationwide, and making it possible to get people and goods where they
need to be safely, quickly, and conveniently. The President’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in passenger rail since
the creation of Amtrak, with a $66 billion total investment in rail.
Today, President Biden is announcing $16.4 billion in new funding for 25
passenger rail projects on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor, moving the
United States closer to his vision for world-class passenger rail.  The
investments announced today will rebuild tunnels and bridges that are
over 100 years old; upgrade tracks, power systems, signals, stations,
and other infrastructure; and, advance future projects to significantly
improve travel times by increasing operating speeds and reducing delays.
Combined with Amtrak’s nearly $9 billion fleet replacement program,
which will replace over 1,000 locomotives and coaches with state-of-the
art and Made-in-America equipment, these investments will ensure that
train service is more convenient and climate-friendly than either
driving or flying. The funding will also contribute to more than 100,000
good-paying union jobs in construction. President Biden will travel to
Bear, Delaware to make the announcement.

The Northeast Corridor, running from Boston, MA, to Washington, DC, is
the most heavily traveled rail corridor in the United States, supporting
800,000 trips per day in a region that represents 20 percent of U.S.
Gross Domestic Product. The trains carry five times more passengers than
all flights between Washington and New York. Amtrak trains on the
Northeast Corridor also emit up to 83% less greenhouse gas emissions
compared to car travel and up to 72% less greenhouse gas emissions than
flying. If the Northeast Corridor shut down for a single day, it would
cost the economy $100 million in lost productivity. Despite its
importance, the Corridor hasn’t seen major investment in generations.
The Northeast Corridor that exists today is the product of investments
that date back to the 1830s, and many of the existing bridges and
tunnels were built in the early twentieth century. Thanks to the
President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Northeast Corridor is
finally on track to be rebuilt to meet the needs of 21<sup>st</sup>
century travelers.

Today’s $16.4 billion announcement is through the Federal Railroad
Administration’s Federal State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail
grant program, and reflects nearly $9 billion in FY 2022 and FY 2023
funds and $7.4 billion in future commitments through phased funding
agreements.  
  
Major awarded projects include:

**Gateway Hudson River Tunnel (NY/NJ)** will receive **$3.8 billion** in
a phased funding agreement to rehabilitate and expand the Hudson River
Tunnel between New York and New Jersey, which is over 100 years old,
serves 200,000 passengers daily, and was damaged by Superstorm Sandy.
The overall Gateway Hudson River Tunnel project will improve resiliency,
reliability, and redundancy for New Jersey Transit (NJ Transit) and
Amtrak passengers traveling on the Northeast Corridor between New York
and New Jersey. Combined with other investments, the total Biden
Administration commitment to the tunnel project will be a record **$11
billion**. President Biden visited this project in January to announce a
$292 million DOT MEGA program grant for the Hudson Yards Concrete
Casing, which supports the critical connection between the new Hudson
River Tunnel and New York Penn Station. In June, the Hudson Tunnel
Project received a $25 million grant through DOT’s RAISE program to
support construction of the new tunnel portal through the Tonnelle
Avenue Bridge and utility relocation project in North Bergen, NJ. On
Friday, Administration officials participated in a groundbreaking to
officially begin construction on the New York side of the tunnel. The
Hudson Tunnel Project is a critical component of the Gateway Program — a
comprehensive rail investment program that will improve commuter and
intercity services, add needed resiliency and create new capacity for
the busiest section of the Northeast Corridor. The project is critical
to the northeast regional economy — not only will the project generate
$19 billion in economic activity over the Project’s construction period,
addressing this critical chokepoint on the Northeast Corridor supports
the $50 billion that workers riding on the NEC contribute to the economy
annually.

-   **Frederick Douglass Tunnel (MD)** will receive **$4.7 billion** in
    a phased funding agreement to replace the 150-year-old Baltimore and
    Potomac Tunnel, increasing speeds from 30 mph to 110 mph and
    reducing delays on the entire Northeast Corridor. The tunnel’s tight
    curvature and steep incline requires trains to reduce speeds to 30
    mph. These issues create chronic delays — more than 10% of weekday
    trains are delayed, and delays occur on 99% of weekdays. The tunnel
    is the largest Northeast Corridor bottleneck between Washington and
    New Jersey and a single point of failure for the roughly 24,000
    Amtrak and Maryland Area Commuter (MARC) passengers who rely on it
    daily. The President visited this project in January to announce the
    signing of a project kickoff agreement between Amtrak and the State
    of Maryland and a Project Labor Agreement between Amtrak and the
    Baltimore-DC Building and Construction Trades Council. Initial
    construction began in March of this year, and Amtrak recently
    awarded a contract for construction on the southern approach.  
-   **Susquehanna River Bridge (MD)** will receive **$2.1 billion** in a
    phased funding agreement to replace an existing 100-year-old rail
    bridge with two new two-track spans that will allow speeds to
    increase from 90 mph to 125 mph, and improve reliability and trip
    times. Amtrak, the MARC rail and Norfolk Southern Railway use the
    bridge to transport both passengers and freight and therefore
    experiences a high volume of rail traffic. Roughly 19,000 passengers
    travel over the existing bridge every weekday. As part of this
    replacement project, the existing movable bridge will be replaced
    with high-level fixed bridges, which will also improve navigation
    for boats on the Susquehanna River.  
-   **Penn Station Access (NY)** will receive **$1.6 billion** in a
    phased funding agreement to repair and rehabilitate 19 miles of the
    Amtrak-owned Hell Gate Line, including tracks, bridges, and signals.
    The project will introduce Metro-North service to Penn Station,
    increase Amtrak service, and the cut local transit travel time from
    the Bronx to Manhattan by as much as 50 minutes. In addition to
    reducing travel times, New York MTA’s investment will create four
    new fully ADA-accessible rail stations, and the added service and
    reduced travel times will have significant benefits for low-income
    communities in the Bronx. This project is in active construction as
    of 2023.  
-   The **Connecticut River Bridge (CT)** will receive **$827 million**
    to replace a 116-year-old bridge with a new modern, resilient
    movable bridge. Replacing the existing structure will increase
    reliability and safety, and rail speeds on the bridge will increase
    from 45 mph to 70 mph. This project is fully designed and set to
    begin construction in 2024.

Two planning studies are also included in the investment: one to examine
opportunities to increase speeds and reduce travel time between
Washington, D.C. and New York City, and one to study future
infrastructure options to improve speed, resilience, performance, and
capacity to support faster trains traveling on the Northeast Corridor
through Connecticut and Rhode Island.

Each new awarded project – from the Frederick Douglass Tunnel to the
Connecticut River Bridge – will improve travel times by addressing the
delays associated with the constant maintenance and repair of old
Northeast Corridor infrastructure. These delays are estimated to result
in almost 245,000 train delay minutes annually, and the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law funding will support replacing infrastructure that
could result in almost 110,000 delay minutes saved annually.

***Creating Good-Paying Union Jobs  
***  
Across all Northeast Corridor projects, an agreement is in place between
Amtrak and North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) that ensures
Amtrak’s large civil engineering construction projects will be performed
under a collective bargaining agreement that addresses points such as
wages, benefits, working conditions, and promoting diversity and veteran
hiring in the construction trades. With this agreement, Amtrak and NABTU
will promote a strong workforce pipeline to prevent work disruptions;
contractors and subcontractors share Amtrak’s commitment to paying fair
wages and benefits; and Amtrak and NABTU can move forward with
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded projects with efficient
labor-management relations.

Amtrak expects the Hudson River Tunnel project will result in 72,000
direct and indirect jobs during construction with union partnerships for
job training. The Frederick Douglas Tunnel program is expected to
generate 30,000 direct and indirect jobs, including approximately 20,000
construction jobs. Amtrak is investing more than $50 million in local
workforce development and community investments, including
pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs to ensure that local
workers in West Baltimore can access these jobs.

***Progress for Other Rail Investments  
***  
After waiting years for new federal funding, 2023 is the year in which
major rail and transit projects across the country are moving forward.

Today’s investment follows major investments in rail safety through
track improvements, bridge rehabilitations, fewer grade crossings,
upgrades on routes carrying hazardous materials, and enhanced
multi-modal connections to keep people living near, working on, and who
travel along America’s rail lines safer:

-    Last month, [FRA announced more than **$1.4 billion** from
    President Biden’s Bipartisan infrastructure
    law](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-14-billion-infrastructure-funding-70-projects)
    for 70 rail improvement projects in 35 states and Washington, D.C.
    This is the largest amount ever awarded for rail safety and rail
    supply chain upgrades through the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure
    and Safety Improvements — or CRISI — program. This popular program
    has quadrupled since the President signed the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. While the majority of selected projects support
    freight rail safety and supply chains, CRISI investments are also
    laying the groundwork to expand world-class passenger rail to more
    communities nationwide. For example, investments in Virginia will
    result in two new Amtrak round trips and three new commuter rail
    round trips on the RF&P corridor between Washington, D.C., and
    Richmond, VA — a critical link between Northeast and Southeast
    states — while also improving the fluidity of CSX’s freight network.
    In California, two additional daily round trips will be added to the
    Capitol Corridor between the cities of Sacramento and Roseville, and
    a project eliminating grade crossings in the Central Valley will
    bring high-speed rail one step closer to becoming a reality. At
    least $376 million, or 25 percent of the amounts appropriated, was
    made available for projects in rural areas. In addition to improving
    passenger rail service, the CRISI program provides funding to
    further develop workforce and industry in America around rail. For
    example, Amtrak will receive up to $8.8 million for a pilot
    apprenticeship training program to recruit and train new track
    foremen and inspectors in Pennsylvania.    
-   In June, FRA announced $570 million for 63 projects in 32 states
    under the new Railroad Crossing Elimination Program, or RCE, created
    by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This inaugural
    round of funding will address more than 400 at-grade crossings
    nationwide, improve safety, and make it easier to get around
    railroad tracks by adding grade separations, closing at-grade
    crossings, and improving existing at-grade crossings where train
    tracks and roads intersect. Over each of the next four years,
    additional RCE Program funding will be made available annually.
    Project selections for other grant programs that will improve
    freight rail safety and efficiency, strengthen supply chains, and
    expand the passenger rail network — representing billions of dollars
    in infrastructure law investments — will be announced in the coming
    months.  
-   In 2022, the Biden Administration [announced $233 million in
    grants](https://railroads.dot.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-administration-usdot-announce-over-233-million-grants-upgrade-0)
    to upgrade intercity passenger rail service across the country
    through the Federal-State Partnership for State of Good Repair
    Program. These investments will help replace bridges and tunnels
    along the Northeast Corridor, many of which are over 100 years old.
    Grants were also awarded to improve rail infrastructure in
    California, Michigan, and improving Chicago Union Station.   
-   On November 30, 2022, the Federal Railroad Administration granted
    $4.3 billion to Amtrak, which represents the first year of the $22
    billion in direct funding to Amtrak provided in the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. Amtrak is using these funds to modernize the
    intercity passenger rail network, modernize and increase
    accessibility at more than 280 Amtrak-served stations across the
    country, and replace Amtrak’s existing fleet of over 1,000 railcars
    and locomotives with accessible, comfortable, state-of-the-art
    equipment. Portions of the new fleet will enter service in 2023, and
    over 525 new railcars and locomotives will begin service by the end
    of the decade. Amtrak debuted the design of the [new “Airo”
    railcars](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amtrak.com%2Famtrak-airo&data=05%7C01%7Ckathryn.thomson%40dot.gov%7C99f1440f93f54969721f08db0192c8d1%7Cc4cd245b44f04395a1aa3848d258f78b%7C0%7C0%7C638105502169805582%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=OYKN770qsZSPNYU6zx2LDzN4rLzIAKrNUjRa%2BP4wuf0%3D&reserved=0)
    in late 2022. In fiscal year 2023 alone, Amtrak has invested nearly
    $3 billion in 750 projects across the country. By the end of 2023,
    15 Amtrak stations will have been brought to full ADA compliance,
    with 25 more upgraded with passenger information display stations.
    Through these investments, Amtrak has created nearly 5,000 jobs,
    including employing over 4,000 union workers.  
-   Later this year, FRA will award billions from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law for intercity passenger rail projects across the
    country under the Fed-State Partnership National Program. High-speed
    rail projects are eligible for funding from this program.
