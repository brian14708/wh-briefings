---
 
Today we saw more progress bringing down inflation while maintaining one
of the strongest job markets in history. At 3.2%, annual inflation is
now down by 65% from the peak. Gas prices are below $3.40 per gallon,
reflecting an average decline of $1.65 from the peak after Putin’s
invasion of Ukraine. Inflation has come down while the unemployment rate
has been below 4% for 21 months in a row—the longest stretch in more
than 50 years—while wages, wealth, and the share of working-age
Americans with jobs are all higher now than before the pandemic. I’m
working to get results for the American people and it’s happening—and
I’m not going to let up for one second. I’m fighting every single day to
continue lowering costs for hardworking families so they have more
breathing room—from eliminating costly junk fees on air fares and event
tickets, to cutting prescription drug costs and health care premiums, to
reducing energy costs. Instead of joining me, Congressional Republicans
are fighting to slash taxes for the wealthy and big corporations, while
standing with Big Pharma and other special interests to try to block us
from bringing down everyday costs for American families. I won’t let
them.
