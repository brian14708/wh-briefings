President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of
Japan in San Francisco today to discuss global and regional security
issues and to advance bilateral security and economic cooperation. 

The two leaders condemned Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism,
reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend itself, and called for adherence to
international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians.
They agreed to work together on delivering urgent life-saving assistance
to civilians in Gaza and committed to continue close diplomatic
coordination to prevent the conflict from spreading and to work toward a
political solution and durable peace. 

Both leaders underscored their resolve to continue supporting Ukraine to
ensure it emerges from its war against Russia as a democratic,
independent, sovereign, and secure nation that can deter and defend
itself against future aggression. They reaffirmed the importance of
maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the Korean
Peninsula, and the East and South China Seas. The leaders also discussed
their respective diplomacy with the People’s Republic of China and
committed to continue close coordination. 

Recognizing the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan backed by the
full range of U.S. capabilities, the leaders resolved to work together
closely to address shared challenges and advance their vision for a free
and open Indo-Pacific. Building on the historic Camp David Trilateral
Summit in August, they agreed to accelerate trilateral cooperation with
the Republic of Korea in all areas. They also highlighted increasing
economic cooperation, and welcomed significant progress on the
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and the second
meeting of the U.S.-Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee
(“Economic 2+2”).
