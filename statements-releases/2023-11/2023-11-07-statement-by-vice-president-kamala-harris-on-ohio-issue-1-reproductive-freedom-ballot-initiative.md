title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Ohio Issue 1 Reproductive Freedom\
  \ Ballot\_Initiative"
---
 
Today, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to protect a
woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. Voters turned out to
safeguard reproductive rights and prevent extremists from enforcing an
abortion ban that would harm women and criminalize doctors.  
  
The results in Ohio underscore what the vast majority of Americans
believe: politicians should not interfere in decisions that should be
between a woman and her doctor. Since the Supreme Court’s decision to
overturn *Roe v. Wade*, people across the country have voted to defend
reproductive freedom every time it has appeared on the ballot –
including in Kansas, California, Michigan, Montana, Kentucky, and
Vermont.  
  
While President Biden and I are working to protect reproductive freedom,
extremists are pushing for a national abortion ban that would
criminalize reproductive health care in every single state in our
Nation.  
  
It is past time for Congress to listen to the American people and pass a
bill that restores the protections of *Roe v. Wade*. And when they do,
President Biden will sign it into law.
