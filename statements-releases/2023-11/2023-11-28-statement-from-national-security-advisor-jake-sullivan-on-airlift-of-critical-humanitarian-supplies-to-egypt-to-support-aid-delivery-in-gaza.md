title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Airlift of Critical\
  \ Humanitarian Supplies to Egypt to Support Aid Delivery in\_Gaza"
---
 
Today, the United States airlifted over 54,000 pounds of medical items
and food aid to the humanitarian logistics hub in Egypt for delivery for
civilians in Gaza. This was the first of three planned deliveries in the
coming days. These UN supplies will save lives and alleviate the
suffering of thousands in Gaza.  We are grateful to the Government of
Egypt for its support of these deliveries and broader efforts to ensure
humanitarian supplies reach Palestinians in need.

Over the past seven weeks, the United States has worked around the clock
to address the acute humanitarian needs facing civilians in Gaza. Since
October 21, thanks to a deal President Biden helped broker, we have
worked with our partners in the region and international organizations
to ramp up humanitarian assistance, with more than 2,000 trucks
delivering aid, including food, water, medical and shelter supplies, and
fuel. The ongoing humanitarian pause has enabled the international
community to surge significant additional assistance as part of that
effort, providing urgently needed relief to civilians in Gaza. 

The humanitarian needs in Gaza demand that the international community
do much more.  The United States is committed to this effort. In the
coming days and weeks, President Biden and other senior members of the
Administration will continue to work to sustain and expand the
international humanitarian response and rally the international
community to urgently increase support to the UN Flash Appeal for Gaza.
