---
 
Today, President Biden welcomed President Joko Widodo of Indonesia to
the White House.  Marking a historic new phase in our bilateral
relations, the two leaders elevated U.S.-Indonesia ties to a
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.  President Biden and President
Widodo celebrated this unprecedented level of cooperation, built on
shared values of democracy and pluralism, by announcing new initiatives
to deliver a better future for our citizens and a free, open,
prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific.

President Biden thanked President Widodo for Indonesia’s leadership of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and underscored the
U.S. commitment to deepening our cooperation in Southeast Asia and with
Indonesia.  Since 2002, the United States has provided over $6.2 billion
in development, economic, health, and security assistance to Indonesia,
which includes more than $2 billion to advance education and health
outcomes and over $1.2 billion to promote economic growth.
 Additionally, President Biden has requested a further $172 million in
new programs across a range of sectors, including climate and the clean
energy transition, economic growth, and health.

**FURTHERING OUR ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP ON SHARED PROSPERITY**  
  
The United States and Indonesia have long been partners in advancing
prosperity for our citizens and those across the Indo-Pacific, including
through Indonesia’s leadership in the G20, U.S leadership as the 2023
chair of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, collaboration on
quality investments through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure
and Investment (PGI), the Indonesia Infrastructure and Finance Compact
between the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Government of
Indonesia, and the United States and Indonesia’s cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity.  As part of the two
leaders’ commitment to upgrade bilateral ties, President Biden intends
to announce the following programs to promote inclusive economic
prosperity through investments in critical and emerging technologies;
micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises; and sustainable
development. 

-   **<u>Diversifying the Global Semiconductor Ecosystem</u>:** The
    United States and Indonesia intend to partner to create a more
    resilient, secure, and sustainable global semiconductor value chain,
    beginning with a review of Indonesia’s current semiconductor
    ecosystem, regulatory framework, and workforce and infrastructure
    needs to inform our collaboration on developing this critical
    sector.  The United States also intends to partner with industry
    associations to lead U.S. semiconductor company trade delegations to
    Indonesia.         
-   **<u>Increasing Digital Connectivity in Rural Indonesia</u>**:  The
    U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will support a grant for
    Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Informatics (Kominfo) to
    assess the commercial and technical viability of deploying open
    radio access network (Open RAN) technology to provide digital
    connectivity for approximately 1,621 unserved villages across
    Indonesia.  
-   **<u>Investing in Indonesia’s Emerging Enterprises</u>: ** The U.S.
    International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) will provide
    $131 million in new financing to:
    -   Advance financial inclusion and economic growth through a loan
        guaranty to Bank Sampoerna to support its lending to micro-,
        small-, and medium-sized enterprises; and
    -   Provide a direct loan to expand Amartha Nusantara Raya’s
        microfinance lending to entrepreneurs in rural villages in
        Indonesia, specifically targeted to women-owned and
        women-operated businesses.  
-   **<u>Launching a U.S.-Indonesia Tourism Partnership</u>**:  The U.S.
    Department of Commerce intends to partner with Indonesia on a new
    initiative with tourism stakeholders to further strengthen travel
    and tourism between our two countries, especially in areas of
    business, education, and leisure.  
-   **<u>Harnessing U.S. Private Sector Investments</u>**:  The
    Government of Indonesia plans to partner with ExxonMobil on an
    investment of up to $15 billion to boost industrial growth and
    promote decarbonization in Indonesia and potentially across the
    Indo-Pacific, including a joint assessment by ExxonMobil and
    Pertamina of the potential for a carbon sequestration hub deep
    underground in the Java Sea, which could hold at least three billion
    metric tons of carbon dioxide.    

**LEADING ACTION TO COMBAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS**  
  
President Biden reiterated his commitment to partnering with Indonesia
on tackling the climate crisis and ensuring the United States and
Indonesia are at the forefront of harnessing the clean energy
transition.  Indonesia and the United States will continue to closely
collaborate on the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), announced
at the 2022 G20 Summit in Bali, which will reduce emissions and
accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in Indonesia.  The JETP
mobilizes $20 billion in public and private financing in support of
Indonesia’s ambitious climate commitments under the agreement.  Building
on JETP, PGI, and the $50 million U.S. commitment to Indonesia’s Forest
and Other Land Uses (FOLU) Net Sink Bilateral Partnership, President
Biden intends to announce the following new climate programs:

-   **<u>Partnering on Sustainable Energy and Minerals</u>: ** President
    Biden will announce a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the
    U.S. Department of State and Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and
    Mineral Resources on sustainable energy and mineral development. 
    The MOU advances technical cooperation on enabling environments and
    regulatory frameworks to help increase the uptake of renewable
    energy resources, enhance grid resiliency and security, improve
    technologies for responsible mining and minerals processing, and
    support Indonesia’s development of a lower-emissions critical
    mineral sector, supporting the objectives of the JETP.

    partner with Indonesia’s national utility PLN on a feasibility study
    for renewable energy mini-grids in five remote sites in eastern
    Indonesia.  This JETP project develops a replication strategy for
    wider renewable mini-grid implementation across the region and will
    be conducted by U.S. company TQ Automation in public-private
    partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy’s national labs under
    the Net Zero World Initiative.          
-   **<u>Advancing Clean Energy Transition Planning</u>**:The U.S.
    Agency for International Development (USAID) supports Indonesia’s
    national utility in developing its energy transition plan.  The U.S.
    Department of Energy plans to work with Indonesia through the Net
    Zero World Initiative to evaluate coal phaseout scenarios, renewable
    energy pricing, and electrification modeling.  Both efforts aim to
    accelerate integrating new, renewable energy sources and supporting
    policy reforms under the JETP Comprehensive Investment and Policy
    Plan.  
-   **<u>Promoting Carbon Capture and Storage</u>**:  The U.S.
    Commercial Law Development Program and the Indonesia Carbon Capture
    and Storage Center have partnered on a bilateral workplan to
    identify draft legislation and regulation to advance the carbon
    capture and storage sector.  In September, Indonesia became the
    first Southeast Asian country to announce its intent to join the
    global Carbon Management Challenge, which aims to accelerate carbon
    capture, removal, use, and storage technologies.   
-   **<u>Enhancing Power Connectivity within ASEAN</u>**:  USTDA plans
    to support a cross-border interconnections feasibility study to
    support two priority grid interconnection projects between Indonesia
    and Malaysia.  The feasibility study helps to better utilize
    renewable energy resources and implement policies to advance clean
    energy and climate protection goals across ASEAN, in line with JETP
    goals.  This project builds on the USAID-funded ASEAN
    Interconnection Master Plan Study in support of the ASEAN Power
    Grid.  
-   **<u>Strengthening Air Quality in Southeast Asia</u>**:  The United
    States intends to further advance a partnership with the World
    Resources Institute that strengthens Indonesia’s national capacity
    to manage air quality and reduce air pollution.  Additional funding
    fosters further collaboration with regional partners Malaysia and
    the Philippines through USAID’s Clean Air Catalyst Program.  
-   **<u>Exploring Clean Energy Alternatives for Industrial
    Growth</u>**: The U.S. Department of Energy and Indonesia’s Ministry
    of Energy and Mineral Resources intend to partner through the Net
    Zero World Initiative on a roadmap that identifies viable clean
    energy alternatives to captive coal-powered industrial growth.  The
    roadmap encourages the creation of clean, high-value battery,
    semi-conductor, and nickel supply chains that meet world-class
    environmental and labor standards, in line with JETP goals.    
-   **<u>Expanding our Waste Management Partnership</u>**:  USAID
    intends to provide an additional $7.5 million to expand the SELARAS
    waste management program to at least 14 additional municipalities in
    Indonesia.  The additional funding strengthens sector governance and
    financing, improves service delivery, and expands methane reduction
    capabilities.  
-   **<u>Investing in Smart, Sustainable Development in Nusantara:</u>**
    Building upon USAID technical assistance to develop smart building
    guidelines and green space management, USTDA and the U.S. Department
    of Commerce plan to fund an Indonesian trade mission to the United
    States and a U.S. business development mission to Indonesia to
    discuss best practices as Indonesia plans its new capital city.

**ADVANCING REGIONAL STABILITY THROUGH DEEPENED SECURITY COOPERATION  
**  
The United States and Indonesia are united by a shared commitment to
ASEAN centrality and the common principles in the ASEAN Outlook on the
Indo-Pacific and the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy.  President Biden
announced new opportunities to advance our collective security through: 

-   **<u>Expanding Cybersecurity Cooperation</u>**:  The United States
    and Indonesia plan to announce their intent to upgrade bilateral
    cybersecurity cooperation through an MOU focused on countering
    threats from malicious state and non-state actors that threaten our
    nations, while also creating a conducive environment for leading
    technology, energy, and financial firms in Indonesia.     
-   **<u>Bolstering Maritime Security</u>**:  Through a joint Work Plan
    on Maritime Security, the United States and Indonesia plan to
    mobilize more than $5 million in assistance to enhance Indonesia’s
    maritime domain awareness and at-sea enforcement, as well as $3
    million for the launch of the U.S.-funded Maritime Training Center
    in Batam.   
-   **<u>Strengthening Defense Cooperation</u>**:The United States and
    Indonesia intend to sign a new Defense Cooperation Arrangement that
    broadens and deepens cooperation in defense professionalization;
    cyber; military medicine; space; combined exercises; recovery of
    prisoner of war/missing in action remains; and countering chemical,
    biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.     
-   **<u>Enhancing our Counterterrorism Cooperation</u>**:  With the aim
    to increase information sharing on terrorist threats, the United
    States and Indonesia intend to extend and enhance our existing MOU
    on counterterrorism cooperation in order to exchange best practices,
    prevent and counter violent extremism, and advance capacity building
    on border and aviation security.    

**INVESTING IN A NEW ERA OF ENDURING PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE TIES
