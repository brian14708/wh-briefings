title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden and First Lady Jill\_Biden on the Passing\
  \ of Former First Lady Rosalynn\_Carter"
---
 
First Lady Rosalynn Carter walked her own path, inspiring a nation and
the world along the way.

Throughout her incredible life as First Lady of Georgia and the First
Lady of the United States, Rosalynn did so much to address many of
society’s greatest needs. She was a champion for equal rights and
opportunities for women and girls; an advocate for mental health and
wellness for every person; and a supporter of the often unseen and
uncompensated caregivers of our children, aging loved ones, and people
with disabilities. 

Above all, the deep love shared between Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter is the
definition of partnership, and their humble leadership is the definition
of patriotism.  She lived her life by her faith. 

Time and time again, during the more than four decades of our friendship
– through rigors of campaigns, through the darkness of deep and profound
loss – we always felt the hope, warmth, and optimism of Rosalynn Carter.
She will always be in our hearts.

On behalf of a grateful nation, we send our love to President Carter,
the entire Carter family, and the countless people across our nation and
the world whose lives are better, fuller, and brighter because of the
life and legacy of Rosalynn Carter.

May God bless our dear friend.

May God bless a great American.
