title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with RSV Immunization Manufacturers"
---
 
On Monday, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials met with
suppliers to discuss the manufacturing, distribution, and accessibility
of RSV immunizations through the private market. Senior administration
officials underscored the importance of manufacturers such as Sanofi and
AstraZeneca working to meet demand with a sense of urgency as we head
into the winter season. During the meeting, manufacturers and senior
administration officials also agreed on proactive planning now to meet
next year’s projected demand for immunizations.   
   
Monday’s meeting follows numerous in-person and virtual meetings to seek
ways manufacturers can make more RSV immunizations available for
infants. As a result, manufacturers earlier this month committed to
producing tens of thousands of additional RSV immunizations for infants
and confirmed that all of the [additional 77,000
doses](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p1116-rsv-doses.html) have been
released.     
   
The Biden-Harris Administration continues to prioritize access to safe
and effective vaccines for all Americans who want to protect themselves
and their loved ones from preventable illness. CDC’s Vaccines for
Children program provides vaccines to half of America’s children and
senior administration officials will continue to work directly with
distributors and manufacturers to make sure the RSV immunization, flu
vaccine, and updated COVID-19 vaccine are available to all families,
with a particular focus on our most vulnerable communities, including
infants.
