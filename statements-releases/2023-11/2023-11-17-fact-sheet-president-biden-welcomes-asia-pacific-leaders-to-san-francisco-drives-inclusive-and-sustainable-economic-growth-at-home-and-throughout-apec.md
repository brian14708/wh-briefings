  \ Drives Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth at Home and Throughout\_APEC"
---
 
This week, President Biden welcomed government and business leaders from
across the Asia-Pacific to San Francisco, California, for APEC Economic
Leaders’ Week. President Biden highlighted how his efforts to grow the
U.S. economy from the bottom up and the middle out have made the United
States the preeminent driver of inclusive and sustainable economic
growth in the Asia-Pacific and are delivering results for American
workers and families. Across the events of the week, President Biden
took steps to deepen U.S. economic ties with key regional partners,
support workers’ rights around the world, and advance his agenda for a
more innovative, interconnected, and inclusive Asia-Pacific region.

**Driving Regional Growth and Dynamism**  
  
The United States is the world’s leading global economy and an engine of
growth and dynamism across the Asia-Pacific region.  Since the President
took office, we’ve created 14 million jobs here at home—and more jobs in
the first two years than any President in a four-year term. The United
States has had 21 straight months of unemployment under 4 percent, for
the first time in over half a century, and the economy grew by 4.9
percent in the third quarter of this year.  Our strong economy is
driving inclusive and sustainable growth across the Asia-Pacific and
catalyzing historic investment from the Asia-Pacific to support growth
here at home.

    America](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-nearly-200-billion-of-private-sector-investments-from-the-asia-pacific-into-the-united-states-since-taking-office/). **President
    Biden’s economic policies, combined with deep economic ties with
    Asia-Pacific countries, are driving historic investments into the
    United States across key sectors. Companies based in the
    Asia-Pacific have announced almost **$200 billion** of investments
    into the United States since the start of the Biden-Harris
    Administration, supporting **tens of thousands of **good new jobs
    for American workers.  Asia-Pacific companies have also contributed
    to **one third** of all major clean energy and semiconductors
    investments in the U.S. since the passage of the CHIPS and Science
    Act and Inflation Reduction Act. This week, companies in APEC
    economies announced new investments into the U.S., such as a new
    facility in Michigan to produce batteries for electric transport and
    electrolysers to make green hydrogen, and highlighted recent major
    announcements, including multibillion-dollar semiconductor
    investments to improve U.S. economic resiliency and create thousands
    of jobs.
-   **U.S. Companies are Fueling Dynamism & Inclusive Economic Growth
    Across APEC. **Over the course of the U.S. APEC host year,
    U.S.-based companies represented at the APEC Summit
    announced **[over $50
    billion](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-50b-of-u-s-private-sector-investments-into-apec-economies-as-well-as-private-sector-contributions-to-sustainability-inclusivity-and-resilience/)** in
    new investments into the Asia-Pacific, including nearly $25 billion
    to increase digital connectivity; new subsea cables that will result
    in more than $1 trillion in GDP; 50+ new direct flights per week
    from the United States to APEC economies; significant investments in
    a wide range of sustainability and clean energy technologies; new
    training and opportunities for hundreds of thousands of
    entrepreneurs, underrepresented groups, and small businesses; and
    more than two dozen partnerships between U.S. companies and
    APEC-based universities on cutting edge technology.

**Charting the Next Chapter of Inclusive Regional Growth**

On top of these strong two-way investment flows, President Biden has
pursued a forward-looking economic agenda that strengthens our ties with
partners and supports American workers. Today our partners recognize
that our collective success hinges on building secure supply chains,
harnessing the clean energy and digital transformations, and driving
broadly shared growth. By putting these issues at the top of our agenda,
President Biden has been able to forge new regional partnerships and
deepen bilateral ones.

-   **Securing Key Outcomes Across the Indo-Pacific Economic
    Framework. **A year and a half ago, President Biden launched the
    Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity to work with diverse
    regional partners to advance workers’ rights, facilitate
    high-standard trade and investment, and tackle pressing issues
    facing our countries, including vulnerable supply chains, clean
    energy transitions, and corruption. This week, the
    President [announced](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-in-san-francisco-president-biden-and-13-partners-announce-key-outcomes-to-fuel-inclusive-sustainable-growth-as-part-of-the-indo-pacific-economic-framework-for-prosperity/) that
    the United States and our IPEF partners have negotiated
    first-of-their-kind agreements to achieve these goals, including a
    Supply Chain Agreement that will help partners promote
    diversification and resiliency in their supply chains, a Clean
    Economy Agreement to accelerate IPEF partners’ transitions to
    cleaner economies, and a Fair Economy Agreement that will enhance
    IPEF partners’ efforts to combat corruption and improve tax
    transparency.
-   **Launching Indo-Pacific Specific Initiatives Through the U.S.
    Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI).** To
    scale high-standard investments and create a more resilient economy
    in the United States and in the Indo-Pacific, the United States
    hosted a regional PGI Investor Forum with IPEF governments and the
    U.S. private sector. At the Investor Forum, the United
    States [announced](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-pgi-indo-pacific-economic-framework-for-prosperity-ipef-investor-forum/) new
    transformative investments from the U.S. Government and U.S. private
    sector and launched the PGI IPEF Investment Accelerator to scale
    high-standard project financing to drive sustainable economic growth
    in IPEF countries. Through the Accelerator, the United States and
    IPEF partners will develop a country-tailored investment approach
    targeting key sectors identified by IPEF beneficiaries. The
    Accelerator will focus on high-standard outcomes, including strong
    worker and environmental protections.
-   **Launching the United States’ First Global Labor
    Strategy. **President Biden has also been clear that growth must
    support workers—both in the United States and around the world. This
    week, President
    Biden [signed](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-historic-step-to-advance-worker-empowerment-rights-and-high-labor-standards-globally/) the
    first-ever Presidential Memorandum outlining the Administration’s
    commitment to workers’ rights globally.  In doing so, President
    Biden is directing Federal departments and agencies to advance labor
    rights and worker empowerment in their work abroad, including
    enhancing labor diplomacy and labor engagements through our
    Embassies; aligning our efforts in multilateral forums to pursue
    high labor standards and enhance worker protections and workers’
    right to organize; and ensuring consistent consultation with and
    participation of labor stakeholders in policy development and
    economic engagement.
-   **Launching the Women in the Sustainable Economy (WISE)
    Initiative. **This week at APEC, the Vice
    President [launched](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-women-in-the-sustainable-economy-initiative-totaling-over-900-million-in-commitments/) the
    Women in the Sustainable Economy (WISE) Initiative, with more than
    $900 million in commitments—including over $163 million in U.S.
    government commitments — by governments, private sector companies,
    foundations, and civil society to bolster women’s economic
    participation in green and blue sectors, including clean energy,
    fisheries, recycling, forest management, and environmental
    conservation.  

**Investing in APEC as an Institution**  
  
While APEC has always focused on economic growth, throughout the United
States host year, we have focused on how we grow. Guided by the theme,
“Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All,” the U.S. APEC
Host Year focused on key priorities for future regional growth.

-   **Elevating Inclusivity, Sustainability, Connectivity, and
    Resiliency.  **Under the U.S. Host Year, APEC launched the Manoa
    Agenda for Sustainable and Inclusive Economies focuses on efforts to
    promote green growth and APEC’s work on sustainable economic growth;
    the Digital Pacific Agenda to support the responsible design,
    development, and deployment of emerging digital technologies aimed
    to secure digital access for consumers and businesses; and the Bay
    Area Agenda on Resilient and Inclusive Growth to increase supply
    chain resilience while continuing to integrate the cross-cutting
    concept of inclusion.
-   **Reaching Consensus on the Golden Gate Declaration. **APEC Leaders
    formally adopted this year’s Leaders’ Declaration, “The Golden Gate
    Declaration.” This Declaration reflects consensus from APEC leaders
    and a commitment to work together to keep our markets open, to
    address supply chain disruptions, and to ensure our trade and
    investment benefits all of our people and economies. It reflects a
    commitment to accelerate our efforts toward a clean and just energy
    transition—including tripling renewable energy capacity globally—and
    to cut in half the digital gender divide by 2030. The Declaration
    was issued alongside a companion Chair’s Statement which reflects
    the Leaders’ discussion on Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and other
    geopolitical issues. Read the Golden Gate
    Declaration **[here](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/17/2023-apec-leaders-golden-gate-declaration/)**,
