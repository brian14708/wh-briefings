The United States strongly condemns the DPRK for its launch of a space
launch vehicle (SLV) using ballistic missile technology, which is a
brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions, raises
tensions, and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region
and beyond.  This space launch involved technologies that are directly
related to the DPRK intercontinental ballistic missile program.  The
President and his national security team are assessing the situation in
close coordination with our allies and partners.  We urge all countries
to condemn this launch and call on the DPRK to come to the table for
serious negotiations.  The door has not closed on diplomacy but
Pyongyang must immediately cease its provocative actions and instead
choose engagement.  The United States will take all necessary measures
to ensure the security of the American homeland and the defense of our
Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
