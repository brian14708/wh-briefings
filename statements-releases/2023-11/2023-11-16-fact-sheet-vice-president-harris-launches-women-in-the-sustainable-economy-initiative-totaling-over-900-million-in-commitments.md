title: "Fact Sheet: Vice President Harris Launches Women in the Sustainable Economy\
  \ Initiative, Totaling Over $900 Million in\_Commitments"
---
 
In the 21st century, no economy can get ahead if half of its population
is left behind. In our rapidly modernizing global economy, the
Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring women are prepared
for, and part of, the industries of the future. 

As part of U.S. government efforts to advance the 2023 Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) theme of “Creating a Resilient and
Sustainable Future for All,” Vice President Harris is announcing the
launch of the Women in the Sustainable Economy (WISE) Initiative, which
aims to bolster women’s economic empowerment globally by expanding
access to employment, training, leadership roles, and financial
resources in the industries critical to our future and the future of our
planet. The Vice President is announcing more than $900 million in
commitments by governments, private sector companies, foundations, and
civil society to bolster women’s economic participation in sectors such
as clean energy, fisheries, recycling, forest management, and
environmental conservation. 

This initiative is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment
to advancing women’s economic empowerment at home and around the world.
In line with the U.S. National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality
and the U.S. Strategy on Global Women’s Economic Security, it builds on
the Vice President’s work earlier this year in Ghana, when she announced
$1 billion in investments to advance the economic empowerment of women
globally, including a focus on closing the digital gender divide. In the
past eight months, the Vice President’s leadership has galvanized more
than $2.4 billion in investments to advance the economic status of women
around the world.

Women’s economic opportunities are linked to their ability to control,
access, and use land, energy, and water, which in turn improves
communities’ and economies’ food security and agricultural productivity.
While women grow a majority of food around the world, they are less
likely to own the land they farm and women entrepreneurs are less likely
to have access to capital and markets. By supporting women’s work and
leadership in the sectors critical to the future of our planet, we
promote women’s economic security, and we advance work to address the
causes and effects of climate change and bolster economic prosperity.

The U.S.-led WISE initiative is a public-private partnership that brings
together governments, private sector companies, foundations, and civil
society to bolster women’s economic opportunity through three key
pillars:

1.  ***Promoting well-paying, quality jobs for women*** in energy, land,
    and water use and management by ensuring women have the skills and
    training; access to decent jobs in the formal economy; labor and
    social protections; and other support needed to compete and safely
    work.
2.  ***Supporting women-owned, -led, and -managed businesses*** in
    energy, land, and water use and management through increased access
    to banking and financial services, networks, markets, trade and
    investment opportunities, and technical assistance.
3.  ***Eliminating barriers to women’s economic participation*** in
    energy, land, and water use and management by advancing girls’
    access to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
    education; and addressing barriers that limit equal access to and
    control over assets.

Flagship WISE initiatives seek to:

-   **Improve Economic Opportunities for Women in the Energy Sector**

The [Engendering
Industries ](https://www.usaid.gov/engendering-industries)program, led
by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID),
increases economic opportunities for women in lucrative, higher-paying,
technical and leadership jobs within predominantly male-dominated
sectors—such as water, agriculture, energy, including renewables, and
information and communication technology, among others. The program also
helps build the capacity of organizational leaders to advance gender
equality and women’s empowerment across their organizations, thereby
advancing women’s economic security and increasing organizational
resilience, competitiveness, and business effectiveness.

-   **Increase Women’s Access to Climate Finance**

USAID’s [Climate Gender Equity Fund
(CGEF)](https://www.climatelinks.org/climate-gender-equity-fund), a
public-private partnership, expands financial inclusion for women-led
organizations and businesses focused on advancing sustainable economic
growth by increasing access to climate finance for investment vehicles,
intermediaries, businesses, and community-based organizations in
developing countries. USAID is joined by Amazon, Reckitt, and the Visa
Foundation as founding partners of this first-ever climate finance
facility dedicated to gender-responsive climate action.

-   **Promote Women’s Access to Land Rights**

The Equal Stake in the Soil initiative, led by the United States
Department of State, advances women’s land rights as a foundation for
achieving gender equality and sustainable development, by supporting
coalitions of civil society organizations in legal and policy reform and
social norm change efforts. Established coalitions are linked to [Stand
for Her Land](https://stand4herland.org/), a broader global land rights
campaign.

-   **Strengthen Women’s Inclusion in the Blue Economy**

The [Building Economic Inclusion via the Blue
Economy ](https://grameenfoundation.org/building-economic-inclusion-via-the-blue-economy-beluu/beluu-community-of-practice)initiative,
led by the United States Department of State, provides financial and
technical assistance to pilot or scale projects, products, and services
by women entrepreneurs and young professionals in maritime sectors,
thereby promoting business growth and resilience in the fishing,
agriculture, green business, and tourism markets.

WISE partners are committing more than $900 million in direct
commitments and aligned efforts that will support women’s participation
in the sustainable economy.
