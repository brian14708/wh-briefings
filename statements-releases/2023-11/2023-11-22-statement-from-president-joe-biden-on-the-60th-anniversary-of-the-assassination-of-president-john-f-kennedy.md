title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 60th Anniversary of the Assassination\
  \ of President John F.\_Kennedy"

Sixty years ago today, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, a
defining moment of deep trauma and loss that shocked the soul of our
nation. Millions of Americans still remember exactly where we were when
it happened. I was in college and had just left class, joining other
students glued to the news in silence along with the entire country.  
  
The weeks and months that followed awakened a generation. President
Kennedy had been a war hero, senator, and statesman. He set our nation’s
compass firmly on many of the most consequential issues of the
20<sup>th</sup> century, from civil rights, to voting rights, to equal
pay for women. He led with calm resolve through the most dangerous
moments of the Cold War. And at the dawn of a new decade, he called us
forward to a new frontier, propelling us to the moon and beyond. He
inspired a nation to see public service as a calling.  
  
Like millions, I deeply felt his conviction and dreams for America. His
ideas rhymed with the lessons I’d learned from the nuns at school and
around my father’s kitchen table – that we are each called to do good
works on this earth, to try to make our world a better place in the
service of others. But what stuck with me most was President Kennedy’s
courage, his heroic sense of duty, and his family’s capacity to absorb
profound suffering.

We saw that most clearly with First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, whose grace
and resilience still hold the hearts of the American people, as they did
during that most challenging time in the life of her family and of our
nation. His brother, Robert, was one of my greatest political heroes;
and Teddy was one of my closest friends. His daughter, Caroline, remains
a dear friend as well, along with countless Kennedy family members whom
Jill and I have been privileged to know, and to whom we send our love
and affection on this day of remembrance.

In life and in death, President Kennedy changed the way we saw ourselves
– a country full of youthful hopes and ambition, steeled with the
seasoned strength of a people who’ve overcome profound loss by turning
pain into unyielding purpose. He called us to take history into our own
hands, and to never quit striving to build an America that lives up to
its highest ideals.

On this day, we remember that he saw a nation of light, not darkness; of
honor, not grievance; a place where we are unwilling to postpone the
work that he began and that we all must now carry forward. We remember
the unfulfilled promise of his presidency – not only as a tragedy, but
as an enduring call to action to each do all we can for our country.  
  
May God continue to bless President John F. Kennedy.
