title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Death of American Service\_Members"
---
 
Today, Jill and I mourn the loss of 5 American service members who died
when their aircraft crashed in the Mediterranean Sea during a routine
training mission. Our service members put their lives on the line for
our country every day.  They willingly take risks to keep the American
people safe and secure. And their daily bravery and selflessness is an
enduring testament to what is best in our nation. Jill and I are praying
for the families and friends who have lost a precious loved one—a piece
of their soul. Our entire nation shares their grief. And, during this
weekend when we pause to honor our nation’s veterans, we once
more affirm the sacred obligation we bear to those who volunteer to
serve our nation as well as their families, caregivers, and
survivors.  We pray for the families of all our fallen warriors today
and every day.
