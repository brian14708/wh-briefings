  \ as well as Private Sector Contributions to Sustainability, Inclusivity, and\_\
  Resilience"

Under President Biden’s leadership, the U.S. host year of Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) has demonstrated that the United States is
uniquely positioned to drive sustainable, inclusive, dynamic growth in
one of the most vibrant and economically important regions in the world.

**American businesses are the largest source of foreign direct
investment in APEC economies.** The United States’ strong and resilient
economy remains an indispensable driver of prosperity and innovation
across our partners in the Asia-Pacific. Our public and private sectors
continue to deliver for APEC economies, catalyzing sustainable,
high-quality investments that create good jobs within APEC member
economies as well as in the United States.

**Many of these investments also advance the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment (PGI), President Biden and the G7’s
flagship infrastructure initiative for leveraging the expertise and
financing from the private sector to scale quality investments in low-
and middle-income countries to generate economic growth.**  
  
**Today, U.S. companies represented at the APEC CEO Summit highlighted
and announced <u>over $50 billion of investments into APEC economies in
2023</u>.** This slate of announcements includes:

-   **Nearly $25 billion in additional investments to increase digital
    connectivity and resilience** throughout our region, including **new
    subsea cables—both across the Pacific and within APEC
    economies—**that will result in more than $1 trillion in GDP over
    the next four years, making our economies more interconnected and
    secure.  
-   **50+ new direct flights per week from the United States to APEC**
    **economies** to support increased people-to-people &
    business-to-business ties and trade/shipping; this steep growth in
    flights **marks the largest U.S. airline expansion into the South
    Pacific in history**.  
-   **Significant investments in a wide range of sustainability and
    clean energy technologies**, including carbon sequestration, grid
    decarbonization, and sustainable aviation fuel.  
-   **Trailblazing investments and financings that both drive economic
    growth and advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s values**,
    including an investment in an environmental markets platform that
    includes an employee ownership plan, an investment into a South
    Carolina manufacturing facility to produce generic and high-quality
    drugs for the APEC region, and more.  
-   **Tens of millions invested in—and the launch of multiple new
    platforms dedicated to—cybersecurity and preparedness,**
    particularly for small- and medium-sized businesses.  
-   **New training and opportunities—including seed funds and hands on
    training—for hundreds of thousands** of entrepreneurs,
    underrepresented groups, and small businesses.  
-   **More than two dozen new partnerships between cutting edge U.S.
    companies and APEC-based universities** that will focus on

    supercomputer.

Participating companies—represented by over 200 CEOs and C-Suite
Executives in attendance at the APEC CEO Summit—made announcements
