Israel’s right to defend its citizens and combat terrorism following
Hamas’s horrific attack, and underscored her and President Biden’s focus
on securing the release of hostages being held by Hamas.  The Vice
President emphasized the importance of protecting civilian lives and
respecting international humanitarian law.  She emphasized the
imperative to further increase the delivery of life-saving humanitarian
assistance to civilians in Gaza.  The Vice President also raised the
