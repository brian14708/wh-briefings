  \ Tariq Al\_Said"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with His Majesty Haitham bin
Tariq Al Said, the Sultan of Oman.  The two leaders discussed the latest
developments in Gaza and the importance of sustained humanitarian access
and the importance of protecting civilians, consistent with
international humanitarian law, as Israel responds to Hamas’s heinous
terrorist attack on October 7.  They emphasized the importance of
deterring threats from any state or non-state actor seeking to expand
the conflict and of working towards a durable and sustained peace in the
Middle East, to include the establishment of a Palestinian state.
 President Biden reaffirmed the enduring ties between the United States
and Oman and thanked Sultan Haitham for his personal leadership and
support for the UN-mediated truce in Yemen.  Both leaders committed to
strengthening the longstanding U.S.-Oman bilateral relationship and
seeking new opportunities in trade and investment, security
coordination, and cooperation towards a more prosperous Middle East
region.
