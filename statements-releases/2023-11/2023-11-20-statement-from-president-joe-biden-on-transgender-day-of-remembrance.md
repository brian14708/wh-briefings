title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Transgender Day of\_Remembrance"
---
 
There is no place for hate in America and no one should be discriminated
against simply for being themselves. Today, on Transgender Day of
Remembrance we are reminded that there is more to do meet that promise,
as we grieve the 26 transgender Americans whose lives were taken this
year. While each one of these deaths is a tragedy – the true toll of
those victimized is likely even higher, with the majority of those
targeted being women of color.  
   
It’s unacceptable and it’s why my Administration has taken action to
strengthen the rights, and protect the safety of transgender and all
LGBTQI+ Americans. My Administration ended the ban on transgender
Americans serving our country and I signed historic executive action to
strengthen civil rights protections for all LGBTQI+ Americans. The
Department of Homeland Security, with support from the Department of
Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services, have launched
the LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership that works hand-in-hand with
LGBTQI+ community organizations to provide critical safety resources. We
must never be silent in the face of hate. As we mourn the loss of
transgender Americans taken too soon this year, we must also recommit
ourselves to never stop fighting until all Americans can live free from
discrimination.
