title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Senator Joe\_Manchin"
---
 
For more than forty years – as a state legislator, a Secretary of State,
a Governor, and a Senator – Joe Manchin has dedicated himself to serving
the people of his beloved West Virginia. During my time as Vice
President and now as President, Joe and I have worked together to get
things done for hardworking families. From the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law – which is upgrading America’s aging infrastructure, to the PACT Act
– which is making sure our veterans get the care they deserve, to the
Inflation Reduction Act – which is strengthening our energy security and
lowering prescription drug costs for our seniors, to the most meaningful
gun safety legislation in three decades, we’ve made real progress. I was
also proud when Joe voted to make history and confirm Ketanji Brown
Jackson as the first Black woman to serve on the United States Supreme
Court.  
   
Joe, Gayle, and the entire Manchin family should feel proud of the
Senator’s service to West Virginia and to our country. I look forward to
continuing our work together to get things done for the American people.
