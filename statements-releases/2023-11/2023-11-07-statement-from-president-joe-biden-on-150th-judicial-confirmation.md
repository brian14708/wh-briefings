title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on 150th Judicial\_Confirmation"
---
 
One of the greatest responsibilities a President has is the appointment
of federal judges. These judges—confirmed for life—play an integral part
in our everyday lives. They oversee cases in which workers fight for
safe conditions. They ensure trials are fair and efficient, helping our
criminal justice system function. And they issue rulings on fundamental
rights—from the right to vote to women’s reproductive rights.  
   
Today, we reached an important milestone—the confirmation of 150
life-tenured federal judges since I took office. All of these men and
women are highly qualified, faithful to the rule of law, and dedicated
to the Constitution. They come from professional backgrounds that have
for far too long been underrepresented on the bench—from labor and
immigration attorneys to public defenders and civil rights lawyers. And
they reflect the diversity that is our country’s strength: two-thirds of
those confirmed are women and nearly two-thirds are people of color.  
   
We have more work to do, and I am committed to filling every judicial
vacancy with appointees whose credentials, ability, and impartiality are
beyond question. I extend my sincere thanks to Leader Schumer, Chair
Durbin, and the Senators on both sides of the aisle who have worked in
good faith to help achieve this milestone.
