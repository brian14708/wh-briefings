*New CEA analysis shows that American Rescue Plan support for child care
helped lower child care costs for a typical family with young children
by over $1,200 per child per year*

President Biden and Vice President Harris know that children, their
parents, and the economy are all made stronger through accessible,
affordable, high-quality child care. That’s why from day one, the
Biden-Harris Administration has focused on ways to lower child care
costs for hardworking families and improve wages for child care workers.

The American Rescue Plan’s (ARP) Child Care Stabilization program
delivered historic support to over 225,000 child care programs serving
as many as 10 million children across the country, helping keep their
doors open for millions of working families who rely on them. A [new
report](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Child-Care-Stabilization.pdf)
released by the President’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) provides
evidence of this critical support:

-   **Saved families with young children who rely on paid child care
    approximately $1,250 per child per year** by slowing the rise of
    child care prices.  
-   **Helped hundreds of thousands of women with young children enter or
    re-enter the workforce more quickly,** increasing the labor force
    participation and employment of mothers of young children by an
    additional 3 percentage points.   
-   **Boosted the child care workforce and helped raise the real wages
    of child care workers,** increasing the availability and reliability
    of child care options and ensuring the workers who take care of our
    children receive fairer pay.

Taken together, these investments had a benefit-cost ratio of about 2:1,
meaning the benefits of these funds for the broader economy outweighed
the costs of the investment.

With the end of the Child Care Stabilization program this fall, evidence
of the Child Care Stabilization program’s success makes clear the need
for Congress to deliver further investment in the child care sector.

The President and Vice President have [called on Congress to provide an
additional year of child care stabilization
funding](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/25/fact-sheet-white-house-calls-on-congress-to-support-critical-domestic-needs/#:~:text=As%20Congress%20works%20to%20reach,or%20raise%20costs%20for%20families.)
to help ensure that child care providers can remain afloat. At the same
time, the President and Vice President have called for sustained,
transformative investments to ensure that all families can access
affordable, high-quality child care and all child care workers are
compensated in a way that reflects their value.

As the Department of Treasury made clear in their [2021
report](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/The-Economics-of-Childcare-Supply-09-14-final.pdf)
on the economics of child care supply in the U.S., the child care sector
is a crucial part of the American economy that suffers from chronic
underinvestment, hindering parents’ ability to contribute to our economy
and make a solid living. Simply returning to the pre-pandemic status quo
will hurt families and our economic potential.

**Today, the Department of Health and Human Services is also releasing
new data on the ARP Child Care Stabilization program showing its broad
reach in helping providers in every corner of the country**:

-   All 50 states, Washington, D.C., and four US territories operated
    Child Care Stabilization programs. Nationwide, **providers in over
    96% of counties received aid.  
    **
-   **More than 8 in 10 licensed child care centers nationwide received
    assistance**.  
-   **About 30,000 child care programs in rural counties received aid**,
    helping small businesses and families in some of the places where
    child care was already difficult to come by even prior to the
    pandemic.  
-   **Assistance was provided to child care providers in 98% of
    persistent poverty counties** in most states. These are counties
    where at least 20% of residents have lived in poverty over the past
    30 years.   
-   **Over 44% of programs that received assistance were owned or
    operated by people of color**.  
-   **53% of providers receiving stabilization funds were operating in
    the most racially diverse counties**.

The Child Care Stabilization program was critical to helping child care
centers and family child care providers, which are mostly very small
women-owned businesses, remain open or reopen and keep the child care
workforce, disproportionately women of color, on the payroll. Roughly 87
percent of child care centers reported using stabilization funds to help
pay personnel costs and keep programs staffed while roughly 87 percent
of family child care programs – typically very small businesses
operating out of a home – reported using stabilization funds to help
cover rent or mortgage payments, usually their largest operating
expense.
