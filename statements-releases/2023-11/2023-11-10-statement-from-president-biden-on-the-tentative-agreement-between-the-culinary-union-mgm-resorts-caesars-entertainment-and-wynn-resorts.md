Congratulations to the Culinary and Bartenders Unions who worked
together in good faith towards an agreement that gives all workers the
quality of life they deserve. Las Vegas has a long union history and
workers have been critical to the city’s growth and success. All workers
– including hospitality workers – should have good jobs with fair pay
and benefits that give them the opportunity to provide for themselves
and their families. As a candidate for President, I had the honor of
joining Culinary Union members on the picket line and standing
shoulder-to-shoulder with men and women who form the backbone of a city
that brings joy to millions around the world. These workers understand
better than just about anybody that a job is about more than just a
paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about respect. Most importantly, it’s
about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going
to be okay.’ Union members made clear that one job should be enough.
Culinary Union members will have the final say on this tentative
agreement, and there are still Las Vegas workers in negotiations who
deserve a fair deal.  But the sacrifices made by hospitality workers,
autoworkers, actors, Teamsters, writers, port workers, rail workers, and
health care workers are the driving force behind a growing movement to
ensure workers receive a fair share of the value they’ve helped
create. This agreement will help give all workers the quality of life
they deserve.
