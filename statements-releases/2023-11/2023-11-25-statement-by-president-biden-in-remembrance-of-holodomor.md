---
 
We mark the solemn anniversary of the Holodomor as the brave people of
Ukraine continue to defend their freedom and Ukraine’s sovereignty
against Russia’s brutal war of aggression.  Ninety years ago, the
inhumane polices of Joseph Stalin and the Soviet regime created the
“death by hunger.”  Millions of Ukrainians—men, women, and
children—suffered and starved to death between 1932-1933 because of a
manmade famine.  Stalin and his regime systematically seized Ukraine’s
grain and farms and transferred Ukrainian grain to other parts of the
USSR as a tactic to repress Ukraine’s national identity. 

Today, Ukraine’s agricultural infrastructure is once more being
deliberately targeted—this time by Vladimir Putin as part of his drive
for conquest and power.  Russian forces seek to destroy Ukraine’s
economy and independence, deliberately damaging fields and destroying
Ukraine’s grain storage facilities and ports.  It is not just an attack
on Ukraine’s economic security, it is a cynical assault on food security
everywhere.  Putin is hurting the world’s most vulnerable communities,
for Russia’s profit.

On this anniversary, we remember and honor all those, both past and
present, who have endured such hardship and who continue still to fight
against tyranny.  We also recommit ourselves to preventing suffering,
protecting fundamental freedoms, and responding to human rights abuses
whenever and wherever they occur.  We stand united with Ukraine.
