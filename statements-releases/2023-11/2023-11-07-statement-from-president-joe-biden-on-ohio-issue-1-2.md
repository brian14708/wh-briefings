title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Ohio Issue\_1"
---
 
Tonight, Americans once again voted to protect their fundamental
freedoms – and democracy won. In Ohio, voters protected access to
reproductive health in their state constitution. Ohioans and voters
across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected
officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives
of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care,
and threaten to criminalize doctors and nurses for providing the health
care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide. This
extreme and dangerous agenda is out-of-step with the vast majority of
Americans. My Administration will continue to protect access to
reproductive health care and call on Congress to restore the protections
of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law once and for all.
