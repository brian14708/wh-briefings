title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Federal Communications Commission\u2019\
  s Vote to Adopt New Rules to Prevent Digital Discrimination"
---
 
Every person in America should be able to access affordable, high-speed
Internet no matter where they live or how much they earn. When President
Joe Biden and I took office, 30 million people across our country did
not have access to high-speed Internet. Communities of color, Native
communities, rural communities, and low-income households were
disproportionately disconnected.  
  
That is why we worked with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to make
the largest investment in affordable, high-speed Internet in history –
$65 billion to lower the cost of monthly Internet plans and build
thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable to connect every household in
our nation to high-speed Internet.  
  
One provision of our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that President Biden
signed exactly two years ago directed the Federal Communications
Commission to create first-of-its-kind rules to prevent digital
discrimination. Today, the FCC answered our call by voting to adopt
these necessary rules, taking a critical step to prohibit digital
discrimination in high-speed Internet access based on income, race,
ethnicity, religion, and national origin. These rules will protect civil
rights, lower costs, and increase Internet access for Americans across
the country.  
  
President Biden and I understand that getting online can be a bridge to
an education, a good-paying job, quality health care, and engagement
with the broader world. We will not stop fighting to make it easier for
everyone to access affordable, high-speed Internet. Today’s action is
another important step toward fulfilling that vision.
