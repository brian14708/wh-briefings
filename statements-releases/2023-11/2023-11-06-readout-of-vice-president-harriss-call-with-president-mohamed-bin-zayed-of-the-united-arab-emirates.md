Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with President Sheikh Mohamed
bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Vice President
reiterated the importance of protecting civilian lives and respecting
international humanitarian law, as Israel defends its citizens from
Hamas terrorism.  They discussed the urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza
and discussed ongoing efforts, including through recent initiatives
announced by the UAE, to increase the flow of food, water, and medicine
to civilians in need.  The Vice President made clear it is critical to
ensure that Palestinians are not forcibly displaced outside of Gaza and
underscored the Palestinian right to self-determination, and that
Israelis and Palestinians must have equal measures of security,
prosperity, and freedom.  The Vice President reaffirmed the United
States’ enduring commitment to the safety and security of the Emirati
people and ongoing efforts to strengthen the defense partnership between
the United States and the UAE.  They also discussed the importance of
deterring threats from any state or non-state actor, especially those
seeking to expand the conflict, and the Vice President condemned recent
attacks by Iranian-backed militias across the region.
