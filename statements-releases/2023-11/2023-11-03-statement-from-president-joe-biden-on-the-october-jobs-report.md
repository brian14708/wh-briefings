title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the October Jobs\_Report"
---
 
Today’s report shows that Bidenomics is growing the economy from the
middle out and bottom up—not the top down. The economy has created 14
million jobs since I took office and 150,000 jobs in October. The
unemployment rate has been below 4% for 21 months in a row, the longest
stretch in more than 50 years, at a time when the share of working-age
Americans with jobs is higher than before the pandemic. American workers
have achieved these gains while inflation has fallen by 60% and core
inflation is at its lowest level in two years—defying projections that
it would take a sharp increase in unemployment to bring inflation down.
Republicans in Congress should join me in growing the economy and
reducing inflation—rather than making reckless threats to weaken our
economy or prioritizing more tax cuts for the wealthy and large
corporations over essential programs for hardworking families, seniors,
and our national security.
