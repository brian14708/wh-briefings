*Employers, unions, and other collaborators will create thousands of
jobs, expand Registered Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships, and
increase recruitment from underserved communities*

On Wednesday, First Lady Jill Biden will travel to Augusta and
Pittsburgh for Workforce Hub convenings in each city, announcing
commitments to equitable workforce development from dozens of Hub
collaborators. In May, the Biden-Harris Administration named Augusta and
Pittsburgh [two of five Workforce
Hubs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strategies-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/) where
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda—including the American
Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and
Inflation Reduction Act—are catalyzing historic private and public
investments and creating good-paying jobs. In Augusta and Pittsburgh,
and across the country, these investments show how Bidenomics—the
President’s vision for growing the economy from the middle out and
bottom up—is creating high-quality career opportunities for students and
workers.  
  
Key commitments to expand pathways into good jobs from Augusta and
Pittsburgh Hub collaborators are below.  
  
**Augusta Launches New Registered Apprenticeship Programs and Over $1
Million in Employer Investments in Workforce Pipelines:**

Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, Georgia has seen
over $37 billion in private investments across new battery and electric
vehicle supply chain facilities, clean energy manufacturing, and
semiconductors and electronics. These significant economic investments
are creating over 27,000 new jobs in Georgia alone.

To meet this accelerated demand, Augusta needs a diverse pipeline of
skilled workers. That’s why Mayor Garnett Johnson and the Augusta
Workforce Hub’s three anchor institutions—Augusta Technical College,
Aiken Technical College, and the Richmond County School System—have
catalyzed a series of new partnerships and deepened existing
collaborations that will connect a broad range of people in the region
to good-quality careers.

First, five major regional employers are committing to actions that will
develop the workforce:

-   **Solvay Specialty Polymers** is investing $1 million to support
    local workforce development, including creating a mobile learning
    unit to expand training opportunities to job seekers across the
    Central Savannah River Area. Solvay received a $178 million grant
    funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law from the Department of
    Energy to build a new battery manufacturing plant that will supply
    materials for more than 5 million EV batteries per year.
-   **Aurubis, **a German-based multi-metal producing company, committed
    to supporting 200 good-quality jobs and signing a community benefit
    agreement with the Hub’s three anchor institutions to invest more
    than $200,000 in scholarship and job training programs for young
    workers, hiring from the local workforce when possible, and
    launching the first U.S. chapter of Women4Metals, an empowerment
    initiative for women in the metals industry. Aurubis doubled its
    investment in Augusta to $700 million in December 2022 to expand
    their manufacturing facility, thanks to the booming recycling market
    in the United States. Aurubis’s U.S. growth and
    investment—accelerated by the Inflation Reduction Act—are helping
    position the Southeast as a leading EV ecosystem.  
-   **Manus**, a synthetic biology company, has committed to developing
    a robust local biomanufacturing workforce by partnering with Augusta
    Technical College and the Richmond County School System to create
    and expand programming for process engineering, operations,
    maintenance, and construction, including creating a dedicated dual
    enrollment program.
-   **Savannah River Site (SRS)** will double the size of its youth
    apprenticeship program in the next year, as well as expanding its
    SRS Introduce a Girl to Engineering program by 25 percent. SRS is
    also committed to developing a consortium with the Augusta Building
    and Trades Council and area K-12 schools dedicated to expanding
    career opportunities in the nuclear industry by fall 2024. 
-   **Kubota,** an equipment manufacturing firm, will use earn-and-learn
    opportunities including paid internships, and partnerships with
    technical schools, high schools, and universities on certificate,
    diploma, degree programs, and adult education across every area of
    its business, including to create a cyber-resilient workforce to
    secure Kubota’s advanced manufacturing systems. Kubota made $457
    million in facility investments in the last year and announced plans
    to fill over 1,300 new jobs in Georgia and Kansas.
-   **The Battelle Savannah River Alliance**, which operates the
    Savannah River National Laboratory, is investing $125,000 to create
    K-12 Catalyst STEM Grants to advance programs and activities related
    to STEM education in Central Savannah River Area schools.

Second, major regional training providers are expanding programs for
skill development in occupations related to clean energy manufacturing,
nuclear energy, construction, cyber, and the development of key
next-generation technologies for advanced manufacturing:

-   **Augusta Technical College** is announcing two new Registered
    Apprenticeship programs—one with SRS to provide nuclear technician
    degrees and another with the **United Association Local 150 Plumbers
    and Steamfitters**—each with a goal of supporting 20-30 students at
    launch and reaching 100 apprenticeships in three years, with
    specific outreach to and recruitment of underrepresented
    populations.
-   **Aiken Technical College** is committing to expanding enrollment in
    its energy-sector Registered Apprenticeship program, in partnership
    with the SRS, to 200 students by January 2024, an increase of 1900
    percent since the program began in 2020.
-   **Aiken Technical College** and **Augusta Technical College** will
    sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the **Augusta Building
    and Construction Trades Council**, which represents 22 local skilled
    trades unions across 17 trades. The MOU outlines numerous shared
    objectives, including having representatives of the Trades Council
    serve on the institutions’ Technical Advisory Committee for three
    years and creating a seamless transition between pre-apprenticeship
    and apprenticeship by better preparing students for entry into union
    apprenticeship programs. 
-   The **Richmond County School System** will sign a similar MOU with
    the **Augusta Building and Construction Trades Council**, including
    co-developing a pre-apprenticeship program that will serve an
    estimated 30 students per year with direct or preferential entry to
    construction Registered Apprenticeship programs as well as
    wraparound student support services including career awareness
    activities in classrooms, field trips and demonstrations, and
    training and materials for guidance counselors/career navigators.
-   **Augusta University** will leverage a $1 million Regional
    Innovation Engines
    Development [award](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/regional-innovation-engines) from
    the National Science Foundation to catalyze local academic and
    industry partnerships around a growing regional cyber workforce,
    including supporting expanded training and internship opportunities
    and transitioning research to practice to foster creation of new
    businesses, especially minority- and veteran-owned businesses. 

Third, a wide array of regional stakeholders will collaborate to help
address systemic workforce barriers:

-   **Grounded.org** is launching a new philanthropic initiative—the
    TradesForce campaign—to boost workforce recruitment for the clean
    energy trades and training programs in Augusta and the other
    Workforce Hubs. Collaborating with **Social Good Club**—a network of
    over 400 top creators with a collective reach of over 600 million
    people—is actively uniting influencers, industry, and labor partners
    to promote clean energy trades, prioritizing the inclusion of
    underrepresented communities such as women, youth, and people of
    color. They have also partnered with **Climatebase** to develop a
    groundbreaking centralized platform that will directly link workers
    to clean energy training opportunities.
-   The **Augusta Department of Transportation** is announcing a new
    $300,000 investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to study
    the use of microtransit to increase access to jobs at manufacturing
    and training sites. **Lyft** also announced a new partnership with
    the **Augusta-Richmond County Mayor’s Office**, the **Community
    Foundation for the Central Savannah River Area**, and **Indeed** to
    provide funding for rides to and from clean energy and manufacturing
    jobs coming to Augusta as a result of the President’s Investing in
    America agenda.
-   **Augusta Technical College** is committing to expanding its
    partnership with the **Augusta District Attorney’s
    Office** and **Richmond County Correctional Facility** to provide
    skilled trades training for more than three dozen people in
    incarceration facilities over the next year, providing inclusive
    opportunities for all workers in the region to participate in the
    clean energy boom.

**Pittsburgh Will Create Over 1,000 New Jobs and Expand Apprenticeship
Programs in Industries Spurred by the Investing in America Agenda:**

Led by Mayor Ed Gainey and Partner4Work, the workforce development board
for the Pittsburgh area, the Pittsburgh Workforce Hub is focused on
creating equitable career pathways in four key sectors— infrastructure,
advanced manufacturing (including robotics and biomanufacturing),
high-speed internet, and clean energy—as well as occupations that
support these sectors (e.g., cybersecurity).  
  
To guide the Hub’s work, the City developed the [Pittsburgh Good Jobs
Principles](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/white-house-workforce-talent-hub),
a set of principles for job quality, equity, and worker empowerment that
build on [Biden-Harris Administration’s Good Jobs
Principles](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/principles). The
Pittsburgh Principles are driving concrete actions and new partnerships
to ensure local workers—particularly disadvantaged workers and residents
of high-need communities—can access good jobs with family-sustaining
wages, high-quality training like Registered Apprenticeships and
pre-apprenticeships, and critical supportive services like child care
and transportation.  
  
First, employers will create more than 1,000 good jobs for residents of
the Pittsburgh region. This includes:

-   **Re:Build Manufacturing** will hire 300 new employees in the next
    three years for its advanced manufacturing investments supported by
    the American Rescue Plan, and will partner with local workforce
    boards, career pathways programs, local technical schools and
    colleges to provide skill development opportunities for a diverse
    array of job seekers.
-   **Module**, a builder of affordable modular homes, will create up to
    50 direct jobs over the next four years at its new “last mile”
    facility in Allegheny County. To fill these jobs, Module will expand
    its construction training program focused on finishing and
    installing modular homes, which trains individuals with barriers to
    employment.
-   **The Pittsburgh Flag of the U.S. Navy Talent Pipeline Program**,
    which works with manufacturers to increase industrial capacity in
    regions with a significant defense footprint, will assist up to 50
    regional manufacturers per year to improve their ability to recruit,
    hire, onboard, and retain workers in good jobs. Employer partners
    have pledged to hire more than 350 manufacturing and other skilled
    trades positions by May 2024, partnering with local career and
    technical education programs on recruitment.
-   **Eos Energy Enterprises** will hire an additional 650 individuals
    in quality jobs in advanced manufacturing and clean energy upon the
    successful financing and completion of its Project AMAZE in 2026 by
    engaging with American Job Centers, K-12 school districts, community
    colleges, and other partners—and is developing a community benefits
    plan to ensure that its growth benefits its workers and the
    surrounding communities in areas like housing, transportation,
    energy stability, and workforce development.

Second, education and training organizations will expand
pre-apprenticeships, Registered Apprenticeships, and other
earn-and-learn training opportunities to more than 500 additional
workers next year alone, including:

-   **Partner4Work** will scale its successful 4Construction
    pre-apprenticeship training model to at least three new project
    sites in 2024, serving up to 80 additional people. 4Construction
    provides participants with direct entry into union Registered
    Apprenticeships and robust supportive services. One new site will
    begin planning in 2024 is the **City of Pittsburgh’s** New Pathways
    to Equity project funded by the RAISE grant program, expanded under
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, in the Hill District.
-   **The Pittsburgh Chapter of the German American Chamber of
    Commerce** and its employer members will launch a new electric
    vehicle (EV) technician registered apprenticeship program, while
    doubling enrollment in four registered apprenticeship
    programs—mechatronics technician, polymer technology process
    technician, sales engineer, and CAD/CAM technical designer—to serve
    50 apprentices annually over the next five years.
-   **Parkway West Career and Technology Center** is raising additional
    funds to construct a new building in partnership with
    the **Bricklayers and Allied Craftsworkers (BAC) Local 9**. The
    building will house a new program of study in masonry, preparing 20
    high school students per year for direct entry into BAC Registered
    Apprenticeships. Parkway West will also train 80 students per year
    in a cybersecurity registered apprenticeship program, connecting
    them to cybersecurity jobs in the region.
-   **Pittsburgh Gateways** will work with at least 30 local clean
    energy employers to build sustainable talent pipelines—leveraging
    the resources of Pittsburgh’s Energy Innovation Center and community
    partners—and will prepare at least 50 skilled construction workers
    for family-sustaining careers through the Intro to the Trades
    pre-apprenticeship program.
-   **Eaton**—an intelligent power management company whose work crosses
    advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and infrastructure—will offer
    paid co-op and internship opportunities with hands-on training in
    cybersecurity, and will invest $100,000 over the next three years in
    Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) CyLab Security and Privacy
    Institute to support multi-disciplinary cybersecurity research and
    education, building on its existing $350,000 investment.
-   Using a $3.75 million Department of Labor Building Pathways to
    Infrastructure Jobs Grant, **Partner4Work**, the **Pittsburgh Tech
    Council**, the **German American Chamber of Commerce**, and other
    partners will create and scale Registered Apprenticeship programs in
    technology and advanced manufacturing to support 300 apprentices in
    the clean energy, transportation, and broadband infrastructure
    sectors.

Third, local education institutions will develop pathways into robotics,
cybersecurity, and advanced manufacturing. For instance:

-   **The Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC)** expects to
    train at least 50 students in advanced manufacturing, building
    automation systems, and cybersecurity programs in the next year at
    its recently opened Center for Education, Innovation, and Training,
    which was completed using funding from President Biden’s American
    Rescue Plan.
-   **The University of Pittsburgh Institute for Cyber Law, Policy, and
    Security** will help build a strong pipeline of cybersecurity
    professionals by training over 500 high school students in
    cybersecurity basics, ethics, and career opportunities by 2028.
-   **The Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing (ARM) Institute** will
    also leverage a new grant from the Department of Defense’s
    Manufacturing Technology Program to expose more school-age children
    in the Pittsburgh region to manufacturing careers, by funding local
    nonprofit STEM Coding Lab to deliver robotics education to
    Pittsburgh-area Title I schools and expanding Manufacturing Day
    programs into rural areas.

Finally, training providers, philanthropies, and other collaborators
will remove barriers to employment and expand recruitment in underserved
communities, including:

-   **ARM** and **New Century Careers** have launched a rapid
    employer-driven training program to help at least 40 dislocated
    workers per year to re-enter the workforce in good-quality,
    high-demand manufacturing jobs—and will connect workers and
    employers through [roboticscareer.org](http://roboticscareer.org/),
    a new resource for robotics training and employment opportunities in
    Southwestern Pennsylvania and beyond.
-   **The University of Pittsburgh** will secure 20 Early Head Start
    slots at a new early childhood care facility, serving both
    neighborhood residents and employees at entities in Hazelwood Green,
    a former brownfield transformed into a life science and technology
    development.
-   **New Century Careers** will expand access to advanced manufacturing
    training in high-need neighborhoods in Pittsburgh in 2024—expanding
    its existing programming by 50 percent—with a key focus on preparing
    job seekers for 3D/additive and robotics careers.
