title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the ICJ Candidacy of Sarah\_Cleveland"
---
 
I strongly support Professor Sarah Cleveland’s candidacy to serve on the
International Court of Justice—the main judicial organ of the United
Nations. A talented scholar and practitioner of international law,
Cleveland is committed to the principles that have long been at the
heart of the Court: judicial independence, rigor, and humanity.   
   
As we face a range of pressing global challenges, the Court’s work has
never been more important. Cleveland’s experience as a professor,
government adviser, and expert on multilateral bodies—and her deep
respect for the diversity of the world’s legal systems—underscore her
ability to make valuable contributions to the issues that come before
the Court at this critical moment.  
   
That is why I am proud to call on all UN Member States to join the
United States in voting for Sarah Cleveland to serve as judge on the
International Court of Justice—which remains one of humanity’s most
critical institutions to advance peace around the world.
