*“We can’t stand by and stand silent \[in the wake of Antisemitic and
Islamophobic incidents\]. We must, without equivocation, denounce
Antisemitism. We must also, without equivocation, denounce
Islamophobia.”* – President Biden

The Biden-Harris Administration is today announcing new actions and
resources to address the alarming rise of reported Antisemitic and
Islamophobic incidents at schools and on college campuses since the
October 7<sup>th</sup> Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. These actions
will help protect students, engage school and university leaders, and
foster safe and supportive learning environments.  
  
The Justice Department (DOJ) has published an updated hate crimes threat
response [guide from the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI)](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/hate-crime-threat-response-guide-updated-11-8-2023.pdf/view)
to inform Americans about the steps they can take if they receive a
threat. The guide, published on the FBI’s hate crimes resource
[page](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights/hate-crimes), has
been shared with organizations and state and local law enforcement
entities across the nation.   
  
The Department of Education (ED) is today announcing that:

-   The National Center for Safe and Supportive Learning Environments, a
    technical assistance center funded by ED, is **releasing two
    collections of specialized resources designed to help educators,
    students, parents, and community members** prevent Antisemitism,
    Islamophobia, and related forms of discrimination – [one for P-12
    schools](https://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov/resources-related-combatting-antisemitism-and-islamophobia-while-promoting-religious-inclusion)
    and the other for institutions of higher education.  
-   This week, senior ED leaders will host **listening sessions with
    P-12 school leaders and university leaders to glean key insights
    from the field about how some schools are keeping students safe** in
    the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict. In addition, listening
    sessions with Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, Sikh, and other
    students, educators, and staff are planned for the next few weeks.
    ED will share notable examples of ways schools and campuses can
    prevent and address Antisemitism and Islamophobia.  
-   Additionally, on December 6th, ED’s Office of Elementary and
    Secondary Education will **launch a webinar series** to develop,
    strengthen, and share evidence-informed strategies that help schools
    prevent and respond to hate-based threats, bullying, and harassment.
    The webinar series kicks off with a session on “Creating a Welcoming
    Environment” on Dec. 6, followed by webinars on “Full Student
    Participation” on Dec. 13, “Conflict Mediation” on Jan. 17, and
    “Ongoing Support” in February. <img

This week, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will host
a webinar on best practices for countering Antisemitism, Islamophobia,
and other forms of hatred on rural college campuses. USDA is partnering
with the Department of Education and Muslim and Jewish groups to host
the webinar. [Register here for the
event](https://www.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_7rulkAOXTkyWkdELgpQu5g#/registration),
which takes place Thurs., Nov. 16, from 2-3:30 PM EST.  
  
Additional actions by the Biden-Harris Administration to combat
Antisemitism and Islamophobia at schools and on college campuses
include:

-   The Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ) have
    taken the following steps to increase campus safety:  
    -   DHS and DOJ have disseminated public safety information to and
        hosted calls with campus law enforcement as part of broader
        outreach to state, local, tribal, and territorial officials to
        address the threat environment and share information about
        available resources. DHS has also shared relevant resources with
        campus partners nationwide.  
    -   As part of its continued outreach to campuses, DHS’s
        Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is
        leveraging its 10 Regional field offices and their vast
        capabilities to conduct outreach and provide resources, tools,
        and services to K-12 and higher educational institutions to
        support their security requirements. On behalf of the U.S.
        Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland
        Security, and Justice, CISA continues to oversee the
        SchoolSafety.gov platform, which provides schools and districts
        with actionable recommendations to create safe and supportive
        environments for students and educators. The site serves as a
        one-stop access point for information, resources, guidance, and
        evidence-based practices on a range of school safety topics and
        threats.  
    -   On Oct. 30, the DOJ announced that is awarding over $38 million
        in grants to support the investigation and prosecution of hate
        crimes, increase hate crimes reporting, expand victim services,
        and improve community awareness. This includes over $8 million
        in grants to community-based organizations and civil rights
        groups, including awards to organizations serving Jewish and
        Arab American communities.  
    -   DOJ’s Community Relations Service continues to provide support
        on college campuses and remains in dialogue with Jewish, Muslim,
        Arab, and other impacted communities on college campuses
        nationwide.

-   ED has taken a number of steps to address prohibited forms of
    Antisemitic and Islamophobic discrimination under Title VI of the
    Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).  
    -   On Nov. 7, ED’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a
        new [Dear Colleague
        Letter](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Mi5lZC5nb3YvYWJvdXQvb2ZmaWNlcy9saXN0L29jci9sZXR0ZXJzL2NvbGxlYWd1ZS0yMDIzMTEtZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24taGFyYXNzbWVudC1zaGFyZWQtYW5jZXN0cnkucGRmP3V0bV9jb250ZW50PSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9uYW1lPSZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWdvdmRlbGl2ZXJ5JnV0bV90ZXJtPSIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzExMDcuODUyNzg1MDEifQ.bp2vR1vf_QknJiOM38IKSA16J7uKyiRwb_3ieagqoD0/s/1480560800/br/230180525751-l)
        reminding schools of their legal obligations under Title VI to
        provide all students, including students who are or are
        perceived to be Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, or Palestinian, a
        school environment free from discrimination based on race,
        color, or national origin. Secretary Cardona also has cautioned
        that if schools violate those obligations, ED has the authority
        to investigate and take action to redress violations, including
        by withholding federal dollars. As ED noted in the letter, the
        Department interprets its regulations consistent with the
        requirements of the First Amendment to the U.S.
        Constitution. Therefore, all of ED’s actions enforcing Title VI
        must comport with First Amendment principles, and ED’s
        regulations should not be interpreted to require recipients to
        enact or enforce codes that punish the exercise of protected
        free speech.  
    -   ED OCR also recently released an updated complaint
        [form](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDUsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Mi5lZC5nb3YvYWJvdXQvb2ZmaWNlcy9saXN0L29jci9jb21wbGFpbnRmb3JtLnBkZj91dG1fY29udGVudD0mdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbmFtZT0mdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1nb3ZkZWxpdmVyeSZ1dG1fdGVybT0iLCJidWxsZXRpbl9pZCI6IjIwMjMxMTA3Ljg1Mjc4NTAxIn0.1_GENNOYasKwUxbTvXC3hzYVzuRvsMtoMycGrewfkqo/s/1480560800/br/230180525751-l)
        specifying that Title VI’s protection from discrimination based
        on race, color, or national origin extends to students who are
        or are perceived to be Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or Sikh, or based
        on other shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics—making it
        easier for students and others who experience such
        discrimination to seek redress for it. ED additionally [made
        clear](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html.)
        that anyone who believes that a school has discriminated against
        a student based on race, color, or national origin [may file a
        complaint of
        discrimination](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html.)
        with ED OCR, and that the person who files the complaint need
        not have been the target of the alleged violation.  
    -   ED continues to offer technical assistance webinars to school
        communities as well as community organizations on these
        applications of Title VI. To request such a training, please
        contact ED OCR at <OCR@ed.gov>.  
    -   ED is sharing additional resources in this area, including a
        fact sheet, [Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on
