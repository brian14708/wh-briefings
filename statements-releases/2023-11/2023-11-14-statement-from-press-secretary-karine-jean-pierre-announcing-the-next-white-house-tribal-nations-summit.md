  House Tribal Nations\_Summit"
---
 
The President will host the next White House Tribal Nations Summit on
December 6 and 7 in Washington, D.C.  
   
Since taking office, the President has prioritized strengthening
Nation-to-Nation relationships with Tribal Nations, honoring treaty
obligations to Tribal Nations, and advancing Tribal sovereignty and
self-determination.  
   
The Tribal Nations Summit represents the President’s commitment to honor
the Nation-to-Nation relationships the United States has with Tribal
Nations. The Summit brings Tribal leaders and top Administration
officials together to address the most important issues facing Tribal
communities.   
   
The Summit will also feature new Administration actions that support
Tribal communities. This year’s Summit announcements will build on the
record of achievements that the President has already delivered on for
Indian Country. Through the President’s Investing in America agenda, the
Biden-Harris Administration has made record investments to support
Tribal Nations and Native communities and has taken a host of actions to
address the top concerns of Tribal communities, including executive
action to address the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous people,
securing more stable advance funding for Indian Health Service, and
championing innovative new partnerships with Tribal Nations to
co-steward their ancestral lands and waters, including some of our
newest National Monuments: Avi Kwa Ame in Nevada, and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah
Kukveni – Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument in
Arizona.
