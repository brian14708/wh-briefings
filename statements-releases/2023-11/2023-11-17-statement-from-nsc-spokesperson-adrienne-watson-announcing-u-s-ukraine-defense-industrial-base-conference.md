The U.S. government will host a two-day Defense Industrial Base
Conference on December 6<sup>th</sup> – 7<sup>th</sup> to convene U.S.
and Ukrainian industry and government representatives to explore
opportunities for co-production and other industrial cooperation in
Ukraine. The conference is part of the U.S. government’s efforts to
significantly increase weapons production to support Ukraine’s fight for
freedom and security.  
   
Representatives from the National Security Council and the U.S.
Departments of Commerce, Defense, and State will attend, as well as
Ukrainian counterparts from the Office of the President and Ministries
of Defense, Strategic Industry, and Foreign Affairs.  
   
This conference follows the International Defense Industries Forum
hosted by Ukraine on September 29 and reinforces the U.S.’s long-term
commitments to the U.S. defense industrial base, to Ukraine’s economic
recovery, and the joint commitment to enhance industrial, armaments, and
security cooperation between both nations.
