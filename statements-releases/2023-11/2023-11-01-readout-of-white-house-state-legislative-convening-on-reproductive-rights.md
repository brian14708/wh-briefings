Today, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
Gender Policy Council, and Tom Perez, Senior Advisor and Assistant to
the President and Director of the White House Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs, convened more than 30 legislative leaders
from 16 states to discuss their efforts to advance proactive legislation
to further safeguard reproductive rights in the upcoming 2024
legislative session.

of more than 80 state legislators from 41 states in June 2023. While
Republican elected officials continue to advance extreme abortion bans
in states and at the national level, legislators across the country are
fighting back to protect access to reproductive health care.  
   
White House senior officials thanked the legislators for their
leadership and reaffirmed the importance of state partners in responding
to attacks on reproductive freedom – including through the passage of
proactive legislation to strengthen access to reproductive health care,
including contraception; to protect patient privacy; and to ensure
health care providers have access to the training they need to care for
patients.
