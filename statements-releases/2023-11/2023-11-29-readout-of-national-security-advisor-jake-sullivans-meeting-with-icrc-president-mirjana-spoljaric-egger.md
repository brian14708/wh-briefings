On Tuesday, November 28, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke
with International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) President Mirjana
Spoljaric Egger. The two discussed ongoing efforts to sustain and expand
the flow of humanitarian assistance and restoration of basic services in
Gaza, and to bolster civilian protections and humanitarian access
throughout Gaza. National Security Advisor Sullivan reiterated the call
for the immediate release of all hostages, and highlighted the
imperative need for the ICRC to have access to and provide medical
assistance to those hostages still being detained.  National Security
Advisor Sullivan thanked ICRC President Spoljaric for the ICRC’s hard
work to deliver life-saving assistance to civilians in Gaza, which they
undertake at great personal risk.
