title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the African Growth and Opportunity\
  \ Act (AGOA) Reauthorization"
---
 
I strongly support reauthorization of the African Growth and Opportunity
Act— a landmark, bipartisan law that has formed a bedrock for U.S. trade
with sub-Saharan Africa for more than two decades. I encourage Congress
to reauthorize AGOA in a timely fashion and to modernize this important
Act for the economic opportunities of the coming decade.

AGOA is facilitating private-sector led economic growth across
sub-Saharan Africa by increasing the competitiveness of African
products, diversifying African exports, and enabling the creation of
tens of thousands of new, quality jobs in Africa. The benefits are felt
on both sides of the Atlantic: AGOA fosters a more competitive
environment for U.S. businesses operating in sub-Saharan Africa.

I am committed to expeditiously working with Congress and our African
partners to renew this law beyond 2025, in order to deepen trade
relations between our countries, advance regional integration, and
realize Africa’s immense economic potential for our mutual benefit. In
so many ways, Africa is the future – and so when Africa succeeds, the
whole world succeeds.
