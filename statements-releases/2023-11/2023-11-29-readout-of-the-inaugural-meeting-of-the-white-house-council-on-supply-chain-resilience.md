  Resilience"

On Monday, as part of his Bidenomics agenda to lower costs for American
families, President Biden convened the inaugural meeting of the White
House Council on Supply Chain Resilience.  
   
The President addressed the Council and discussed the importance of
fixing supply chains to lower costs and provide more breathing room to
American families. He announced more than 30 new actions to strengthen
America’s supply chains, lower costs for families, and secure key
sectors, detailed in a fact

They include new steps through the Defense Production Act to support
domestic manufacturing of essential medicines, as well as new data
collaboration to spot supply chain risks sooner. President Biden lauded
the work his Administration has done to bring manufacturing home and
strengthen supply chains since supply chain bottlenecks peaked during
the pandemic, and called on his Council to continue this work to keep
supply chains secure, diversified, and resilient into the future. He
also spoke to the work his Administration is doing to build deeper
relationships with allies and partners around the world, and to support
the workers that keep supply chains secure and our economy moving. And
the President called on corporations who have benefitted from lower
input costs to pass those savings on to American families.  
   
Secretary Buttigieg, in introducing President Biden, also spoke to the
unprecedented investments in America’s supply chain infrastructure,
including at our ports. He highlighted the Department of
Transportation’s innovative efforts to facilitate greater data sharing
among supply chain participants, and the work through President Biden’s
Trucking Action Plan to improve working conditions for the truck drivers
who move goods across the country.  
   
The Council members used the remainder of the meeting to discuss these
announcements and the work they are undertaking in more detail. Council
members noted the importance of resilient supply chains to economic,
national, and homeland security, and discussed additional ways their
agencies will collaborate to advance these priorities, including sharing
data to identify supply chain risks and recommendations to address them.
They also affirmed the need for continued support for good working
conditions for the workers who keep supply chains running.  
   
They noted that supply chain resilience remains a key topic in
diplomatic discussions with allies and partners, and highlighted ongoing
bilateral and multilateral efforts to strengthen supply chains,
including the first-of-its-kind Supply Chain Agreement recently
concluded in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity
(IPEF).  
   
Council members also remarked on the economic benefits of investing in
America and in our supply chains—which lowers costs for businesses and
brings jobs in industries of the future to communities that have been
left behind. They noted the positive impacts this work has on the fight
against climate change, particularly through investments in supply
chains for clean energy and agriculture and food. Council members also
highlighted the importance of deeper engagement with the private sector
on efforts to fortify domestic competitiveness and diversify critical
supply chains.
