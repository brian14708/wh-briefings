title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on United\_States\u2019\
  \ Suspension of the CFE Treaty Alongside NATO\_Allies"
---
 
Today, the Russian Federation withdrew from the Treaty on Conventional
Armed Forces in Europe (CFE).  The combination of Russia’s withdrawal
from the CFE Treaty and its continuing full-scale war of aggression
against Ukraine – another CFE State Party – has fundamentally altered
circumstances that were essential to the CFE States Parties’ consent to
be bound by the treaty, and radically transformed the obligations under
the treaty.  In light of this fundamental change of circumstances, the
United States will suspend the operation of all CFE Treaty obligations
between itself and every other State Party, effective December 7,
consistent with our rights under international law.   
   
This decision to suspend our obligations under the CFE Treaty was taken
in close consultation and coordination with our NATO Allies, many of
whom are also CFE Treaty States Parties. A number of our CFE partners
that are not members of NATO also support suspension of CFE Treaty
obligations in response to Russia’s actions.  
   
As reflected in the statement issued at NATO Headquarters today, our
Allies unanimously share our view that a situation where the United
States and our NATO Allies continue to be militarily constrained by the
CFE Treaty, while Russia – whose armed forces are the largest in Europe,
and who continues to actively wage a war of aggression against Ukraine
using the very forces the treaty aims to constrain – is not, would be
unacceptable. Suspension of CFE obligations will strengthen the
Alliance’s deterrence and defense capacity by removing restrictions that
impact planning, deployments, and exercises – restrictions that no
longer bind Russia after Moscow’s withdrawal.   
   
While Russia’s withdrawal from the CFE Treaty further demonstrates
Moscow’s continued disregard for arms control, the United States, our
NATO Allies, and our responsible partners remain committed to effective
conventional arms control as a critical element of Euro-Atlantic
security.  We will continue to pursue measures that aim to bolster
stability and security in Europe by reducing risk, preventing
misperceptions, avoiding conflicts, and building trust.
