title: "FACT SHEET: The U.S. \u2013 Angola\_Partnership"
---
 
As the United States and Angola mark 30 years of diplomatic relations,
our bilateral relationship is deepening with regular senior-level
engagements and increasing cooperation on key shared objectives.  Angola
is a strategic partner and regional leader, and the U.S.-Angola
partnership is critical to advancing our shared goals of economic
prosperity, regional security, and increasing energy security in Africa
and the Atlantic.  
  
**High Level Engagements**  
  
Since the U.S. Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022, the United States
has engaged in frequent and substantive high-level engagements with
Angola.  Highlights in the past year alone include:

-   U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin became the first-ever U.S.
    Secretary of Defense to visit Angola in September 2023, engaging on
    military modernization and regional security.  
-   U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator
    Samantha Power, U.S. International Development Finance Corporation
    (DFC) CEO Scott Nathan, and Deputy Assistant to the President Amos
    Hochstein, engaged Angolan leadership in September 2023 on food
    security and the transformational potential of Angola’s Lobito
    Corridor, part of President Biden’s flagship Partnership for Global
    Infrastructure and Investment (PGI).  
-   U.S. Export Import Bank (EXIM) Chair Reta Jo Lewis visited Angola
    after the EXIM Board’s approval of $900 million in financing for Sun
    Africa’s solar energy project.  In October, EXIM declared the Sun
    Africa program its “Deal of the Year” for 2023.  
-   U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed Angolan Foreign
    Minster Tete Antonio to join the launch of the Partnership for
    Atlantic Cooperation, in which Angola has played a leading and
    constructive role.  
-   U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg welcomed Angola
    Minister of Transport D’Abreu to Washington, D.C in April 2023 to
    initial a bilateral Open Skies Agreement, facilitating increased air
    connectivity between the United States and Angola, providing
    significant new opportunities for trade, tourism, and investment.  
-   U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves met with President
    Lourenço in December 2022 to discuss Angola’s improving economy and
    its commitments to further economic development, and reforms across
    the country that would benefit deepening U.S.-Angola economic
    ties.  
-   In November 2023, the U.S. and Angola signed the Artemis Accords,
    which advances a common vision of space exploration for the benefit
    of all humankind.

**Trade and Investment**  
  
The United States has partnered with Angola on one of President Biden’s
key foreign policy priorities, establishing strategic economic corridors
that benefit local populations and integrate them into the global
economy.  The Lobito Corridor is a transformative economic corridor from
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to the Atlantic Ocean, and the
President’s PGI initiative is working with Angola and development
partners to develop infrastructure across the corridor and extend it
from Angola directly to Zambia.  The Lobito Corridor offers the
potential for critical infrastructure that will better integrate DRC,
Zambia, and Angola into regional and global markets; develop green
energy supply chains; and, spur investment in agriculture, telecoms, and
additional sectors in underdeveloped regions of Angola.  Angola’s
commitment to economic reform since 2017 has laid the groundwork for
stronger U.S. commercial and government engagement.  Other U.S.
government initiatives such as Prosper Africa further deepen U.S.-Angola
economic engagement.  Since the beginning of Prosper Africa, the U.S
government has also facilitated billions of dollars of closed private
sector deals.    

-   DFC’s advanced due-diligence of $250 million of financing to
    refurbish the 1,300km Lobito Atlantic Railway line as well as
    Secretary Blinken’s October 2023 signing of the Lobito Corridor
    seven-side Memorandum of Understanding to build the new 800km rail
    line between Angola and Zambia underscores the seriousness of U.S.
    intent to increase economic activity along the corridor.  
-   EXIM’s $900 million financing of Sun Africa’s solar projects and
    $363 million financing of Acrow Bridge’s 186 prefabricated bridges
    promises to support critical infrastructure and thousands of Angolan
    and American jobs.  
-   Boeing and Angolan flag carrier TAAG announced a deal for the
    purchase of ten new 787s valued at $3.6 billion, a testament to
    growing Angola – U.S. bilateral commercial relations.  
-   The U.S. Department of Treasury supported Angola’s efforts to reduce
    its debt vulnerabilities through technical assistance
    throughout 2023.  The program has successfully enabled the Angolan
    government to reprofile its domestic debt and lower interest
    costs.  
-   USAID will provide approximately $1 million to assist the Angolan
    Ministry of Transportation to develop their planned
    Public-Private-Partnership Unit for transportation infrastructure. 
    The support will enable the Ministry to replicate the successful and
    transparent Lobito Rail concession for additional rail and port
    investments.  
-   The U.S. Geological Survey Institute and the Angolan Geological
    Institute signed a Memorandum of Understanding in November 2023 that
    will enable further scientific collaboration between the two
    agencies to advance Angola’s potential as a critical minerals
    producer.

**Food Security**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized global food security
through increased agricultural trade.  The United States has partnered
with Angola to increase food security and climate resilience through
building capacity and expanding investment in support of Angola’s
agriculture development and economic diversification goals.

-   The U.S. Department of Agriculture will lead the first-ever U.S.
    agribusiness trade mission to Angola with over 60 individuals
    representing U.S. companies and agricultural organizations in early
    February.  This mission will promote U.S. agricultural trade and
    regional food security investments with Angolan partners.  U.S.
    trade mission participants will meet with potential private sector
    buyers, and engage industry trade experts.  
-   USAID has provided $13.3 million in 2022 and 2023 in emergency
    assistance to three southern Angolan provinces affected by the 2022
    drought.  The program has screened over 500,000 children for acute
    malnutrition and treated 121,000 for moderate to severe
    malnutrition.   
-   Through a $5 million Gender Equality and Equality Action Fund
    project, USAID will support agricultural development along the
    Lobito Corridor, focusing on linking women smallholder farmers to
    value chains that will use the rail line as a critical component of
    sustainability of the corridor project.

**Digital Transformation**  
  
Along with physical infrastructure, the United States is investing in
Angola’s digital architecture, supporting reliable telecommunication
networks — using trusted vendors — that will benefit the Angolan people
and improve Angola’s digital connectivity to the global economy.

-   In August 2023, USAID launched a nearly $5 million “Dinheiro Digital
    é Melhor” (DDM) or “Mobile Money is Better” project with Africell, a
    U.S.-owned telecoms company, which will provide an equivalent
    in-kind contribution to the partnership on top of their existing
    mobile network.  
-   Under the auspices of PGI, the DDM program will create an enabling
    environment for digital finance applications to spur the growth of a
    vibrant, secure, and more inclusive digital payments ecosystem in
    Angola.  This partnership will support Africell’s ongoing expansion
    of their 5G infrastructure to the area using trusted networks, which
    is critical for Lobito Corridor development.  
-   On November 17, 2022, EXIM approved a final commitment in the amount
    of $42 million in support of Gates Air’s export of FM transmitters,
    towers, training, and other equipment and services to Radio Nacional
    de Angola.  The U.S. exports are for Angola’s “Radio Signal
    Expansion and Studio Modernization Project.”  The EXIM authorization
    is for the first phase of the project, which when complete, will
    extend the Angolan government’s ability to communicate by radio with
    approximately 95 percent of the country’s population.

**Democracy, Governance, and Human Rights**  
  
The United States supports Angola’s efforts to combat corruption,
enhance accountability, advance democratic governance, and support
protections for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the
right to peaceful assembly and of freedom of expression, association,
and religion or belief.  The U.S. continues to support Angola’s
commitment to democratic reforms, including amplifying civil society and
faith-based organizations role in democratic elections and local
decision making.

-   The U.S. Embassy in Angola launched a program to promote rule of law
    by strengthening judicial independence, making citizens more aware
    of their legal rights, and building the capacity of courts.  The
    Embassy also supports several grants to strengthen press freedom.  
-   USAID and State Department are working with the National Bank of
    Angola to support Angola’s continued efforts to fight against
    corruption, including Angola’s substantial improvement in its
    Transparency International score.  The programming will increase
    public finance transparency and build the capacity of oversight
    institutions in support of Angola’s commitments as a new Extractive
    Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) implementing country.  
-   Since 2019, the Treasury Department has provided technical
    assistance to strengthen Angolan institutions’ ability to identify,
    detect, and prosecute money laundering, terrorist financing, and
    other crimes in support of Angola’s political and economic reforms.

**Climate**  
  
Angola has been a leader in making progress toward the energy
transition.  Despite being one of the largest oil and gas producers in
sub-Saharan Africa, Angola has made ambitious environmental and
conservation commitments with U.S. support as it endeavors to generate
73 percent of its energy from clean sources by 2027.

-   Sun Africa’s existing projects in development in Angola will
    generate 370 MW of renewable energy, preventing the emission of
    935,953 tons of carbon per year.  In July 2023, under PGI, EXIM’s
    board approved a $900 million commitment for Sun Africa to construct
    two utility-scale solar photovoltaic parks that will provide more
    than 500 MW of renewable power.  
-   Angola became a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge in November
    2023, a voluntary framework supporting nations to collectively
    reduce methane emissions by 30 percent from 2020 level by 2030. 
    Reducing methane from the atmosphere is the most effective strategy
    to limit warming this decade.  
-   USAID launched the Ecosystems, Communities, and Climate – Okavango
    (ECCO) project in July 2023 to support communities in the heart of
    the Okavango Delta to sustainably improve their livelihoods while
    improving conservation of vital natural resources in support of the
    Congressional 2019 DELTA Act.  This five-year program expects to
    leverage $10 million in funding from U.S., local, and international
    private sector partners.  
-   Alongside U.S. support, Angola has invested $60 million of its own
    resources in demining national parks.   
-   The State Department is funding efforts to counter wildlife
    trafficking through training of law enforcement, prosecutors, and
    park rangers continued.  
-   NASA’s Applied Sciences program’s Water Resources focus area is
    supporting research on drought mitigation, crop irrigation schemes,
    water resource management, and reservoir management in Angola.  
-   The U.S. – Angola Energy Security Dialogue will launch in 2024 and
    will focus on the secure and stable supply of energy and deeper
    commercial ties while advancing our shared climate goals. 

**Health**  
  
The United States and Angola have a longstanding and productive
partnership in health. U.S. support has included decades of investment
to improve the day-to-day health of Angolans, particularly against
malaria and HIV/AIDS. 

-   The United States intends to provide over $23 million in Angola
    through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in
    fiscal year 2023.  PEPFAR has strengthened public health and
    laboratory systems in Angola, providing technical assistance to the
    National HIV/AIDS Coordinating Office and the Ministry of Health in
    supply chain management, clinical treatment, capacity building, and
    community-based mobilization.  Over the past year, PEPFAR has tested
    more than 20,000 Angolans who were contacts of known persons living
    with HIV or newly diagnosed with HIV.   
-   Through PEPFAR, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    trained over 400 Angolan laboratory technicians, supported the
    regional laboratory in Benguela province, and continued
    collaboration between government institutions, international
    stakeholders, and partners to collect, test, and diagnose HIV and
    COVID-19.  
-   During the past year, the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI)
    distributed over 4 million bed nets to protect Angolans against
    malaria and trained over 8,000 health workers to diagnose and treat
    malaria.  Through September 2023, Angola has witnessed a 15 percent
    decrease in deaths in PMI-focused provinces.  
-   The U.S.-Angolan partnership on COVID-19 response and recovery has
    provided 10.9 million vaccine dose donations and, through the
    Initiative for Global Vaccine Access, enabling the vaccination of
    9.4 million Angolans in all 18 provinces.  
-   USAID is providing $5 million from the Local Works program to
    partner with local universities to address road traffic injuries and
    deaths, the second leading cause of death behind malaria in Angola
    and a major burden on economic growth potential due to lost human
    capital and medical costs.

**Peace and Security**

-   Secretary Austin’s visit to Angola launched the creation of a joint
    high-level defense dialogue, scheduled for early 2024.  The leaders
    identified future engagement potential in several areas, including
    capacity building for maritime security, space, and cyber defense.  
-   The U.S. – Angola partnership continues to grow, focusing on a wide
    range of security priorities, including International Military
    Education and Training, English language capacity building, maritime
    security, and peacekeeping.  In the coming year, the U.S. will
    explore new opportunities to expand capacity building efforts for
    cyber security and Angola’s Navy.  
-   The U.S. has significantly increased military assistance to Angola
    in the past four years, providing over $18 million from 2020 – 2023.
