title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Arrest of N\xE9stor Isidro P\xE9\
  rez Salas (\u201CEl\_Nini\u201D)"
---
 
On November 22, Mexican security forces captured Néstor Isidro Pérez
Salas (“El Nini”), the notorious head of security for the Chapitos wing
of the Sinaloa Cartel.  For nearly three years, El Nini has been one of
Mexico’s and the United States’ most wanted criminals, indicted by the
United States for his roles in perpetrating violence and illicit
fentanyl trafficking into the United States, and both our countries are
safer with him behind bars and facing justice for his crimes.  His
arrest also follows Mexico’s arrest and extradition to the United States
of another Chapitos leader, Ovidio Guzmán López, earlier this year.

These arrests are testament to the commitment between the United States
and Mexico to secure our communities against violence, counter the
cartels, and end the scourge of illicit fentanyl that is hurting so many
families.  We will continue working as strong partners to do everything
possible to hold criminals accountable for jeopardizing public health
and safety in our two countries. As I told President Andrés Manuel López
Obrador when we met in San Francisco on November 17, nothing is beyond
our reach when Mexico and the United States stand together.

I want to thank President López Obrador and the Mexican Army and special
forces for effectively capturing El Nini, and express our appreciation
for the brave men and women of Mexican security forces who undertook
this successful operation to apprehend him.
