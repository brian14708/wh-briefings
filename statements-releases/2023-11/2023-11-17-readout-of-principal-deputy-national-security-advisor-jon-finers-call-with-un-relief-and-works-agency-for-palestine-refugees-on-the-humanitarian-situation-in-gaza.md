Today, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer spoke with
UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
(UNRWA) Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini to discuss the dire
humanitarian situation in Gaza. Finer expressed his condolences for the
loss of 103 UNRWA staff since October 7, the highest number of UN aid
workers killed in any conflict. He also expressed gratitude for the
commitment of UNRWA’s staff to deliver humanitarian aid and provide
essential services in Gaza.  The two discussed the critical importance
of protecting civilians, including UN staff and other aid workers, and
continuing to mitigate any potential aid diversion to Hamas. The United
States remains committed to supporting the Agency’s critical work as a
lifeline for millions.  Finer underscored the importance of the agency’s
work to enable life-saving humanitarian aid to reach those in need in
Gaza.
