title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on President\_\
  Biden\u2019s Establishment of First-Ever National Strategy to Counter\_Islamophobia"
---
 
President Biden ran for office to restore the soul of our nation. He is
unequivocal: there is no place for hate in America against anyone.
Period.

Today, he and Vice President Harris are announcing that their
Administration will develop the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to
Counter Islamophobia in the United States. We look forward to continuing
our work with community leaders, advocates, members of Congress, and
more to develop the strategy – which will be a joint effort led by the
Domestic Policy Council and the National Security Council – and counter
the scourge of Islamophobia and hate in all its forms. For too long,
Muslims in America, and those perceived to be Muslim, such as Arabs and
Sikhs, have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks and
other discriminatory incidents. We all mourn the recent barbaric killing
of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy, and
the brutal attack on his mother in their home outside Chicago.

Today’s announcement is the latest step as part of President Biden’s
directive last year to establish an interagency group to increase and
better coordinate U.S. Government efforts to counter Islamophobia,
Antisemitism, and related forms of bias and discrimination within the
United States. Moving forward, the President, Vice President, and our
entire Administration will continue working to ensure every American has
the freedom to live their lives in safety and without fear for how they
pray, what they believe, and who they are.
