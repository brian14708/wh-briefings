title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Ratification of the UAW\u2019s\
  \ Historic Agreements with the Big Three\_Automakers"
---
 
The UAW has announced that their dedicated union members who fought
together, stood together, and walked the picket line together have now
voted together to ratify their record contracts. These historic
contracts reward the autoworkers who have sacrificed so much with record
raises, more paid leave, greater retirement security, and more rights
and respect at work. I want to applaud the UAW and each of our Big Three
auto companies for their good faith negotiations to reach this record
contract.

These contracts show that when unions do well, it lifts all workers.
Following the UAW’s historic agreements, we’ve seen Toyota, Honda,
Hyundai, and Subaru announce significant wage increases as well. The UAW
is fighting hard to ensure that all auto jobs are good, middle-class
jobs – and I stand with them in that fight.
