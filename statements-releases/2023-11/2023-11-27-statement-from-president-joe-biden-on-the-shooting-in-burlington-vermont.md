title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Shooting in Burlington,\_Vermont"
---
 
Jill and I were horrified to learn that three college students of
Palestinian descent, two of whom are American citizens, were shot
Saturday in Burlington, Vermont. They were simply spending Thanksgiving
gathered with family and loved ones.

We join Americans across the country in praying for their full recovery,
and we send our deepest condolences to their families. While we are
waiting for more facts, we know this: there is absolutely no place for
violence or hate in America. Period. No person should worry about being
shot at while going about their daily lives. And far too many Americans
know a family member injured or killed as a result of gun violence. We
cannot and we will not accept that.

Earlier today, I spoke to Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger to offer my
support. We are grateful to the Burlington Police Department – as well
as the FBI, ATF, and other law enforcement partners – for their swift
work identifying and arresting a suspect. Our Administration will
provide any additional federal resources needed to assist in the
investigation.
