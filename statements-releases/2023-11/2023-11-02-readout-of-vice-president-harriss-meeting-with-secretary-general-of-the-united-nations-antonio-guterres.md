Vice President Kamala Harris met today with Secretary General of the
United Nations Antonio Guterres in Bletchley Park, the United Kingdom on
the margins of the Global Summit on Artificial Intelligence Safety. The
Vice President reaffirmed Israel’s right and duty to defend itself
following the appalling Hamas terrorist attack of October 7 as well as
the importance of respecting international humanitarian law.  The Vice
President and the Secretary General discussed recent progress to
increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population
of Gaza as well as the urgent need to dramatically increase the pace and
scale of those deliveries to ensure the flow of food, water, and
medicine while restoring basic services. They also discussed the steps
necessary to ensure that relief organizations had the resources they
needed to effectively distribute assistance once it enters Gaza. In
addition, they spoke about Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Vice
President underscored the importance of continuing to provide support to
the people of Ukraine. They also discussed the situation in Haiti and
the importance of mobilizing international support for a multinational
security support mission there.
