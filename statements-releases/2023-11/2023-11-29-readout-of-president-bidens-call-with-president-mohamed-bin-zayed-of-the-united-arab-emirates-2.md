President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Mohamed bin
Zayed of the United Arab Emirates to affirm the strong bilateral ties
between the United States and the UAE and to express appreciation to the
UAE for organizing COP28 in Dubai.  The President asked Vice President
Harris to attend the COP28 Leaders Summit on his behalf to showcase U.S.
global leadership on climate at home and abroad and to help galvanize
increased global ambition at this critical event.  The United States
delegation will also include Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John
Kerry and dozens of senior U.S. officials representing more than 20
departments and agencies. The two leaders also discussed the situation
in the Middle East region and welcomed the recent hostage deal and
humanitarian pause, which has enabled a surge in assistance to the
people of Gaza. President Biden reiterated the steadfast U.S. commitment
to peace and security in the Middle East region.
