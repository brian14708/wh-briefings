Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Middle East
and North Africa, Brett McGurk, departed last night for visits to
Belgium, Israel, the West Bank, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Qatar, and Jordan. He will be in Brussels, Belgium today
briefing NATO Allies and European Union partners on a coordinated
approach to the current situation in the Middle East, with a focus on
significantly expanding humanitarian assistance to Gaza, economic
pressure on Hamas and other terrorist groups, and demands to immediately
release hostages of multiple nationalities still being held by Hamas.  
   
In Israel, he will discuss Israel’s security needs, the imperative of
protecting civilians in the course of military operations, as well as
ongoing efforts to secure the release of hostages, and the need to rein
in violent extremist settlers in the West Bank.  
   
In the West Bank, Mr. McGurk will discuss the Biden Administration’s
support for the Palestinian Authority and its essential role as the
representative of the Palestinian people, as well as the need for
reforms to promote long-term stability in both the West Bank and Gaza,
and the aspirations of Palestinians to live with equal measures of
freedom, security, and dignity in a state of their own.  
   
In the Gulf region, Mr. McGurk will discuss efforts to contain the
conflict against Hamas, and deterrence against any state or non-state
group seeking its expansion, as well as U.S. security assistance to our
Gulf Cooperation Council partners.  
   
In Doha, he will also focus on the intensive efforts to secure release
of hostages being held by Hamas, including a number of Americans, one of
whom is a 3-year old toddler.  
   
Finally, in Jordan, he will consult with senior leaders on the Biden
Administration’s historic support for Jordan and a viable pathway to a
Palestinian state.  
   
Mr. McGurk will be joined on his trip by Assistant Secretary for Near
East Affairs, Ambassador Barbara Leaf.
