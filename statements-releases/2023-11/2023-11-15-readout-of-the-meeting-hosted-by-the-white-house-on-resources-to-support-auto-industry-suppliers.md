  \ Auto Industry\_Suppliers"

Yesterday, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials met with
associations and members representing small and mid-sized suppliers and
parts manufacturers for the automotive industry. Industry participants
discussed the challenges faced by auto suppliers following several
economic disruptions to the industry, including the pandemic and
semiconductor shortage, and Administration officials shared information
about federal programs that can provide near-term relief to auto
industry suppliers and highlighted the President’s commitment to
strengthening American manufacturing.  
  
Small- and mid-sized suppliers are a critical piece of the auto supply
chain, which is one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the United
States. During the meeting, industry participants described the
challenges faced by the industry, and particularly by small- and
medium-sized suppliers. Auto suppliers affirmed their appreciation for
the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to supporting the industry
and connecting firms to federal resources to provide immediate and
targeted relief.  
  
Representatives from the Department of the Treasury, Department of
Commerce, Department of Labor, and Small Business Administration shared
information about specific resources that the Biden-Harris
Administration has mobilized to support businesses and workers in the
auto supply chain. This whole-of-government plan includes loan guarantee
programs, hardship accommodation plans, workforce development, employer
and worker matchmaking, and technical assistance opportunities.
Participants engaged directly with the federal resource providers and
technical experts and asked questions about the various programs. A
summary of these resources is available
[here](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Resource-Guide-for-Auto-Suppliers.pdf).  
  
Administration officials closed the meeting by reiterating the
President’s commitment to providing immediate and targeted relief to
businesses and workers in the auto supply chain and to building back
with a more resilient, secure, and sustainable auto supply chain.
