title: "FACT SHEET: Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) Indo-Pacific\
  \ Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Investor\_Forum"
---
 
The United States is committed to an Indo-Pacific that is free and open,
connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient. To help realize that
future, the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI)
and Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), will work
with IPEF partners and the private sector to scale high-standard
investments, create more resilient economies, and drive long-term
sustainable development.  
  
Today, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Senior Advisor to
the President Amos Hochstein hosted the**PGI IPEF Investment Forum** to
discuss collaborative actions and shared priorities to increase private
investment in the Indo-Pacific. Participants included IPEF Government
Officials and Co-CEO of KKR Joseph Bae; Chairman and CEO of BlackRock
Larry Fink; CEO of Citi Jane Fraser; Founder and Chairman of Fortescue
Andrew Forrest; Founding Partner of Global Infrastructure Partners
Matthew Harris; Founding Partner, Chairman and CEO of Global
Infrastructure Partners Adebayo Ogunlesi; President, CIO and CFO of
Alphabet and Google Ruth Porat; Founder and CEO of RockCreek Afsaneh
Beschloss; and Founding Partner and Executive Chair of TPG Jim
Coulter.   
  
Looking forward, the United States will continue to engage the private
sector to orient around investment opportunities in emerging markets. In
particular, IPEF partners will host an annual **IPEF Clean Economy
Investor Forum**, beginning in 2024, to catalyze sustainable
infrastructure and climate technology investments across IPEF economies
that are party to the Clean Economy Agreement. The IPEF Clean Economy
Investor Forum will bring together the region’s largest investors,
innovative start-up entrepreneurs, cutting-edge project proponents, and
government agencies for matchmaking and investment facilitation.  
  
The United States also announced a new **PGI IPEF Investment Accelerator
to scale high-standard project financing to drive sustainable economic
growth in IPEF countries.** Through the PGI IPEF Investment Accelerator,
the United States will work with IPEF partners to develop
country-tailored investment approaches targeting key sectors identified
by the IPEF partners. This new one-stop-shop will increase
project-specific financing, upstream project development, and robust
private sector engagement to the benefit of IPEF partners. The
Accelerator will focus on high-standard outcomes, including strong
worker and environmental protections.    
  
As part of the Accelerator, USTDA is launching an **IPEF Project
Preparation Facility** that will bring in additional funding to support
the full life-cycle of project preparation while leveraging experienced
solutions from USTDA, including project planning, architectural and
engineering design, transactional advisory services, feasibility
studies, procurement assistance, and other technical assistance. The
Facility will be cabined to IPEF emerging markets and the U.S.
Government will make an initial contribution of $15 million.  
  
To support the proposed IPEF Supply Chain Agreement, Clean Economy
Agreement, and Fair Economy Agreement, the United States and its IPEF
partners are deepening their engagement with the private sector and
mobilizing investment through new programs, incentives, and
partnerships. IPEF partners are establishing the **IPEF Catalytic
Capital Fund** to pool resources and expand the pipeline of bankable
climate projects. The Private Infrastructure Development Group will
administer the fund and mobilize private capital by offering later-stage
support to projects such as lender due diligence, viability gap funding,
and other forms of concessional capital, in support of the IPEF
partners’ shared objectives and goals under the Clean Economy Agreement.
In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce entered into a new **public
private partnership** to mobilize engagement and investment from the
private and nonprofit sector to strengthen Indo-Pacific supply chains,
promote environmental sustainability, expand upskilling for workers, and
grow economic opportunity in the IPEF economies in support of the
objectives under these three agreements.   
  
**Key Investments in 2023 from the U.S. Government and U.S. Private
Sector in the Indo-Pacific**

    climate impact benefits, and accelerate the development of
    clean-energy transition projects in India through investments in
    solar, energy storage, and e-mobility.  The Fund, and all projects
    in which it invests will adhere to DFC’s environmental and social
    policies and procedures, as well as international environmental and
    social standards, including the IFC Performance Standards.

    larger-scale deployment of Open RAN technology in support of
    Kominfo’s mandate to provide universal access for all Indonesians.  
-   **USTDA announced a feasibility study for the State Railway of
    Thailand (SRT)** to help deploy a fleet of low or zero-emission
    battery shunter locomotives for use in Bangkok and other train

    SRT’s strategy to modernize its railway system while decarbonizing
    and improving air quality by reducing locomotive emissions.  
-   **USTDA announced a feasibility that will support the implementation
    of priority power interconnection across mainland Southeast Asia**.
