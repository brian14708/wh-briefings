title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Takes Historic Step to Advance Worker Empowerment,\
  \ Rights, and High Labor Standards\_Globally"
---
 
Today, President Biden signed the first-ever Presidential Memorandum
outlining the Administration’s commitment to worker rights globally.  In
doing so, President Biden is directing Federal departments and agencies
to advance labor rights and worker empowerment in their work abroad.  
  
President Biden is the most pro-worker President in history, and is
committed to building a sustainable global economy from the bottom up
and middle out. Together, he and Vice President Harris have committed to
ensuring high labor standards, bringing workers’ voices to the
decision-making table, and enforcing rules against unfair labor
practices – not just here at home, but around the world. Upholding
common standards and protecting fundamental rights are key for American
workers and American companies to compete fairly in the global
economy.  
  
Workers and labor organizations are key defenders of democracy.
Throughout history, in diverse contexts ranging from apartheid South
Africa to communist Poland, Brazil’s military rule, and Myanmar’s coup,
trade unions have been instrumental in citizen movements for democracy
and inclusion. U.S. actions to support workers’ right to organize will
help to preserve and expand civic space and ensure workers’ voices are
heard.  
  
The Memorandum signed by President Biden today organizes U.S. actions
around the following priority lines of effort:  

-   **Using Diplomacy, Economic Engagement, and Foreign Assistance to
    Promote Internationally Recognized Labor Rights, Worker Empowerment,
    and Organizing.**  The U.S. Government, through diplomacy, foreign
    assistance and programming, trade, and commerce, will strengthen
    engagement with governments, workers, labor organizations and trade
    unions, civil society, and the private sector to protect and promote
    respect for internationally recognized labor rights, including the
    prevention of forced labor, child labor, and other abuses.  
-   **Preventing and Responding Swiftly and Meaningfully to Threats,
    Intimidation, and Violence Against Trade Union Leaders, Labor Rights
    Defenders, and Labor Organizations.** Labor rights advocates and
    their organizations around the world can become targets for
    repression. Attacks on labor leaders and advocates are attacks on
    human rights defenders, and we will publicly, as appropriate,
    express our concern for the risks faced by those individuals,
    highlight cases of labor rights defenders on the front lines and
    under threat as appropriate, and support their protection.  
-   **Strengthening Capacity Across Federal Departments and Agencies to
    Lead a Global Labor Agenda.** U.S. global leadership on labor rights
    is needed urgently, and we must equip our departments and agencies
    to redouble our efforts. This will include enhanced training on
    labor rights across federal departments and agencies, and enhanced
    cross-agency coordination to advance labor priorities.  
-   **Engaging Multilateral Organizations and Building Coalitions to
    Advocate for Internationally Recognized Labor Rights, Worker
    Organizing, and Improved Global Labor Standards.** Consistent with
    President Biden’s commitment to multilateralism, the U.S. Government
    will seek global cooperation on improving international labor
    standards and build coalitions to protect internationally recognized
    labor rights. We will increase our engagement on labor issues in
    diverse multilateral forums and will invite partners to join us in
    our efforts.  
-   **Enhancing Trade Enforcement and Other Related Tools to Promote
    Internationally Recognized Labor Rights.** Protecting the rights of
    workers at home and abroad is an integral part of advancing a trade
    policy that contributes to inclusive economic growth.  The U.S.
    Government will expand ongoing efforts to promote trade and economic
    initiatives that advance labor rights, and reaffirms its commitment
    to using applicable enforcement tools to meaningfully address labor
    rights violations.

Today’s action builds upon the Executive Order establishing the White
House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment; the Multilateral
Partnership for Organizing, Worker Empowerment and Rights that is part
of the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal; and the recently
launched Partnership for Workers’ Rights with Brazilian President Lula
da Silva.

We look forward to working with partners and allies, workers, labor
unions, and other labor stakeholders, and with international
organizations to realize these goals.
