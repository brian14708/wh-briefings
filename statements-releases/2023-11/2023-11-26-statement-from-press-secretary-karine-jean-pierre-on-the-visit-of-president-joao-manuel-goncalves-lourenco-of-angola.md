President Biden looks forward to welcoming Angolan President João Manuel
Gonçalves Lourenço to the White House on Thursday, November 30.  The
leaders will mark 30-years of diplomatic relations and discuss next
steps to deepen our bilateral cooperation on trade, investment, climate
and energy, and to advance President Biden’s Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) project in the Lobito Corridor,
which will connect Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia
to global markets through Angola’s Lobito port. This meeting will build
on the tenets of the U.S.- Africa Leaders Summit, specifically how the
United States and African nations and people can continue working
together to address regional and global challenges.
