President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Abdel Fattah
Al-Sisi of Egypt to express his appreciation for Egypt’s efforts to
reach a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas together with a
humanitarian pause in Gaza.  They discussed coordination to further
surge humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza.  The President
reiterated that under no circumstances will the United States permit the
forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, or the
besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza.  He also
affirmed that under no circumstances can Gaza remain a sanctuary for
Hamas where they can threaten Israel and Palestinians alike and  imperil
any pathway to a durable peace.  The President affirmed his commitment
to the establishment of a Palestinian state and recognized Egypt’s
essential role in setting the conditions for that outcome.  The two
leaders agreed to remain in close contact over the coming days as the
deal to release hostages from Hamas is fully implemented.
