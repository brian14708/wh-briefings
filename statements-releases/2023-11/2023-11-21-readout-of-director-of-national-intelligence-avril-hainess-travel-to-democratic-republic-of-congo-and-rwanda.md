title: "Readout of Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines\u2019s Travel to\
  \ Democratic Republic of Congo and\_Rwanda"
---
 
Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril Haines travelled to Rwanda
and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on 19-20 November. The DNI was
joined by Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee
and Special Assistant to the President and NSC Senior Director for
African Affairs Judd Devermont.  
  
DNI Haines met with Rwandan President Kagame and Congolese President
Tshisekedi to secure commitments from both leaders to de-escalate
tensions in eastern DRC. Acknowledging the long history of conflict in
this region, Presidents Kagame and Tshisekedi plan to take specific
steps to reduce current tensions by addressing the respective security
concerns of both countries. The steps are drawn from previous
arrangements reached with the support of neighbors under the Luanda and
Nairobi processes.  
  
The U.S. government welcomes, and intends to monitor, these DRC and
Rwandan steps towards de-escalation, and plans to support diplomatic and
intelligence engagements between both countries to foster greater
security and prosperity for the Congolese and Rwandan peoples.
