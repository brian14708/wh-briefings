title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Congratulating Joseph Boakai as President-elect\
  \ of\_Liberia"

I congratulate Joseph Boakai on his election to be the next president of
Liberia.  These free and fair elections and presidential runoff
demonstrated Liberians’ commitment to making their voices heard through
the ballot box, and I look forward to working together to continue
deepening the ties between our nations and people in the years ahead.  
   
I also want to commend President Weah for respecting the will of the
people, and putting patriotism above politics.  As we discussed at the
U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last year, the peaceful transition of power
is a threshold liberty of democracy.  The people of Liberia have
exercised their constitutional right and demonstrated the power of that
truth.  And they have set a clear example for West Africa and the entire
world.  Democracy is a powerful tool for progress, and democracies can
deliver for our people.
