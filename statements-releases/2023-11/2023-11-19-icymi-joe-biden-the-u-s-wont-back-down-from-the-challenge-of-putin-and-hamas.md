challenge of Putin and
Hamas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/18/joe-biden-gaza-hamas-putin/)**  
\[President Joe Biden, 11/18/23\]  
  
Today, the world faces an inflection point, where the choices we make —
including in the crises in Europe and the Middle East — will determine
the direction of our future for generations to come.  
   
What will our world look like on the other side of these conflicts?  
   
Will we deny Hamas the ability to carry out pure, unadulterated evil?
Will Israelis and Palestinians one day live side by side in peace, with
two states for two peoples?  
   
Will we hold Vladimir Putin accountable for his aggression, so the
people of Ukraine can live free and Europe remains an anchor for global
peace and security?  
   
And the overarching question: Will we relentlessly pursue our positive
vision for the future, or will we allow those who do not share our
values to drag the world to a more dangerous and divided place?  
   
Both Putin and Hamas are fighting to wipe a neighboring democracy off
the map. And both Putin and Hamas hope to collapse broader regional
stability and integration and take advantage of the ensuing disorder.
America cannot, and will not, let that happen. For our own national
security interests — and for the good of the entire world.  
   
The United States is the essential nation. We rally allies and partners
to stand up to aggressors and make progress toward a brighter, more
peaceful future. The world looks to us to solve the problems of our
time. That is the duty of leadership, and America will lead. For if we
walk away from the challenges of today, the risk of conflict could
spread, and the costs to address them will only rise. We will not let
that happen.  
   
That conviction is at the root of my approach to supporting the people
of Ukraine as they continue to defend their freedom against Putin’s
brutal war.  
   
We know from two world wars in the past century that when aggression in
Europe goes unanswered, the crisis does not burn itself out. It draws
America in directly. That’s why our commitment to Ukraine today is an
investment in our own security. It prevents a broader conflict
tomorrow.  
   
We are keeping American troops out of this war by supporting the brave
Ukrainians defending their freedom and homeland. We are providing them
with weapons and economic assistance to stop Putin’s drive for conquest,
before the conflict spreads farther.  
   
The United States is not doing this alone. More than 50 nations have
joined us to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself. Our
partners are shouldering much of the economic responsibility for
supporting Ukraine. We have also built a stronger and more united NATO,
which enhances our security through the strength of our allies, while
making clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory to deter
further Russian aggression. Our allies in Asia are standing with us as
well to support Ukraine and hold Putin accountable, because they
understand that stability in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific are
inherently connected.  
   
We have also seen throughout history how conflicts in the Middle East
can unleash consequences around the globe.  
   
We stand firmly with the Israeli people as they defend themselves
against the murderous nihilism of Hamas. On Oct. 7, Hamas slaughtered
1,200 people, including 35 American citizens, in the worst atrocity
committed against the Jewish people in a single day since the Holocaust.
Infants and toddlers, mothers and fathers, grandparents, people with
disabilities, even Holocaust survivors were maimed and murdered. Entire
families were massacred in their homes. Young people were gunned down at
a music festival. Bodies riddled with bullets and burned beyond
recognition. And for over a month, the families of more than 200
hostages taken by Hamas, including babies and Americans, have been
living in hell, anxiously waiting to discover whether their loved ones
are alive or dead. At the time of this writing, my team and I are
working hour by hour, doing everything we can to get the hostages
released.  
   
And while Israelis are still in shock and suffering the trauma of this
attack, Hamas has promised that it will relentlessly try to repeat Oct.
7. It has said very clearly that it will not stop.  
   
The Palestinian people deserve a state of their own and a future free
from Hamas. I, too, am heartbroken by the images out of Gaza and the
deaths of many thousands of civilians, including children. Palestinian
children are crying for lost parents. Parents are writing their child’s
name on their hand or leg so they can be identified if the worst
happens. Palestinian nurses and doctors are trying desperately to save
every precious life they possibly can, with little to no resources.
Every innocent Palestinian life lost is a tragedy that rips apart
families and communities.  
   
Our goal should not be simply to stop the war for today — it should be
to end the war forever, break the cycle of unceasing violence, and build
something stronger in Gaza and across the Middle East so that history
does not keep repeating itself.  
   
Just weeks before Oct. 7, I met in New York with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. The main subject of that conversation was a set of
substantial commitments that would help both Israel and the Palestinian
territories better integrate into the broader Middle East. That is also
the idea behind the innovative economic corridor that will connect India
to Europe through the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and
Israel, which I announced together with partners at the Group of 20
summit in India in early September. Stronger integration between
countries creates predictable markets and draws greater investment.
Better regional connection — including physical and economic
infrastructure — supports higher employment and more opportunities for
young people. That’s what we have been working to realize in the Middle
East. It is a future that has no place for Hamas’s violence and hate,
and I believe that attempting to destroy the hope for that future is one
reason that Hamas instigated this crisis.  
   
This much is clear: A two-state solution is the only way to ensure the
long-term security of both the Israeli and Palestinian people. Though
right now it may seem like that future has never been further away, this
crisis has made it more imperative than ever.  
   
A two-state solution — two peoples living side by side with equal
measures of freedom, opportunity and dignity — is where the road to
peace must lead. Reaching it will take commitments from Israelis and
Palestinians, as well as from the United States and our allies and
partners. That work must start now.  
   
To that end, the United States has proposed basic principles for how to
move forward from this crisis, to give the world a foundation on which
to build.  
   
To start, Gaza must never again be used as a platform for terrorism.
There must be no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, no
reoccupation, no siege or blockade, and no reduction in territory. And
after this war is over, the voices of Palestinian people and their
aspirations must be at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza.  
   
As we strive for peace, Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under
a single governance structure, ultimately under a revitalized
Palestinian Authority, as we all work toward a two-state solution. I
have been emphatic with Israel’s leaders that extremist violence against
Palestinians in the West Bank must stop and that those committing the
violence must be held accountable. The United States is prepared to take
our own steps, including issuing visa bans against extremists attacking
civilians in the West Bank.  
   
The international community must commit resources to support the people
of Gaza in the immediate aftermath of this crisis, including interim
security measures, and establish a reconstruction mechanism to
sustainably meet Gaza’s long-term needs. And it is imperative that no
terrorist threats ever again emanate from Gaza or the West Bank.  
   
If we can agree on these first steps, and take them together, we can
begin to imagine a different future. In the months ahead, the United
States will redouble our efforts to establish a more peaceful,
integrated and prosperous Middle East — a region where a day like Oct. 7
is unthinkable.  
   
In the meantime, we will continue working to prevent this conflict from
spreading and escalating further. I ordered two U.S. carrier groups to
the region to enhance deterrence. We are going after Hamas and those who
finance and facilitate its terrorism, levying multiple rounds of
sanctions to degrade Hamas’s financial structure, cutting it off from
outside funding and blocking access to new funding channels, including
via social media. I have also been clear that the United States will do
what is necessary to defend U.S. troops and personnel stationed across
the Middle East — and we have responded multiple times to the strikes
against us.  
   
I also immediately traveled to Israel — the first American president to
do so during wartime — to show solidarity with the Israeli people and
reaffirm to the world that the United States has Israel’s back. Israel
must defend itself. That is its right. And while in Tel Aviv, I also
counseled Israelis against letting their hurt and rage mislead them into
making mistakes we ourselves have made in the past.  
   
From the very beginning, my administration has called for respecting
international humanitarian law, minimizing the loss of innocent lives
and prioritizing the protection of civilians. Following Hamas’s attack
on Israel, aid to Gaza was cut off, and food, water and medicine
reserves dwindled rapidly. As part of my travel to Israel, I worked
closely with the leaders of Israel and Egypt to reach an agreement to
restart the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to Gazans.
Within days, trucks with supplies again began to cross the border.
Today, nearly 100 aid trucks enter Gaza from Egypt each day, and we
continue working to increase the flow of assistance manyfold. I’ve also
advocated for humanitarian pauses in the conflict to permit civilians to
depart areas of active fighting and to help ensure that aid reaches
those in need. Israel took the additional step to create two
humanitarian corridors and implement daily four-hour pauses in the
fighting in northern Gaza to allow Palestinian civilians to flee to
safer areas in the south.  
   
This stands in stark opposition to Hamas’s terrorist strategy: hide
among Palestinian civilians. Use children and innocents as human
shields. Position terrorist tunnels beneath hospitals, schools, mosques
and residential buildings. Maximize the death and suffering of innocent
people — Israeli and Palestinian. If Hamas cared at all for Palestinian
lives, it would release all the hostages, give up arms, and surrender
the leaders and those responsible for Oct. 7.  
   
As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a cease-fire is
not peace. To Hamas’s members, every cease-fire is time they exploit to
rebuild their stockpile of rockets, reposition fighters and restart the
killing by attacking innocents again. An outcome that leaves Hamas in
control of Gaza would once more perpetuate its hate and deny Palestinian
civilians the chance to build something better for themselves.  
   
And here at home, in moments when fear and suspicion, anger and rage run
hard, we have to work even harder to hold on to the values that make us
who we are. We’re a nation of religious freedom and freedom of
expression. We all have a right to debate and disagree and peacefully
protest, but without fear of being targeted at schools or workplaces or
elsewhere in our communities.  
   
In recent years, too much hate has been given too much oxygen, fueling
racism and an alarming rise in antisemitism in America. That has
intensified in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks. Jewish families worry
about being targeted in school, while wearing symbols of their faith on
the street or otherwise going about their daily lives. At the same time,
too many Muslim Americans, Arab Americans and Palestinian Americans, and
so many other communities, are outraged and hurting, fearing the
resurgence of the Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11.  
   
We can’t stand by when hate rears its head. We must, without
equivocation, denounce antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of
hate and bias. We must renounce violence and vitriol and see each other
not as enemies but as fellow Americans.  
   
In a moment of so much violence and suffering — in Ukraine, Israel, Gaza
and so many other places — it can be difficult to imagine that something
different is possible. But we must never forget the lesson learned time
and again throughout our history: Out of great tragedy and upheaval,
enormous progress can come. More hope. More freedom. Less rage. Less
grievance. Less war. We must not lose our resolve to pursue those goals,
because now is when clear vision, big ideas and political courage are
needed most. That is the strategy that my administration will continue
to lead — in the Middle East, Europe and around the globe. Every step we
take toward that future is progress that makes the world safer and the
United States of America more secure.
