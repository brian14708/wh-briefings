title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Hostage Release in\_Gaza"
---
 
I welcome the deal to secure the release of hostages taken by the
terrorist group Hamas during its brutal assault against Israel on
October 7th. 

Jill and I have been keeping all those held hostage and their loved ones
close to our hearts these many weeks, and I am extraordinarily gratified
that some of these brave souls, who have endured weeks of captivity and
an unspeakable ordeal, will be reunited with their families once this
deal is fully implemented.

I thank Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar and President
Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt for their critical leadership and
partnership in reaching this deal.  And I appreciate the commitment that
Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government have made in supporting an
extended pause to ensure this deal can be fully carried out and to
ensure the provision of additional humanitarian assistance to alleviate
the suffering of innocent Palestinian families in Gaza. I look forward
to speaking with each of these leaders and staying in close contact as
we work to ensure this deal is carried through in its entirety. It is
important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented.

As President, I have no higher priority than ensuring the safety of
Americans held hostage around the world. That’s why—from the earliest
moments of Hamas’s brutal assault—my national security team and I have
worked closely with regional partners to do everything possible to
secure the release of our fellow citizens.  We saw the first results of
that effort in late October, when two Americans were reunited with their
loved ones.  Today’s deal should bring home additional American
hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released. 

Today’s deal is a testament to the tireless diplomacy and determination
of many dedicated individuals across the United States Government to
bring Americans home.
