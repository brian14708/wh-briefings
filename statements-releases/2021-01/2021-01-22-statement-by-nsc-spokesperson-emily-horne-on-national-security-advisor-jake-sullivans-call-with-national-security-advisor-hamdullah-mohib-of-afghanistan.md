National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke this morning with Afghan
National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib regarding the U.S. commitment
to the U.S.-Afghan partnership and to peace for all the people of
Afghanistan. Mr. Sullivan underscored that the U.S. will support the
peace process with a robust and regional diplomatic effort, which will
aim to help the two sides achieve a durable and just political
settlement and permanent ceasefire. Mr. Sullivan also made clear the
United States’ intention to review the February 2020 U.S.-Taliban
agreement, including to assess whether the Taliban was living up to its
commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in
Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan
government and other stakeholders. He expressed America’s desire that
all Afghan leaders embrace this historic opportunity for peace and
stability. The National Security Advisors discussed the United States’
support for protecting the extraordinary gains made by Afghan women,
girls, and minority groups as part of the peace process. Mr. Sullivan
committed to consulting closely with the Government of Afghanistan, NATO
allies, and regional partners regarding a collective strategy to support
a stable, sovereign, and secure future for Afghanistan.
