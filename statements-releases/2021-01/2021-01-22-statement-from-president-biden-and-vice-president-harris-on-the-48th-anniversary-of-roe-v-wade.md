title: "Statement from President\_Biden and Vice President Harris on the 48th Anniversary\
  \ of Roe v.\_Wade"
---
 
Today marks the 48th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark
ruling in *Roe v. Wade*.  

In the past four years, reproductive health, including the right to
choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack.  We are deeply
committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including
reproductive health care – regardless of income, race, zip code, health
insurance status, or immigration status. 

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to codifying *Roe v. Wade*
and appointing judges that respect foundational precedents like Roe.  We
are also committed to ensuring that we work to eliminate maternal and
infant health disparities, increase access to contraception, and support
families economically so that all parents can raise their families with
dignity.  This commitment extends to our critical work on health
outcomes around the world. 

As the Biden-Harris Administration begins in this critical moment, now
is the time to rededicate ourselves to ensuring that all individuals
have access to the health care they need.
