-   As the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the U.S. economy into crisis,
    millions of Americans are unemployment, falling behind on rent
    payment, or struggling with food security. 

<!-- -->

-   And, because of pervasive system racism and inequality, the burdens
    of the economic crisis are hitting communities of color and
    underserved families the hardest.

<!-- -->

-   Today, President Biden is taking new executive actions to deliver
    economic relief for American families and businesses amid the
    COVID-19 crisis while addressing the racial inequities it has
    exacerbated. 

<!-- -->

-   The President is also issuing an Executive Order that will launch an
    all-of-government effort to provide equitable emergency economic
    relief to working families, communities, and small businesses across
    the nation. The all-of-government effort will:
    -   **Address the growing hunger crisis facing 29 million Americans
        — and as many as 12 million children –** by asking the U.S.
        Department of Agriculture to consider expanding and extending
        federal nutrition assistance programs. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Ensure equitable and effective delivery of direct payments —**
        **by asking the Treasury Department to change its delivery
        structure** and focus on getting relief to the 8 million
        Americans who still have not received the financial assistance
        to which they are entitled.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Help approximately 2 million veterans maintain their financial
        footing** by asking the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to
        consider pausing federal collections on overpayments and debts. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Help ensure that unemployed Americans no longer have to choose
        between paying their bills and keeping themselves and their
        families safe from COVID-19** by asking the U.S. Department of
        Labor to clarify that workers who refuse unsafe working
        conditions can still receive unemployment insurance.
    -   **Enable effective and equitable distribution of government
        assistance** by establishing an interagency benefit coordination
        structure.

<!-- -->

-   While the President will continues working with Congress to take
    bold action that will help working families through the remainder of
    the crisis, he is taking these emergency measures and important
    steps to give millions of Americans real relief during the
    pandemic. 

<!-- -->

-   The all-of-government executive order, combined with the President’s
    historic relief package and forthcoming jobs package will help
    Americans persevere through the pandemic and lay the foundation for
    a strong and equitable recovery.
