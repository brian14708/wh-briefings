title: "Fact Sheet: President\_Biden Sends Immigration Bill to Congress as Part of\
  \ His Commitment to Modernize our Immigration\_System"
---
 
*The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 establishes a new system to
responsibly manage and secure our border, keep our families and
communities safe, and better manage migration across the Hemisphere*

President Biden is sending a bill to Congress on day one to restore
humanity and American values to our immigration system. The bill
provides hardworking people who enrich our communities every day and who
have lived here for years, in some cases for decades, an opportunity to
earn citizenship. The legislation modernizes our immigration system, and
prioritizes keeping families together, growing our economy, responsibly
managing the border with smart investments, addressing the root causes
of migration from Central America, and ensuring that the United States
remains a refuge for those fleeing persecution. The bill will stimulate
our economy while ensuring that every worker is protected. The bill
creates an earned path to citizenship for our immigrant neighbors,
colleagues, parishioners, community leaders, friends, and loved
ones—including Dreamers and the essential workers who have risked their
lives to serve and protect American communities.

The U.S. Citizenship Act will:

**PROVIDE PATHWAYS TO CITIZENSHIP & STRENGTHEN LABOR PROTECTIONS**

-   **Create an earned roadmap to citizenship for undocumented
    individuals.** The bill allows undocumented individuals to apply for
    temporary legal status, with the ability to apply for green cards
    after five years if they pass criminal and national security
    background checks and pay their taxes. Dreamers, TPS holders, and
    immigrant farmworkers who meet specific requirements are eligible
    for green cards immediately under the legislation. After three
    years, all green card holders who pass additional background checks
    and demonstrate knowledge of English and U.S. civics can apply to
    become citizens. Applicants must be physically present in the United
    States on or before January 1, 2021. The Secretary of the Department
    of Homeland Security (DHS) may waive the presence requirement for
    those deported on or after January 20, 2017 who were physically
    present for at least three years prior to removal for family unity
    and other humanitarian purposes. Lastly, the bill further recognizes
    America as a nation of immigrants by changing the word “alien” to
    “noncitizen” in our immigration laws.
-   **Keep families together. **The bill reforms the family-based
    immigration system by clearing backlogs, recapturing unused visas,
    eliminating lengthy wait times, and increasing per-country visa
    caps.  It also eliminates the so-called “3 and 10-year bars,” and
    other provisions that keep families apart. The bill further supports
    familes by more explicitly including permanent partnerships and
    eliminating discrimination facing LGBTQ+ families. It also provides
    protections for orphans, widows, children, and Filipino veterans who
    fought alongside the United States in World War II. Lastly, the bill
    allows immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join
    family in the United States on a temporary basis while they wait for
    green cards to become available.
-   **Embrace diversity. ** The bill includes the NO BAN Act that
    prohibits discrimination based on religion and limits presidential
    authority to issue future bans. The bill also increases Diversity
    Visas to 80,000 from 55,000.
-   **Promote immigrant and refugee integration and citizenship. **The
    bill provides new funding to state and local governments, private
    organizations, educational institutions, community-based
    organizations, and not-for-profit organizations to expand programs
    to promote integration and inclusion, increase English-language
    instruction, and provide assistance to individuals seeking to become
    citizens.
-   **Grow our economy.** This bill clears employment-based visa
    backlogs, recaptures unused visas, reduces lengthy wait times, and
    eliminates per-country visa caps. The bill makes it easier for
    graduates of U.S. universities with advanced STEM degrees to stay in
    the United States; improves access to green cards for workers in
    lower-wage sectors; and eliminates other unnecessary hurdles for
    employment-based green cards. The bill provides dependents of H-1B
    visa holders work authorization, and children are prevented from
    “aging out” of the system. The bill also creates a pilot program to
    stimulate regional economic development, gives DHS the authority to
    adjust green cards based on macroeconomic conditions, and
    incentivizes higher wages for non-immigrant, high-skilled visas to
    prevent unfair competition with American workers.
-   **Protect workers from exploitation and improve the employment
    verification process. **The bill requires that DHS and the
    Department of Labor establish a commission involving labor,
    employer, and civil rights organizations to make recommendations for
    improving the employment verification process. Workers who suffer
    serious labor violations and cooperate with worker protection
    agencies will be granted greater access to U visa relief. The bill
    protects workers who are victims of workplace retaliation from
    deportation in order to allow labor agencies to interview these
    workers. It also protects migrant and seasonal workers, and
    increases penalties for employers who violate labor laws.

**PRIORITIZE SMART BORDER CONTROLS**

-   **Supplement existing border resources with technology and
    infrastructure. **The legislation builds on record budget
    allocations for immigration enforcement by authorizing additional
    funding for the Secretary of DHS to develop and implement a plan to
    deploy technology to expedite screening and enhance the ability to
    identify narcotics and other contraband at every land, air, and sea
    port of entry.  This includes high-throughput scanning technologies
    to ensure that all commercial and passenger vehicles and freight
    rail traffic entering the United States at land ports of entry and
    rail-border crossings along the border undergo pre-primary scanning.
    It also authorizes and provides funding for plans to improve
    infrastructure at ports of entry to enhance the ability to process
    asylum seekers and detect, interdict, disrupt and prevent narcotics
    from entering the United States. It authorizes the DHS Secretary to
    develop and implement a strategy to manage and secure the southern
    border between ports of entry that focuses on flexible solutions and
    technologies that expand the ability to detect illicit activity,
    evaluate the effectiveness of border security operations, and be
    easily relocated and broken out by Border Patrol Sector. To protect
    privacy, the DHS Inspector General is authorized to conduct
    oversight to ensure that employed technology effectively serves
    legitimate agency purposes.
-   **Manage the border and protect border communities. ** The bill
    provides funding for training and continuing education to promote
    agent and officer safety and professionalism. It also creates a
    Border Community Stakeholder Advisory Committee, provides more
    special agents at the DHS Office of Professional Responsibility to
    investigate criminal and administrative misconduct, and requires the
    issuance of department-wide policies governing the use of force. The
    bill directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the
    impact of DHS’s authority to waive environmental and state and
    federal laws to expedite the construction of barriers and roads near
    U.S. borders and provides for additional rescue beacons to prevent
    needless deaths along the border. The bill authorizes and provides
    funding for DHS, in coordination with the Department of Health and
    Human Services (HHS) and nongovernmental experts, to develop
    guidelines and protocols for standards of care for individuals,
    families, and children in CBP custody.
-   **Crack down on criminal organizations.** The bill enhances the
    ability to prosecute individuals involved in smuggling and
    trafficking networks who are responsible for the exploitation of
    migrants. It also expands investigations, intelligence collection
    and analysis pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation
    Act to increase sanctions against foreign narcotics traffickers,
    their organizations and networks. The bill also requires the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and
    DHS, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to improve and
    expand transnational anti-gang task forces in Central America.

**ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION**

-   **Start from the source.** The bill codifies and funds the
    President’s $4 billion four-year inter-agency plan to address the
    underlying causes of migration in the region, including by
    increasing assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras,
    conditioned on their ability to reduce the endemic corruption,
    violence, and poverty that causes people to flee their home
    countries. It also creates safe and legal channels for people to
    seek protection, including by establishing Designated Processing
    Centers throughout Central America to register and process displaced
    persons for refugee resettlement and other lawful migration
    avenues—either to the United States or other partner countries. The
    bill also re-institutes the Central American Minors program to
    reunite children with U.S. relatives and creates a Central American
    Family Reunification Parole Program to more quickly unite families
    with approved family sponsorship petitions.
-   **Improve the immigration courts and protect vulnerable
    individuals.** The bill expands family case management programs,
    reduces immigration court backlogs, expands training for immigration
    judges, and improves technology for immigration courts. The bill
    also restores fairness and balance to our immigration system by
    providing judges and adjudicators with discretion to review cases
    and grant relief to deserving individuals. Funding is authorized for
    legal orientation programs and counsel for children, vulnerable
    individuals, and others when necessary to ensure the fair and
    efficient resolution of their claims. The bill also provides funding
    for school districts educating unaccompanied children, while
    clarifying sponsor responsibilities for such children.
-   **Support asylum seekers and other vulnerable populations.** The
    bill eliminates the one-year deadline for filing asylum claims and
    provides funding to reduce asylum application backlogs. It also
    increases protections for U visa, T visa, and VAWA applicants,
    including by raising the cap on U visas from 10,000 to 30,000. The
    bill also expands protections for foreign nationals assisting U.S.
    troops.
