*Biden-Harris Administration Commits to Investing in American Workers
and Companies*

Today, while many American businesses are on the brink of having to
close their doors because of the crises that our country faces,
President Biden will sign an Executive Order to support manufacturers,
businesses, and workers to ensure that our future is made in all of
America by all of America’s workers.

With this order, President Biden is ensuring that when the federal
government spends taxpayer dollars they are spent on American made goods
by American workers and with American-made component parts. This
Executive Order fulfills President Biden’s promise to make Buy American
real and close loopholes that allow companies to offshore production and
jobs while still qualifying for domestic preferences.

President Biden’s executive action will ensure that the federal
government is investing taxpayer dollars in American businesses—both
small and large. These investments will help create well-paid, union
jobs, and build our economy back better so that everybody has a fair
shot at the middle class. They will buy from all of America—including
minority entrepreneurs and businesses in every region in our country.
And, they will support the manufacturing capabilities and technology
needed to build a clean energy future and strengthen our national
security, and give our workers and companies the tools they need to
compete globally for decades to come.

This executive action is a part of the President’s broader commitment to
increase investments in manufacturing industries and workers in order to
Build Back Better. The President is committed to working on a bipartisan
basis to advance this work, including with members of Congress who have
been leaders on Buy American and Buy America for years.

**<u>MADE IN AMERICA EXECUTIVE ORDER</u>**

The dollars the federal government spends on goods and services are a
powerful tool to support American workers and manufacturers. 
Contracting alone accounts for nearly $600 billion in federal spending.
Federal law requires government agencies to give preferences to American
firms, however, these preferences have not always been implemented
consistently or effectively. And, some of these requirements, which
shape how the government preferences domestic goods and services in what
it buys, have not been substantially updated since 1954, during the
Eisenhower Administration. It is long overdue that the U.S. government
utilizes the full force of current domestic preferences to support
America’s workers and businesses, strengthening our economy, workers,
and communities across the country.

The President is taking action to reset the U.S. government’s
longstanding approach to domestic preferences to create an approach that
will remain durable for years to come and grow quality, union jobs. The
President’s Executive Order establishes the goals and standards
necessary to use federal purchasing, and other forms of federal
assistance with domestic preference requirements, as a way to
proactively invest in American industry so it can continue to lead in
the global marketplace.

For purposes of this fact sheet and the Executive Order,
“Made-in-America” refers to domestic preferences related to federal
procurement, federal grants, and other forms of federal assistance. Buy
American and Buy America refers to the specific statutes that go by
those names.

This Order directs a process for updating domestic preferences to fit
the current realities of the American economy. The Executive Order:

-   **Directs agencies to close current loopholes in how domestic
    content is measured and increase domestic content requirements**.
    Existing Buy American rules establish a domestic content threshold –
    the amount of a product that must be made in the U.S. for a purchase
    to qualify under Buy American law. This Executive Order directs an
    increase in both the threshold and the price preferences for
    domestic goods – the difference in price over which government can
    by a product from a non-US supplier.  It also updates how government
    decides if a product was sufficiently made in America, building a
    stronger foundation for the enforcement of Buy American laws.
-   **Appoints a new senior leader in the Executive Office of the
    President in charge of the government’s Made-in-America policy
    approach.** A bold approach to Made-in-America requires leadership
    and accountability. The new Director of Made-in-America at the
    Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will oversee the
    implementation of this Executive Order, make sure the President’s
    new rules are followed, work with key stakeholders, and carry
    through the President’s vision in conjunction with their executive
    agency partners.
-   **Increases oversight of potential waivers to domestic preference
    laws.** This order creates a central review of agency waivers of Buy
    American requirements, fulfilling the President’s commitment to
    crack down on unnecessary waivers. It also directs the General
    Services Administration to publish relevant waivers on a publicly
    available website.
-   **Connects new businesses to contracting opportunities by requiring
    active use of supplier scouting by agencies.** This Executive Order
    directs agencies to utilize the Manufacturing Extension Partnership
    — a national network in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, that supports
    small and medium-size manufacturers — to help agencies connect with
    new domestic suppliers who can make the products they need while
    employing America’s workers.
-   **Reiterates the President’s strong support for the Jones Act.** The
    President will continue to be a strong advocate for the Jones Act
    and its mandate that only U.S.-flag vessels carry cargo between U.S.
    ports, which supports American production and America’s workers.
    With the signing of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, the
    Jones Act has also been affirmed as an opportunity to invest in
    America’s workers as we build offshore renewable energy, in line
    with the President’s goals to build our clean energy future here in
    America.
-   **Directs a cross-agency review of all domestic preferences**. The
    order requires agencies to report on their implementation of current
    Made in America laws and make recommendations for achieving the
    President’s Made in America goals, and to continue to do so on a
    bi-annual basis. This review includes a requirement that agencies
    submit recommendations for ways to ensure items offered to the
    general public on federal property are Made in America — to the
    fullest extent possible—and to consider service industries in
    addition to manufacturing.

**Supporting America’s Workers through Federal Purchasing** This order
is deeply intertwined with the President’s commitment to invest in
American manufacturing, including clean energy and critical supply
chains, grow good-paying, union jobs, and advance racial equity. The
federal government should buy from suppliers that are growing the
sectors of the future and treating their workers with dignity and
respect. The President remains committed to working with partners and
allies to modernize international trade rules—including those related to
government procurement–to make sure all countries can use their taxpayer
dollars to spur investment in their own countries.
