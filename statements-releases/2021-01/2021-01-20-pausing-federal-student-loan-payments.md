title: "Pausing Federal Student Loan\_Payments"
---
 
At the request of President Biden, the Acting Secretary of Education
will extend the pause on federal student loan payments and collections
and keep the interest rate at 0%. Too many Americans are struggling to
pay for basic necessities and to provide for their families. They should
not be forced to choose between paying their student loans and putting
food on the table.Â
