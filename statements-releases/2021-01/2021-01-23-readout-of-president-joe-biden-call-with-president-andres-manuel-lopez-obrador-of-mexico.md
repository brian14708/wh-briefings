President Biden spoke with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador
yesterday to review bilateral cooperation on a range of bilateral and
regional issues, particularly regional migration. The President outlined
his plan to reduce migration by addressing its root causes, increasing
resettlement capacity and lawful alternative immigration pathways,
improving processing at the border to adjudicate requests for asylum,
and reversing the previous administration’s draconian immigration
policies. The two leaders agreed to work closely to stem the flow of
irregular migration to Mexico and the United States, as well as to
promote development in the Northern Triangle of Central America. They
also recognized the importance of coordination to combat the COVID-19
pandemic.
