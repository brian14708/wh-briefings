The United States is alarmed by reports that the Burmese military has
taken steps to undermine the country’s democratic transition, including
the arrest of State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian
officials in Burma. President Biden has been briefed by National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. We continue to affirm our strong support
for Burma’s democratic institutions and, in coordination with our
regional partners, urge the military and all other parties to adhere to
democratic norms and the rule of law, and to release those detained
today. The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of
recent elections or impede Myanmar’s democratic transition, and will
take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed.
We are monitoring the situation closely and stand with the people of
Burma, who have already endured so much in their quest for democracy and
peace.
