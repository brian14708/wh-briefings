title: "President Joe\_Biden Announces Acting Federal Agency\_Leadership"
---
 
WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced the acting agency
leadership across the administration to assist in the next phase of the
transition of government. These individuals, nearly all of whom are
career civil servants, will temporarily lead federal agencies while
Cabinet nominees continue moving through the confirmation process.

These public servants have significant experience in the agencies they
will now temporarily lead. They will play an important role as the Biden
administration prepares to coordinate a whole-of-government approach to
tackle the challenges facing the nation, restore trust in our
government, and ensure the federal government — and its many agencies —
serves the American people.

**President Joe Biden said**, “These public servants, like so many
across the federal government, are dedicated to serving the American
people, not a political party or agenda. Their experience in government
and commitment to service will allow this administration to take the
reins as we prepare to get the pandemic under control and our economy
moving once again. I am thankful for their willingness to step-up to
lead during these difficult times and help us make sure the government
continues to operate and serve the American people. Together, we are
restoring trust in the federal government and building our nation back
better.”

**Vice President Kamala Harris said**, “Protecting our nation’s
interests abroad, rebuilding our economy, and confronting the
coronavirus pandemic requires a team of dedicated experts. The acting
leaders announced today are more than capable of helping with this
incredible task. Many of them have dedicated their careers to public
service, and I, on behalf of a grateful nation, am thankful for their
willingness to temporarily serve in these critical first days of the
administration.”
