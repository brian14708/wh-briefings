*Biden-Harris Administration Commits on Climate Change – Creating Jobs,
Building Infrastructure, and Delivering Environmental Justice*

Today, President Biden will take executive action to tackle the climate
crisis at home and abroad while creating good-paying union jobs and
equitable clean energy future, building modern and sustainable
infrastructure, restoring scientific integrity and evidence-based
policymaking across the federal government, and re-establishing the
President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.  
  
These Executive Orders follow through on President Biden’s promise to
take aggressive action to tackle climate change and build on the
executive actions that the President took on his first day in office,
including rejoining the Paris Agreement and immediate review of harmful
rollbacks of standards that protect our air, water, and communities.  
  
President Biden set ambitious goals that will ensure America and the
world can meet the urgent demands of the climate crisis, while
empowering American workers and businesses to lead a clean energy
revolution that achieves a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035
and puts the United States on an irreversible path to a net-zero economy
by 2050. Today’s actions advance those goals and ensure that we are
tapping into the talent, grit, and innovation of American workers,
revitalizing the U.S. energy sector, conserving our natural resources
and leveraging them to help drive our nation toward a clean energy
future, creating well-paying jobs with the opportunity to join a union,
and delivering justice for communities who have been subjected to
environmental harm.  
  
President Biden will also sign an important Presidential Memorandum on
scientific integrity to send a clear message that the Biden-Harris
Administration will protect scientists from political interference and
ensure they can think, research, and speak freely to provide valuable
information and insights to the American people. Additionally, and in
line with the scientific-integrity memorandum’s charge to reestablish
scientific advisory committees, President Biden will sign an Executive
Order re-establishing the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology.  
  
**TACKLING THE CLIMATE CRISIS AT HOME AND ABROAD EXECUTIVE ORDER**  
  
Today’s Executive Order takes bold steps to combat the climate crisis
both at home and throughout the world. In signing this Executive Order,
President Biden has directed his Administration to:  
  
**Center the Climate Crisis in U.S. Foreign Policy and National Security
Considerations**

-   The order clearly establishes climate considerations as an essential
    element of U.S. foreign policy and national security. 
-   The order affirms that, in implementing – and building on – the
    Paris Agreement’s objectives, the United States will exercise its
    leadership to promote a significant increase in global ambition. It
    makes clear that both significant short-term global emission
    reductions and net zero global emissions by mid-century – or before
    – are required to avoid setting the world on a dangerous,
    potentially catastrophic, climate trajectory. 
-   The order reaffirms that the President will host a Leaders’ Climate
    Summit on Earth Day, April 22, 2021; that the United States will
    reconvene the Major Economies Forum; that, to underscore the
    administration’s commitment to elevating climate in U.S. foreign
    policy, the President has created a new position, the Special
    Presidential Envoy for Climate, which will have a seat on the
    National Security Council, and that it will be a U.S. priority to
    press for enhanced climate ambition and integration of climate
    considerations across a wide range of international fora.
-   The order also kicks off the process of developing the United
    States’ “nationally determined contribution” – our emission
    reduction target – under the Paris Agreement, as well as a climate
    finance plan.
-   Among numerous other steps aimed at prioritizing climate in U.S.
    foreign policy and national security, the order directs the Director
    of National Intelligence to prepare a National Intelligence Estimate
    on the security implications of climate change, the State Department
    to prepare a transmittal package to the Senate for the Kigali
    Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, and all agencies to develop
    strategies for integrating climate considerations into their
    international work.

**Take a Whole-of-Government Approach to the Climate Crisis**

-   The order formally establishes the White House Office of Domestic
    Climate Policy – led by the first-ever National Climate Advisor and
    Deputy National Climate Advisor – creating a central office in the
    White House that is charged with coordinating and implementing the
    President’s domestic climate agenda.
-   The order establishes the National Climate Task Force, assembling
    leaders from across 21 federal agencies and departments to enable a
    whole-of-government approach to combatting the climate crisis.

**Leverage the Federal Government’s Footprint and Buying Power to Lead
by Example**

-   Consistent with the goals of the President’s Build Back Better jobs
    and economic recovery plan, of which his clean energy jobs plan is a
    central pillar, the order directs the federal agencies to procure
    carbon pollution-free electricity and clean, zero-emission vehicles
    to create good-paying, union jobs and stimulate clean energy
    industries.
-   In addition, the order requires those purchases be Made in America,
    following President Biden’s Buy American executive order. The order
    also directs agencies to apply and strictly enforce the prevailing
    wage and benefit guidelines of the Davis Bacon and other acts and
    encourage Project Labor Agreements. These actions reaffirm that
    agencies should work to ensure that any jobs created with funds to
    address the climate crisis are good jobs with a choice to join a
    union.
-   The order directs each federal agency to develop a plan to increase
    the resilience of its facilities and operations to the impacts of
    climate change and directs relevant agencies to report on ways to
    expand and improve climate forecast capabilities – helping
    facilitate public access to climate related information and
    assisting governments, communities, and businesses in preparing for
    and adapting to the impacts of climate change.
-   The order directs the Secretary of the Interior to pause on entering
    into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore
    waters to the extent possible, launch a rigorous review of all
    existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel
    development on public lands and waters, and identify steps that can
    be taken to double renewable energy production from offshore wind
    by 2030. The order does not restrict energy activities on lands that
    the United States holds in trust for Tribes. The Secretary of the
    Interior will continue to consult with Tribes regarding the
    development and management of renewable and conventional energy
    resources, in conformance with the U.S. government’s trust
    responsibilities.
-   The order directs federal agencies to eliminate fossil fuel
    subsidies as consistent with applicable law and identify new
    opportunities to spur innovation, commercialization, and deployment
    of clean energy technologies and infrastructure. 

**Rebuild Our Infrastructure for a Sustainable Economy**

-   The order catalyzes the creation of jobs in construction,
    manufacturing, engineering and the skilled-trades by directing steps
    to ensure that every federal infrastructure investment reduces
    climate pollution and that steps are taken to accelerate clean
    energy and transmission projects under federal siting and permitting
    processes in an environmentally sustainable manner.

**Advance Conservation, Agriculture, and Reforestation**

-   The order commits to the goal of conserving at least 30 percent of
    our lands and oceans by 2030 and launches a process for stakeholder
    engagement from agricultural and forest landowners, fishermen,
    Tribes, States, Territories, local officials, and others to identify
    strategies that will result in broad participation. 
-   The order also calls for the establishment of a Civilian Climate
    Corps Initiative to put a new generation of Americans to work
    conserving and restoring public lands and waters, increasing
    reforestation, increasing carbon sequestration in the agricultural
    sector, protecting biodiversity, improving access to recreation, and
    addressing the changing climate.
-   The order directs the Secretary of Agriculture to collect input from
    farmers, ranchers, and other stakeholders on how to use federal
    programs to encourage adoption of climate-smart agricultural
    practices that produce verifiable carbon reductions and
    sequestrations and create new sources of income and jobs for rural
    Americans.

**Revitalize Energy Communities**

-   The order establishes an Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power
    Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization, to be co-chaired by
    the National Climate Advisor and the Director of the National
    Economic Council, and directs federal agencies to coordinate
    investments and other efforts to assist coal, oil and natural gas,
    and power plant communities. 
-   The order tasks the new Interagency Working Group to advance
    projects that reduce emissions of toxic substances and greenhouse
    gases from existing and abandoned infrastructure and that prevent
    environmental damage that harms communities and poses a risk to
    public health and safety – such as projects to reduce methane
    emissions, oil and brine leaks, and other environmental harms from
    tens of thousands of former mining and well sites.
-   In addition, the new Interagency Working Group is also directed to
    explore efforts to turn properties idled in these communities, like
    brownfields, into new hubs for the growth of our economy.

**Secure Environmental Justice and Spur Economic Opportunity**

-   The order formalizes President Biden’s commitment to make
    environmental justice a part of the mission of every agency by
    directing federal agencies to develop programs, policies, and
    activities to address the disproportionate health, environmental,
    economic, and climate impacts on disadvantaged communities.
-   The order establishes a White House Environmental Justice
    Interagency Council and a White House Environmental Justice Advisory
    Council to prioritize environmental justice and ensure a
    whole-of-government approach to addressing current and historical
    environmental injustices, including strengthening environmental
    justice monitoring and enforcement through new or strengthened
    offices at the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of
    Justice, and Department of Health and Human Services.  The new
    bodies are also tasked with advising on ways to update Executive
    Order 12898 of February 11, 1994.
-   The order creates a government-wide Justice40 Initiative with the
    goal of delivering 40 percent of the overall benefits of relevant
    federal investments to disadvantaged communities and tracks
    performance toward that goal through the establishment of an
    Environmental Justice Scorecard.
-   The order initiates the development of a Climate and Environmental
    Justice Screening Tool, building off EPA’s EJSCREEN, to identify
    disadvantaged communities, support the Justice40 Initiative, and
    inform equitable decision making across the federal government

**SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY PRESIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM**  
The Presidential Memorandum on Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based
Policymaking directs agencies to make evidence-based decisions guided by
the best available science and data. Scientific and technological
information, data, and evidence are central to the development and
iterative improvement of sound policies, and to the delivery of
effective and equitable programs. Improper political interference in the
scientific process, with the work of scientists, and in the
communication of scientific facts undermines the welfare of the nation,
contributes to systemic inequities and injustices, and violates the
public trust.  
  
The memorandum charges the Director of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy (OSTP) with the responsibility for ensuring scientific
integrity across federal agencies. The OSTP Director is directed to
review the effectiveness of agency scientific-integrity policies and
assess agency scientific-integrity policies and practices going
forward.  
  
In addition, agencies that oversee, direct, or fund research are tasked
with designating a senior agency employee as Chief Science Officer to
ensure agency research programs are scientifically and technologically
well founded and conducted with integrity. Because science, facts, and
evidence are vital to addressing policy and programmatic issues across
the Federal Government, all agencies – not just those that fund,
conduct, or oversee scientific research –must designate a senior career
employee as the agency’s Scientific Integrity Official to oversee
implementation and iterative improvement of scientific-integrity
policies and processes.  
  
**EXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING THE PRESIDENT’S COUNCIL OF ADVISORS ON
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY**  
  
Leaders across the Biden-Harris Administration, including the President
himself and his senior advisors in the Executive Office of the
President, will seek input, advice, and the best-available science,
data, and scientific and technological information from scientists,
engineers, and other experts in science, technology, and innovation.  
  
To that end, and in alignment with the scientific-integrity memorandum’s
charge to reestablish scientific and technological advisory committees,
this order re-establishes the President’s Council of Advisors on Science
and Technology (PCAST). The PCAST– co-chaired by the President’s Science
Advisor – will advise the President on policy that affects science,
technology, and innovation. The Council will also advise the President
on scientific and technical information that is needed to inform public
policy relating to the economy, worker empowerment, education, energy,
environment, public health, national and homeland security, racial
equity, and other topics.
