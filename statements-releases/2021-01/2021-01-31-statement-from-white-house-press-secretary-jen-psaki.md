The President spoke to Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer today; he is
grateful that Congress is prepared to begin action on the American
Rescue Plan in just his second full week in office.

As has been widely reported, the President received a letter today from
10 Republican Senators asking to meet with him to discuss their ideas
about the actions needed to address these crises.  In response, the
President spoke to Senator Collins, and invited her and other signers of
the letter to come to the White House early this week for a full
exchange of views.

With the virus posing a grave threat to the country, and economic
conditions grim for so many, the need for action is urgent, and the
scale of what must be done is large.  The American Rescue Plan –
including $1400 relief checks, a substantial investment in fighting
COVID and reopening schools, aid to small businesses and hurting
families, and funds to keep first responders on the job (and more) – is
badly needed.   As leading economists have said, the danger now is not
in doing too much: it is in doing too little.  Americans of both parties
are looking to their leaders to meet the moment.
