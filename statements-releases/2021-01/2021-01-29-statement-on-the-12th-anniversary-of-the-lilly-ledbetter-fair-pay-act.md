title: "Statement on the 12th Anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay\_Act"
---
 
Twelve years ago to the day, President Obama and I were a little over a
week into our time in office. While we were working with Congress on
what became the Recovery Act that kept us from another Great Depression,
we got another groundbreaking and critical piece of economic legislation
passed and to the President’s desk. I stood next to him and the
incredible woman for whom the first law he would ever sign was named
after, Lilly Ledbetter.  
  
Before she was a household name, she was like so many other women in the
workforce – who worked hard, with honor, only to find out she was being
paid less than a man for the same work.  
   
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act marked one small step to give women a
fair chance to get ahead in this country. But we’re still far from full
fair pay in the workplace — as we’ve seen in this pandemic and economic
crisis.  
   
Women are disproportionately working on the frontlines caring for our
loved ones and working to beat the virus, but they continue to earn less
than their male counterparts. The pandemic is widening women’s income
and wealth gaps, as more than two million have dropped out of the labor
force, partly reflecting the increased domestic labor demands on women
during the pandemic.  
  
Vice President Harris and I will lead an economic recovery that not only
brings women back into the workforce, but that also breaks down barriers
that have left women, especially women of color, unseen, underpaid, and
undervalued.  
   
We applaud Senator Murray and Congresswoman DeLauro for reintroducing
the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will take critical steps to end pay
discrimination and increase transparency by protecting workers from
retaliation for simply sharing their wages with their colleagues. It
will also ban employers from seeking salary history, so they have one
less false justification for under-paying women and people of color.
And, it will provide tools to hold employers accountable for engaging in
systemic discrimination. We urge Congress to pass it and to go further
to end pay discrimination –starting by dramatically increasing funding
for enforcement so that employers are held accountable.  
   
We also need to take additional steps to help women have more choices to
rejoin or stay in the workforce and to have more options for high-paying
jobs. That includes by providing paid family and medical leave, making
child care more affordable and schedules more predictable and flexible,
and building training pipelines into high-paying jobs. It also includes
raising the minimum wage and boosting pay for those in the care economy
– including child care workers, home health aides, and pre-school
teachers. And, we must make it easier for workers to organize and
bargain collectively, a critical path to reducing the wage gap for
women.  
  
As we do this work, we urge employers across the country to partner with
us and take immediate action to change the culture and pay practices
that foster discrimination.  
   
We cannot move forward while leaving half of our country behind. I hope
there is a bill that comes to my desk for me to sign, with Vice
President Harris standing next to me as we ensure that women are valued,
appreciated, and given the fair shot they deserve.
