  \ Business Leaders and\_Advocates"

Today, Acting Small Business Administrator Tami Perriello, Director of
the National Economic Council Brian Deese, Deputy Director of the
National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti, and other senior
Biden-Harris Administration officials from the SBA and Department of
Treasury held a virtual meeting with more than 100 representatives from
small business advocates, minority and women small business leaders,
lenders, and other economic organizations.

The senior administration officials underscored President Biden and Vice
President Harris’s commitment to providing small businesses with the
support they need throughout the economic downturn caused by the
pandemic, especially ensuring minority- and women- owned businesses have
fair and equitable access to small business relief programs. They
discussed how the Biden-Harris Administration will focus on identifying
Navigators to ensure small businesses in communities of color and
underserved communities can better access the Paycheck Protection
Program (PPP) and other emergency assistance programs. 

Acting Administrator Perriello also asked community navigators to share
successes about how the community navigator approach has helped
underserved businesses. The American Business Immigration Coalition and
the Resurrection Project shared their perspectives on implementing a
community navigator model in Illinois, and the City of Columbus provided
insights on its community navigator efforts.

The senior administration officials thanked participants for joining and
said they look forward to continued dialogue about the best ways to
support small businesses throughout the ongoing economic crisis.
