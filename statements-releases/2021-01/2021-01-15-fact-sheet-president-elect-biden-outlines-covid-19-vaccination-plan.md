*Effectively and equitably vaccinating the U.S. population will happen
through stronger partnerships with states and communities, increased
supply, more vaccination sites, and more vaccinators*

The COVID-19 pandemic is getting worse by the day — more people are
hospitalized with COVID-19 than ever before, the death rate is up almost
20 percent, and we’re nearing 400,000 deaths total. At the same time,
there is a new, more contagious strain spreading across the country and
we are woefully behind on vaccinating the U.S. population.

President-elect Biden will confront this historic challenge with the
full strength of the federal government — working closely with local
communities already in the trenches. He will lead an unprecedented,
whole-of-society effort that mobilizes every resource available — across
the public and private sectors. It will take every American doing their
part.

As we move forward to get vaccines in arms as quickly as possible, we
will not leave anyone behind. Communities across the country are
counting on it. The health and economic security of our nation depend on
it.

Today, the president-elect outlined key highlights of his plan to
efficiently and equitably vaccinate the U.S. population. This includes
taking action to:

**Get more people vaccinated**

-   **Encourage states to allow more people to be vaccinated including
    individuals 65 and older as well as frontline workers.** The process
    of establishing priority groups was driven by science, but the
    implementation has been too rigid and confusing. We now see doses of
    vaccines sitting in freezers unused while people who want the
    vaccine cannot get it. President-elect Biden’s plan encourages
    states to open up eligibility beyond healthcare workers and
    long-term care facility residents and staff, to include frontline
    essential workers like teachers, first responders, grocery store
    employees, and anyone who is 65 and older. It won’t mean that
    everyone in these groups will get vaccinated immediately, as supply
    is not where it needs to be. But it will mean that as vaccines
    become available, they will reach more people who need them. For
    states with the capacity and supply to further expand, we encourage
    that as well. The federal government will continue to look to the
    CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) framework
    for an equitable, effective vaccination program.
-   **Ensure equity throughout the vaccination process to reach those in
    hard-to-reach, marginalized communities.** We will ensure that there
    is equity in the vaccination process by using data to target
    resources to hard-hit communities, ensuring no out-of-pocket costs
    for vaccinations, and equitable access to vaccines in marginalized
    and medically-underserved communities. Partnerships with state,
    local and community-based organizations and trusted health care
    providers, like community health centers, will be central to this
    effort.

**Create more vaccination sites**

-   **Stand up new, federally-supported community vaccination centers
    across the country. **Getting as many people vaccinated as quickly
    as possible will require close coordination between the federal
    government and all states and territories. Knowing that not all
    states and jurisdictions have the resources to scale vaccinations at
    the pace this crisis demands, the Biden-Harris administration will
    leverage federal resources and emergency contracting authorities to
    launch new vaccination sites and to expand state and local efforts
    across the country. With the support of Federal Emergency Management
    Administration (FEMA), these sites will mobilize thousands of
    clinical and non-clinical staff and contractors who will work
    hand-in-glove with the National Guard and state and local teams. The
    program will be scaled based on what is working best on the ground
    for state and local partners, and the communities they serve.
-   **Fully reimburse state deployment of the National Guard to support
    vaccinations and provide additional FEMA assistance. **Many states
    are planning to use their National Guard to support vaccine
    distribution efforts, including to support critical transportation
    and logistics functions. To further support states, President-elect
    Biden’s plan fully reimburses states for the use of the National
    Guard and provides 100% cost match for state and local emergency
    costs through FEMA.
-   **Launch mobile vaccination clinics and provider partnerships to
    reach underserved urban areas and rural
    communities. **President-elect Biden will deploy mobile vaccination
    clinics in the most hard-to-reach communities and to support those
    who face challenges accessing vaccination sites, including
    individuals who live in underserved urban and rural areas. The
    federal government will partner with states and local providers,
    including primary care providers, to ensure that they have the
    resources needed to help get vaccines to the communities they serve.
    The federal government will launch targeted programs to engage
    community health centers, rural health clinics, critical access
    hospitals, and tribal health services to ensure that we can meet the
    needs of all communities.
-   **Make vaccines available in pharmacies. **Millions of Americans
    turn to their local pharmacies every day for their medicines, flu
    shots, and much more. Nearly 90 percent of Americans live within
    five miles of a pharmacy. President-elect Biden will quickly
    jumpstart efforts to increase capacity at chain and independent
    pharmacies across the country to get Americans vaccinated.
-   **Launch a new partnership with Federally Qualified Health Centers
    nationwide.** Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) serve more
    than 30 million patients each year — one in 11 people nationwide.
    Many are people of color and many live in rural communities. FQHC
    patients are often individuals struggling to make ends meet. Given
    the critical role that these providers play in their communities,
    President-elect Biden will launch a new program to ensure that FQHCs
    can directly access vaccine supply where needed. At the same time,
    the administration will encourage jurisdictions to engage and work
    closely with health centers in their community vaccination planning.
    And to ensure that health centers have the resources they need to
    successfully launch vaccination programs, President-elect Biden has
    called on Congress to provide additional funds to support community
    health centers, and HHS will launch a new program to provide
    guidance, technical assistance, and other resources to prepare and
    engage these providers nationwide.
-   **Launch new models to serve high-risk individuals.** The
    administration will make programs available for high-risk congregate
    settings, including homeless shelters, jails, and institutions that
    serve individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

**Increase supply and get it out the door as quickly as possible**

-   **Ensure a robust vaccine supply and spur manufacturing. **To help
    people get vaccinated more quickly, the president-elect will
    maximize the manufacture of vaccine and vaccine supplies for the
    country, including using the Defense Production Act. This effort
    will prioritize supplies that could cause bottlenecks, including
    glass vials, stoppers, syringes, needles, and the “fill and finish”
    capacity to package vaccine into vials.
-   **Be a reliable partner for states by providing actionable data on
    vaccine allocation timelines and delivery. **To effectively plan and
    scale distribution, states and localities rely on both advanced
    understanding of their allocations and timely delivery of their
    ordered doses. Under President-elect Biden’s plan, the federal
    government will provide regular projections of the allocations
    states and localities will receive. The federal government will
    build on the operational plans in place to ensure the effective
    distribution, storage, and transit of vaccines to states, including
    support for maintaining or augmenting the vaccine-specific required
    cold chain. The federal government will also fully leverage the
    Defense Production Act to fill any distribution gaps, including with
    respect to any needed refrigeration, transportation, or storage
    facilities.
-   **Increase vaccine availability while maintaining a commitment to
    the two-dose schedule. **President-elect Biden’s plan will release
    the vast majority of the vaccines when they are available, so more
    people can get vaccinated quickly, while still retaining a small
    reserve for any unforeseen shortages or delays. To continue ensuring
    second-dose availability on the timeline recommended by the FDA, the
    Biden-Harris administration will closely monitor development,
    production and release of vaccines, and use the DPA as needed to
    ensure adequate supply for second doses on the timeline recommended
    by the FDA.

**Mobilize more personnel to get shots in arms. **

-   **Surge the public health workforce to support the vaccination
    effort. **A diverse, community-based public health workforce is
    essential to an effective vaccination program. President-elect Biden
    will address workforce needs by taking steps to allow additional
    qualified professionals to administer vaccines and strongly
    encourage states to use their flexibility fully to surge their
    workforce, including by expanding scope of practice laws and waiving
    licensing requirements as appropriate. The federal government, in
    partnership with states, will provide appropriate training,
    including thorough use of the U.S. Public Health Service
    Commissioned Corps. The president-elect will also act swiftly to
    amend the current COVID-19 Public Readiness and Emergency
    Preparedness Act declaration to permit certain qualified
    professionals, including retired medical professionals, that are not
    licensed under state law to administer vaccines to be able to do so
    with appropriate training in order to expand the number of qualified
    professionals able to administer the vaccine.
-   **Mobilize a public health jobs program to support COVID-19
    response. **President-elect Biden has asked Congress to make an
    historic investment in expanding the public health workforce,
    funding 100,000 public health workers to [nearly
    triple](https://buildbackbetter.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8c306f1270b84f82f1a14dd29&id=6e89e15049&e=537771d557) the
    country’s community health roles. These individuals will be hired to
    work in their local communities to perform vital tasks like vaccine
    outreach and contact tracing in the near term, and to transition
    into community health roles to build our long-term public health
    capacity that will help improve quality of care and reduce
    hospitalization for low-income and underserved communities.

**Ensure the American people have the information and confidence they
need to get vaccinated **

-   **Launch a federally led, locally focused public education
    campaign.** The federal government will build public trust through
    increased transparency, communication around progress and setbacks,
    and a public education campaign that addresses vaccine hesitancy and
    is tailored to meet the needs of local communities. The campaign
    will work to elevate trusted local voices and outline the historic
    efforts to deliver a safe and effective vaccine as part of a
    national strategy for beating COVID-19.
