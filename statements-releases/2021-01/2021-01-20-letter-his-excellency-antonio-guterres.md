His Excellency  
Mr. António Guterres   
Secretary-General   
United Nations  
New York

Excellency:

This letter constitutes a retraction by the Government of the United
States of the letter dated July 6, 2020, notifying you that the
Government of the United States intended to withdraw from the World
Health Organization (WHO), effective July 6, 2021.  The United States
intends to remain a member of the World Health Organization. 

The WHO plays a crucial role in the world’s fight against the deadly
COVID-19 pandemic as well as countless other threats to global health
and health security.  The United States will continue to be a full
participant and a global leader in confronting such threats and
advancing global health and health security. 

Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
