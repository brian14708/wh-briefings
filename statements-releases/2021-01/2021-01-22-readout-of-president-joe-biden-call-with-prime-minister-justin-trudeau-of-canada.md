President Biden spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his
first call to a foreign leader as President of the United States,
highlighting the strategic importance of the U.S.-Canada relationship
and reinvigorating our bilateral cooperation on an ambitious and
wide-ranging agenda, including combating the COVID-19 pandemic,
strengthening economic ties, defense, and global leadership to address
the pressing challenge of climate change. The President acknowledged
Prime Minister Trudeauâ€™s disappointment regarding the decision to
rescind the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, and reaffirmed his
commitment to maintain an active bilateral dialogue and to further
deepen cooperation with Canada. The President and the Prime Minister
discussed their shared vision to promote a sustainable economic recovery
and to work together to achieve a net-zero emissions future, including
through advancements in the automotive sector. The two leaders agreed to
speak again in a month to continue to build out our bilateral
cooperation.
