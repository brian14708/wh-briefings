Vice President Kamala Harris met today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine in Munich, Germany to discuss Ukraine’s ongoing
fight against Russian aggression.  The Vice President emphasized the
Administration’s continued efforts to ensure passage of the President’s
national security supplemental funding bill, and reaffirmed the strong
bipartisan support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity
in the U.S. government and among the American people.  The Vice
President welcomed Ukraine’s progress on its path of Euro-Atlantic
integration, and encouraged continued work to counter corruption and
strengthen Ukraine’s democratic institutions, which will give confidence
to investors and enable Ukraine’s rapid recovery and reconstruction when
Russia ceases its unlawful aggression.
