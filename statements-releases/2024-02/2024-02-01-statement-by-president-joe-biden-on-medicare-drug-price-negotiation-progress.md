title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Medicare Drug Price Negotiation\_Progress"
---
 
For the first time in history, Medicare is making offers on the fair
price for ten of the most widely used and expensive drugs. Medicare is
no longer taking whatever prices for these drugs that the pharmaceutical
companies demand. 

To keep their prices high, Big Pharma and their allies lobbied hard
against this historic law, and they were joined by every single
Republican in Congress, who voted against giving Medicare the power to
negotiate lower prices.  What’s worse, Republicans in Congress are still
trying to block this historic law and keep Medicare from getting the
best deal for America’s seniors, supporting legislation and budgets that
would repeal my work to lower drug prices.

My vision is different. Medicare is negotiating for lower prices on
drugs to treat everything from diabetes, Crohn’s disease, arthritis,
heart disease, cancer, and more. Just one of these drugs alone can cost
as much as $6,500 in out-of-pocket costs for seniors. Through my
Inflation Reduction Act, we’re working to give seniors the best possible
deal on their prescription drugs and lower health care costs. Already,
we’ve cut insulin costs to $35 for seniors and people with disabilities,
15 million Americans are saving an average of $800 per year on health
insurance costs, and seniors’ out of pocket drug costs will be capped at
$2,000 starting next year. The days where Americans pay two to three
times what they pay for prescription drugs in other countries are
ending.  

My Administration won’t stop fighting to lower health care costs for
seniors and families. Even as Republicans in Congress continue to try to
repeal my Inflation Reduction Act, cut Medicare and Social Security
benefits, end insurance for millions, and keep health care costs high,
we’ll continue to protect these programs and deliver lower costs for
seniors and hardworking families.
