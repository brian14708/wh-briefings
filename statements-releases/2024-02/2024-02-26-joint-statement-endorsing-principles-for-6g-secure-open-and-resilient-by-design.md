title: "Joint Statement Endorsing Principles for 6G: Secure, Open, and Resilient by\_\
  Design"
---
 
The Governments of the United States, Australia, Canada, the Czech
Republic, Finland, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the
United Kingdom concur on these shared principles for the research and
development of 6G wireless communication systems; and recognize that by
working together we can support open, free, global, interoperable,
reliable, resilient, and secure connectivity. We believe this to be an
indispensable contribution towards building a more inclusive,
sustainable, secure, and peaceful future for all, and call upon other
governments, organizations, and stakeholders to join us in supporting
and upholding these principles. Collaboration and unity are key to
resolving pressing challenges in the development of 6G, and we hereby
declare our intention to adopt relevant policies to this end in our
countries, to encourage the adoption of such policies in third
countries, and to advance research and development and standardization
of 6G networks that fulfill the following shared principles:  

1\. Trusted Technology that is Protective of National Security     

-   6G technologies that are supported by secure and resilient
    technology as part of a wider secure trusted communications
    ecosystem, facilitating the ability of participating governments and
    partners to protect national security.     

2\. Secure, Resilient, and Protective of Privacy     

-   6G technologies developed by organizations that have systematic
    approaches to cybersecurity, including through the use of technical
    standards, interfaces, and specifications; approaches such as
    security-by-design, able to ensure the availability of essential
    services; and systems designed to fail safely and recover
    quickly.   
-   6G technologies that are reliable, resilient, safe, and protect the
    privacy of individuals.    
-   6G technologies and architectures that provide a high level of
    security on communication networks, including by mitigating
    potential risks posed by greater network complexity or larger attack
    surfaces.

3\. Global Industry-led and Inclusive Standard Setting & International
Collaborations     

-   6G technologies that are built on global technical standards,
    interfaces, and specifications that are developed through open,
    transparent, impartial and consensus-based decision-making
    processes.
-   6G technologies that are built on global standards that respect
    intellectual property rights, that promote sustainability,
    accessibility, inclusive participation, interoperability,
    competitiveness, openness, and security.   

4\. Cooperation to Enable Open and Interoperable Innovation     

-   6G technologies that use technical standards in line with principles
    laid down under the Global Industry-led and Inclusive Standard
    Setting & International Collaborations principle and interfaces to
    enable seamless interoperability between products from different
    suppliers, including software and hardware.
-   6G technologies that recognize the importance of international
    cooperation in promoting open, secure, resilient, inclusive,
    interoperable networks, such as Open Radio Access Networks, and
    safe, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable 6G ecosystem.     
-   6G technologies that benefit from joint research, development and
    testing, and which leverage innovative technologies such as
    virtualization, software-defined networking, artificial
    intelligence.   

5\. Affordability, Sustainability, and Global Connectivity   

-   6G technologies that allow for energy-efficient deployments and
    operation, improving both environmental sustainability, reparability
    and recyclability of equipment, and the affordability necessary to
    support social sustainability.   
-   6G technologies that are accessible through mechanisms such as
    economies of scale, enabled by standardization and competitive
    environment, and able to bridge digital divides, delivering reliable
    coverage and consistent quality of experience, minimizing disparity
    in service levels wherever possible while allowing for innovative
    use cases.  
-   6G technologies that contribute towards empowering other industries
    and sectors to reduce their environmental impacts by promoting
    digital transformation.  
-   6G technologies that are widely available and accessible to
    developing nations.     
-   6G technologies that leverage non-terrestrial networks (NTN) such as
    satellite and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS).  

6\. Spectrum and Manufacturing     

-   6G technologies that have secure and resilient supply chains.   
-   6G technologies that promote a globally competitive market along the
    ICT value chain and in all elements of the compute and connectivity
    continuum, with multiple software and hardware suppliers.
-   6G technologies that could make use of new spectrum allocations or
    spectrum that has already been allocated for wireless services.
-   6G technologies that use spectrum efficiently and incorporate
    spectrum sharing mechanisms by design to coexist with incumbent
    service providers.
