title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Loss of Two National\_Guardsmen"
---
 
Jill and I mourn the loss of two Mississippi National Guardsmen, whose
aircraft crashed during a routine training mission near Booneville,
Mississippi yesterday.   
   
Our prayers are with their families, units, and the entire Mississippi
National Guard at this incredibly difficult time. These two Guardsmen
embodied the very best of our nation—bound by honor, and committed to
service. We will continue to keep our solemn promise to care for their
families, just as they were faithful to our nation.  
   
I am grateful to the local law enforcement and first responders, who
quickly supported recovery efforts after this tragic accident. As the
Department of Defense and National Guard continue to assess what
occurred, we stand ready to provide any assistance needed.
