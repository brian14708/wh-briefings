title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Calls on Congress to Immediately\
  \ Pass the Bipartisan National Security\_Agreement"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration strongly supports the bipartisan
agreement announced in the Senate that would address a number of
pressing national security issues. President Biden has repeatedly said
he is willing to work in a bipartisan way to secure the border and fix
our broken immigration system. From his first day in office, he has
called on Congress to act and over the course of several months, his
administration has worked with a bipartisan group of Senators on
important reforms and necessary funding. This agreement, if passed into
law, would be the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the
border we’ve had in decades. It will make our country safer, make our
border more secure, and treat people fairly and humanely while
preserving legal immigration, consistent with our values as a nation.
This bipartisan national security agreement would also advance our
national security interests by continuing our support for the people of
Ukraine and Israel as they defend themselves against tyranny and
terrorism while also providing much-needed humanitarian assistance to
civilians affected by conflicts around the world. The Biden-Harris
Administration calls on Congress to not delay and immediately pass the
bipartisan national security agreement.  
   
**Provides Temporary Emergency Authority for the President to Shut Down
the Border When the System is Overwhelmed**

-   Establishes a new temporary authority, the “Border Emergency
    Authority,” that allows the President and Secretary of Homeland
    Security to temporarily prohibit individuals from seeking asylum,
    with limited exceptions, when the Southwest Border is overwhelmed.
    The authority preserves access to other protections, consistent with
    our international obligations, and will sunset after three years.
-   Importantly, this authority is to be used when the number of
    migrants encountered at the border reaches very high levels – levels
    that strain the U.S. government’s ability to process migrants. 
    Additionally, the authority is limited to a set number of days each
    calendar year – in the third year of implementation the authority
    may only be exercised for half of a given calendar year.
-   The United States is a country of refuge for those fleeing
    persecution. For that reason, the legislation requires asylum access
    be preserved for a minimum number of individuals per day, limited to
    those using a safe and orderly process at ports of entry, when the
    authority is invoked.

**Expedites Access to Work Authorization for Hundreds of Thousands of
Migrants**

-   Ensures that those who are here and qualify are able to get to work
    faster. It provides work authorization to asylum seekers once they
    receive a positive protection screening determination. This will
    allow asylum seekers to begin to support themselves and their
    families in the United States much earlier than the current 180-day
    statutorily required waiting period, which only begins after an
    individual submits an asylum application.  This will also reduce the
    resource strain on our cities and states who have been supporting
    asylum seekers during this existing waiting period.
-   This bill provides work authorization to approximately 25,000 K-1,
    K-2, and K-3 nonimmigrant visa holders (fiancé or spouse and
    children of U.S. citizens) per year, and about 100,000 H-4 spouses
    and children of certain H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders who have
    completed immigrant petitions (temporary skilled workers) per year,
    so they no longer have to apply and wait for approval before they
    can begin working in the United States.

**Establishes an Efficient and Fair Process for Consideration of Asylum
and other Protection Claims by those arriving at our Southwest Border**

-   Today, the process to get to a final decision on a migrant’s asylum
    claim can take 5-7 years.  That is far too long.  Once fully
    implemented, this bipartisan agreement would – for the first time –
    give the Administration the authority and resources to reduce that
    process to 6 months.  This gets people quick decisions on their
    asylum claims rather than leaving them and their families in limbo
    for years.
-   The agreement also for the first time gives Asylum Officers the
    authority to grant a claim at the protection screening stage if the
    case is clear and convincing, thereby reducing the strain on the
    asylum system.

**Recalibrates the Asylum Screening Process**

-   Moves consideration of statutory bars to asylum eligibility, such as
    criminal convictions, into the screening stage. This will ensure
    that those who pose a public safety or national security risk are
    removed as quickly in the process as possible rather than remaining
    in prolonged, costly detention prior to removal.
-   Modifies the screening threshold for asylum from “significant
    possibility” to “reasonable possibility,” with the goal of making it
    more likely that those who are screened in to pursue protection
    claims are ultimately found to have a valid asylum claim. 
    Currently, of all migrants screened in and allowed to go to the next
    phase, only roughly 20 percent are ultimately granted asylum. 

**Provides Critical Funding for Combatting Smuggling and Drug
Trafficking, Border Security, and Asylum Processing**

-   Funds the installation of 100 cutting-edge inspection machines to
    help detect fentanyl at our Southwest Border ports of entry. 
-   Over 1,500 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel
    including Border Patrol Agents and CBP Officers. 
-   Over 4,300 new Asylum Officers and additional U.S. Citizenship and
    Immigration Services staff to facilitate timely and fair decisions. 
-   100 new immigration judge teams to help reduce the asylum caseload
    backlog and adjudicate cases more quickly. 
-   Shelter and critical services for newcomers in our cities and
    states.  
-   1,200 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel for
    functions including enforcement and deportations. 
-   More resources to fund transportation needs to enable increased
    removals. 
-   Support to partner nations hosting large numbers of migrants and
    refugees, and funding to partner nations to ensure cooperation in
    accepting returns associated with the implementation of the Border
    Emergency Authority. 

**Strengthens Federal Law Against Fentanyl Trafficking**

-   Declares that international trafficking of fentanyl is a national
    emergency and gives the President authority to impose sanctions on
    any foreign person knowingly involved in significant trafficking of
    fentanyl by a transnational criminal organization.
-   Allows for transfer of sanctioned persons’ forfeited property to
    forfeiture funds and authorizes Treasury to impose additional
    restrictions against sanctioned persons upon a determination that
    their transactions are of primary money laundering concern.
-   Directs Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to issue
    guidance on filing suspicious transactions reports related to
    fentanyl trafficking by transnational criminal organizations.

**Increases Lawful Pathways to Come to the United States**

-   For the first time in over 30 years, raises the cap on the number of
    immigrant visas available annually by adding an additional 250,000
    immigrant visas over 5 years (50,000/year).  160,000 of these visas
    will be family-based, and the other 90,000 will be employment-based.
-   These additional immigrant visas expand lawful pathways to the
    United States, prioritizing family reunification and reducing the
    time families have to spend apart, and get U.S. businesses access to
    additional workers.
-   Establishes a faster pathway to permanent status for the
    approximately 76,000 Afghan allies who entered the United States
    under Operation Allies Welcome and their families.

**Promotes Family Unity and Stability for Noncitizens**

-   Provides relief to over 250,000 individuals who came to the United
    States as children on their parents’ work visa.  These individuals
    have resided lawfully in the United States since they were children
    and have established lives here in the U.S but have since “aged out”
    of continuing to receive lawful status through their parents and
    have no other means of lawfully remaining in the United States with
    their families. Noncitizens who lived lawfully in the United States
    as a dependent child of an employment-based nonimmigrant for at
    least 8 years before turning 21 will be eligible to remain
    temporarily in the United States with work authorization.
-   In support of family unity, the bill makes clear that certain
    noncitizens can travel to the United States on a temporary
    visitor (B) visa to visit their family members.

**Ensure the Humane and Fair Treatment of Those Seeking Asylum,
Especially the Most Vulnerable **

-   Children should not be expected to represent themselves in a court –
    and this agreement will provide, for the first time,
    government-mandated and funded legal counsel for unaccompanied
    children age 13 or younger as they go through the process to seek
    asylum.  The bill would also provide counsel to particularly
    vulnerable, mentally incompetent adults.
-   Strengthens legal requirements that migrants always be provided with
    clear and accessible information about their rights, including their
    right to counsel.
-   Mandates that only trained Asylum Officers are permitted to conduct
    protection screenings.

**Ukraine:**

-   Provides critically-needed military aid to help the people of
    Ukraine defend themselves against Russian aggression.  Russia
    continues to launch aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities and is
    actively attacking Ukrainian forces. 
-   Invests in our defense industrial base, supporting American jobs
    across our country, and produce weapons and equipment that the
    United States can send Ukraine to help Ukraine’s military protect
    its people, defend against Russian attacks, and succeed on the
    battlefield. 
-   Enables the United States to continue to send economic assistance to
    Ukraine. Putin has made destroying Ukraine’s economy central to his
    war strategy and boosting Ukraine’s economy is essential to its
    survival. If Ukraine’s economy collapses, they will not be able to
    keep fighting. This aid will help Ukraine pay its first responders,
    import basic goods, and provide essential services to its
    population. 

**Israel:**

-   Authorizes the United States to provide additional military aid to
    help Israel defend itself from Hamas, which committed horrific acts
    of terror on October 7th, and whose leaders have pledged to repeat
    the attacks of October 7th over and over again until Israel is
    annihilated.  
-   The aid in this agreement will also help Israel replenish its air
    defenses and ensure it is prepared for any future contingencies. 
-   This includes its defense against Iran and groups backed by Iran,
    including Hezbollah. The funding in this agreement is essential to
    supporting Israel’s short- and long-term defense needs against a
    broad array of immediate and future threats.  

**Humanitarian Aid:**

-   Includes important humanitarian aid funding to help civilians in
    need around the world, whether it’s to address the spillover effects
    of Putin’s war and help Ukrainians who have been displaced by
    Russia’s invasion, or to help Palestinians in Gaza, where we are
    actively working to increase the flow of aid for Palestinian
    civilians who have nothing to do with Hamas.

**Indo-Pacific:**

-   Provides resources to help our allies and partners in the region
    build the capabilities necessary to address threats from an
    increasingly assertive PRC and to meet emerging challenges. It is
    critically important that we maintain our focus on the Indo-Pacific
    and preserve peace and stability.
