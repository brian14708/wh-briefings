**MUNICH –** Today, Vice President Kamala Harris
[made](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=67a8dc8f67&e=6f914ef5a5)
a forceful
[case](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/16/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-the-munich-security-conference-munich-germany/)
for America’s continued global leadership and the Biden-Harris
Administration’s worldview while strongly rejecting the failed
ideologies of isolationism, authoritarianism, and unilateralism. During
her third time representing the nation at the Munich Security
Conference, the Vice President condemned recent attacks on NATO,
reaffirmed U.S. support for Ukraine, outlined how America’s global
leadership benefits people across the country, and highlighted
Biden-Harris accomplishments at home and abroad.  
   
“We are committed to pursue global engagement, to uphold international
rules and norms, to defend democratic values at home and abroad, and to
work with our allies and partners in pursuit of shared goals,” **said
Vice President Harris.** “However, there are some in the United States
who disagree. They suggest it is the best interest of the American
people to isolate ourselves from the world, to flout common
understandings among nations, to embrace dictators and adopt their
repressive tactics, and abandon commitments to our allies in favor of
unilateral action. Let me be clear: That worldview is dangerous,
destabilizing, and indeed short-sighted. That view would weaken America
and would undermine global stability and undermine global prosperity.”  
   
During her 16th foreign trip, Vice President Harris reaffirmed that her
and President Biden’s “sacred commitment to NATO remains ironclad” and
that “NATO is central to our approach to global security.” She outlined
how, thanks to the leadership of the U.S., NATO is stronger, larger,
more united, and more effective than ever before. The Vice President
went on to unequivocally condemn recent attacks on NATO and offer a
direct warning about what would happen if America abandoned its allies
and cozied up to a dictator like Vladimir Putin by encouraging him.  
   
“If we stand by while an aggressor invades its neighbor with impunity,
they will keep going – and in the case of Putin, that means all of
Europe would be threatened. If we fail to impose severe consequences on
Russia, other authoritarians across the globe would be emboldened
because you see, they will be watching – they are watching – and drawing
lessons,” **said Vice President Harris.** “History has also shown us: if
we only look inward, we cannot defeat threats from outside; isolation is
not insulation. In fact, when America has isolated herself, threats have
only grown.”  
   
The Vice President also recounted how the world has come together under
U.S. leadership to help Ukraine defend itself, achieve what many thought
was impossible, and ensure that “Putin’s war has already been an utter
failure for Russia.” She once again reiterated that America will
continue to stand with Ukraine and our allies and partners around the
world.  
  
“I will make clear; President Joe Biden and I stand with Ukraine,”
**said Vice President Harris.** “In partnership with supportive
bipartisan majorities in both Houses of the United States Congress, we
will work to secure critical weapons and resources that Ukraine so badly
needs. And let me be clear, the failure to do so would be a gift to
Vladimir Putin.”  
   
Additionally, the Vice President made a clear case for how the U.S.’
role of global leadership “makes America strong and it keeps Americans
safe.” She identified how being globally engaged is not only in the
nation’s strategic interest, but also a direct benefit to the American
people.  
   
“I strongly believe America’s role of global leadership is to the direct
benefit of the American people,” **said Vice President Harris.** “Our
leadership keeps our homeland safe, supports American jobs, secures
supply chains, and opens new markets for American goods. And I firmly
believe our commitment to build and sustain alliances has helped America
become the most powerful and prosperous country in the world…To put all
of that at risk would be foolish.”  
   
Finally, the Vice President highlighted a range of Biden-Harris
accomplishments – from historic investments in infrastructure and
domestic semiconductor manufacturing, to unprecedented investments in
taking on the climate crisis, record small business creation, and the
fact that America’s economy is the strongest in the world. She also
spoke about what the Administration has been doing in the Indo-Pacific,
Middle East, and elsewhere throughout the world.   
   
Later today, the Vice President will meet with foreign leaders to
advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s priorities, including on
Ukraine and the Middle East. Her leadership at the Munich Security
Conference will also continue tomorrow as she meets with President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The two leaders will deliver remarks to
press at 7:30 a.m. ET. These remarks will be livestreamed at
