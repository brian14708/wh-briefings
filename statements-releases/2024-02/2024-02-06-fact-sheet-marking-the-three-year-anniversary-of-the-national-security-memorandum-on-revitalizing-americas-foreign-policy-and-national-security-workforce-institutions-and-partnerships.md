title: "FACT SHEET: Marking the Three-Year Anniversary of the National Security Memorandum\
  \ on Revitalizing America\u2019s Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce,\
  \ Institutions, and\_Partnerships"
---
 
Three years ago, on February 4, 2021, President Biden signed the
historic National Security Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign
Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships
(NSM-3).  
  
Our foreign policy and national security institutions are staffed with
more than one million committed professionals and patriots who
selflessly serve the Nation and our fellow Americans. A prepared,
professional, and diverse workforce is essential to protecting the
homeland, advancing America’s interests abroad, and projecting our core
values. Ensuring that members of our national security workforce have
the necessary tools, training, and support to fully realize their
potential is a key priority for the Biden-Harris Administration, and why
one of the first directives President Biden issued was NSM-3.   
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration marks the three-year anniversary
of NSM-3 by recognizing the tremendous achievements made to revitalize
and strengthen this critical workforce.  
  
Over the last year three years, the interagency NSM-3 Working Group has
operated with the necessary urgency to meet its tasks and goals. The
Principal Deputy National Security Advisor chairs this group, with vice
chairs from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB), and the Office of Science and Technology
Policy as co-chairs, to support implementation by its twelve member
agencies. Since the signing of NSM-3, additional agencies with foreign
policy workforces, including the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative, and newly-established offices and White House policy
councils, like the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) and the
Gender Policy Council, have joined the effort.  
  
The NSM-3 Working Group has prioritized leveraging, aligning, and
integrating their efforts with the continued implementation of other
government-wide initiatives with similar goals, including the
[President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/pma/) (PMA),
workforce-related Executive Orders (e.g., [Executive Order 14035:
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal
Workforce](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/)
and [Executive Order 14100: Advancing Economic Security for Military and
Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and
Survivors](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/06/09/executive-order-on-advancing-economic-security-for-military-and-veteran-spouses-military-caregivers-and-survivors/)),
[Presidential
Memoranda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/02/memorandum-on-supporting-access-to-leave-for-federal-employees/),
and the [National Cyber Workforce and Education
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/31/fact-sheet-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-announces-national-cyber-workforce-and-education-strategy-unleashing-americas-cyber-talent/)
(NCWES). Many of the initiatives, mentioned in the context of agency
accomplishments in this Fact Sheet, are cross-government implementation
efforts.  
  
Highlights of actions taken by NSM-3 departments and agencies include
the following:  
  
*Expanding pathways to recruit and hire, removing barriers, and better
retaining and supporting current employees and their families.*

-   Increasing the number of **paid internships** across the national
    security workforce, hundreds of which are broadly accessible through
    the “Intern Portal” on USAJOBS at <https://intern.usajobs.gov/>.
    -   For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development
        (USAID) is set to double the number of Pathways interns for
        Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 from last fiscal year, resourcing
        approximately 137 domestic and 10 overseas summer intern
        positions.
-   Expanding **scholarship-for-service programs**, including the
    Department of Defense (DOD) Science, Mathematics, and Research for
    Transformation (SMART) Scholarship-for-Service Program, which aims
    to create a diverse and technically proficient flow of new STEM
    talent into the DOD. To date, the SMART Program has awarded over
    4,700 scholarships.
-   Establishing **new and expanded paid fellowship programs**.
    -   For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is
        preparing to launch its second cohort of the DHS Intelligence
        and Cybersecurity Diversity Fellowship Program, a paid program
        that aims to help DHS recruit, retain, and reward the best and
        brightest in the fields of intelligence and cybersecurity. The
        program is intended for currently enrolled freshmen, sophomores,
        or juniors at an institution of higher learning, with a
        particular focus on Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs),
        specifically, Historically Black Colleges or Universities
        (HBCUs).
    -   The Department of State established two direct recruitment
        pathways into the Foreign and Civil Service seeking individuals
        from all segments of society. The William D. Clarke, Sr.
        Diplomatic Security Fellowship leads to a Diplomatic Security
        Service Special Agent career in the U.S. Foreign Service and the
        Colin Powell Leadership Program prepares future civil service
        leaders. Additionally, the State Department expanded the
        Pickering and Rangel Fellowships, which are direct recruitment
        pathways for Foreign Service Generalists, by 50%, accepting 90
        fellows annually. The Foreign Affairs IT Fellowship, which leads
        to IT careers in the Foreign Service, increased by 200% to 15
        fellows per year.
    -   USAID doubled the number of Donald M. Payne Fellows annually.
        The Payne Fellowship is a unique pathway to USAID Foreign
        Service and encourages the application of individuals from
        historically underrepresented groups in the U.S. Foreign Service
        as well as those with financial need.

<!-- -->

-   Expanding our **efforts to recruit and retain a more diverse and
    inclusive workforce**, including hiring Chief Diversity Officers and
    Senior Advisors on Workplace Safety and Sexual Harassment; creating
    and implementing agency-specific diversity, equity, inclusion, and
    accessibility (DEIA) strategic plans; implementing the Presidential
    Memorandum on Supporting Access to Leave for Federal Employees; and
    launching significant new partnerships.
    -   DOD funded a new university-affiliated research center with a
        consortium of HBCUs, led by Howard University, and has partnered
        with several MSIs to cohost seven successful “Taking the
        Pentagon to the People” (TTPTTP) program events designed to help
        advance the development of the nation’s full human capital
        potential and provide information about DOD employment,
        contracts, grants, scholarships, and research and development
        opportunities.
    -   The Intelligence Community (IC) developed tools, like the IC
        DEIA Maturity Model, to increase accountability and measure and
        track the effectiveness of DEIA programs and initiatives. It
        also implemented policies to promote a diverse, equitable, and
        inclusive workplace, irrespective of gender identity,
        transgender status, gender expression, and perceived gender
        through IC Directive 125, *Gender Identity and Inclusivity in
        the Intelligence Community*.
    -   The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) held an HBCU president’s
        conference, developed a multi-faceted MSI outreach strategy and
        participated in 107 outreach events at various MSIs.
    -   Departments and agencies have bolstered leadership for employee
        associations and resource groups—voluntary, employee-led groups
        focused on support and information sharing about collective
        interests, backgrounds, or demographics. For example, to better
        understand and address employee issues, many DHS top leaders are
        required to engage quarterly with various employee associations.
    -   CIA created and staffed the role of Neurodiversity Program
        Manager, who partners with IC and private sector organizations
        and participates in outreach events to establish neurodiverse
        talent pipelines to the agency. The agency appointed its first
        Chief Wellbeing Officer and improved employee wellbeing
        programs, support, resources, and services, including expanding
        workplace flexibility options and enhanced healthcare support
        through regional health bases. It also launched an outreach
        campaign to re-hire eligible former agency officers.
    -   In November 2023, the Department of Energy (DOE) was named
        [“America’s Best Employer for
        Veterans](https://www.forbes.com/lists/best-employers-for-veterans/?sh=a4b628f3606f)”
        by Forbes Magazine.  This designation reflects DOE’s continued
        commitment to maintaining an engaging and inclusive workplace
        culture that includes recognizing the critical contributions
        made by its U.S. Military Veteran employees.
    -   USAID has a long-standing relationship with university partners
        and institutions of higher learning all over the world. The
        agency prioritizes working via Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)
        with U.S. MSIs who serve underrepresented students and
        populations such as HBCUs, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Tribal
        Colleges and Universities, and Asian American and Pacific Island
        Serving Institutions. Beyond hiring and recruitment, MOUs also
        leverage the innovation happening at these universities. For
        example USAID’s Acquisition Workforce Certification Fellows
        Program (AWCFP) leverages a partnership with Fayetteville State
        University, while Delaware State University supports partnership
        engagements with USAID/Jamaica to address emerging issues in the
        Caribbean region.
-   Improving **methods to attract and retain persons with
    disabilities** by improving physical and electronic accessibility
    across departments and agencies.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of State opened its Access Center, which provides
    tools, resources, and support to employees with disabilities,
    contributing to the Department’s broader effort of cultivating a
    culture of inclusion and building a more accessible Department. The
    Department of State [recently
    reported](https://www.state.gov/u-s-department-of-state-releases-fy-2023-demographic-data-as-part-of-its-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-deia-demographic-baseline-report/)
    an increase of 1,000 employees with disabilities from FY 2021 to FY
    2023, now comprising 18 percent of its workforce. The increase was
    due to the growing willingness of employees to self-identify their
    disability, including non-apparent disabilities, as well as
    increased hiring under the Schedule A hiring mechanism for persons
    with disabilities. *Careers & the disABLED* magazine cited an
    employee of the Department as an Employee of the Year in 2021, 2022,
    and 2023.
-   CIA officers hired in FY 2022 and FY 2023 include the highest
    percentage of persons with disabilities since 2007. CIA’s efforts to
    increase recruitment of persons with disabilities has been augmented
    by a dedicated Persons with Disability Program Manager, who
    coordinates and attends recruitment events, and a Talent Broker
    liaison, who works with applicants on accessibility requests during
    the hiring process. CIA opened an Accessibility Storefront to
    provide employees with hands-on access to try accessible technology
    options and reasonable accommodations equipment.
-   USAID joined the Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP) through the
    Department of Labor and prioritized the use and awareness of the
    Schedule A and Disabled Veteran non-competitive hiring mechanisms.
    In 2023, the agency opened its first-ever Disability Resource Center
    which better supports and empowers current and prospective
    colleagues with disabilities to ensure the workplace is reflective
    of their needs and lived experiences.

<!-- -->

-   Expanding the tools available to hiring leads and managers **to
    attract, recruit, and retain diverse talent**, including more
    regularly analyzing data on diversity trends within organizations;
    expanding sources to better recruit top diverse talent; and creating
    more robust support mechanisms for existing employees to better
    retain top talent into the senior ranks.
    -   The Department of State established a Retention Unit to lead
        data collection and analysis on attrition and retention drivers.
        The data analysis informed several new initiatives to improve
        employee experience and retain a diverse workforce.
    -   The Department of the Treasury established an enterprise
        recruitment team and is piloting “stay surveys” to better
        address retention challenges.
    -   DOE refined and released targeted hiring goals for Veterans and
        persons with disabilities to track and report on progress.
    -   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established a
        public-facing [Workforce
        Dashboard](https://www.va.gov/EMPLOYEE/Workforce-dashboard/)
        that displays key metrics related to hiring, retention, and
        diversity to track progress towards department goals.
        Additionally, VA champions employee retention through its Stay
        in VA (SIVA) initiative; an employee-centered strategy designed
        to improve employee retention by focusing on the employee
        experience through direct engagement. SIVA provides regular
        touchpoints for employees and their supervisors that create a
        trusting environment with open communication that addresses
        issues that might otherwise affect retention. Further, VA has
        established a New Employee Buddy Program that supports
        onboarding, connects new hires with colleagues, and facilitates
        acclimatization into the Department.
    -   CIA’s recruitment metrics team guides talent acquisition plans,
        including outreach and engagement strategies.
    -   DHS launched “Jump Teams,” comprised of experts from across
        headquarters and component offices, that deploy to field
        locations to learn about and help resolve issues in resources,
        IT, management, facilities and any other areas that may be
        impacting the ability of employees to accomplish the mission.
        DHS also conducts quarterly pulse surveys to better understand
        employee experiences. Supervisors, managers, and leaders receive
        guidance and learn best practices to address issues raised in
        the surveys.
    -   USAID successfully launched and completed its inaugural DEIA
        survey with full results received in Spring 2023. Data points
        from this survey include expanded demographics and identity
        categories across the entire workforce, including U.S. Direct
        Hires, Personal Service Contractors, and other staffing
        mechanisms. The agency made survey data available via a DEIA
        Survey Dashboard and Operating Unit Snapshots.
    -   Responding to feedback from its Foreign Service (FS) workforce
        of nearly 2,000, USAID overhauled and streamlined FS performance
        management, assignment and promotions processes and introduced
        new tools and strategies to increase employee satisfaction and
        ensure that USAID has a FS workforce that inclusively represents
        the American people in its work abroad.
-   **Shortening hiring timelines.**
    -   Shortening hiring timelines is a Director of National
        Intelligence (DNI)-stated goal that aims to reduce the median,
        end-to-end hiring timeline to no more than 180 days. The IC has
        made progress towards meeting this goal by enhancing virtual
        recruiting capabilities, utilizing IC-wide hiring authorities to
        create synergies across IC elements, and focusing on investments
        in end-to-end processing capabilities that will integrate
        security, medical, and suitability assessments into the overall
        hiring process.
    -   The Federal government as a whole continued to make progress in
        reducing security clearance timelines, which can affect broader
        hiring timelines. thanks to vetting policy and operational
        reforms achieved through *Trusted Workforce 2.0*. Top Secret and
        Secret clearance timelines are averaging 189 days and 78 days,
        respectively, as of the end of Fiscal Year 2023, down from their
        peak in 2018. New aspirational targets have been set to further
        improve end-to-end timeliness: 40 days for Secret (currently 74
        days) and 75 days for Top Secret (currently 114 days). These
        time reductions have been tied to broader workforce hiring
        improvement strategy goals to transform the job applicant
        experience, to include a new Personnel Vetting Questionnaire
        that includes simpler language and helpful explanations, making
        the background investigation process less daunting for
        applicants.
    -   CIA continued to make significant strides in reducing the
        application to cleared processing timeline. At the end of FY
        2023, CIA reduced the median processing time from application to
        cleared by 23 percent, and the application to final job offer is
        now under 180 days. Its transition to an “Invitation to Apply”
        model in early 2023 has increased interest in agency employment
        and allows for resumes to stay on file for future consideration
        as new job opportunities arise.
    -   USAID established an onboarding team for the Civil Service,
        expanded hiring approaches to build a pipeline of candidates for
        the Foreign Service to quickly fill attrition and hiring
        targets; and transitioned to virtual platforms for recruitment,
        hiring, and onboarding. USAID’s Office of Human Capital and
        Talent Management designed and launched the Navigate tool to
        quickly onboard all U.S. direct-hire employees. USAID’s Chief
        Information Office also launched Work-Ready Progress Dashboards
        to provide an at-a-glance view and traceability of direct-hire
        candidates going through the onboarding process.
-   **Streamlining open opportunities** for job applicants by creating
    new branded search pages at
    [STEM.usajobs.gov](https://stem.usajobs.gov/) for Science,
    Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics-related positions across
    the Federal government,
    [CyberCareers.gov](http://www.cybercareers.gov) for cyber-related
    positions, and [NatSec.usajobs.gov](https://natsec.usajobs.gov/) for
    opportunities within the national security and foreign policy
    workforce.
    -   The IC launched the first centralized site for IC recruitment at
        [IntelligenceCareers.gov](/Users/JLCrissman/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/EW6OGX2V/intelligencecareers.gov).
    -   DOD continued to leverage <https://www.DODciviliancareers.com/>,
        to promote the DOD Civilian Employer brand, highlight diverse
        career and internship/scholarship opportunities, advertise job
        fairs, and give top talent access to DOD jobs. Through this
        platform, DOD hosts virtual hiring events to fill critical
        skills positions, including STEM, cyber, medical, prevention
        workforce, and skilled trades and labor positions. In addition,
        DOD uses the site to post an annual consolidated list of DOD
        scholarships and employment programs.
    -   VA promotes employment opportunities on [VA
        Careers](https://vacareers.va.gov/), [Digital
        Careers](https://digital.va.gov/careers/), [VA
        Police](https://department.va.gov/about/va-police/), and the [VA
        for Vets](https://www.vaforvets.va.gov/) websites. To further
        promote career opportunities in VA, VHA developed [Total
        Reward$](https://vacareers.va.gov/employment-benefits/total-rewards/)
        brochures with generalized information that reflects potential
        monetized value of a full VA compensation package for certain
        full-time positions.
-   **Supporting family members overseas.**
    -   Recognizing the valuable contributions of employee families, the
        Department of State and USAID provide a variety of programs and
        services to Foreign Service Eligible Family Members (EFMs) while
        they are overseas and when returning to the U.S. The Department
        of State’s Global Community Liaison Office (GCLO) hosts a Global
        Employment Initiative and employs Global Employment Advisors to
        support EFMs. USAID developed an EFM Employment Registry for
        those applying for Federal jobs using Non-Competitive
        Eligibility (NCE).
    -   CIA opened the Family Engagement Center (FEC) in July 2023 to
        continue its enhanced support of families going to the field.
-   **Supporting Military-Connected Families.**

<!-- -->

-   OPM issued guidance to agencies in support of Executive Order 14100,
    *Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses,
    Military Caregivers, and Survivors* reinforcing the use of flexible
    work arrangements that support the needs of military-connected
    families including telework and remote work, administrative leave,
    and workforce retention tools such as the opportunity to request
    reassignment and relocation. 
-   Also pursuant to EO 14100, DOD and DHS provide consultation, advice,
    and assistance to military families regarding employment at overseas
    locations. This includes assistance in navigating complex employment
    requirements related to Status of Forces Agreements, other
    agreements with host nations affecting family member employment, and
    working remotely for U.S. based entities while a service member
    spouse is stationed overseas. Additionally, DOD and the Department
    of State are considering work options for spouses when reevaluating
    or entering into Status of Forces Agreements and other related
    arrangements with host nations. 
-   DOD continues to provide robust career support for military spouses
    including those that are, or seek to be, employed within the Foreign
    Policy and National Security Workforce. Its Spouse Education and
    Career Opportunities program includes several initiatives that
    support careers for military spouses, including providing expert
    career coaching, Federal employment support, and more.
-   **Domestic Employees Teleworking Overseas (DETOs) –** DETO
    arrangements help us retain Federal employees who wish to relocate
    overseas to remain with their spouse or sponsor employed in the
    national security, defense and foreign policy workforce. The
    Departments of Defense and State have taken actions to strengthen
    the DETO program to ensure equitable opportunities for servicemember
    and foreign service spouses so that resilient and talented civil
    servants are retained and families may stay together.

<!-- -->

-   Last year, DOD and the Department of State signed an interim
    Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to clarify residential security and
    safety requirements for military and foreign service spouses
    employed by the Federal government and working overseas through the
    DETO program, and are working towards a permanent MOA expected in
    March 2024.
-   As directed by the Executive Order on *Advancing Economic Security
    for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and
    Survivors*, the State Department is coordinating with Federal
    agencies across the government to improve awareness about the
    program, centralize points of contact for DETO at each agency, and
    set common standards to strengthen the program. These actions will
    support an increasing number of Federal employees—including, but not
    limited to, military spouses—to remain in the Federal workforce
    while teleworking from overseas.

*Better recruiting and retaining technical and specialized talent, and
improving professional development to close mission critical gaps*

-   **Improving hiring outcomes through pooled hiring and skills-based
    assessments.**

<!-- -->

-   Pooled hiring is a coordinated, cross-agency approach to strategic
    talent acquisition where multiple agencies with the same staffing
    need can run one hiring process for interested candidates. It is a
    critical tool in enhancing the hiring experience for both candidates
    and agencies, as pooled actions allow a single application to be
    reviewed by multiple agencies and a single hiring action to yield
    many hires.
-   OPM’s Hiring Experience Group, which serves as a hub for agency
    talent teams to improve hiring outcomes through innovation, is
    helping agencies navigate the deployment of strategic hiring tools
    designed to support expanded recruiting efforts, increased hiring
    manager satisfaction, and reduced applicant burden and agency hiring
    timeframes. Through pooled hiring actions, agencies benefit from
    access to shared certificates of qualified candidates who have
    completed rigorous assessments, thereby reducing the need for
    agencies to post multiple hiring actions for the same position.
-   As part of the pooled hiring process, OPM and subject-matter experts
    from multiple agencies work together to identify the required skills
    and competencies, develop appropriate assessments with support from
    subject matter experts, and identify high quality candidates to fill
    critical needs. This process results in a much higher rate of
    selection and gives candidates multiple opportunities for similar
    roles. For example, from a single hiring effort for data analysts at
    the Department of State, more than 100 selections were made. At DHS,
    successful selections have been made in the following occupational
    series: 0201 Human Resources Specialist, 1102 Contract Specialist,
    0101 Program Evaluator, and 2210 Information Technology Program
    Manager positions. In early CY 2024, pooled actions underway include
    key data and IT management and analyst positions.   
-   OPM is also working closely with agencies to best position Federal
    recruitment strategies to harness private sector tech talent
    possessing critical skillsets needed to protect, defend, and bolster
    the nation’s infrastructure.   
-   **Targeting critical staff through robust use of flexible and
    scalable hiring and pay authorities** focused on mission-critical
    skill-sets. With options to more agilely identify critical skills
    that are in high demand or low supply, agencies will be able to
    design more effective and robust recruitment and retention
    strategies including skills incentives for highly-skilled workers.

<!-- -->

-   DHS launched its Cybersecurity Talent Management System that allows
    for skills-based hiring, market competitive compensation, and
    specialized career development opportunities. 
-   In conjunction with the launch of the [National Cybersecurity
    Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf),
    ONCD, OPM and OMB partnered to develop a legislative proposal to
    support agencies in recruiting, hiring and retaining the cyber
    workforce. ONCD, OPM, and OMB are leveraging the Federal Cyber
    Workforce Working Group to socialize the proposal, set cyber
    workforce development priorities, and share agency leading
    practices.
-   DOE expanded retention incentives for specialized skills, including
    cyber.
-   VA leveraged the expanded Special Salary Rate (SSR) authorities
    afforded by the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act to
    authorize an SSR for its technology and cybersecurity personnel in
    Information Technology Management (2210), Computer Science (1550),
    and Computer Engineering (0854) occupational series. This is an
    important step towards closing the growing gap between industry and
    Federal government salary rates for technology and cybersecurity
    roles. The SSR represents an average increase of 17 percent in basic
    pay for VA’s highly skilled technical workforce.
-   VA partnered with DOD to hire transitioning military personnel to
    civilian police occupations within VA while they are still on active
    duty under the Skillbridge Program. This creates law
    enforcement-specific career development pathways to provide
    developmental skills needed to achieve the next level of leadership.
    VA has also worked with OPM to obtain approval for SSRs to support
    recruiting and retaining Police Officers, and has authorized a
    national Critical Skills Incentive strategy to further enhance
    recruitment and retention.
-   VA’s Office of Information Technology helped innovate Federal talent
    acquisition approaches by actively recruiting laid off tech workers
    to fill Department vacancies in software development, product
    management and cybersecurity.
-   OPM established the Tech to Gov Initiative, a multipronged strategy
    that aims to bring laid off tech workers into the public sector to
    support various IT modernization efforts. This effort consists of
    government-wide job fairs and a working group of HR, technologists,
    and hiring managers who work to systemically improve the hiring
    process for technologists across government. By participating in the
    job fair and the working group, Federal agencies can leverage
    special hiring authorities, shared hiring certificates with other
    Federal agencies and streamline recruitment strategies to ultimately
    onboard top talent quickly.
-   The IC uses existing and new authorities to attract highly-skilled
    candidates to the IC with in-demand skills. Expanded use of
    incentives, such as NSA’s STEM/Cyber pay scale, allows elements to
    be better compete in a fiercely competitive job market.
-   The Department of State offers skills incentive pay (SIP) in the
    amount of up to 15% for eligible IT employees and up to 25% for
    certain Cyber employees for receiving and utilizing certain
    certificates or credentials.  As a result, the Department of State
    is better positioned to retain highly skilled IT and Cyber employees
    in order to accomplish foreign policy objectives.
-   USAID stood up a Crisis Operations Staffing initiative in FY 2023
    with the intention to shift up to 350 existing contractor crisis
    response positions to new time-limited direct hire positions,
    determined by programmatic agency needs. These positions enable the
    agency to resource its crisis response bureaus and ensure that the
    agency can recruit and retain staff in the short- and long-term to
    prevent or respond to foreign crises and contexts with growing
    instability.
-   Expanding the use of **incentives and flexibilities available to
    recruit, retain, and support employees**, at a time of strong
    national job competition, including childcare subsidies, student
    loan repayments, and retention bonuses.

-   DOD implemented a standardized minimum 50 percent child care
    discount on the first child of direct-care staff members.
-   DOD implemented Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts for active
    duty servicemembers, allowing them to contribute up to $5,000 per
    household per year to a pretax account for eligible dependent care
    services.
-   USAID redesigned and is piloting a new, improved version of its
    Child Care Subsidy Program, which raised the total family income
    limit to $150,000 to make the program accessible to a wider range of
    USAID employees.
-   The Department of State is piloting an open enrollment of its Child
    Care Subsidy Program that allows employees to enroll in the program
    upon the birth or adoption of a child and for foreign service
    employee’s assumption of a domestic assignment. The Department
    raised the total family income limit to $170,000 which allowed more
    employees to receive up to $5,000 per year in childcare subsidy
    benefits.
-   The Student Loan Repayment Program (SLRP) has over 170 participants
    at USAID and over 1,000 at the Department of State who each receive
    up to $10,000 in student loan repayment annually in exchange for a
    service commitment. The SLRP program is open to career conditional
    civil service and foreign service employees in over 20 mission
    critical and STEM positions, and in some of the more challenging
    overseas posts, and includes Parent Plus loans, which are loans that
    parents take out for their children’s education.    
-   Approximately 40 percent of CIA employees are leveraging a newly
    expanded Official Time for Health and Wellbeing policy to spend
    three hours per week for health and wellbeing activities. CIA offers
    financial incentives to attract and retain employees specialized
    skill sets, such as foreign language skills. CIA is reviewing the
    effectiveness of existing incentive pay programs for STEM and
    foreign language, including a long-term compensation study to assess
    internal pay equity and external competitiveness with the private
    sector.

-   Bringing together for the first time 25 national security education
    institutions to create the **National Security Educational
    Consortium**, which will work to better provide meaningful learning
    and career growth opportunities for the national security workforce,
    particularly for critical skills. As a first effort, the Consortium
    compiled a shared catalogue of over 7,500 courses across critical
    skill areas, which can be used to share future resources focused on
    critical skill development needs.
-   Facilitating **critical skills development** for current and future
    employees and mission enablers.
    -   The Defense Language and National Security Education Office
        (DLNSEO) continues to lead the National Security Education
        Program (NSEP)/Boren Scholars and Fellows Program, providing
        opportunities for U.S. students to study critical foreign
        languages overseas under the David L. Boren National Security
        Education Act of 1991. DLNSEO also manages the National Language
        Service Corps (NLSC), which provides a readily available group
        of language volunteers with proficiency in over 500 languages
        and dialects to provide foreign language services to U.S.
        Federal agencies.
    -   The Intelligence Community Centers for Academic Excellence (IC
        CAE) Program offers grants to academic institutions to enhance
        the recruitment and retention of an ethnically and culturally
        diverse IC workforce through curriculum and/or program
        development (e.g., areas of study including national security,
        STEM, and less commonly taught foreign languages), faculty
        development, laboratory equipment or improvements, and faculty
        research.
    -   State issued its first Learning Policy to promote career-long
        learning with a core curriculum for mid-career employees and 40
        hours of annual learning for employees above and beyond
        mandatory training.  State also is adding dozens of new detail,
        fellowship and academic programs for employees focused on
        critical mission priorities.
    -   USAID launched its Foreign Service National (FSN) Empowerment
        initiative to expand opportunities for professional growth and
        increase retention of its 4700-strong network of local experts
        serving in its missions worldwide. This includes creating
        additional senior-level positions that create new pathways for
        high-performing employees along an expanded career ladder, while
        boosting mission effectiveness.
    -   The VA Office of Information Technology launched an interactive
        development resource that enables VA employees to explore cyber
        work roles defined by the NICE Workforce Framework for
        Cybersecurity and the Defense Cyberspace Workforce Framework.
        Work roles are the guiding principle of the cybersecurity
        development technical track, which consists of skills-based
        profiles, day-in-the-life videos, qualification indicators,
        curated curriculum, on-the-job training, and just-in-time
        resources, all aligned to the tasks, knowledge, and skills
        required for each individual role. By exploring role-driven
        development resources, employees are able to explore career
        options by role, develop new skills/or refine existing ones,
        discover alternate career pathways, and access resources,
        including meaningful learning and development opportunities,
        necessary for achieving career goals.
    -   OPM has established a Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce
        Program, designed to spearhead the development of critical cyber
        skills and to foster environments where employees have ongoing
        learning and development opportunities. Fourteen Federal
        agencies submitted approximately 70 rotation assignments across
        the government. Agencies are actively interviewing candidates
        with selections forthcoming.
    -   OPM tracks agency progress to close hiring and staffing gaps in
        mission critical occupations (MCO) and DOD, State, and DHS
        successfully met over 90 percent of their staffing targets for
        their MCOs, while USAID met over 80 percent.  
-   **Expanding development and outreach to the Human Resources
    practitioners** who are key to implementing these efforts, including
    creating new training programs, coursework and guides as well as
    establishing new communities of practice to encourage the exchange
    of leading practices and innovative ideas in Federal human resources
    management.
    -   DOD’s Human Resources Functional Community (HRFC) is charged
        with prioritizing and elevating HR talent through several
        communities of practice, as well as through the Chief Human
        Capital Officers Council Elevating HR Working Group; HR
        technical area credentialing and development programs and
        training; and central repositories that offer HR practitioners
        information on available training, best practices, tools,
        developmental opportunities, and other resources. In
        coordination with OPM, the HRFC is currently partnering with
        nine other Federal agencies to pilot a Federal HR career path in
        support of the President’s Management Agenda within DOD. The
        HRFC publishes quarterly a newsletter to communicate and
        socialize DoD-wide HR news, events, initiatives, and best
        practices to the more than 24,000 HR practitioners supporting
        the Department.
    -   VA established an HR intern program, hiring over 1000 HR
        professionals into the program in the first year.

Moving forward, we will continue to work to implement these and other
NSM-3 actions, with a particular focus on enhancing public outreach;
improving hiring, expanding skills-based hiring and maximizing the
utilization of hiring authorities and innovations; leveraging expert
hiring and talent surge initiatives; improving workforce rotational and
detailee experiences, and agency utilization; enhancing training and
upskilling in critical occupational areas; and continually improving
critical skills recruitment, hiring, development, and retention.  
Our country’s future and the strength and safety of our people and
communities rely on the success of our national security and foreign
policy workforce and the partnerships we build today to educate,
support, and motivate the next generation of talented and dedicated
Americans to pursue careers in public service.  
The President has never been more confident that the U.S. government and
the American people are up to this enormous task, and we remain
committed to meeting this moment in history with the best the country
has to offer.
