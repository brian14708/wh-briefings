title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Restoration of the Northern Ireland\
  \ Executive and\_Assembly"

I welcome and strongly support the restoration of the Northern Ireland
Executive and Assembly at Stormont, and I commend the political leaders
of Northern Ireland for taking the necessary steps to restore these core
institutions. As I said when I visited Belfast last year to mark the
25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, the
democratic institutions it established remain critical for the future of
Northern Ireland, and a government that finds ways through hard problems
together will draw even greater opportunity to Northern Ireland. I look
forward to seeing the renewed stability of a power-sharing government
that strengthens the peace dividend, restores public services, and
continues building on the immense progress of the last decades. This is
an important step, and I am confident that through consistent dialogue
and ongoing cooperation with both the United Kingdom and Ireland,
Stormont’s restoration will facilitate the critical North-South and
East-West relations vital to the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, and
ensure that Northern Ireland will continue to be vibrant and dynamic,
defined by unlimited opportunity for all who call it home.
