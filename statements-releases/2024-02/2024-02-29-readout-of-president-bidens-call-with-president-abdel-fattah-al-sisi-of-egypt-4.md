President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Abdel Fattah
Al-Sisi of Egypt. The two leaders discussed the war in Gaza and their
efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. The President
thanked President Al-Sisi for Egypt’s leadership in delivering
humanitarian aid to Gaza.  The leaders underscored that the release of
hostages would result in an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza
over a period of at least six weeks.  They exchanged views on how such a
prolonged period of calm could then be built into something more
enduring.  They also discussed planning to surge humanitarian assistance
into Gaza and how the ceasefire under the hostage deal would further
help enable those efforts and ensure that assistance reached civilians
in need throughout Gaza.  They also discussed the tragic and alarming
incident earlier today in northern Gaza.  Both leaders grieved the loss
of civilian lives and agreed that this incident underscored the urgency
of bringing negotiations to a close as soon as possible and expanding
the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza.  The two leaders and
their teams agreed to stay in regular contact over the coming days.
