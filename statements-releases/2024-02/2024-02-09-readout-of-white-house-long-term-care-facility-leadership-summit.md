title: "Readout of White\_House Long-Term Care Facility Leadership\_Summit"
---
 
Last week, the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response
Policy, and senior Biden-Harris Administration officials hosted the
second Long-Term Care Facility Leadership Summit, convening leaders from
national associations and organizations focused on protecting our
nations’ seniors and providing high-quality care to residents of
long-term care facilities.

During the summit, which built on a previous convening in October,
participants discussed their shared commitment to ensuring older
Americans have the information needed to inform choices about how to
protect themselves from three viruses – COVID-19, flu, and RSV. These
illnesses are some of the leading causes of hospitalizations and other
severe outcomes among older Americans. The convening also included a
dialogue on the operational challenges which long-term care facility
leaders have faced and how Administration officials can continue to
partner with them to meet our shared goal of fewer elder Americans who
become seriously ill. Senior Administration Officials and attendees
agreed that they would continue their partnership and take proactive
steps now to develop plans for the 2024-2025 respiratory season, guided
by best practices and key takeaways learned from this season.

Maj Gen (ret) Paul Friedrichs, MD, FACS, Deputy Assistant to the
