  Leaders"

Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened her second meeting of 2024
with leaders who are on the frontlines of protecting voting rights and
registering communities to vote.

During the discussion at the White House, the Vice President announced
new steps that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to ensure
Americans have the information they need to vote, promote voter
participation for students, protect election workers, and fight voter
suppression laws. Additionally, she announced three National Days of
Action on Voting – Juneteenth, the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act,
and National Voter Registration Day – that will focus on voter
engagement. While once again urging Congress to pass the John Lewis
Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, Vice
President Harris also encouraged voting rights leaders to continue to
work with agencies from across the Administration to promote voting
access for all communities.

The leaders in attendance shared their commitment to protecting voting
rights across the country and to coordinating and collaborating on the
National Days of Action on voting. They also gave an overview of their
work to respond to the needs of their communities to address disparities
in voter engagement and remove barriers to the ballot box. Additionally,
leaders highlighted why it is critical to promote ongoing civic
engagement, not only for Election Day, but also year-round.

The new steps that Vice President Harris announced include:

-   The Department of Health and Human Services is providing information
    about how to register to vote in follow-up emails to those who
    enroll in health care on HealthCare.gov.

<!-- -->

-   The Social Security Administration will now display signs with
    Vote.gov in the lobbies of all Social Security offices. There are
    more than 1,200 offices across the country that see around six
    million visitors each year.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Interior will now display Vote.gov signage and
    information at the entrances and visitor centers of national parks,
    national wildlife refuges, and other federal public lands across the
    country. These sites received nearly 50o million visits last year. 

<!-- -->

-   Federal Work Study funds can now be used to pay students to work as
    nonpartisan poll workers through federal, state, local, or tribal
    government offices, helping to address the shortage of poll workers
    that exists across America.
