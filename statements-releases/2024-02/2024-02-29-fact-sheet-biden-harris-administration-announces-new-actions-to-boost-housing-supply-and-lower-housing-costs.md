title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Boost\
  \ Housing Supply and Lower Housing\_Costs"
---
 
*New actions will create tens of thousands of affordable homes, while
promoting fairer and more transparent rental markets*

President Biden believes that every American deserves access to a
quality and affordable home. His Administration is pursuing an
all-of-government approach to build more housing and lower housing
costs. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a series of
new actions that will:

-   Bolster federal programs with a proven track-record of producing
    affordable housing;
-   Boost the supply and affordability of manufactured homes; and
-   Promote fairer, more transparent rental markets.

These actions fulfill and build upon the dozens of commitments in the
White House [Housing Supply Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/)
and the [Blueprint for a Renters Bill of
Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-House-Blueprint-for-a-Renters-Bill-of-Rights.pdf)
that span the federal government. But more action is needed: the
Administration will continue to lay out additional actions we are taking
to lower housing costs and call on Congress to make the investments
necessary to ensure access to quality and affordable housing for all
Americans.

**Bolster federal programs with a proven track-record of producing
affordable housing**

The Biden-Harris Administration has taken dozens of executive actions to
improve the federal programs to support the construction and
preservation of affordable housing – which has contributed to record
housing construction in 2023. Today’s announcements will build on that
progress. Specific actions include:

-   **Extending the Federal Financing Bank Risk Sharing program.**
    Today, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the
    Department of the Treasury are announcing that they are indefinitely
    extending the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Federal
    Financing Bank (FFB) Risk Sharing program– providing an ongoing
    source of capital so that state and local housing finance agencies
    (HFAs) can continue to offer FHA insured multifamily loans at
    reduced interest rates to create and preserve high-quality,
    affordable rental homes. After the previous Administration suspended
    the program, the Biden-Harris Administration restarted the program
    in 2021. Since then, more than 12,000 affordable housing units have
    been created or preserved, supported by almost $2 billion in
    FHA-insured loans made through the program. This new extension will
    create an estimated 38,000 additional units over ten years, as well
    as bolster HFA participation in the program.

-   **Making the HOME program easier to use.** In the coming weeks, HUD
    expects to publish a proposed rule to streamline and modernize the
    regulations for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME
    program), the nation’s largest annual block grant to support housing
    supply. During the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD has allocated
    $4.35 billion in funding to build and preserve affordable rental
    homes and make homeownership a reality for thousands of families. In
    collaboration with states, cities, local elected officials,
    stakeholder organizations, and local community development partners,
    HOME has assisted over 45,000 households since 2021.

HUD is proposing improvements that would make HOME easier to use for
individuals and families looking for a home to rent or buy, as well as
for homeowners making upgrades to their homes such as accessibility
improvements, new roofs, and replacement of outdated utilities with
energy efficient ones. HUD’s proposals would also streamline
requirements for grantees administering funding, community development
organizations building new homes, and property owners renting to
HUD-funded households. The proposed rule would also update requirements
regarding property standards, small scale rental housing projects,
community land trusts, homebuyer resale, allowable rents for units
receiving rental assistance, and tenant protections.

-   **Providing new funding to support housing for low-income seniors.**
    Last week, HUD
    [announced](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_032)
    the availability of $115 million in grant funding to support the
    development preservation of supportive housing for an estimated
    1,100 units for low-income seniors through the Section 202
    Supportive Housing for the Elderly program. $35 million of these
    funds will be set aside to create intergenerational housing units
    with features to meet the needs of households headed by seniors who
    are raising children under 18 years old. This builds off of over
    $161 million in Section 202 grant awards HUD announced in October
    2023, which will support nearly 1,300 units for eligible households.
-   **Unlocking affordable housing tax credits for states affected by
    recent disasters**. Last month, the IRS
    [released](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-24-05.pdf) guidance
    clarifying that returned low-income housing tax credits that were
    allocated to disaster areas in 2021 and 2022 can be reallocated for
    any proposed LIHTC project.

In addition to funding housing production and preservation, the federal
government continues to produce research to build knowledge about and
promote innovations that can produce more housing. HUD recently
[awarded](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_036)
nearly $4 million in research funds to assess the potential of off-site
construction and state and local land use and zoning reforms to increase
housing supply and reduce housing costs, and to help local governments
convert underutilized offices and commercial buildings to housing.

**Boost the Supply and Affordability of Manufactured Homes:**

Manufactured housing is a critical source of affordable housing,
especially for low-income, rural, and Native American households and
offers a potentially lower-cost pathway to homeownership. More than 20
million Americans currently live in manufactured housing, which is the
largest form of unsubsidized affordable housing in the country.
Manufactured housing provides an essential path to increasing overall
housing supply and offers significant savings over site-built housing.
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing steps to preserve
and rehabilitate existing manufactured home communities and to make it
easier to finance the purchase of manufactured homes, including by:

-   **Releasing a first-of-its-kind $225 million funding opportunity
    to** **support manufactured housing communities.** Today, HUD
    announced that the application for [Preservation and Reinvestment
    Initiative for Community Enhancement (PRICE)
    grants](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/price) is
    now open to support the preservation and revitalization of
    manufactured housing communities. These competitive grants can be
    used for the replacement of dilapidated homes, assistance for
    homeowners such as repairs and accessibility modifications,
    mitigation and resilience upgrades, improvement of infrastructure
    such as stormwater systems or utilities, housing services including
    eviction prevention, and planning activities. This marks the first
    time the federal government has made grant funding available
    specifically for investments in manufactured housing communities,
    including resident-owned communities. A portion of funds are
    dedicated to supporting Tribes and tribal nonprofit organizations.
-   **Preserving the affordability of manufactured housing communities
    via expanded financing options.** Corporate investors are purchasing
    manufactured housing communities and driving up rent and driving out
    longtime residents. Today, FHA is publishing a [draft Mortgagee
    Letter](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/Multifamily/MFH_Policy_Drafts/Utilizing_Section_223_f_MHC_draft)
    that, once finalized, will create a new program to preserve
    affordability for existing residents of manufactured housing
    communities. Under the new program, resident cooperatives and other
    mission-oriented borrowers will be permitted to use FHA 223(f)
    multifamily loans to acquire or refinance communities. Designed to
    complement the PRICE grant program, a PRICE recipient could use this
    program to purchase the community from its current owner, preserving
    its long-term affordability and use PRICE funds for critical
    infrastructure improvements and home repairs. However, eligibility
    for this program will not be limited to PRICE awardees.
-   **Increasing loan limits for Title I Manufactured Housing.** This
    week, [FHA published a final
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/28/2024-04138/indexing-methodology-for-title-i-manufactured-home-loan-limits)
    increasing loan limits for the Title I Manufactured Housing program,
    which insures loans to finance the purchase or refinancing of
    manufactured homes titled as personal property. Doing so will allow
    FHA to better serve low- and moderate-income and first-time buyers
    of manufactured housing whose financing needs have not been
    well-served by the private market. Historically, HUD’s Title I
    program has been an important source of financing for manufactured
    homes, but low loan limits have made the program dormant in recent
    years. The rule will increase loan limits to be in line with current
    market prices and enable HUD to regularly update the limits in the
    future. To support this action, Ginnie Mae
    [revised](https://www.ginniemae.gov/issuers/program_guidelines/Pages/mbsguideapmslibdisppage.aspx?ParamID=157)
    eligibility requirements for Issuers of its Manufactured Housing
    Mortgage-Backed Securities program. These actions are intended to
    reduce barriers to entry for Issuers and increase participation in
    its securitization program for Title I loans. 

These actions build on steps HUD took earlier this year to [publish a
proposed
rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/10/2024-00039/submission-for-community-development-block-grant-program-consolidated-plans-and-indian-community)
for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program that emphasized
the importance of considering the needs of manufactured housing
communities during their planning process. HUD also recently updated the
[CDBG in Support of Housing Activities
notice](https://www.hudexchange.info/news/notice-cpd-23-10-use-of-cdbg-funds-in-support-of-housing/)
to clarify that communities may use CDBG funds for acquisition of
manufactured housing units, services to homeowners of manufactured
housing units, and investments in infrastructure and resilience for
manufactured housing communities.

**Promote Fairer, More Transparent Rental Markets**

The Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to promote housing
stability for renters. In January 2023, the White House published a
Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights, which contained dozens of agency
commitments to create a fairer rental market. Today, the Administration
is announcing several new actions:

-   **Clarifying banned non-rent fees in HUD-assisted properties.**
    Today, HUD is releasing new resources clarifying HUD policies and
    laws that prohibit certain non-rent fees in its
    [Multifamily](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Housing/documents/Existing_Policy_on_Non-Rent_Fees_for_Subsidized_Multifamily_Housing_Programs.pdf),
    [Public
    Housing](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/documents/PH%20Non-Rent%20Fees%20Chart_Final.pdf),
    and [Housing Choice Vouchers/Project Based
    Vouchers](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/images/HCV_PBV%20Non-Rent%20Fees%20Chart_Final_2-21-24.pdf)
    programs. These new resources make clear that certain fees, such as
    application and screening fees in Public Housing and Multifamily
    subsidized programs, are prohibited, and help ensure that tenants
    are not charged or penalized for impermissible fees. Last year,
    President Biden
    [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-on-junk-fees-in-rental-housing-to-lower-costs-for-renters/)
    new private sector commitments to call out junk fees in the rental
    housing market, HUD Secretary Fudge issued an [open
    letter](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_23_048)
    calling on housing providers to adopt policies that promote fairness
    and transparency for renters, and the FTC last fall
    [proposed](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/10/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-junk-fees)
    a new rule that would ban misleading and hidden fees across the
    economy, including in rental housing.
-   **Ensuring tenants’ rights for military service members.** The
    Department of Defense (DoD) announced all 200 of its bases will have
    adopted its [Tenant Bill of
    Rights](https://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/ResourceGuides/Military-Housing-Privatization-Initiative-Tenant-Bill-of-Rights.pdf)
    by the end of the calendar year. Once fully implemented, it will
    cover approximately 203,000 houses for Service members and their
    families.
-   **Providing new resources to prevent unfair and preventable
    evictions.** Today, HUD is publishing a [fact
    sheet](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/FHEO/documents/Never%20Good%20Cause.pdf)
    highlighting situations in which housing providers may not evict or
    threaten to evict someone. In addition, HUD’s [Office of Policy
    Development and Research (PD&R) published
    policies](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/policy-and-practice-publication-2024-february.pdf)
    that local and state governments can adopt to reduce eviction
    filings, such as requiring good cause for evictions, increasing
    access to legal services, improving access to courtrooms, using data
    to identify at-risk households, sharing data across sectors,
    offering financial assistance, and providing housing navigators who
    can assist with connecting tenants to supportive services.
-   **Promoting prospective renters’ rights during tenant screening
    process.** The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Consumer Financial
    Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and HUD
    will soon jointly publish a fact sheet describing the rights
    prospective renters have when screened by housing providers.
    Together, the four agencies administer the Fair Credit Report Act
    (FTC and CFPB) and the Fair Housing Act (DOJ and HUD), and the fact
    sheet lays out protections under these two laws in one document.
