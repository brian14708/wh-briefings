---
 
When President Biden came into office, he vowed to lower health care
costs for American families. By passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the
President and Congressional Democrats finally allowed Medicare to
negotiate lower prescription drug prices for seniors – while every
single Republican in Congress voted to keep health care costs high, even
for their own constituents.  
   
Yesterday’s decision in the Western District of Texas is an important
step in this Administration’s defense of the law.  Despite Big Pharma’s
attempts to block prescription drug negotiation, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services is moving forward with their critical
work to negotiate for lower drug prices for the first ten drugs selected
for the negotiation program. Millions of seniors take these drugs every
year for conditions ranging from diabetes to heart disease, blood
cancers, Crohn’s disease, and more – and some pay nearly $6,500 per year
out of their own pockets for one drug alone.  
   
Americans shouldn’t be forced to pay two to three times more for their
prescription drugs than other developed nations. President Biden and
this Administration will continue this essential work to lower health
care costs for millions of seniors and their families.
