In the spirit of their strong partnership, President Joe Biden spoke to
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico this

challenges at our shared border and committed to continuing their
productive partnership.  President Biden expressed his appreciation for
Mexico’s operational support and for taking concrete steps to deter
irregular migration while expanding lawful pathways.  The two leaders
reiterated their shared commitment to bolster our joint efforts to
counter transnational criminal organizations involved in the illicit
trafficking of drugs, guns, and people.  They agreed to continue close
cooperation between our two governments in improving the lives of
Americans and Mexicans and in advancing opportunities throughout the
Western Hemisphere.
