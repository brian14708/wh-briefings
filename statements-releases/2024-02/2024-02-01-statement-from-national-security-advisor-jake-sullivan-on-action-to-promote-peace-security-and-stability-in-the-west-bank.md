title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Action to Promote\
  \ Peace, Security, and Stability in the West\_Bank"
---
 
President Biden has been clear that the United States strongly supports
Israel’s right to defend itself following the horrific terrorist attacks
that occurred on October 7 and in its effort to defeat Hamas to make
sure that such an attack never happens again. This includes taking steps
to cut off Hamas’ access to the international financial system. Since
October 7, the United States has issued five rounds of sanctions against
Hamas, including the most recent round of sanctions against Hamas last
week. President Biden has also spoken about his concern about the rise
in violence that we have seen in the West Bank from extremist actors—in
particular the rise in extremist settler violence, which reached record
levels in 2023. This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security,
and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and
threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the
United States.  
   
Today, President Biden signed a new Executive Order to implement new
measures to address actions that undermine peace, security, and
stability in the West Bank. This E.O. will allow the United States to
issue financial sanctions against those directing or participating in
certain actions, including acts or threats of violence against
civilians, intimidating civilians to cause them to leave their homes,
destroying or seizing property, or engaging in terrorist activity in the
West Bank. The State Department today will also be announcing an initial
set of designations under this new E.O.  
   
Today’s actions seek to promote peace and security for Israelis and
Palestinians alike.
