title: "Statement by Karine Jean-Pierre on Senate Republicans Blocking Efforts to\
  \ Safeguard Nationwide Access to\_IVF"
---
 
The idea that Senate Republicans would block a vote to protect access to
in vitro fertilization – IVF – is outrageous. After the Alabama Supreme
Court’s ruling put IVF on pause in much of the state, and raised issues
about whether it would be available in other states, Congressional
Republicans rushed to the microphones to proclaim their support for IVF.
But when Senator Tammy Duckworth offered a bill to protect access to IVF
in every state, Senate Republicans said no. Let’s be clear – every woman
in this country should have the freedom to make the decision to have a
child, and about one in five American women struggle with infertility
and many rely on IVF. This is a basic issue of reproductive freedom.   
   
We must be clear-eyed about how we got here. When the Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade, it paved the road for Republican elected
officials’ extreme, out-of-touch agenda which has eroded access to
reproductive health care for families in Alabama and across the country.
No attempts by Republican elected officials to “rebrand” can change the
fact that they have spent decades trying to eliminate the constitutional
right to choose and undermine reproductive freedom.  
   
President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to fight to
protect access to reproductive health care, including IVF, and call on
Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law for
all women in every state.
