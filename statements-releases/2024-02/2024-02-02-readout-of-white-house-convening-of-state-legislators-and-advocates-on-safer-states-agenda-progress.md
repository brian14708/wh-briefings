  \ States Agenda\_Progress"

In September 2023, President Biden established the [first-ever White
House Office of Gun Violence
Prevention](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ogvp/), overseen by Vice
President Kamala Harris. President Biden tasked the office with four key
responsibilities, including enhancing the federal government’s
partnerships with cities and states to help them advance their own
efforts to reduce gun violence.  
  
On Tuesday, the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention and the
Office of Intergovernmental Affairs convened over 150 state legislators,
advocates, and staff to discuss progress and build momentum following
the release of the White House [Safer States
Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OGVP-Safer-States-Policy-Agenda.pdf) at
the December convening of [state
legislators. ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/13/readout-of-white-house-convening-of-state-legislators-on-advancing-gun-violence-prevention-efforts/)At
the initial convening, Vice President Kamala Harris called on
legislators to continue their efforts heading into the 2024 legislative
session. This follow-up conversation highlighted early successes and
opportunities for the Administration to support states in their ongoing
commitment to building safer communities.  
  
Since December, state legislators in at least 27 states across the
country have introduced legislation advancing the Safer States Agenda,
including legislation that would establish state offices of gun violence
prevention, reinforce responsible gun ownership, and establish industry
accountability, among other safety measures. Yesterday, participants
heard from six state leaders who are championing specific state
legislative proposals:

-   **California State Senator Anthony Portantino** on strengthening
    safe firearm storage laws.
-   **Delaware State Representative Cynthia Romer** on requiring permits
    to purchase firearms.
-   **Pennsylvania State Representative Ben Sanchez** on banning assault
    weapons.
-   **Virginia State Senator Jennifer Carroll Foy** on holding the gun
    industry accountability.
-   **Washington State Representative Liz Berry** on efforts to address
    lost and stolen firearms.
-   **Executive Director of the Maryland Office of Crime Prevention,
    Youth, and Victim Services Dorothy Lennig** on Governor Moore’s
    proposals to establish a statewide Center for Firearm Violence
    Prevention and Intervention, and modernize Maryland’s victims’
    compensation program.

The leadership of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention
thanked legislators for their commitment and partnership, and advocates
for the vital role they plan in advancing state legislation.
