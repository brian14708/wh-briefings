We applaud this bipartisan effort by Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Ron Wyden and Ranking Member Mike Crapo on fraud prevention and
technology modernization in the unemployment system that aligns
with several specific elements from [President Biden’s anti-fraud
proposal](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-president-bidens-sweeping-pandemic-anti-fraud-proposal-going-after-systemic-fraud-taking-on-identity-theft-helping-victims/). Emergency
unemployment benefits were a critical lifeline for millions of workers
who lost jobs through no fault of their own during the pandemic. But the
implementation in 2020 exposed the need for stronger fraud
prevention systems and greater investment in technology to modernize
unemployment systems.

The bipartisan framework released today comprises several specific
provisions from the President’s anti-fraud proposal, including extending
the statute of limitations for pandemic UI fraud to 10 years, giving
prosecutors the time needed to investigate and prosecute complex
criminal syndicates, and requiring checks against existing government
datasets that will prevent fraudulent unemployment insurance
payments to ineligible recipients, including deceased individuals and
prisoners. The President looks forward to further action from
Congress on additional components of his plan to prevent fraud, punish
systemic fraud, and recover funds, while ensuring equitable access for
legitimate claimants. This includes expanded strike forces and resources
for Inspectors General to prosecute and recover funds from criminal
syndicates, investments in the analytical tools, safeguards, and
data-sharing to prevent future fraud, and resources to safeguard
Americans from identity theft and help victims recover.
