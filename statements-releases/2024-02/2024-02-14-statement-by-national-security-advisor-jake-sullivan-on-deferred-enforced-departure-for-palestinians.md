title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Deferred Enforced\
  \ Departure for\_Palestinians"
---
 
Following the horrific October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas against
Israel, and Israel’s ensuing military response, humanitarian conditions
in Gaza have significantly deteriorated. In light of the ongoing
conflict and humanitarian needs on the ground, President Biden signed a
memorandum directing the deferral of removal of certain Palestinians who
are present in the United States, giving them a temporary safe haven.
Specifically, President Biden is granting deferred enforced departure
for 18 months to Palestinians that are currently in the United
States. This grant of deferred enforced departure would provide
protections for most Palestinians in the United States, with certain
exceptions. Those convicted of felonies or who are otherwise deemed to
pose a public safety threat are not eligible for deferred enforced
departure. Anyone who voluntarily returns to the Palestinian territories
would lose any such protections.
