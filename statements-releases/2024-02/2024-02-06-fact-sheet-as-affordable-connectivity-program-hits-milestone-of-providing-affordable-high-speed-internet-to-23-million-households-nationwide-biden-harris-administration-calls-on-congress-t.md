title: "FACT SHEET: As Affordable Connectivity Program Hits Milestone of Providing\
  \ Affordable High-Speed Internet To 23 Million Households Nationwide, Biden-\u2060\
  Harris Administration Calls on Congress to Extend Its\_Funding"
---
 
As part of the President’s Investing in America agenda, a key component
of Bidenomics, the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic
progress towards lowering costs – including internet costs – for
American families across the country. The Affordable Connectivity
Program, enacted under President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
as the largest internet affordability program in our nation’s history,
is now helping 23 million households – 1 in 6 households across America
– save $30-$75 each on their monthly internet bills. And, because the
Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer
high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable
Connectivity Program, most eligible households can now get high-speed
internet for free.  
  
However, without action from Congress, this program will sunset this
spring and millions of Americans may no longer be able to afford
high-speed internet service. On October 25, 2023, the Biden-Harris
Administration sent Congress [a supplemental request for $6
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Summary-of-Funding-Request-to-Meet-Critical-Needs.pdf) to
extend funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program. Tomorrow, the
FCC will be pausing new enrollments in the program. This means that
households that can’t afford high-speed internet and haven’t yet signed
up will stay stuck on the wrong side of the digital divide—unless
Congress acts. **The Biden-Harris Administration continues to call on
Congress to pass legislation that would extend free and discounted
high-speed internet for eligible households through 2024.**  
  
In the 21st century, affordable, reliable high-speed internet is
critical in order to access education, healthcare, and work, engage in
precision agriculture, and keep in touch with loved ones. Still, too
many are left without high-speed internet because they lack the
infrastructure or are inhibited by high costs. In particular, these
inequities impact underserved communities, rural communities, veterans,
and older Americans where the lack of affordable, reliable high-speed
internet contributes to significant economic, health and other
disparities.  
  
Thanks to the Affordable Connectivity Program, the Administration has
made historic progress toward closing the digital divide for communities
that have been left behind for too long.  
  
**Key stats on enrollment include the following:**

-   Nearly half of the households benefitting from ACP are military
    families.
-   Four million seniors and 10 million Americans over the age of 50
    benefit from this program every month.
-   1-in-4 households participating in the Affordable Connectivity
    Program are African American and 1-in-4 households are Latino.
-   The Affordable Connectivity Program provides an enhanced monthly
    subsidy to 320,000 households on Tribal lands, where high-speed
    internet is generally more expensive.

Below, find state by state data on how many families are enrolled in the
Affordable Connectivity Program, including estimates of percentages of
households enrolled in ACP in every Congressional District.
