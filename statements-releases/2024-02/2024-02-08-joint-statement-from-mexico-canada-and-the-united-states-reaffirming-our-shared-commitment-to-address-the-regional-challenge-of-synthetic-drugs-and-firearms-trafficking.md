On February 7, 2024, Mexico’s Secretary of Security and Citizen
Protection Rosa Icela Rodriguez hosted the United States’ White House
Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and Canada’s
Deputy Clerk and National Security and Intelligence Advisor Nathalie G.
Drouin in the fourth meeting of the Trilateral Fentanyl Committee to
review progress on our commitments and discuss further joint actions to
counter the flows of illicit synthetic drugs and illegal firearms in
North America.   
   
President Joe Biden, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau established the Trilateral Fentanyl Committee in
January 2023, during the North American Leaders’ Summit (NALS), to guide
priority actions to address the threat from illicit synthetic drugs,
including fentanyl, in North America.

The United States, Mexico, and Canada commit to increasing collaboration
on the control of precursor chemicals and equipment related to illicit
drug production, continuously reviewing our legal frameworks to identify
areas for improvement, and further engaging the private sector to combat
the production of illicit synthetic drugs.  We are also working to
strengthen diplomatic efforts to build on the progress of the Global
Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats.  To advance public health,
we are committed to developing and implementing a common drug and
substances analysis protocol, which will allow toxicologists from the
three countries to improve our understanding of regional drug trends. In
addition, we plan to convene a forum to discuss strategies and their
implementation for assisting the long-term recovery of individuals with
substance use disorders.   
   
Our governments have expanded the scope of the Trilateral Fentanyl
Committee to address firearms trafficking associated with illicit drug
production and distribution under the auspices of the North American
Drug Dialogue.  As an important first step, we commit to developing a
trilateral report that documents cross-border firearms seizures in all
three countries.  The report will broaden our strategic understanding of
the corridors and methodologies used for trafficking drugs and firearms
and the criminal organizations involved to better inform our actions.
 We also commit to increase our use of the U.S. Department of Justice’s
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ (ATF) eTrace
database to allow for more and faster joint investigations into the
illicit trafficking of firearms across our borders. In addition, to
increase and expedite information sharing on criminals and illicit
activities associated with trafficking of fentanyl and firearms, the
United States invited Mexico to embed personnel at the U.S. Customs and
Border Protection National Targeting Center, joining Canadian personnel
who are already embedded there.  
   
We are optimistic that our ongoing collective efforts will help improve
the security and health of our citizens and communities.  Together we
will work aggressively to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl, precursor
chemicals, and firearms across our shared borders; increase
investigations and prosecutions of criminals behind these heinous
crimes; and support individuals who are affected by these crimes and
those in recovery.
