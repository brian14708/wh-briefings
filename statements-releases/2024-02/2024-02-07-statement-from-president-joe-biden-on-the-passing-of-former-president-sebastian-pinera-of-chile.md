Jill and I join the people of Chile in grieving the tragic loss of
former President Sebastián Piñera of Chile.

Driven by a sense of passion and purpose, President Piñera was committed
to forging a more secure and prosperous future for Chile.  He worked
tirelessly to grow Chile’s economy and advocate for his nation on the
world stage. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he placed the safety of his
fellow citizens paramount—helping Chile achieve one of the fastest
vaccination rates in the world.  And in the wake of a devastating
earthquake and tsunami in 2010, President Piñera’s steadfast leadership
not only helped guide Chile through the pain of darkness and loss,
but enabled Chile to emerge stronger—an inspiration Chileans can
continue to draw from today as they bravely fight and recover from the
tragic ongoing wildfires.

I deeply valued my time working with President Piñera over the last
decade, where I saw his dedication to his country—and to our
partnership—firsthand. The United States will continue the remarkable
legacy of cooperation he helped chart, and we send our deepest
condolences to former First Lady Cecilia Morel, his family, and all
those mourning this grave loss.
