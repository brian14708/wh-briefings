title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Namibian President Hage\_\
  Geingob"
---
 
Jill and I offer our deepest condolences to First Lady Monica Geingos
and the rest of the Namibian people on the loss of President Hage
Geingob.  
   
President Geingob was a fearless leader, fighting for independence,
overseeing the drafting of the new nation’s constitution, and serving
his country twice as prime minister and finally as president. He was an
eloquent advocate for his country and continent, who stood up for his
values and beliefs. We will continue to build on his legacy,
strengthening our partnerships and shared vision for deeper mutual
support.  
   
Throughout his life, he maintained close ties to the United States and
the American people. From studying at Temple University in Philadelphia
and at both Fordham University and The New School in New York, President
Geingob believed in the enduring ties between the people of our two
great nations. I will miss working with him.  
   
We look forward to continuing to strengthen our relationship with
Namibia, honoring President Geingob’s legacy and vision for his country
and people.
