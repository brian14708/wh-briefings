President Biden will welcome President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister
Donald Tusk of Poland for a joint meeting at the White House on March
12.  The leaders will reaffirm their unwavering support for Ukraine’s
defense against Russia’s brutal war of conquest.  The meeting also
coincides with the 25th anniversary of Poland’s accession to NATO and
underscores the United States’ and Poland’s shared ironclad commitment
to the NATO Alliance, which makes us all safer.  The three will
coordinate ahead of the upcoming NATO Summit in Washington.  They will
also discuss the strong U.S.-Polish strategic energy security
partnership, its robust economic relationship, and the United States’
and Poland’s shared commitment to democratic values.
