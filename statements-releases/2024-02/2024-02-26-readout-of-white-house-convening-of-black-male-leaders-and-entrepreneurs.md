title: "Readout of White\_House Convening of Black Male Leaders and Entrepreneurs"
---
 
On Friday, the White House Office of Public Engagement hosted a
Celebration of Black Men, an event highlighting the achievements of
Black male leaders and entrepreneurs across the fields of professional
sports, arts and design, media, academia, and finance. The event
underscored the Administration’s commitment to investing in Black
Americans’ ability to succeed by expanding access to economic
opportunity – a key part of Bidenomics.

Event participants comprised over 120 Black men including members of
national and local community organizations, university students from
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other regional
institutions, government officials, and leaders from the private sector.

During a panel conversation moderated by Senior Advisor to the President
and Director of Public Engagement Stephen Benjamin, Black entrepreneurs
had the opportunity to discuss their respective journeys navigating
different industries, and provided insights and advice for younger
audience members in attendance. Participants also celebrated Black male
White House and Agency leaders representing the most diverse
Administration in history.

Officials emphasized the Administration’s dedication to furthering the
implementation of the President’s policy agenda to secure and expand the
unprecedented gains made for Black Americans. This historic event marked
a continuation of the White House’s 2024 celebration of Black History
Month.
