title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Black Americans and Communities Across the\_Country"
---
 
Over the past three years, President Biden and Vice President Harris
have leveraged the full force of the Federal Government to advance
racial justice and equity and ensure the promise of America for all
communities, including Black Americans, across the country. With the
support of these efforts, Black Americans are starting new businesses,
creating jobs, buying homes, and taking advantage of increased education
opportunities at historic rates—contributing to a 60% increase in wealth
compared to before the pandemic. And this boom in wealth creation
following the pandemic is helping to drive a [historically equitable
economic
recovery](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1834). From
promoting entrepreneurship to increasing access to homeownership and
delivering the lowest Black unemployment rate, from proving it’s
possible to reduce child poverty to historic lows to expanding access to
quality affordable healthcare, from advancing voting rights and police
accountability to ensuring equal access to a high-quality education with
historic funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs), President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to
investing in the future of Black communities.  
   
**Growing Economic Opportunity for Black Families and Communities**  
Through the President’s legislative victories, including the American
Rescue Plan (ARP), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), the CHIPS
and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—as well as the
President’s historic executive orders on racial equity—the Biden-Harris
Administration is ensuring that federal investments through the
President’s landmark [Investing in
America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
agenda are equitably flowing to communities to address longstanding
economic inequities that impact people’s economic security, health, and
safety. And this vision is already delivering results. The Biden-Harris
Administration has:

-   Powered a historic economic recovery that created 2.6 million jobs
    for Black workers—and achieved both the lowest Black unemployment
    rate on record and the lowest gap between Black and White
    unemployment on record.
-   Helped Black working families build wealth. Black wealth is up by
    60% relative to pre-pandemic—the largest increase on record.
-   Cut in half the number of Black children living in poverty in 2021
    through ARP’s Child Tax Credit expansion. This expansion provided
    breathing room to the families of over 9 million Black children.
-   Began reversing decades of infrastructure disinvestment, including
    with $4 billion to reconnect communities that were previously cut
    off from economic opportunities by building needed transportation
    infrastructure in underserved communities, including Black
    communities.
-   Connected an estimated 5.5 million Black households to affordable
    high-speed internet through the Affordable Connectivity Program,
    closing the digital divide for millions of Black families.

**Helping Black-Owned Businesses Grow and Thrive**  
Since the President entered office, a record 16 million new business
applications have been filed, and the share of Black households owning a
business has more than doubled. Building on this momentum, the
Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   Achieved the fastest creation rate of Black-owned businesses in more
    than 30 years—and more than doubled the share of Black business
    owners from 2019 to 2022.
-   Improved the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) flagship loan
    guarantee programs to expand the availability of capital to
    underserved communities. Since 2020, the number and dollar value of
    SBA-backed loans to Black-owned businesses have more than doubled.
-   Launched a whole-of-government effort to expand access to federal
    contracts for small businesses, awarding a record $69.9 billion to
    small disadvantaged businesses in 2022.
-   Through Treasury’s State Small Business Credit Initiative, invested
    $10 billion to expand access to capital and invest in early-stage
    businesses in all 50 states—including $2.5 billion in funding and
    incentive allocations dedicated to support the provision of capital
    to underserved businesses with $1 billion of these funds to be
    awarded to the jurisdictions that are most successful in reaching
    underserved businesses.
-   Helped more than 37,000 farmers and ranchers who were in financial
    distress, including Black farmers and ranchers, stay on their farms
    and keep farming, thanks to resources provided through IRA. The IRA
    allocated $3.1 billion for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to
    provide relief for distressed borrowers with at-risk agricultural
    operations with outstanding direct or guaranteed Farm Service Agency
    loans. USDA has provided over $2 billion and counting in timely
    assistance.
-   Supported small and disadvantaged businesses through CHIPS Act
    funding by requiring funding applicants to develop a workforce plan
    to create equitable pathways for economically disadvantaged
    individuals in their region, as well as a plan to support
    procurement from small, minority-owned, veteran-owned, and
    women-owned businesses.
-   Created the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that will
    invest in clean energy projects in low-income and disadvantaged
    communities.

**Increasing Access to Housing and Rooting Out Discrimination in the
Housing Market for Black Communities**  
To increase access to housing and root out discrimination in the housing
market, including for Black families and communities, the Biden-Harris
Administration has:

-   Set up the first-ever national infrastructure to stop evictions,
    scaling up the ARP-funded Emergency Rental Assistance program in
    over 400 communities across the country, helping 8 million renters
    and their families stay in their homes. Over 40% of all renters
    helped are Black—and this support prevented millions of evictions,
    with the largest effects seen in majority-Black neighborhoods.
-   Published a proposed “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing” rule
    through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which
    will help overcome patterns of segregation and hold states,
    localities, and public housing agencies that receive federal funds
    accountable for ensuring that underserved communities have equitable
    access to affordable housing opportunities.
-   Created the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and
    Valuation Equity, or PAVE, a first-of-its-kind interagency effort to
    root out bias in the home appraisal process, which is taking
    sweeping action to advance equity and remove racial and ethnic bias
    in home valuations, including cracking down on algorithmic bias and
    empowering consumers to take action against misvaluation.
-   Taken additional steps through HUD to support wealth-generation
    activities for prospective and current homeowners by expanding
    access to credit by incorporating a borrower’s positive rental
    payment history into the mortgage underwriting process. HUD
    estimates this policy change will enable an additional 5,000
    borrowers per year to qualify for an FHA-insured loan.

**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity for Black Students**  
To expand educational opportunity for the Black community in early
childhood and beyond, the Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   Approved more than $136 billion in student loan debt cancellation
    for 3.7 million Americans through various actions and launched a new
    student loan repayment plan—the Saving on a Valuable Education
    (SAVE) plan—to help many students and families cut in half their
    total lifetime payments per dollar borrowed.
-   Championed the largest increase to Pell Grants in the last decade—a
    combined increase of $900 to the maximum award over the past two
    years, affecting the over 60% of Black undergraduates who rely on
    Pell grants.
-   Fixed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, so all
    qualified borrowers get the debt relief to which they are entitled.
    More than 790,000 public servants have received more than $56
    billion in loan forgiveness since October 2021. Prior to these
    fixes, only 7,000 people had ever received forgiveness through PSLF.
-   Delivered a historic investment of over $7 billion to support HBCUs.
-   Reestablished the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational
    Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Historically Black
    Colleges and Universities and the White House Initiative on
    Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity
    for Black Americans.
-   Through ARP, secured $130 billion—the largest investment in public
    education in history—to help students get back to school, recover
    academically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and address
    student mental health.
-   Secured a 30% increase in child care assistance funding last year.
    Black families comprise 38% of families benefiting from federal
    child care assistance. Additionally, the President secured an
    additional $1 billion for Head Start, a program where more than 28%
    of children and pregnant women who benefit identify as Black.

**Improving Health Outcomes for Black Families and Communities**  
To improve health outcomes for the Black community, the Biden-Harris
Administration has:

-   Increased Black enrollment in health care coverage through the
    Affordable Care Act by 49%—or by around 400,000—from 2020 to 2022,
    helping more Black families gain health insurance than ever before.
-   Through IRA, locked in lower monthly premiums for health insurance,
    capped the cost of insulin at $35 per covered insulin product for
    Medicare beneficiaries, and helped further close the gap in access
    to medication by improving prescription drug coverage and lowering
    drug costs in Medicare. 
-   Through ARP, expanded postpartum coverage from 60 days to 12 months
    in 43 states and Washington, D.C., covering 700,000 more women in
    the year after childbirth. Medicaid covers approximately 65% of
    births for Black mothers, and this investment is a critical step to
    address maternal health disparities.
-   Financed projects that will replace hundreds of thousands of lead
    pipes, helping protect against lead poisoning that
    disproportionately affects Black communities.
-   Provided 264 grants with $1 billion in Bipartisan Safer Communities
    Act funds to more than 40 states to increase the supply of
    school-based mental health professionals in communities with high
    rates of poverty.

**Launched An Unprecedented Whole-Of-Government Equity Agenda to Ensure
the Promise of America for All Communities, including Black
Communities**  
President Biden believes that advancing equity, civil rights, racial
justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our
government, which will require sustained leadership and partnership with
all communities. To make the promise of America real for every American,
including for the Black Community, the President has:

-   Signed two Executive Orders directing the Federal Government to
    advance an ambitious whole-of-government equity agenda that matches
    the scale of the challenges we face as a country and the
    opportunities we have to build a more perfect union.
-   Nominated the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court and
    more Black women to federal circuit courts than every President
    combined.
-   Countered hateful attempts to rewrite history including: the signing
    of the Emmett Till Antilynching Act; establishing Juneteenth as a
    national holiday; and designating the Emmett Till and Mamie
    Till-Mobley National Monument in Mississippi and Illinois. The
    Department of the Interior has invested more than $295 million in
    infrastructure funding and historic preservation grants to protect
    and restore places significant to Black history.
-   Created the Justice40 Initiative, which is delivering 40% of the
    overall benefits of certain Federal investments in clean energy,
    affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other programs
    to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by
    underinvestment and overburdened by pollution as part of the most
    ambitious climate, conservation, and environmental justice agenda in
    history.

**Protecting the Sacred Right to Vote for Black Families and
Communities**  
Since their first days in office, President Biden and Vice President
Harris have prioritized strengthening our democracy and protecting the
sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections. To do so, the
President has:

-   Signed an Executive Order to leverage the resources of the Federal
    Government to provide nonpartisan information about the election
    process and increase access to voter registration. Agencies across
    the Federal Government are taking action to respond to the
    President’s call for an all-of-government effort to enhance the
    ability of all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy.
-   Repeatedly and forcefully called on Congress to pass essential
    legislation, including the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement
    Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, including calling for an exception
    to the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation.
-   Increased funding for the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights
    Division, which has more than doubled the number of voting rights
    enforcement attorneys. The Justice Department also created the
    Election Threats Task Force to assess allegations and reports of
    threats against election workers, and investigate and prosecute
    these matters where appropriate.
-   Signed into law the bipartisan Electoral Reform Count Act, which
    establishes clear guidelines for our system of certifying and
    counting electoral votes for President and Vice President, to
    preserve the will of the people and to protect against the type of
    attempts to overturn our elections that led to the January 6
    insurrection.

**Addressing the Crisis of Gun Violence in Black Communities**  
Gun violence has become the leading cause of death for all youth and
Black men in America, as well as the second leading cause of death for
Black women. To address this national crisis, the President has:

-   Launched the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
    Prevention, and taken more executive action on gun violence than any
    President in history, including investments in violence reduction
    strategies that address the root causes of gun violence and address
    emerging threats like ghost guns. In 2022, the Administration’s
    investments in evidence-based, lifesaving programs combined with
    aggressive action to stop the flow of illegal guns and hold shooters
    accountable yielded a 12.4% reduction in homicides across the United
    States.
-   Signed into the law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most
    significant gun violence reduction legislation enacted in nearly 30
    years, including investments in violence reduction strategies and
    historic policy changes to enhance background checks for individuals
    under age 21, narrow the dating partner loophole in the gun
    background check system, and provide law enforcement with tools to
    crack down on gun trafficking.
-   Secured the first-ever dedicated federal funding stream for
    community violence intervention programs, which have been shown to
    reduce violence by as much as 60%. These programs are effective
    because they leverage trusted messengers who work directly with
    individuals most likely to commit gun violence, intervene in
    conflicts, and connect people to social, health and wellness, and
    economic services to reduce the likelihood of violence as an answer
    to conflict.

**Enhancing Public Trust and Strengthening Public Safety for Black
Communities**  
Our criminal justice system must protect the public and ensure fair and
impartial justice for all. These are mutually reinforcing goals. To
enhance equal justice and public safety for all communities, including
the Black community, the President has:

-   Signed a historic Executive Order to put federal policing on the
    path to becoming the gold standard of effectiveness and
    accountability by requiring federal law enforcement agencies to ban
    chokeholds; restrict no-knock warrants; mandate the use of body-worn
    cameras; implement stronger use-of-force policies; provide
    de-escalation training; submit use-of-force data; submit officer
    misconduct records into a new national accountability database; and
    restrict the sale or transfer of military equipment to local law
    enforcement agencies, among other things. 
-   Taken steps to right the wrongs stemming from our Nation’s failed
    approach to marijuana by directing the Departments of Health and
    Human Services and Justice to expeditiously review how marijuana is
    scheduled under federal law and in October 2022 issued categorical
    pardons of prior federal and D.C. offenses of simple possession of
    marijuana and in December 2023 pardoned additional offenses of
    simple possession and use of marijuana under federal and D.C. law.
    While white, Black, and brown people use marijuana at similar rates,
    Black and brown people have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted
    at disproportionately higher rates.
-   Announced over 100 concrete policy actions as part of a White House
    evidence-informed, multi-year Alternatives, Rehabilitation, and
    Reentry Strategic Plan to safely reduce unnecessary criminal justice
    system interactions so police officers can focus on fighting crime;
    supporting rehabilitation during incarceration; and facilitating
    successful reentry.
