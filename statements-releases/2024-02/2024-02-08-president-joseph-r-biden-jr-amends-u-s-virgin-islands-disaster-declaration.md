---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. made additional disaster
assistance available to the territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands by
authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for Public
Assistance projects undertaken in the U.S. Virgin Islands as a result of
hurricanes Irma and Maria.  
   
Today, President Biden increased the Federal share to 95 percent for all
Public Assistance categories, retroactive to include all projects
currently funded at less than 100 percent; and increased the Federal
share to 98 percent until September 30, 2024 for all projects utilizing
Section 428 procedures.  The additional 3 percent Federal share apply
only to projects for which a Fixed Cost Offer has been accepted by
September 30, 2024, subject to extension on a per-project basis by the
FEMA Administrator for specific and unavoidable extenuating
circumstances.  Section 428 projects not completed by December 31, 2035,
revert to a 95 percent Federal cost share.
