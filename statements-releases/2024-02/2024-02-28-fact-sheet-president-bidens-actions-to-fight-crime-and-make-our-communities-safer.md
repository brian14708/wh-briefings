title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Actions to Fight Crime and Make Our Communities\_\
  Safer"
---
 
*During the previous Administration, America saw the largest increase in
murders ever recorded in 2020; Under the Biden-Harris Administration,
there has been a significant decrease in crime – including one of the
largest yearly declines in homicides ever.*

The historic declines in crime mean that America is safer. The
Biden-Harris Administration has taken a three-part approach to public
safety and fighting crime: funding effective, accountable policing;
investing in intervention and prevention strategies; and keeping
especially dangerous guns off our streets and out of dangerous hands.  
  
That balanced approach is the hallmark of the President’s Safer America
Plan, which calls on Congress to invest $37 billion to support law
enforcement and crime prevention, including by funding 100,000
additional police officers for accountable community policing,
consistent with the standards set out in the President’s executive order
on policing; community violence intervention and crisis responders; and
commonsense gun reforms such as background checks.  
  
And states and localities have adopted this balanced approach through
one of the largest investments ever in public safety:  The President’s
American Rescue Plan – which every Republican elected official in
Congress voted against – has helped states and over one thousand cities,
towns, and counties across the country to invest over $15 billion to
public safety and violence prevention. Communities have invested those
funds to support additional police officers, expand community violence
intervention, add crisis responders, and more.  And today we are seeing
real results:  Cities around the country are experiencing historic
declines in violent crime, and homicides are estimated to be down
nationally 12% from 2022 to 2023.    
  
By comparison, during the final year of the Trump Administration in
2020, the United States saw the largest increase in murders ever
recorded.  
  
Communities have leveraged funding from President Biden’s American
Rescue Plan to reduce crime:

-   Detroit invested more than $100 million for public safety, including
    to pay bonuses that enabled the city to hire 200 new police
    officers, advance community violence intervention, and expand teams
    of police and mental health professionals who can respond to people
    in crisis. In 2023, Detroit had its fewest homicides since 1966,
    with an 18% decline from 2022.
-   Milwaukee invested over $40 million to pay new officers engaging in
    community policing, fund gun crime investigations, and increase the
    number of dispatchers to handle 911 calls. The city improved city
    street lighting, supported community violence intervention efforts,
    and expanded summer programs for at-risk youth.  The city and county
    of Milwaukee also partnered with the state of Wisconsin to invest
    $28 million more on anti-violence efforts, including to reduce
    dramatically the court backlog of violent crime cases. In 2023,
    homicides in Milwaukee dropped 20%. 
-   Philadelphia invested millions in group-violence intervention and
    community crisis intervention programs. It also partnered with the
    state of Pennsylvania to devote $45 million more to upgrade the
    city’s crime lab, reduce gun violence, and investigate and prosecute
    violent gun crimes, as well as further support violence intervention
    and prevention. In 2023, Philadelphia experienced record crime
    declines, including a 20% drop in homicides and a 28% decline in
    nonfatal shootings.
-   Chicago invested $100 million for public safety, including $16
    million for community violence intervention focused on those at the
    highest risk of violence, $15 million to support alternative
    responders for 911 calls involving health crises, $30 million for
    youth intervention and diversion programs, and $10 million to
    support victims of crime. In addition to these targeted investments
    to reduce violence, Chicago is making additional significant
    investments to expand opportunity for young people – including
    hiring nearly 25,000 young people over the summer and investing $53
    million for youth employment programs. Chicago also received $6.25
    million in grants from the Department of Justice to hire or retain
    50 additional officers. Chicago saw a 13% drop in homicides in 2023,
    and nonfatal shootings declined 17%.

**The President’s Safer America Agenda:**  
*Funding Effective, Accountable Policing*

-   In 2023, the Department of Justice alone provided state, local,
    Tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies, research
    institutions, and nonprofit organizations nearly $5.8 billion to
    advance public safety, $1 billion more than just two years earlier.
    Those grants included more than $200 million to fund 1,730 new
    police officers in nearly 400 communities.  The Department of
    Justice’s 2023 grant funding also included more than $173 million in
    site-based funding to improve school safety.      
-   The President signed and is continuing to implement a historic
    Executive Order to advance police reform which required that federal
    law enforcement agencies ban chokeholds, strengthen use-of-force
    policies, restrict no-knock warrants, and direct other measures to
    advance effective, accountable policing that increases public
    safety.

*Investing in Violent Crime Prevention and Intervention*  
  
President Biden has secured historic investments in crime prevention and
intervention strategies, including strategies to prevent crime. For
example:

-   President Biden secured the first-ever federal funding solely
    dedicated to community violence interventions, and has increased
    funding for violence intervention programs.
-   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act includes the biggest ever
    one-time investment in mental health through the Department of
    Education, to help students deal with a range of mental health
    issues, including the trauma resulting from gun violence. To date,
    nearly $300 million has been distributed and will help to hire or
    train 14,000 mental health professionals for our schools.
-   Thanks to the President’s leadership and through the historic
    resources in the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Safer
    Communities Act, HHS has increased funding for mobile crisis teams
    and training for first responders and law enforcement to respond
    appropriately and safely to people with mental health challenges.
    DOJ has funded the creation and delivery of de-escalation training.
-   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act secured $750 million to support
    crisis interventions.

*Keeping Dangerous Guns Out of Our Communities and Guns Out of Dangerous
Hands*  
  
President Biden and his Administration have taken more executive action
to reduce gun crime than any other President. For example:

-   After hearing from law enforcement that they were increasingly
    finding “ghost guns” at crime scenes, the Bureau of Alcohol,
    Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives issued a [final
    rule](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-new-rule-modernize-firearm-definitions) to
    rein in the proliferation of these unserialized firearms.
-   The Justice Department launched five [new law enforcement strike
    forces](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-launches-firearms-trafficking-strike-forces-address-violent-crime-crack) focused
    on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that have
    diverted guns to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and
    Washington, D.C. 

In addition, President Biden secured confirmation of Steve Dettelbach to
be Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
(ATF) – after this critical law enforcement agency lacked confirmed
leadership since 2015. Under Director Dettelbach’s leadership, ATF is
driving data-driven prioritization to focus on the gun dealers most
closely connected to gun violence and have revoked the licenses of those
that have endangered public safety by willfully violating the law ATF is
also partnering with state and local officials to establish joint Crime
Gun Intelligence Centers to bring gun trafficking and violent crime
prosecutions.  
  
In 2022, the President signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the
most significant gun violence prevention legislation in nearly 30 years.
That law includes:

-   The first ever federal gun trafficking and straw purchasing law,
    which has allowed the Department of Justice to charge more than 300
    defendants.
-   Broadening the definition of who must become a licensed dealer and
    run background checks before selling guns.
-   Enhanced background checks for gun purchasers under the age of 21,
    which has already helped stop the transfer of firearms to prohibited
    persons under 21 more than 600 times.

In 2023, the President established the first-ever White House Office of
Gun Violence Prevention to accelerate his work to reduce gun crime and
other forms of gun violence.  
  
**Congress Needs to Act**. The President also continues to urge Congress
to take commonsense actions to prevent and combat crime and advance
public safety. Congress should enact universal background checks,
require safe storage of firearms, and ban assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines. It should pass the George Floyd Justice in
Policing Act to advance accountability, transparency, and public trust
in law enforcement. Building public trust advances public safety. And it
should pass the Violent Incident Clearance and Technological
Investigations Methods (VICTIM) Act to help communities solve murders
and violent gun crimes as well as support victims.  
  
Despite the progress we have made, we can and must do more to reduce
crime and save lives. President Biden will continue to call on
Republican elected officials in Congress to support these lifesaving law
enforcement actions rather than standing in the way
