title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting on Child Care to Mark Black History\_Month"
---
 
Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, Director of the Gender
Policy Council Jennifer Klein, and Director of the Office of Public
Engagement Stephen Benjamin were joined by Secretary of Health and Human
Services Xavier Becerra, Representative Ayanna Pressley, and national
leaders to celebrate the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to
support Black children, families, and early educators during Black
History Month.

Many Black families face significant challenges in affording child
care—a typical, median-income Black family with two young children would
have to spend 56 percent of their income on child care, a larger share
than any other group. Furthermore, child care workers in low-paying jobs
with few benefits are disproportionately Black. In the meeting,
Directors Tanden and Klein reaffirmed President Biden’s commitment to
accessible, affordable, high-quality child care and reiterated the
Administration’s strong support for Congressional efforts to secure
additional child care investments for hardworking families. Participants
discussed the need for Congress to provide additional funding in the
near-term, while underscoring the importance of working towards a
long-term solution that ensures all families can access affordable,
high-quality early care and education.

President Biden and Vice President Harris have prioritized tackling the
structural issues negatively impacting the child care sector, including
low wages for workers, high costs for families, and inadequate supply of
high-quality care. The Administration [has proposed transformational
investments](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2024-budget-in-brief.pdf) that
would expand access to high-quality child care and preschool. And as
American Rescue Plan funds dwindle, the President has also [requested
supplemental
funding](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/11/02/state-breakdown-the-biden-harris-administrations-funding-request-would-help-prevent-families-across-the-country-from-losing-child-care/) to
sustain the child care sector and ensure support for more than 220,0000
child care providers serving more than 10 million kids. The President
also signed an [historic Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-most-sweeping-set-of-executive-actions-to-improve-care-in-history/) in
April 2023 directing nearly every cabinet-level agency to expand access
to affordable, high-quality care and provide increased support for care
workers and family caregivers. That EO has led to actions: including a
proposal to [raise annual wages for Head Start
teachers](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2023/biden-harris-administration-proposes-new-rule-strengthen-head-start-workforce) by
more than $10,000 on average and [lowering child care costs for service
members](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3662171/dod-reduces-on-base-child-care-fees-for-military-families/) who
receive care on military bases. Additionally, the White House hosted
a [White House States Convening on Child
Care](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/19/readout-of-the-white-house-states-convening-on-child-care/),
gathering nearly 100 state legislators to discuss ways to improve child
care governance, access, affordability, and the workforce.

Also today, Vice President
Harris [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/29/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-action-to-lower-child-care-costs-for-more-than-100000-families/) that
the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule
strengthening the Child Care & Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program,
lowering the cost of child care for working families and better
supporting early educators.
