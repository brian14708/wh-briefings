President Biden met with Yulia and Dasha Navalnaya today in San
Francisco to express his heartfelt condolences for their terrible loss
following the death of Aleksey Navalny in a Russian prison.  The
President expressed his admiration for Aleksey Navalny’s extraordinary
courage and his legacy of fighting against corruption and for a free and
democratic Russia in which the rule of law applies equally to everyone.
The President emphasized that Aleksey’s legacy will carry on through
people across Russia and around the world mourning his loss and fighting
for freedom, democracy, and human rights. He affirmed that his
Administration will announce major new sanctions against Russia tomorrow
in response to Aleksey’s death, Russia’s repression and aggression, and
its brutal and illegal war in Ukraine.
