Francisco to express his heartfelt condolences for their terrible loss

courage and his legacy of fighting against corruption and for a free and
democratic Russia in which the rule of law applies equally to everyone.
The President emphasized that Aleksey’s legacy will carry on through
people across Russia and around the world mourning his loss and fighting
for freedom, democracy, and human rights. He affirmed that his
Administration will announce major new sanctions against Russia tomorrow

its brutal and illegal war in Ukraine.
