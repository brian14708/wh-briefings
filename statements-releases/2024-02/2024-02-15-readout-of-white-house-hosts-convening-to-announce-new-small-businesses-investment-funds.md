  Funds"

*New milestones announced represent the Biden-Harris Administration’s
commitment to expanding SBIC program investments to high tech small
start-ups and advanced manufacturing small businesses*

Yesterday, the White House National Economic Council (NEC) and the Small
Business Administration (SBA) hosted a convening with business leaders
from around the country to celebrate recent Biden-Harris Administration
reforms to the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program that
expand the spectrum and diversity of private sector capital supporting
small businesses and innovative startups. As a part of the President’s
Bidenomics agenda to grow the economy from the middle out and bottom up,
SBA announced the first SBIC licensee under the new reforms, and the
first applicant to be greenlit to raise private capital under a new
SBA-Department of Defense partnership focused on investing in small
businesses supporting critical technology and manufacturing priorities
vital to U.S. national security.

Federal officials, small business owners, investment professionals, and
industry association leaders participated in a roundtable discussion
about how the reforms will help amplify private sector investment in
capital constrained and underserved markets. Under President Biden’s
small business boom, Americans have filed a record 16 million new
business applications, a sign of the hope and confidence in the economy
from entrepreneurs and small business owners.

SBIC funds across the country manage [over $42 billion in SBA-backed and
private
capital](https://www.sba.gov/blog/2024/2024-02/white-house-sba-announce-landmark-investments-vital-small-businesses-start-ups-through-sbic-program),
providing equity investment and long-term loans to small businesses in a
wide range of industries. In just the last year alone, SBICs have
created or sustained more than 130,000 jobs, building on major
investments the Biden-Harris Administration has made to support small
businesses, spur record job growth and create high quality jobs in
critical industries of the future. Financing to women-owned,
minority-owned, and veteran-owned small businesses from the SBIC program
totaled nearly $670 million, over a 25% increase from the year prior.
SBA’s SBIC Diversification and Growth reforms that went into effect last
August improve the ability for SBIC funds to bridge key funding gaps and
provide patient capital to historically underserved small businesses.

At the convening, SBA made two landmark announcements about licensing
milestones made possible through these reforms. First, SBA announced
that a fund managed by Pelion Ventures was the first fund licensed as an
Accrual SBIC under SBA’s new SBIC Diversification and Growth rule. SBA
will commit up to $125 million to the Accrual SBIC fund as a match to
private limited partner capital raised by this Salt Lake City based
early-stage technology venture capital firm to support early-stage
companies in industries such as software infrastructure, information
services, developer tools, consumer technology, and e-commerce. Second,
SBA announced Stifel North Atlantic received the first approval to raise
private capital for the Additive Manufacturing (AM Forward) fund, as a
part of the SBA-DOD SBIC Critical Technologies (SBICCT) initiative, a
new partnership between SBA and DOD that will invest in manufacturing
and service businesses that support the supply chains of leading
defense, aerospace, and energy manufacturers. In seeking an SBIC license
for this fund, Stifel North Atlantic aims to promote the advancement of
numerous additive manufacturing production capabilities including
workforce training, part design, machining and inspection, and part
qualification, with the objective of increasing advanced manufacturing
capabilities in the domestic supply chain. These milestones represent a
spectrum of investment strategies, stages, industries, and geographic
focus and reflect the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to
serving all small businesses.

During the discussion, small business owners reflected on how critical
SBIC funds have been to their ability to scale up and grow, including
one small business owner who credited SBIC support with helping increase
revenue ten-fold. Fund managers discussed how these reforms to the SBIC
program address persistent gaps in capital-intensive and frontier
technologies, as well as how the recent reforms provide new tools that
improve their ability to invest in a more diverse ecosystem. Other
business leaders stressed the importance of public-private partnerships
in catalyzing small business development, especially in regions that
have historically lacked access to private capital.
