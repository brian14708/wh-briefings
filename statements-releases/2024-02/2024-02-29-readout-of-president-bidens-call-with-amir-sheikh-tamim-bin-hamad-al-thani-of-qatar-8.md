President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin
Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar.  The two leaders discussed efforts to secure
the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas.  They agreed that Hamas
should release the hostages it is holding without delay.  The leaders
underscored that the release of hostages would result in an immediate
and sustained ceasefire in Gaza over a period of at least six weeks. 
They exchanged views on how such a prolonged period of calm could then
be built into something more enduring.  They also discussed planning to
surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza and how the ceasefire under the
hostage deal would further help enable those efforts and ensure that
assistance reached civilians in need throughout Gaza.  They also
discussed the tragic and alarming incident earlier today in northern
Gaza.  Both leaders grieved the loss of civilian lives and agreed that
this incident underscored the urgency of bringing negotiations to a
close as soon as possible and expanding the flow of humanitarian
assistance into Gaza.  The two leaders and their teams agreed to stay in
regular contact over the coming days.
