title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with President Zelenskyy of\_Ukraine"
---
 
President Biden called President Zelenskyy today to underscore the
United States’ commitment to continue supporting Ukraine ahead of the
two year anniversary of Russia’s brutal invasion. This morning,
Ukraine’s military was forced to withdraw from Avdiivka after Ukrainian
soldiers had to ration ammunition due to dwindling supplies as a result
of congressional inaction, resulting in Russia’s first notable gains in
months. President Biden emphasized the need for Congress to
urgently pass the national security supplemental funding bill to
resupply Ukrainian forces. President Biden reaffirmed the strong
bipartisan support in the U.S. government and among the American
people for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to
imposing costs on the Russian government to hold it accountable for its
actions.
