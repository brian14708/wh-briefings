title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Latest House Republican\_\
  Bill"
---
 
For months the administration has been working with a bipartisan group
of Senators on a national security agreement that secures our border and
provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel. Just as
legislative text is imminent, the House Republicans come up with their
latest cynical political maneuver. The security of Israel should be
sacred, not a political game. We strongly oppose this ploy which does
nothing to secure the border, does nothing to help the people of Ukraine
defend themselves against Putin’s aggression, and denies humanitarian
assistance to Palestinian civilians, the majority of them women and
children, which the Israelis supported by opening the access route.
House Republicans should instead work in a bipartisan way, like the
administration and Senate are doing, on these pressing national security
issues.
