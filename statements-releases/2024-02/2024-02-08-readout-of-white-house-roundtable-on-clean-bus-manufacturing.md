title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable on Clean Bus Manufacturing"
---
 
On Wednesday, February 7<sup>th</sup>, the White House and the Federal
Transit Administration (FTA), in coordination with the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA), convened a roundtable discussion
focused on ensuring adequate U.S. manufacturing capacity to build clean
transit buses at the scale and pace needed to meet market demand and
achieve national climate and equity goals.  
  
The roundtable included approximately 60 representatives from U.S.
transit agencies, bus manufacturers, component suppliers, labor unions,
federal agencies, and other stakeholders.  
  
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is delivering historic
funding to advance clean transit, which is crucial in reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in the largest emitting sector, transportation.
This historic funding also helps ensure that all communities are able to
access good-paying jobs, schools, and health care. The President’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests more than $11 billion over five
years to support purchasing cleaner, American-made transit buses,
training the transit workforce, and upgrading fueling and maintenance
infrastructure. **<u>To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has funded
over 2,900 low- and zero- emission transit buses – enough to more than
double the number of zero-emission transit buses on our roadways.  
</u>**  
Today, to further build on these goals, FTA released [its FY24 Bus
Grants Notice of Funding Opportunity
(NOFO)](https://www.transit.dot.gov/about/news/biden-harris-administration-announces-availability-15-billion-federal-funding-modernize),
**<u>which makes available more than $1.5 billion in funding through
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</u>**. These funds are
part of FTA’s “Bus and Bus Facilities” and “Low and No Emission Bus”
competitive grant programs., which include substantial support for
transit agencies to procure and deploy low- or no-emission,
American-made buses. During the roundtable, FTA Administrator Nuria
Fernandez emphasized changes in the NOFO to support these American
manufacturers of clean buses, while driving down costs.  
  
FTA also issued a “Dear Colleague” letter highlighting procurement
flexibility FTA grantees can take advantage of, allowing more support
for the U.S. clean bus industry, clarifying requirements governing
federal funding for transit buses, and announcing new steps FTA is
taking to help transit agencies transition to low- and zero-emission
buses.  
  
In parallel, APTA’s Bus Manufacturing Task Force
[released](https://www.apta.com/news-publications/press-releases/releases/apta-joins-white-house-roundtable-on-clean-buses-releases-recommendations-to-strengthen-u-s-bus-manufacturing/)
new recommendations to bolster competitiveness and stability in the U.S.
bus manufacturing sector to help meet market demand, climate goals, and
equity objectives for zero-emission buses.  
  
Following discussion of these recommendations at the roundtable held
yesterday, major transit agencies (listed below) committed to use their
respective authorities to implement the Task Force’s recommendations as
fully as possible, particularly focusing on the discretionary bus grants
announced Thursday. These agencies are collectively responsible for
almost 50% of bus trips taken in the United States.  
  
Transit agencies and U.S. bus manufacturers further committed to
collaborate, through APTA, on fast-tracking standardization
recommendations within 90 days. In parallel, the Biden-Harris
Administration will continue to work with stakeholders on priority
topics including testing, charging, cybersecurity, and support for the
clean transportation goals of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics.
