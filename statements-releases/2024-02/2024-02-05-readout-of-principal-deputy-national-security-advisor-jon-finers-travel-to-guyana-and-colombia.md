Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer travelled to Guyana
and Colombia on February 4-5 to continue U.S. cooperation with our
regional partners on issues of mutual interests, including democratic
governance, economic stability, and regional security.  He was
accompanied by National Security Council’s Senior Director for the
Western Hemisphere Juan González.

In Guyana, Mr. Finer met with President Irfaan Ali to reaffirm our
unwavering support for Guyana’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and
defense capabilities.  They discussed ways to strengthen our bilateral
cooperation on regional security, combatting climate change, and food
security matters.  The United States appreciates Guyana’s leadership in
the region, including its support for a Haitian political accord and for
the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission for the people of
Haiti. We look forward to advancing our shared priorities during
Guyana’s membership on the UN Security Council these next two years. 
Mr. Finer also met with Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretary-General
Dr. Carla Barnett to discuss ongoing planning for the MSS to Haiti and
the urgent need for robust international support for the mission, as
well as ways to promote democratic governance in Venezuela.

In Colombia, Mr. Finer met with President Gustavo Petro to continue
building on our strong decades-long partnership with Colombia across a
broad set of shared bilateral goals, including our support for the Peace
Accord implementation and deepening U.S.-Colombian economic ties.  They
also discussed our efforts to counter narcotics trafficking and manage
hemispheric migration, as well as our work with international partners
and actors in Venezuela to implement commitments made in the Barbados
Agreement and pave the way for competitive and inclusive elections.
