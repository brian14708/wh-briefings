title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on U.S. Military Operation in the Middle\_\
  East"

This past Sunday, three American soldiers were killed in Jordan by a
drone launched by militant groups backed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC).  Earlier today, I attended the dignified return of
these brave Americans at Dover Airforce Base, and I have spoken with
each of their families.  
   
This afternoon, at my direction, U.S. military forces struck targets at
facilities in Iraq and Syria that the IRGC and affiliated militia use to
attack U.S. forces.  
   
Our response began today.  It will continue at times and places of our
choosing.  
   
The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere
else in the world.  But let all those who might seek to do us harm know
this: If you harm an American, we will respond.
