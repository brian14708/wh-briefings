title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Successful Landing of the Odysseus\
  \ Lunar\_Craft"
---
 
On Thursday night, for the first time in over 50 years, an American
spacecraft landed on the Moon – a thrilling step forward in a new era of
space exploration.  
   
The robotic lunar lander, named Odysseus, launched from NASA’s Kennedy
Space Center on February 15. On Thursday, it sent images from the Moon
as it circled in low orbit, before touching down near the South Pole.  
   
This mission marks a milestone: the first Moon landing by an American
company. Odysseus is a public-private partnership between NASA and the
American company Intuitive Machines. It was made possible by American
ingenuity, innovation, and curiosity. And, through NASA’s Artemis
program, it’s the first of more public- and private-sector space
missions to come, bringing together our international and commercial
partners to return humans to the Moon for the first time in decades.
America is leading the world back to the Moon.  
   
In 1962, when America’s first Moon landing was still years away,
President Kennedy spoke to a group of students about why the United
States sets such bold missions for ourselves. “We choose to go to the
Moon in this decade and do the other things,” he said, “not because they
are easy but because they are hard.” And he continued, “That challenge
is one that we are willing to accept, one that we are unwilling to
postpone, and one that we intend to win.”  
   
What was true then is true now. America does hard things. We rise to the
great scientific challenges of our time. And there’s nothing beyond our
capacity when we work together.  
   
I congratulate the Intuitive Machines team who successfully landed
Odysseus, as well as their partners at NASA who are shaping the future
of human space exploration.
