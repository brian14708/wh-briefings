title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Addressing National Security Risks to the\
  \ U.S. Auto\_Industry"
---
 
American automakers and auto workers are the best in the world. The
iconic Big Three and American auto workers are leading the world in
quality and innovation. A dynamic auto industry is vital to the U.S.
economy.  
   
China is determined to dominate the future of the auto market, including
by using unfair practices.  China’s policies could flood our market with
its vehicles, posing risks to our national security. I’m not going to
let that happen on my watch.  
   
Most cars these days are “connected” – they are like smart phones on
wheels. These cars are connected to our phones, to navigation systems,
to critical infrastructure, and to the companies that made them.
Connected vehicles from China could collect sensitive data about our
citizens and our infrastructure and send this data back to the People’s
Republic of China. These vehicles could be remotely accessed or
disabled.  
   
China imposes restrictions on American autos and other foreign autos
operating in China. Why should connected vehicles from China be allowed
to operate in our country without safeguards?  
   
So today, I am announcing unprecedented actions to ensure that cars on
U.S. roads from countries of concern like China do not
undermine our national security. I have directed my Secretary of
Commerce to conduct an investigation into connected vehicles with
technology from countries of concern and to take action to respond to
the risks.   
   
As President I vowed to do right by auto workers and middle-class
families that depend on the auto industry for jobs. With this and other
actions, we’re going to make sure the future of the auto industry will
be made here in America with American workers.
