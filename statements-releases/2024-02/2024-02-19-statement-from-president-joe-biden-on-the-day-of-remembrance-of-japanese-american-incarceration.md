title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Day of Remembrance of Japanese\
  \ American Incarceration"
---
 
On this day in 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive
Order 9066, which led to the forcible incarceration of over 120,000
Americans of Japanese descent – half of whom were children. It was
shameful. Families were separated. Communities were torn apart. People
were stripped of their dignity. And the unconstitutional and
unconscionable policy was even upheld by the Supreme Court.   
   
In the face of injustice, 33,000 Japanese Americans stepped up and
courageously served in the U.S. military during World War II. They
demonstrated loyalty and patriotism. We honor those service men and
women, as well as the legacy of civil rights leaders like Fred
Korematsu, Minoru Yasui, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Mitsuye Endo, along
with every Japanese American who organized and worked to right a wrong.
Their sacrifice, their resilience and their belief that civil liberties
and freedom must be vigorously defended inspire us today.   
   
I decided to run for President to restore the Soul of America. To
confront racism, xenophobia, and hate in all its forms. To strengthen
and preserve our democracy. We remember the tragic legacy of Executive
Order 9066 – and the trauma it inflicted – by reaffirming the Federal
Government’s formal apology to Japanese Americans. And by stating
unequivocally: Nidoto Nai Yoni – to “Let It Not Happen Again.”
