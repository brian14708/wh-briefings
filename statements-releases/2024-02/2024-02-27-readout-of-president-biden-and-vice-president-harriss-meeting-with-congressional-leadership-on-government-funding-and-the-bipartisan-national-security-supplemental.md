title: "Readout of President\_Biden and Vice President Harris\u2019s Meeting with\
  \ Congressional Leadership on Government Funding and the Bipartisan National Security\_\
  Supplemental"
---
 
Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris met with Leader
Schumer, Leader McConnell, Speaker Johnson, and Leader Jeffries in the
Oval Office about the urgency of keeping the government open and passing
the bipartisan national security supplemental.

The President made clear that Congress must take swift action to fund
the government and prevent a shutdown. A shutdown is unacceptable and
would cause needless damage to hardworking families, our economy, and
our national security. He emphasized that the only path forward is
through bipartisan funding bills that deliver for the American people
and are free of any extreme policies.

The President also emphasized the urgent need for Congress to continue
standing with Ukraine as it defends itself every day against Russia’s
brutal invasion. He discussed how Ukraine has lost ground on the
battlefield in recent weeks and is being forced to ration ammunition and
supplies due to Congressional inaction. He underscored the importance of
the bipartisan national security supplemental, which passed the Senate
with overwhelming bipartisan support and would pass in the House if it
was brought to a vote. He made clear that in addition to arming Ukraine
and investing in America’s defense industrial base, the bill would help
Israel defend itself against Hamas, and provide more humanitarian aid
for those impacted by conflicts around the world, including Palestinian
civilians who are experiencing dire humanitarian conditions.
