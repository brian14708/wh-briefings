title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Hungarian Parliament\u2019\
  s Ratification of Sweden\u2019s NATO Accession\_Process"
---
 
The United States welcomes the Hungarian parliament’s overwhelming vote
today to approve Sweden’s application to join NATO, and we urge the
Hungarian government to complete the process so we can welcome Sweden
into our Alliance.  We look forward to Hungary signing and depositing
the instrument of ratification without delay.  Like Finland, which
recently joined our Alliance, Sweden is a strong democracy with a highly
capable military that shares our values and vision for the world.
 Having Sweden as a NATO Ally will make the United States and our Allies
even safer.  NATO is the most powerful defensive alliance in the history
of the world, and it is as critical today to ensuring the security of
our citizens as it was 75 years ago when our Alliance was founded out of
the wreckage of World War II.
