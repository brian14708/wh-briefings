title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable on Improving Job Opportunities for Communities\
  \ Affected by Gun\_Violence"
---
 
On Wednesday, February 28, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, the Office
of Gun Violence Prevention (OGVP) and the Department of Labor (DOL)
hosted a roundtable on improving job opportunities for communities
affected by gun violence and discuss the connection between workforce
development and violence intervention and prevention.  
  
During the roundtable, DOL discussed its Growth Opportunities Program,
which provides up to $85 million to improve job opportunities for youth
in communities affected by violence and poverty. This [recently
announced](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20240207) funding
opportunity supports programs that provide skills training through
work-based learning, employment services, educational support and
mentorship to youth and young adults in communities affected by
violence, crime and poverty.  
  
These funds provided by the Growth Opportunities Program build on
efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to prevent crime and promote
public safety, including the President’s American Rescue Plan, which
helped states and over one thousand cities, towns, and counties across
the country to invest over $15 billion in public safety and violence
prevention.  Communities have invested those funds to support additional
police officers, expand community violence intervention, add crisis
responders, and more. And in addition to key investments for schools to
expand mental health services and violence intervention programs, BSCA
provides $250 million in funding for community-based violence prevention
initiatives.   
  
We are already seeing the positive impacts of the President’s strategy
to prevent and reduce crime and gun violence nationwide. Cities around
the country are experiencing historic declines in violent crime, and
homicides are estimated to be down nationally 12% from 2022 to 2023. By
comparison, during the final year of the Trump Administration in 2020,
the United States saw the largest increase in murders ever recorded. We
have also seen key provisions created by the BCSA begin to deliver
results in making communities safer against gun violence, including
enhanced background check provisions that have enabled the Department of
Justice to [stop more than 600 illegal gun
purchases](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/05/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-stopping-over-500-illegal-under-21-gun-purchases-through-the-bipartisan-safer-communities-act/#:~:text=January%2005%2C%202024-,Statement%20from%20President%20Joe%20Biden%20on%20Stopping%20Over%20500%20Illegal,the%20Bipartisan%20Safer%20Communities%20Act&text=Today%20is%20an%20important%20milestone,fabric%20of%20our%20nation%20apart.) by
prohibited persons under 21 years old, and the first ever federal gun
trafficking and straw purchasing law.  
  
The President knows more can and must be done, which is why OGVP,
overseen by Vice President Kamala Harris, continues to identify
executive orders to save lives, while also announcing new initiatives to
encourage action at the state and local level. This past December, the
Vice President convened 100 state legislators at the White House to
launch [the Biden-Harris Administration’s Safer States
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OGVP-Safer-States-Policy-Agenda.pdf),
providing states with additional tools and the support they need to
reduce gun violence—and we have already seen states begin to [answer the
call and implement these critical
measures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/09/maryland-juvenile-justice-wes-moore/).
Last month, the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, in partnership with
the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice, also
announced [new executive actions to help promote safe storage of
firearms](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/25/white-house-announces-new-actions-to-promote-safe-storage-of-firearms/) that
implement President Biden’s Executive Order on promoting safe gun
storage, which has been shown to dramatically reduce children’s risk of
self-inflicted harm and unintentional shootings.  
  
These are just a few examples of the progress that is being made under
the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris to protect
our communities, schools and children, and end the epidemic of gun
violence that is leaving empty seats at dinner tables across the
country.   
  
The Second Gentleman also continues to show up for communities affected
by gun violence, meeting with victims and families in Parkland, Florida;
Uvalde, Texas; Highland Park, Illinois; and the Tree of Life Community
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This past December, the Second Gentleman
also [delivered
remarks](https://www.c-span.org/video/?532261-1/gentleman-doug-emhoff-remarks-newtown-action-alliance-foundation-vigil) at
the 11<sup>th</sup> Annual Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence.  
  
In addition to representatives from the White House and the Department
of Labor, the roundtable also included the following participants:

-   Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott
-   Kalef Jones, Member Success Manager, PowerCorpsPHL
-   Cindy Anderson, Program Manager, Employ Milwaukee Inc.
