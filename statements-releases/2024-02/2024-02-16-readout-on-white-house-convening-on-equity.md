This week, the Biden-Harris Administration hosted the 2024 White House
Convening on Equity. This convening brought together Cabinet members,
and nearly 100 stakeholders, including national civil rights
organizations, community organizers, advocates, and policy leaders.
Participants discussed the Administration’s whole-of-government equity
agenda and the ambitious actions underway to redress systemic barriers
to opportunity for underserved communities.

To commemorate the first anniversary of President Biden’s second equity
Executive Order, [on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
Underserved Communities Through the Federal
Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/),
the convening also marked the release of [23 Federal agencies’ updated
Equity Action Plans](http://www.whitehouse.gov/equity) and a [progress
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/White-House-Equity-Action-Plan-Progress-Report.pdf)
showcasing hundreds of equity accomplishments across the Administration.
Highlights include federal actions that leverage the Biden-Harris
Administration’s historic [Investing in America
agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/) to uplift small
disadvantaged businesses, reduce housing discrimination, advance
environmental justice, invest in disadvantaged communities, address
health disparities, promote rural development, bolster fairness in the
justice system and civil rights enforcement, support victims and
survivors of gender-based violence, and root out bias in emerging
technology.

Cabinet officials, leadership from the White House, the Office of
Management and Budget, and numerous agencies discussed their historic
efforts to address barriers to equity and deliver equal opportunity for
all Americans.
