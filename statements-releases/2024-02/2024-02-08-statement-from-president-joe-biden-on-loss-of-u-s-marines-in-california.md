title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Loss of U.S. Marines in\_California"
---
 
Jill and I are heartbroken at the loss of five U.S. Marines, whose
aircraft crashed while flying from Nevada to California during a routine
training mission. As the Department of Defense continues to assess what
occurred, we extend our deepest condolences to their families, their
squadron, and the U.S. Marine Corps as we grieve the loss of five of our
nation’s finest warriors. I am deeply grateful to the San Diego County
Sheriff’s Department, the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary-Civil Air Patrol, and
other federal, state, and local agencies for their professionalism and
dedication in supporting search and recovery efforts.  
   
Our service members represent the very best of our nation—and these five
Marines were no exception. Today, as we mourn this profound loss, we
honor their selfless service and ultimate sacrifice—and reaffirm the
sacred obligation we bear to all those who wear the uniform and their
families.
