*More Than $330 Million in Federal Grants and Disaster Loans Provided to
Support Response and Recovery Efforts*  
  
*FEMA Administrator Criswell, SBA Administrator Guzman to travel to Maui
to* *Meet with State and Local Officials and Discuss Ongoing Recovery
Efforts*

Six months after the start of the unprecedented wildfires on Maui,
Hawaiʻi, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to support survivors
and affected communities through a whole-of-government response and
recovery effort. Since the onset of this tragedy, the Administration has
provided more than $330 million in Federal grants and disaster loans to
support response and recovery efforts, while hundreds of personnel from
across dozens of Federal departments and agencies continue working with
State and local partners on the ground to support Maui as it continues
its long-term recovery. To mark the six-month anniversary, **FEMA
Administrator Criswell and SBA Administrator Guzman will travel to Maui
this week to meet with State and local officials** and discuss ongoing
recovery efforts.  
  
As President Biden made clear during his visit to Maui last August, the
Biden-Harris Administration will continue to do everything in its power
to help Maui recover and rebuild the way the people of Maui want, while
respecting sacred lands, cultures, and traditions, for as long as it
takes.

Here is an update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s coordinated
Federal response and recovery efforts:

-   More than **445** **Federal personnel remain on the ground in
    Hawaiʻi, 232 of whom are on Maui,** assisting residents in their
    greatest time of need. To ensure the effectiveness of Federal
    support, President Biden appointed Bob Fenton as his Chief Federal
    Response Coordinator. Fenton continues to lead the integrated
    response, recovery and rebuilding effort on Maui in coordination
    with State and local leadership.   
-   To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved more than
    **$43.7 million in assistance** to **7,013 households.**  
-   In the wake of the wildfires, President Biden made [additional
    disaster funding
    available](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=da9644fe5c&e=ebcdb14f7c)
    to the state of Hawaiʻi, unlocking the Federal government’s ability
    to cover all eligible expenses for debris removal and emergency
    protective measures on Maui County and assistance for emergency
    protective measures for Hawaiʻi County. The President authorized the
    Federal cost share for debris removal to be increased from 75% to
    100% for 180 days within the first 270 days of the incident.  The
    President also authorized the Federal cost share for emergency
    protective measures to be increased to 100% of the total eligible
    costs for a 90-day period that the Governor selects within the first
    180 days of the incident.   
-   Through its Direct Lease program, the **Federal Emergency Management
    Agency (FEMA)** is working to find and manage apartments,
    condominiums, and other suitable living quarters, which can be
    leased for survivors.  FEMA has secured **1,404 leased properties
    for survivors. Some 162 households have been placed in temporary
    homes.**  
-   Nearly 700 personnel from the **Department of Defense** and the U.S.
    Coast Guard have participated in the coordinated response to the
    Maui wildfires – from supporting aerial fire suppression and
    providing strategic air transportation, to assisting with potable
    water distribution and providing grief counseling and emotional
    support, to providing additional life-sustaining support.  
-   The **Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Honolulu Division**
    continues its months-long effort to assist the Maui Police
    Department with their efforts to locate and identify victims of the
    wildfires in Lahaina, Hawaii, by helping collect DNA samples from
    family members. The FBI, in coordination with the Maui Police
    Department, have reduced the number of unaccounted for missing
    persons to 3.  
     
-   The **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers** continues to provide public
    works and engineering support, which includes debris collection and
    removal; the construction of a temporary elementary school campus
    for the Lahaina community, which benefits approximately **600**
    elementary school students; and managing the conceptual design, site
    preparation, and construction for **approximately 400 – 600**
    temporary housing “pads” or places to put housing units on.    
-   The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** remains on the ground
    on Maui to help restore and maintain safe drinking water,
    stormwater, and wastewater services.  Arriving within days of the
    devastating wildfire, EPA personnel swiftly assessed the burn area;
    installed air monitors to protect the health of first responders;
    developed and executed first-in-the-nation protocols to safely
    dispose of electric vehicle and solar energy storage batteries
    damaged by the wildfires; protected air and water by stabilizing
    ash; and developed a precedent-setting approach to preserve cultural
    artifacts that honored the traditions of the native Hawaiians who
    have called Maui home for centuries. Throughout this initial phase,
    the agency had more than 300 responders working with Federal, state,
    local, and community cultural leaders to remove 200 tons of
    hazardous materials from over 1,400 properties. On November 30,
    2023, the agency completed its mission to safely clean up and remove
    hazardous materials and transitioned work to the U.S. Army Corps of
    Engineers for the next phase of the recovery process.  
-   The **U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)** has approved more
    than $290 million in Federal disaster loans for Hawaiʻi businesses
    and residents impacted by wildfires. The SBA continues to operate
    two Disaster Business Recovery Centers for survivors of the Maui
    wildfires and is part of the multi-agency presence at the Disaster
    Recovery Centers, assisting small businesses and most non-profits in
    all five counties. Information and details on the location of the
    business recovery center and disaster recovery centers are available
    by calling the SBA Customer Service Center at (800) 659-2955. These
    Centers provide services to survivors, including homeowners,
    renters, and small business owners seeking financial assistance.   
      
    SBA is continuing outreach to businesses throughout Hawaiʻi to take
    advantage of the Physical Damage and Economic Injury Disaster Loan
    program, and staff are working with survivors in every major
    community throughout Maui through local assistance centers and a
    Center staff outreach campaign. To be considered for all forms of
    disaster assistance, including low-interest disaster loans from SBA,
    survivors must first register with FEMA.    
-   The **U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)** is
    working with the Maui local housing agency to help rehouse public
    housing tenants in the wake of the fires. In addition, HUD is
    working to connect homeowners on Maui with resources from the
    Federal Housing Administration to support their relief in the wake
    of the disaster. HUD has also joined with the Hawaii Division of
    Financial Institutions, other Federal partners, and mortgage
    servicers to host a series of mortgage assistance events to connect
    homeowners on Maui with resources and other support. **HUD** Office
    of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is also available to assist
    survivors who believe they have experienced housing
    discrimination.  
      
    In August 2023, HUD announced a $1.3 million funding allocation to
    help communities on Maui in the wake of the wildfires through the
    department’s new Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) program,
    a rapid response program to address homelessness by filling in
    Federal assistance gaps in communities hit by disasters. RUSH
    funding is available to help communities provide outreach, emergency
    shelter, rapid re-housing, and other assistance to people
    experiencing or at risk of homelessness. HUD also provided a
    moratorium on foreclosures of Federal Housing Administration-insured
    mortgages and home equity conversion mortgages through May 6, 2024.
    Homeowners affected by the disaster should contact their mortgage or
    loan servicer immediately. They can also call the FHA Resource
    Center at 1-800-304-9320 for additional information and visit
    the [FHA Disaster
    Relief](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=ce9907e6fe&e=ebcdb14f7c) site
    to learn more about disaster relief options for FHA homeowners.   
      
    **Additionally, HUD** also has released [regulatory and
    administrative
    waivers](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=9a58a6f86b&e=ebcdb14f7c) to
    help communities accelerate their recovery. This includes funding
    for housing rehabilitation and reconstruction, homebuyer programs
    replacing disaster damaged residences, infrastructure improvements
    and assistance to people at risk of homelessness. HUD has assigned
    experienced Disaster Technical Assistance providers to support local
    leaders help communities and families that were experiencing
    homelessness before the devastating fires and those that may require
    homeless services because of the fires.   
-   The **Department of the Interior (DOI)** continues to work to
    protect natural and cultural resources on Maui in coordination with
    Federal and state partners. Immediately after the disastrous fires,
    DOI deployed a cultural advisor to ensure Federal personnel were
    properly trained to understand native Hawai’ian culture and build
    trust between the native Hawai’ian community and the Federal
    government. DOI personnel have continued to assist with assessment
    and recovery operations, including any impacts to wildlife habitats,
    like coral reefs, as well as monitoring the potential for
    debris-flow and ash sediment run-off. The Department remains in
    close contact with Native Hawaiian leaders and organizations to
    coordinate the availability of services, information, and culturally
    sensitive opportunities for engagement and healing.  
-   The **Department of Energy (DOE)** is working with State and local
    partners to implement a $95 million grant provided in August through
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to harden Hawaiʻi’s electric grid.
    This grant is in addition to a $6 million grid resilience formula
    grant announced in June, also funded by the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. In the immediate aftermath of the devastating
    wildfires, DOE deployed emergency responders to support the Federal
    response to the wildfires and continues to work closely with the
    Federal Emergency Management Agency, Hawaiʻi State Energy Office,
    and the Hawaiʻi Office of Emergency Management to support Federal
    long-term recovery efforts.  
-   The **U.S. Coast Guard** assessed and removed pollution, hazardous
    materials, and dozens of damaged and sunken vessels, and associated
    debris, from in and around Lahaina Harbor.  
-   The **Department of Commerce’s** Economic Development Administration
    (EDA) has been deployed to assist the Maui recovery since
    late-August 2023 and has been meeting with State, county, and local
    stakeholders to identify and develop potential economic recovery and
    resilience projects for future funding. EDA also participates in the
    State-supported Maui Economic Recovery Commission, launched in
    January, to work with State and local partners to provide guidance
    and recommendations for projects that will support local recovery
    and to develop economic opportunities to maximize Federal funding
    and community support.  
-   The **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR)**
    deployed responders from ASPR, including experts from their Disaster
    Mortuary Operations Response and Victim Identification Center teams
    to assist Maui County with processing and identification of remains
    as well as Disaster Behavioral Health specialists to help survivors
    cope with the traumatizing fires. ASPR also deployed a portable
    morgue unit to assist the Maui coroner and additional personnel to
    bolster mental health staff and resources available at Lahaina
    Comprehensive Health Center. In addition, ASPR activated the
    [Emergency Prescription Assistance
    Program](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=84e2a83a7d&e=ebcdb14f7c),
    a Federal program that assists people in a Federally-identified
    disaster area who do not have health insurance get the prescription
    drugs, vaccinations, medical supplies, and equipment that they
    need. Secretary Becerra also [issued a Public Health
    Emergency](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=a8502d95b3&e=ebcdb14f7c)
    shortly after the President’s disaster declaration, giving CMS
    health care providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting
    emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries on the
    ground. The Disaster Distress Helpline – 1-800-985-5990 – is
    available to provide immediate counseling to anyone affected by the
    wildfires.  
-   The **U.S. Department of Agriculture’s** Natural Resources
    Conservation Service will provide a total of $15.9 million in
    emergency funding through the Federal Emergency Watershed Protection
    (EWP) program to help mitigate widescale environmental damage. As
    local sponsors, the Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCD) of
    West Maui and Central Maui will manage the emergency response
    projects approved under the EWP agreement to stabilize the landscape
    and help protect communities and ecosystems located downslope of the
    burn zones in Upcountry Maui. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
    Forest Service deployed a Burned Area Emergency Response team in
    August to assess the impacts of the fire to watersheds, including
    the potential for runoff and erosion, and support state and local
    staff in assessing post-fire watershed conditions and post-fire
    slope stability issues. The Forest Service is also providing Hawaiʻi
    with $500,000 to support the management of invasive grasses on Maui
    using biological control and herbicide treatments.  
      
    Additionally, USDA’s Farm Service Agency Hawaii & Pacific Basin
    continues to offer financial and technical assistance through
    multiple disaster programs to support farmers and ranchers with
    recovery and restoration efforts. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service
    has taken [several
    actions](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/hawaii-disaster-nutrition-assistance),
    including an extension through February 29, 2024 of a waiver for
    Maui County residents to purchase hot foods with SNAP benefits,
    approval of a Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
    (D-SNAP) through September 2023, and a mass replacement of SNAP
    benefits in August 2023 for these residents who had lost food due to
    power outages.  
-   The **U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau** has created a
    [disaster and emergencies
    guide](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=611bb7813b&e=ebcdb14f7c)
    to handling finances, including resources to help impacted residents
    recover, such as tackling housing issues, protecting your finances,
    dealing with property damage, managing your bills, and asking for
    help from financial companies like banks, credit cards and other
    lenders. If residents are having trouble with a financial company,
    they can [submit a complaint
    online](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=ba3b95760d&e=ebcdb14f7c) or
    by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).  
-   The **U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)** made available $3
    million, the full amount of “quick release” Emergency Relief (ER)
    funds requested by the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation, to
    offset costs associated with traffic management services in the wake
    of the wildfires. Additionally, in the wake of the wildfires, DOT
    had issued three temporary flight restrictions to help facilitate
    search and rescue missions and worked with major U.S. airlines that
    serve Kahului Airport to promote [flexible
    travel](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=b3077b84f2&e=ebcdb14f7c)
    policies.  
-   The **Heritage Emergency National Task Force (HENTF)**, a
    partnership between FEMA and Smithsonian Institution, is working
    through the Hawaiʻi Emergency Management Agency to ensure that
    museums and cultural heritage sites are incorporated into FEMA
    preliminary damage assessments to anticipate needs associated with
    long-term recovery planning.
