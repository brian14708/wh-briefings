title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Over $5 Billion from\
  \ the CHIPS and Science Act for Research, Development, and\_Workforce"
---
 
*The Administration expects to invest billions in the National
Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), now established as a
public-private consortium, and other CHIPS Research and Development
(R&D) priorities*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced it expects to invest
over $5 billion in semiconductor-related research, development, and
workforce needs, including in the National Semiconductor Technology
Center (NSTC), to advance President Biden’s goals of driving R&D in the
United States. As part of the implementation of the CHIPS and Science
Act and the President’s Investing in America agenda, these investments
advance U.S. leadership in semiconductor R&D, cut down on the time and
cost of commercializing new technologies, bolster U.S. national
security, and connect and support workers in securing good semiconductor
jobs.    
  
Semiconductors were invented in America and serve as the backbone of the
modern economy. But today, the United States produces less than 10
percent of global supply and none of the most advanced chips. Similarly,
decades ago the U.S. government invested nearly 2% of GDP in R&D. At
that time, federally funded initiatives allowed America led the world in
innovation – creating life-changing advances in technology like GPS and
the internet. In recent years, however, the government investment ratio
has fallen below 1 percent. Under President Biden’s Investing in America
agenda, the CHIPS and Science Act aims to change that by making a
historic investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and
development (R&D), and the workforce. The CHIPS R&D program includes $11
billion in total funding to advance four programs: the NSTC; the
National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP); the CHIPS
Metrology Program; and the CHIPS Manufacturing USA Institute. The NSTC,
as the centerpiece of the CHIPS R&D program, will bring together and
support government, industry, labor, customers, suppliers, educational
institutions, entrepreneurs, and investors to accelerate the pace of new
innovations, lower barriers to participation in semiconductor R&D, and
directly address fundamental needs for a skilled, diverse semiconductor
workforce.   
   
Today, the White House hosted research and development and workforce
convenings with senior Administration leadership, industry, academia,
think tanks, state and local government, and labor, where the
Biden-Harris Administration announced several milestones that will drive
U.S. leadership in cutting-edge semiconductor research and development,
including:  
   
*<u>Building the National Semiconductor Technology Center</u>*

-   **Planning to invest at least $5 billion in the NSTC**, which is now
    formally established as a Public-Private Consortium by the
    Secretaries of Commerce, Defense, and Energy, the Director of the
    National Science Foundation, and Natcast CEO Deirdre Hanford;  
-   **Announcing NSTC research priorities for 2024,** laying the
    groundwork to ensure the NSTC supports the U.S. in developing the
    next generation of semiconductor technologies by supporting design,
    prototyping, and piloting and through ensuring innovators have
    access to critical capabilities; and  
-   **Launching the NSTC Community of Interest**, a no-cost,
    pre-membership program for interested stakeholders to provide input
    into the program offerings and structure of the NSTC.

*<u>Investing in the Semiconductor Workforce</u>*

-   **Planning to invest at least hundreds of millions of dollars in the
    NSTC’sworkforce efforts, including the creation of a Workforce
    Center of Excellence** with a presence in multiple regions. This
    work will build on the Administration’s efforts to create equitable
    training pathways to connect Americans to the good-paying, high
    quality jobs in critical industries of the future created by the
    President’s Investing in America Agenda, including work done through
    the Biden-Harris Administration’s Workforce Hubs and Advanced
    Manufacturing Sprint. The NSTC will leverage workforce investments
    made by industry, academia, and other education and workforce
    partners and its own funding to:
    -   Convene stakeholders, facilitating connections between employers
        and education and training providers, such as community and
        technical colleges, workforce development boards, and registered
        apprenticeship programs;
    -   Use data to measure the success of existing programs and to
        guide future investment;
    -   Scale up proven education and training programs; and
    -   Pilot new efforts, including initiatives to engage underserved
        communities.
    -   Additional activities could include synthesizing semiconductor
        education and training to form a common baseline education
        program, launching campaigns to attract new students and workers
        to the semiconductor industry, developing new training
        methodologies, and accelerating access to educational
        resources.  
-   **Continuing to engage a broad set of stakeholders to guide the
    stand-up of the** **NSTC’s workforce activities**, with the goal of
    launching in summer 2024. The NSTC’s workforce activities will
    engage senior leadership from the **National Science Foundation,
    Department of Defense, Department of Energy,** **Department of
    Labor, and Department of Education,** **among other federal
    agencies**, to ensure the NSTC benefits from expertise across the
    government, in addition to experts from industry, academia, labor,
    and workforce training providers.

*<u>Investing in Other Key R&D Needs</u>*

-   **Commerce released a Notice of Intent to invest at least $200
    million in a CHIPS Manufacturing USA Institute** to create a
    first-of-its-kind semiconductor manufacturing digital twin
    institute, which will allow innovators to replicate and experiment
    with physical manufacturing processes at low cost, helping to
    significantly reduce U.S. chip development and manufacturing costs,
    improve development cycle time, and accelerate the adoption of
    innovation semiconductor manufacturing technologies;  
-   **Commerce released a Notice of Intent to fund up to $300 million in
    new R&D activities in advanced packaging** of substrates and
    substrate materials, a key technology for manufacturing
    semiconductors, to improve all aspects of system performance and
    support the breadth of new semiconductor applications; and  
-   **Commerce has awarded over $100 million in funding across 29
    projects in the CHIPS Metrology** program addressing common needs
    across the microelectronic industry. Current projects are helping to
    develop new measurement instruments, measurement methods, and
    measurement-informed models and simulations for advanced
    microelectronics design and manufacturing, all of which will help
    inventors and entrepreneurs more easily scale innovations into
    commercial products.  
      
    Today’s announcements build on the progress the Administration has
    already made in advancing research, development, and innovation in
    the United States through implementation of the CHIPS and Science
    Act. Last week, the White House and the [National Science Foundation
    announced 10 U.S.
    regions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-innovation-engines-awards-catalyzing-more-than-530-million-to-boost-economic-growth-and-innovation-in-communities-across-america/)
    that are emerging as innovation ecosystems and **receiving over $530
    million in investment catalyzed by the National Science Foundation’s
    Regional Innovation Engines program,** including to support advanced
    semiconductor packaging capabilities in Osceola County, Florida.
    Over the last several months, the Biden-Harris Administration also
    officially designated a new nonprofit, the National Center for the
    Advancement of Semiconductor Technology (Natcast), as the operator
    of the NSTC, and announced the selection of a Board of Directors and
    a CEO.  And, in the fall of 2023, the Administration announced the
    **designation of 31 Regional Tech Hubs**, including hubs in New
    York, Oregon, Vermont, Texas, and Oklahoma that will specifically
    focus on spurring and supporting innovation in semiconductor
    manufacturing.
