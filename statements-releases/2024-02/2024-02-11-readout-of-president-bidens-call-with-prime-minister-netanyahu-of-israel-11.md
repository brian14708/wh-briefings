President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke this morning with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. The President reaffirmed our shared goal
to see Hamas defeated and to ensure the long-term security of Israel and
its people.  The President and the Prime Minister discussed ongoing
efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas.
 The President emphasized the need to capitalize on progress made in the
negotiations to secure the release of all hostages as soon as possible.
He also called for urgent and specific steps to increase the throughput
and consistency of humanitarian assistance to innocent Palestinian
civilians.  And he reaffirmed his view that a military operation in
Rafah should not proceed without a credible and executable plan for
ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people
sheltering there.  The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact.
