title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Senate Republican Leader Mitch\_McConnell"
---
 
American Democracy is based on elected representatives coming together
and bridging their different points of view to find common ground on
behalf of the American people.

I’m proud that my friend Mitch McConnell and I have been able to do that
for many years, working together in good faith even though we have many
political disagreements.

During his many years of leadership, we could always speak with each
other honestly and put the country ahead of ourselves.

America is now being rebuilt by the biggest infrastructure law in nearly
70 years. We’re making critical investments so our economy can
outcompete China. We’re standing up for our values and our most urgent
national security interests in the world because of it. America is
making tremendous strides towards curing cancer.

There is nothing America cannot do when we do it together.

Mitch has lived the American dream, overcoming polio and going on to
become the longest-serving Senate leader in American history. Jill and I
wish the best to Mitch and Elaine.
