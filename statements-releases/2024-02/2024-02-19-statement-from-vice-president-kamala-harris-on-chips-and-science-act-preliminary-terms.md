  Terms"

Semiconductors are the brain of modern technology. While they are no
larger than a fingernail and no thicker than a piece of paper, they are
essential to every electronic device that we currently use – from
computers and televisions to cars and washing machines. Thanks to our
Administration’s CHIPS and Science Act, we are announcing the Department
of Commerce’s preliminary agreement with GlobalFoundries, which will
award approximately $1.5 billion to expand domestic production of
semiconductors, strengthen U.S. supply chains, and create thousands of
good paying jobs right here in America.  
   
While in Singapore in August 2021, I convened CEOs and government
leaders to make progress on global supply chain challenges. As part of
that convening, I met with an executive from GlobalFoundries, and they
committed to working with our administration to secure domestic supply
chains. The preliminary agreement announced today will allow
GlobalFoundries to create a new state of the art semiconductor
production facility in Malta, NY, and will allow the company to expand
existing operations in both New York and Vermont. The chips made by
GlobalFoundries are critical for the development and manufacturing of
vehicles and smartphones, and are used for satellite and space
communications that are essential to our national defense and national
security.  
   
This investment will also create more than 10,000 good jobs over the
next decade, including many union construction jobs that pay fair wages
and offer benefits like child care services. Additionally, the domestic
production of these chips will provide more supply chain stability to
the auto and aerospace industries across the United States that
currently rely on the shipment of these chips from overseas. And of
course, these types of investments can have a multiplier effect in
communities – driving small business growth, strengthening workforce
pipelines, and helping more people access good jobs without having to
leave their hometowns.  
   
President Biden and I continue to be fully committed to growing our
economy and creating opportunity in every part of America. Today’s
announcement is another way in which we are delivering on that
commitment in New York, Vermont, and communities throughout the country.
