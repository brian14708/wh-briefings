  \ of the Indo-Pacific\_Strategy"

Sunday, February 11, 2024 marks the second anniversary of the
Biden-Harris Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy. Over the past two
years, we have made historic progress in advancing an Indo-Pacific that
is free and open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient. Thanks
to President Biden’s leadership, the United States has never been in a
stronger position in the Indo-Pacific.

In the two years since we have launched the Indo-Pacific Strategy, we
have reinvested and revitalized our alliances and partnerships and taken
them to new heights. We have deepened and elevated alliances with Japan,
the Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
We upgraded our bilateral relationships with Vietnam and Indonesia, and
our partnership with ASEAN. We have expanded our partnership with India
in unprecedented ways. We have surged our efforts in the Pacific,
including with two historic summits for Pacific Island leaders at the
White House and the establishment of the Partners of the Blue Pacific.

In addition, President Biden hosted the historic U.S.-Japan-ROK
trilateral summit at Camp David to open a new chapter in this important
partnership. Under President Biden’s leadership, we have elevated the
Quad with Australia, India, and Japan to a leader-level summit and have
delivered concrete results for the Indo-Pacific region, from vaccines to
maritime domain awareness to scholarships for students.  And three of
the four Official State Visits President Biden has hosted were with
leaders of Indo-Pacific countries: the Republic of Korea, India, and
Australia. This year, the President will welcome Prime Minister Kishida
Fumio of Japan. We have also undertaken historic cooperation between the
United States, Japan, and the Philippines. 

We have also built closer ties between Europe and the Indo-Pacific,
including through the launch of AUKUS, a historic partnership between
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Today, we see a
recognition both in Europe and the Indo-Pacific that the opportunities
and challenges in one region directly affect the other. We’ve seen that
with historic support from some of our Indo-Pacific partners for Ukraine
as it defends itself against Russia’s brutal invasion. And we see that
recognition from our European partners as we work to address the direct
military support from the DPRK to Russia’s war in Ukraine.

After just two years, our execution of the Indo-Pacific Strategy has
made our country and the Indo-Pacific region more secure and more
prosperous. All of this strengthens the United States’ position in the
Indo-Pacific, and advances our interests in and vision for the region
amidst strategic competition with the People’s Republic of China. And
even as we confront challenges elsewhere, the United States will proudly
continue to prioritize our work in this critical region for our future.
