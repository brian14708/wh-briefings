title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration to Kick off Fourth Investing\
  \ in America Tour to Highlight How the President Is Delivering for Communities in\
  \ Every Corner of\_America"
---
 
*To date, over 50,000 infrastructure and clean energy projects have now
been announced thanks to Bidenomics and President Biden’s Investing in
America agenda*

Tomorrow, February 15, the Biden-Harris Administration will kick off its
fourth Investing in America tour to highlight how Bidenomics and the
President’s Investing in America agenda are growing the economy from the
middle out and bottom up—not the top down. The tour will demonstrate how
the President is **delivering for communities across the country,
including those that have been left out or overlooked**. Officials
across the Administration will highlight how President Biden’s
investments are **lowering costs for families, creating good-paying
jobs, and advancing opportunity for all Americans.**  
  
Throughout the Investing in America tour, President Biden, Vice
President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas
Emhoff, Cabinet members, and Senior Administration Officials will visit
communities across the country where the President is cutting costs for
American families, growing our clean energy economy, rebuilding our
infrastructure, and creating good-paying jobs along the way. To date,
the Administration has now **launched over 50,000 infrastructure and
clean energy projects and mobilized over $640 billion in private sector
clean energy and manufacturing investments**.  
  
During the Investing in America tour, Administration officials will also
call out Congressional Republicans who voted against the President’s
agenda yet continue to claim credit for its transformative
impact—including the jobs it’s creating and the economic growth it has
spurred in their communities and across the country. While the President
is busy delivering for the American people, House Republicans are
fighting to give more tax cuts to wealthy and big corporations, raise
costs for prescription drugs and utilities, and cut Social Security,
Medicare, and Medicaid.  
  
When the tour kicks off tomorrow, the Administration will announce
nearly $1 billion for airport terminal projects that will modernize
airports for the 21<sup>st</sup> century—improving passenger experience,
accessibility, and sustainability while creating good-paying jobs. Over
the course of the tour, President Biden and Administration leaders will
make major announcements made possible by the President’s Investing in
America agenda, which includes the Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS and
Science Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and American Rescue Plan.
The tour will also underscore how under President Biden, cities and
towns across the country that have historically been left behind are
making an economic comeback. A [recent
report](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strategic-sector-investments-are-poised-to-benefit-distressed-us-counties/)
found that economically distressed counties are receiving a
disproportionate share of the private sector investment in industries of
the future targeted by the President’s agenda, including clean energy
and semiconductors and electronics. This complements similar findings by
the [Treasury
Department](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1931).
