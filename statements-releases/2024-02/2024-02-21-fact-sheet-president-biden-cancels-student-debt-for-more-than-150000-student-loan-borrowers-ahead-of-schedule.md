Today, President Biden announced the approval of $1.2 billion in student
debt cancellation for almost 153,000 borrowers currently enrolled in the
Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan. The Biden-Harris
Administration has now approved nearly $138 billion in student debt
cancellation for almost 3.9 million borrowers through more than two
dozen executive actions. The borrowers receiving relief are the first to
benefit from a SAVE plan policy that provides debt forgiveness to
borrowers who have been in repayment after as little as 10 years and
took out $12,000 or less in student loans. Originally planned for July,
the Biden-Harris Administration implemented this provision of SAVE and
is providing relief to borrowers nearly six months ahead of schedule.

From Day One of his Administration, President Biden vowed to fix the
student loan system and make sure higher education is a pathway to the
middle class – not a barrier to opportunity. Already, the President has
cancelled more student debt than any President in history – delivering
lifechanging relief to students and families – and has created the most
affordable student loan repayment plan ever: the SAVE plan. While
Republicans in Congress and their allies try to block President Biden
every step of the way, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to
cancel student debt for millions of borrowers, and is leaving no stone
unturned in the fight to give more borrowers breathing room on their
student loans.

Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration’s SAVE plan, starting today,
the Administration will be cancelling debt for borrowers who are
enrolled in the SAVE plan, have been in repayment for at least 10 years
and took out $12,000 or less in loans for college. For every additional
$1,000 a borrower initially borrowed, they will receive relief after an
additional year of payments. For example, a borrower enrolled in SAVE
who took out $14,000 or less in federal loans to earn an associate’s
degree in biotechnology would receive full debt relief starting this
week if they have been in repayment for 12 years. The U.S. Department of
Education (Department) identified nearly 153,000 borrowers who are
enrolled in SAVE plan who will have their debt cancelled starting this
week, and those borrowers will receive an email today from President
Biden informing them of their imminent relief. Next week, the Department
of Education will also be reaching out directly to borrowers who are
eligible for early relief but not currently enrolled in the SAVE Plan to
encourage them to enroll as soon as possible.  
  
This shortened time to forgiveness will particularly help community
college and other borrowers with smaller loans and put many on track to
being free of student debt faster than ever before. Under the
Biden-Harris Administration’s SAVE plan, 85 percent of future community
college borrowers will be debt free within 10 years. The Department will
continue to regularly identify and discharge other borrowers eligible
for relief under this provision on SAVE.  
  
**Over four million borrowers have a $0 monthly payment under the SAVE
Plan**  
  
Last year, President Biden launched the SAVE plan – the most affordable
repayment plan ever. Under the SAVE plan, monthly payments are based on
a borrower’s income and family size, not their loan balance. The SAVE
plan ensures that if borrowers are making their monthly payments, their
balances cannot grow because of unpaid interest. And, starting in July,
undergraduate loan payments will be cut in half, capping a borrower’s
loan payment at 5% of their discretionary income. Already, 7.5 million
borrowers are enrolled in the SAVE Plan, and 4.3 million borrowers have
a $0 monthly payment.  

Today, the White House Council of Economic Advisers released an [issue
brief](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/02/21/issue-brief-the-benefits-of-save/)
highlighting how low and middle-income borrowers enrolled in SAVE could
see significant saving in terms of interest saved over time and
principal forgiven as a result of SAVE’s early forgiveness provisions.

**President Biden’s Administration has approved student debt relief for
nearly 3.9 million Americans through various actions**

Today’s announcement builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s track
record of taking historic action to cancel student debt for millions of
borrowers. Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has
approved debt cancellation for nearly 3.9 million Americans, totaling
almost $138 billion in debt relief through various actions. This relief
has given borrowers critical breathing room in their daily lives,
allowing them to afford other expenses, buy homes, start businesses, or
pursue dreams they had to put on hold because of the burden of student
loan debt. President Biden remains committed to providing debt relief to
as many borrowers as possible, and won’t stop fighting to deliver relief
to more Americans.

The Biden-Harris Administration has also taken historic steps to improve
the student loan program and make higher education more affordable for
more Americans, including:

-   Achieving the **largest increases in Pell Grants** in over a decade
    to help families who earn less than $60,000 a year achieve their
    higher-education goals.  
-   **Fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program** so that
    borrowers who go into public service get the debt relief they’re
    entitled to under the law. Before President Biden took office, only
    7,000 people ever received debt relief through PSLF. After fixing
    the program, the Biden-Harris Administration has now cancelled
    student loan debt for nearly 800,000 public service workers.  
-   **Cancelling student loan debt for more than 930,000 borrowers** who
    have been in repayment for over 20 years but never got the relief
    they earned because of administrative failures with Income-Driven
    Repayment Plans.  
-   **Pursuing an alternative path to deliver student debt relief to as
    many borrowers as possible** in the wake of the Supreme Court’s
    decision striking down the Administration’s original debt relief
    plan. Last week, the Department of Education released proposed
    regulatory text to cancel student debt for borrowers who are
    experiencing hardship paying back their student loans, and late last
    year released proposals to cancel student debt for borrowers who:
    owe more than they borrowed, first entered repayment 20 or 25 years
    ago, attended low quality programs, and who would be eligible for
    loan forgiveness through income-driven repayment programs like SAVE
    but have not applied.  
-   **Holding colleges accountable** for leaving students with
    unaffordable debts.

It’s easy to enroll in SAVE. Borrowers should go to studentaid.gov/save
to start saving.
