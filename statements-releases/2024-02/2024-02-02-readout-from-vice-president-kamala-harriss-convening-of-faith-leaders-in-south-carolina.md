title: "Readout From Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Convening of Faith Leaders\
  \ in South\_Carolina"
---
 
Today, in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Vice President Harris convened
faith leaders and community leaders for a conversation about the
Biden-Harris Administration’s historic efforts to ensure all
communities, including Black communities, can live with dignity, safety,
and have access to opportunity.  
  
The Vice President and participating leaders discussed efforts to cut
prescription costs, like capping insulin at $35 a month, which means
Black seniors, who are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes, no
longer have to choose between filling their prescriptions or
refrigerators. They also discussed the Administration’s work to tackle
student debt, make the criminal justice system more just, and reduce gun
violence, including the President signing the Bipartisan Safter
Communities Act—the first significant gun safety legislation in nearly
30 years. Additionally, they spoke about the importance of the
Administration’s investments in Historically Black College and
Universities (HBCUs), including those in South Carolina, and the
Administration’s efforts to expand access to high-speed internet.  
  
This was the Vice President’s 9th trip to the Palmetto State since
becoming Vice President. Earlier this month, she visited Columbia, South
Carolina, to deliver the keynote address at the South Carolina NAACP’s
annual “King Day at the Dome,” and prior to that, she visited Myrtle
Beach, South Carolina on January 6th to deliver the keynote address at
the 7th Episcopal District AME Church Women’s Missionary Society annual
retreat.
