Last week, the White House Office of Public Engagement convened over 100
Latino leaders for Dominican Day at the White House. This event
consisted of a policy briefing for local and state officials and a
reception to celebrate the Dominican-American culture.  
   
During the briefing, participants discussed how the Biden-Harris
Administration has advanced economic opportunity for the Latino
community through their economic recovery agenda, including the American
Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act,
and the CHIPS and Science Act. The participants highlighted President
Biden’s accomplishments for the Latino community, including growing
economic opportunity, tackling student debt, expanding access to higher
education, and efforts to enhance access to resources and funding for
communities most at need. Biden-Harris Administration officials
committed to continuing to work with community leaders to deliver on the
President’s efforts to advance equity for the Latino community.  
   
During the reception, guests were welcomed by the Second Gentleman who
reiterated the Administration’s commitment to the Latino community and
highlighted the importance of celebrating the diversity that makes up
the fabric of our nation.
