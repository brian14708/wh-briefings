*Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda, Every U.S.
State and Territory Will Receive Funding for Clean Drinking Water and
Wastewater Infrastructure*

Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) Administrator Michael Regan will travel to Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania as part of the Administration’s [Investing in America
Tour](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/14/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-to-kick-off-fourth-investing-in-america-tour-to-highlight-how-the-president-is-delivering-for-communities-in-every-corner-of-america/#:~:text=Throughout%20the%20Investing%20in%20America,families%2C%20growing%20our%20clean%20energy)
to **announce $5.8 billion in funding for clean water infrastructure
from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda**. President Biden
and Vice President Harris are committed to ensuring a future where every
child and family has access to clean, safe water, and today’s
announcement brings the total amount of clean water funding announced by
EPA from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to **$22
billion**. The Infrastructure Law invests a total of over $50 billion to
upgrade America’s water infrastructure, **the largest investment in
clean water in American history.  
**  
Over two million people in America live without running water, tens of
millions more lack access to safe and reliable drinking water and
sanitation, and over nine million homes, daycares, and businesses
receive their water through a toxic lead pipe. Due to decades of
inequitable infrastructure development and underinvestment, lack of
access to clean water disproportionately affects low-income and
underserved communities. President Biden and Vice President Harris
believe this is unacceptable and must change. No child, no family, no
teacher, and no American should lack access to clean water.

Today’s announcement **delivers funding to every single state and
territory in the country** to expand access to clean drinking water,
replace lead pipes, improve wastewater and sanitation infrastructure,
and remove PFAS contamination in water. Additionally, thanks to the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, nearly half of this funding will be
provided as grants or forgivable loans to disadvantaged communities,
advancing President Biden’s [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/)
and ensuring that no community is left behind. Today’s announcement will
build upon the progress President Biden and Vice President Harris have
already made to ensure every American can access clean water. Through
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Administration has launched over
1,300 drinking water and wastewater projects across the country,
including projects that will replace hundreds of thousands of lead
service lines. **To tell the story of how these transformative projects
are impacting communities across the country, EPA is launching a new**

*See below for details on key progress the Administration has made
delivering clean water across America:  
*  
**Delivering Clean Drinking Water**

-   Today, EPA is announcing **over $3.2 billion through the Drinking
    Water State Revolving Fund** to expand access to clean drinking
    water across the country, bringing the total amount of funding
    announced under this category to $8.9 billion. The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law invests nearly $31 billion in funding for a wide
    range of drinking water projects, including upgrades to water
    treatment plants, water distribution and piping systems, PFAS
    treatment, and lead pipe replacement.  
-   One community benefitting from this funding is **Ridgway,
    Colorado**, where over 50,000 people rely on a single water
    treatment plant that is vulnerable to failure, putting their
    drinking water supply at risk. Through a $50 million investment from
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the community will be able to
    build an additional treatment plant and extend service to additional
    communities, helping to ensure safe, reliable drinking water for the
    region.  
-   The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation is investing
    $1 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to construct seven
    major Rural Water Projects to deliver new supplies of clean drinking
    water to rural communities. In addition, the Department of the
    Interior has awarded $160 million for the [**Arkansas Valley
    Conduit**](https://www.usbr.gov/gp/ecao/avc/), a planned 230-mile
    water pipeline that will deliver clean water to 50,000 people in
    southeastern Colorado whose groundwater supplies may be contaminated
    with radionuclides. The project was initially authorized by
    President John F. Kennedy in 1962 and has now finally accelerated
    construction under the Biden-Harris Administration, with the first
    pipeline breaking ground and construction contracts awarded for
    multiple new segments in the past year.  
-   The [**Great Lakes Restoration
    Initiative**](https://www.epa.gov/great-lakes-funding/great-lakes-restoration-initiative-glri)
    – the largest investment in the Great Lakes in two decades –
    received $1 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help
    provide healthy ecosystems and safe drinking water for the 20
    million Americans who rely on the Great Lakes. The program will
    completely restore eleven highly contaminated sites in the Great
    Lakes, three of which have already broken ground. Projects include
    the Milwaukee Estuary in Wisconsin and Cuyahoga River in Ohio, which
    have received a combined $415 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law funding to clean up millions of cubic yards of contaminated
    sediment.

**Replacing Lead Pipes**

-   The general-purpose drinking water funding announced today can also
    be used to replace toxic lead pipes, accelerating progress towards
    the President’s goal of replacing every lead service line in the
    country.  
-   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also includes a historic **$15
    billion in dedicated funding for lead pipe replacement.** To date,
    EPA has announced $6 billion of this funding, which will help
    replace hundreds of thousands of lead pipes. EPA will announce
    additional lead pipe replacement funding from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure for 2024 in the coming months.  
-   Since Vice President Harris last visited **Pittsburgh,
    Pennsylvania** in June 2022 to highlight the importance of replacing
    lead pipes and securing clean water access, the city has received
    $42 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for lead pipe
    replacement, helping Pittsburgh towards its goal of replacing 100%
    of its lead pipes by 2026.

<!-- -->

-   In November 2023, EPA proposed updates to the [**Lead and Copper
    Rule**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/30/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-action-to-protect-communities-from-lead-exposure/)
    that require water systems to replace lead service lines within 10
    years. EPA is also financing major lead pipe replacement projects
    through its WIFIA (Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act)
    loan program. EPA announced low-interest loans of [$340 million to
    the City of
    Philadelphia](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-340-million-water-infrastructure-and-lead-pipe)
    and [$336 million to the City of
    Chicago](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-336-million-loan-chicago-help-remove-30000-lead)
    to replace tens of thousands of lead pipes while creating thousands
    of jobs.  
-   The Administration’s [**Get the Lead Out (GLO)
    Initiative**](https://www.epa.gov/water-infrastructure/get-lead-out-initiative)
    – launched in November 2023 as a part of the President’s goal of
    replacing all lead service lines within a decade – establishes a
    partnership with 200 underserved communities nationwide to provide
    the technical assistance they need to access federal funding and
    remove lead service lines from their communities. This initiative
    builds on EPA and the Department of Labor’s partnership with 40
    underserved communities to support lead pipe replacement.

**Improving Wastewater and Sanitation Infrastructure**

-   Today, EPA is announcing **over** **$2.6 billion through the Clean
    Water State Revolving Fund** for a range of projects to improve
    wastewater, sanitation, and stormwater infrastructure, bringing the
    total funding announced for this purpose to $7 billion. Inadequate
    wastewater or sanitation systems put communities’ health at risk,
    and in total, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests nearly $13
    billion in wastewater funding to expand and upgrade these critical
    systems across the country.  
-   Last week, EPA announced an expansion of its successful [**Closing
    America’s Wastewater Access Gap Community
    Initiative**](https://www.epa.gov/water-infrastructure/closing-americas-wastewater-access-gap-community-initiative)
    to help an additional 150 underserved communities plan wastewater
    projects and access funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
    Through the pilot of this initiative, EPA and the U.S. Department of
    Agriculture have been assisting 11 communities since 2022.  
-   One member of the Wastewater Access Gap initiative is **Lowndes
    County, Alabama**, where roughly 90% of households have failing
    wastewater systems and many children and families are exposed to raw
    sewage in their own backyards. Through the program, EPA and USDA
    have worked with the Lowndes County community of White Hall to
    secure over $500,000 in federal funding for wastewater projects to
    date. In the Lowndes County community of Hayneville, EPA has awarded
    a 100% forgivable $8.7 million loan to address failing or
    non-existent wastewater systems in 650 homes.  
-   Since President Biden took office, the Indian Health Service in the
    Department of Health and Human Services has allocated $1.4 billion
    in funding from the Infrastructure Law to over 650 projects to build
    sanitation infrastructure in Tribal communities.

** Cleaning Up PFAS Pollution in Water**

-   The funding announced today includes **over** **$1 billion**
    dedicated to addressing emerging contaminants like PFAS, bringing
    the total funding announced for emerging contaminants to nearly $5
    billion. PFAS “forever chemicals” can be present in drinking water
    or wastewater and contribute to a variety of harmful health impacts,
    including developmental challenges in children and increased risk of
    cancer. In total, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $10
    billion to help communities build new treatment systems to remove
    PFAS pollution. Additionally, thanks to the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law, 100% of funding to remove emerging contaminants
    like PFAS will be provided as grants or forgivable loans, greatly
    reducing barriers for all communities with PFAS contamination.  
-   One community benefitting from this funding is the city of **Tucson,
    Arizona**, where drinking water supplies have been stressed by both
    drought and the pollution of drinking water wells by harmful PFAS
    and other chemicals. Through a $33.5 million forgivable loan, the
    city will build a new drinking water treatment facility to eliminate
    these contaminants and restore clean drinking water for the
    community.
-   In March 2023, EPA proposed the [**first-ever national drinking
    water standard for
    PFAS**](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas)
    under President Biden’s
    [plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/14/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-new-action-to-protect-communities-from-pfas-pollution/)
    to combat PFAS pollution and EPA’s [PFAS Strategic
    Roadmap](https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-strategic-roadmap-epas-commitments-action-2021-2024).
    Expected to be finalized in 2024, these drinking water standards
    will establish legally enforceable levels for six PFAS chemicals, a
    major step to protect public health from PFAS pollution.
