title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden On Confirming 175 Federal\_Judges"
---
 
During the past three years, I have worked tirelessly to nominate men
and women to the federal bench who are committed to the rule of law.
Today, we reached an important milestone: the confirmation of the
175<sup>th</sup> life-tenured federal judge since I took office. I am
grateful to Leader Schumer, Chair Durbin, and Senators on both sides of
the aisle who have helped to make today’s milestone a reality.  
   
I’m particularly proud that these judges reflect the diversity that is
our country’s strength. They come from every corner of the legal
profession – they were prosecutors, defense attorneys, civil rights
lawyers, and advocates for women’s reproductive freedoms. They were
labor lawyers, municipal law experts, and academics. More than 65% are
women, and 65% are people of color. And we have confirmed more Black
women to life-tenured federal judgeships than any previous
Administration in history – including our nation’s first Black woman on
the U.S. Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson.  
   
Judges make decisions on issues that matter to the American people –
from workers’ rights to women’s reproductive rights, to making sure our
criminal justice system functions fairly and efficiently. That is why I
will continue moving expeditiously – working with the Senate – to
nominate and confirm exceptionally qualified individuals who are
impartial and faithful to the Constitution.
