Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with President Joseph Boakai of
Liberia. The Vice President welcomed Liberia’s free and fair elections
and peaceful transfer of power, and highlighted Liberia’s commitment to
democracy as an example for the region and the world. The Vice President
and President Boakai discussed the importance of good governance and how
it is essential for prosperity, and they agreed to work together to
strengthen democracy in West Africa. The Vice President also underscored
rule of law and transparency as fundamental elements needed to increase
U.S. private sector investment in Liberia, and reiterated the U.S.
government focus on facilitating private sector investment in Africa,
including the $8 billion in commitments announced during the Vice

President Boakai expressed their shared commitment to global peace and
stability, including freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, and the Vice
President recognized Liberia’s contribution to global security,
including its transition from a country hosting UN peacekeeping
operations to providing UN peacekeepers around the world.
