  \ of\_America"

On Tuesday, February 13, Lael Brainard, National Economic Advisor, and
Tom Perez, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the White
House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, met with county elected
officials to discuss how President Biden’s Investing in America agenda
is spurring historic investments in clean energy and manufacturing in
communities too often left behind and positioning them for an economic
comeback. The meeting was held during the National Association of
Counties Legislative Conference with participation from Administration
officials, private sector executives, and non-profit leaders.

The meeting opened with remarks by White House leadership about the
President’s focus on delivering for areas left behind by trickle-down
economics and the importance of collaborating with local government when
implementing economic policy. The Brookings Institution and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology presented a [new
report](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strategic-sector-investments-are-poised-to-benefit-distressed-us-counties/)
that finds that a disproportionate share of recent investments in
strategic sectors is going to economically distressed counties –
delivering on the President’s commitment to ensuring no community is
left out or behind. This report confirms [similar
findings](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-act-a-place-based-analysis)
by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on clean energy investments
spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act.

County officials shared their on-the-ground experiences accessing
federal programs and attracting private sector investment.
Administration officials then spoke about the resources available to
county officials, which can ease the costs of preparing industrial sites
or delivering on projects. Private sector experts in advanced
manufacturing offered expertise on how firms strategically consider
different localities for investment, the role of financing, and how to
approach site readiness. The session concluded by identifying potential
resources available from the public, private, and non-profit sector for
county officials to continue driving equitable economic growth in
communities across the country.
