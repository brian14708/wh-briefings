title: "Readout of White\_House Convening with Community College Presidents and\_\
  Provosts"
---
 
Yesterday, the Biden-Harris Administration convened community college
presidents and provosts at the White House to discuss the ways they are
strengthening talent pipelines into growing sectors fueled by President
Biden’s historic Investing in America agenda.  The Investing in America
agenda—including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science
Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and American Rescue Plan—is creating
strong demand for skilled workers in clean energy, biotechnology,
advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, and more. To support community
colleges’ critical efforts to prepare a diverse, skilled workforce for
these good jobs, the Administration has made robust investments in these
institutions, including through the National Science Foundation’s
[Advanced Technical Education
program](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/advanced-technological-education-ate),
the Department of Labor’s [Strengthening Community Colleges Training
Grants](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/skills-training-grants/scc),
the Department of Commerce’s [Tech Hubs
program](https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/regional-technology-and-innovation-hubs),
and more.  
  
     Biden-Harris Administration officials from the Domestic Policy
Council, the National Economic Council, the Office of the First Lady,
the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor heard from more
than 30 community college leaders representing 21 states on their
successful strategies for recruiting and training a diverse array of
students and workers; their efforts to create partnerships with K-12
systems, employers, labor unions, local elected leaders, and others; and
how the Biden-Harris Administration can continue to support their
efforts.
