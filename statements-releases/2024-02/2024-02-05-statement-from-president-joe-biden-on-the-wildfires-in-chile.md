---
 
Jill and I are deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation
caused by the ongoing wildfires in Chile. Our thoughts and prayers are
with the people impacted by this terrible tragedy and the first
responders working to fight the fires and support displaced families and
individuals. My administration is in contact with our Chilean partners,
and the United States is ready to provide necessary assistance to the
Chilean people. The United States stands with Chile at this difficult
time.Â
