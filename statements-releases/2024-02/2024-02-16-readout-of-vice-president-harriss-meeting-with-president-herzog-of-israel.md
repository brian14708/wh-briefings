Vice President Kamala Harris met today with President Isaac Herzog of
Israel in Munich Germany. The Vice President reiterated her steadfast
support for Israel and its right to defend itself in the face of threats
from Hamas, and she again condemned Hamas as a barbaric terrorist
organization that perpetrated a horrific massacre on October 7. The Vice
President and President discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release
of all hostages held by Hamas and achieve a prolonged pause in
fighting.  The Vice President also emphasized the importance of
protecting civilians, increasing humanitarian assistance, and ensuring
proper deconfliction mechanisms to ensure that aid can reach those in
need inside Gaza.  The Vice President reaffirmed the Biden-Harris
Administration’s position that a military operation in Rafah should not
proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety
of and support for the more than one million people sheltering
there. The leaders also discussed ongoing planning for post-conflict
Gaza and progress made on that front, and the Vice President reiterated
U.S. positions, including that Israel must be secure, there must be no
forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, and the Palestinians must
enjoy their right to freedom, dignity, security, and self-determination.
