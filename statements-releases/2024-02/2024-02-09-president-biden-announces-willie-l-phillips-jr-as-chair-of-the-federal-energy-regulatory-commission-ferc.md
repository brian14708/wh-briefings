WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced Willie L. Phillips,

an independent agency that regulates the interstate transmission of
natural gas, oil, electricity, and other energy projects. As the Biden
Administration works to tackle the climate crisis, advance environmental
justice, and create a clean electricity grid by 2035, FERC will maintain
an important role in spurring access to reliable, affordable carbon-free
energy moving across the country.
