  \ of Secretary\_Mayorkas"

History will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act
of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public
servant in order to play petty political games. Homeland Security
Secretary Mayorkas, a Cuban immigrant who came to the United States with
his family as political refugees, has spent more than two decades
serving America with integrity in a decorated career in law enforcement
and public service.  From his time in the Justice Department as a U.S.
Attorney to his service as Deputy Secretary and now Secretary of
Homeland Security, he has upheld the rule of law faithfully and has
demonstrated a deep commitment to the values that make our nation
great. 

This impeachment already failed once on a bipartisan vote. Instead of
staging political stunts like this, Republicans with genuine concerns
about the border should want Congress to deliver more border resources
and stronger border security. Sadly, the same Republicans pushing this
baseless impeachment are rejecting bipartisan plans Secretary Mayorkas
and others in my administration have worked hard on to strengthen border
security at this very moment — reversing from years of their own demands
to pass stronger border bills. Giving up on real solutions right when
they are needed most in order to play politics is not what the American
people expect from their leaders. Congress needs to act to give me,
Secretary Mayorkas, and my administration the tools and resources needed
to address the situation at the border. The House also needs to pass the
Senate’s national security supplemental right away. We will continue
pursuing real solutions to the challenges Americans face, and House
Republicans have to decide whether to join us to solve the problem or
keep playing politics with the border.
