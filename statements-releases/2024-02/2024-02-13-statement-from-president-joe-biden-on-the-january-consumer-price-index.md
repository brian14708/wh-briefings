title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the January Consumer Price\_Index"
---
 
Today’s report shows that wage growth has been the strongest of any
economic recovery in 50 years. At a time when growth and employment
remain strong, inflation declined by two thirds from its peak but we
know there’s still work to do to lower costs.

That’s why I’m fighting to lower costs for middle class families—from
the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs, to eliminating hidden
junk fees that companies use to rip you off, to calling on corporations
to pass savings on to consumers instead of hiding price increases by
shrinking package sizes. I will continue standing in the way of
Congressional Republicans who want to cut taxes for the wealthy and
large corporations, raise costs for middle class families, and cut
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
