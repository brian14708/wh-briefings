National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Prime Minister Masrour
Barzani of Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) today at the White
House.  Sullivan expressed appreciation for the longstanding partnership
between Kurdistan and the United States and confirmed U.S. support for a
strong and economically viable Kurdistan region as outlined in Iraq’s
constitution.  He made special reference to the role played by the
Kurdish Peshmerga in the fight against ISIS and the historic partnership
between the Peshmerga and the United States.  He expressed condolences
to Peshmerga fighters and Kurdish civilians lost over the last decade
during the campaign to defeat ISIS.  He affirmed support for the
security of the Kurdistan region and condemned attacks by Iran and
Iranian-backed proxy groups against locations there.  Sullivan also
reaffirmed U.S. support for the KRG and Iraqi government as they work
towards a durable revenue- and budget-sharing arrangement that
strengthens stability, good governance, and economic progress throughout
Iraq and its Kurdistan region.
