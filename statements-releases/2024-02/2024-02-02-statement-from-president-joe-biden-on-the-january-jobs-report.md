title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the January Jobs\_Report"
---
 
America’s economy is the strongest in the world. Today, we saw more
proof, with another month of strong wage gains and employment gains of
over 350,000 in January, continuing the strong growth from last year.
Our economy has created 14.8 million jobs since I took office,
unemployment has been under 4% for two full years now, and inflation has
been at the pre-pandemic level of 2% over the last half year. It’s great
news for working families that wages, wealth, and jobs are higher now
than before the pandemic, and I won’t stop fighting to lower costs and
build an economy from the middle out and bottom up. I’ll continue to
stand in the way of efforts by Congressional Republicans to enact
massive tax giveaways for the wealthy and big corporations; cut
Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security; and raise costs for American
families.
