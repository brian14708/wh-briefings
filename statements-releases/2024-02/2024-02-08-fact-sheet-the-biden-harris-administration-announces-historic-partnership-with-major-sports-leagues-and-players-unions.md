***Partnership with President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and
Nutrition is among new commitments under the White House Challenge to
End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities***

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a new partnership
with major sports leagues and players associations to boost physical
activity and increase nutrition programming across the country.  
   
Fourteen sports leagues and players associations have signed agreements
with the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition to expand
access to physical activity, integrate messaging and education around
nutrition, and promote healthy lifestyles to the millions of people who
engage in their programs every year.  
   
In 2022, President Biden hosted the [White House Conference on Hunger,
Nutrition, and
Health](https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/white-house-conference-hunger-nutrition-and-health),
the first in more than 50 years. The President also
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/27/executive-summary-biden-harris-administration-national-strategy-on-hunger-nutrition-and-health/)
a National Strategy to meet an ambitious goal to end hunger and reduce
diet-related diseases by 2030 – all while closing disparities among the
communities that are impacted most.  
   
Towards that goal, last year the Biden-Harris Administration launched
the [White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy
Communities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-the-white-house-challenge-to-end-hunger-and-build-healthy-communities-announces-new-public-private-sector-actions-to-continue-momentum-from-hist/)
as a nationwide call-to-action to stakeholders across all of society to
make bold commitments. The historic partnership announced today is one
of the new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge.
Additional new commitments will be announced later this month.  
   
The President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, & Nutrition is a federal
advisory committee that aims to promote healthy, accessible eating and
physical activity for all Americans, regardless of background or
ability. In 2022, President Biden appointed chef José Andrés and
basketball player Elena Delle Donne to serve as Co-Chairs of the
President’s Council followed by a full slate of [Council
Members](https://health.gov/pcsfn/council-members) in 2023.  
   
The following sports leagues and players associations are announcing new
commitments today:
