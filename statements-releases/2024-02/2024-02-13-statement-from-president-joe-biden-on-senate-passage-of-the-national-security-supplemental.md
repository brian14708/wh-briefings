title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Senate Passage of the National Security\_\
  Supplemental"
---
 
This bipartisan supplemental agreement is critical to advancing
America’s national security interests. It will allow the United States
to continue our vital work, together with our allies and partners all
around the world, to stand up for Ukraine’s freedom and support its
ability to defend itself against Russia’s aggression. It will provide
Israel with what it needs to protect its people against Hamas
terrorists. Significantly, this agreement will provide life-saving
humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people, the vast majority of
whom have nothing to do with Hamas. 

I applaud the bipartisan coalition of Senators who came together to
advance this agreement, and I urge the House to move on this with
urgency. We cannot afford to wait any longer. The costs of inaction are
rising every day, especially in Ukraine. Already, we are seeing reports
of Ukrainian troops running out of ammunition on the front lines as
Russian forces continue to attack and Putin continues to dream of
subjugating the Ukrainian people. There are those who say American
leadership and our alliances and partnerships with countries around the
world do not matter. They do. If we do not stand against tyrants who
seek to conquer or carve up their neighbors’ territory, the consequences
for America’s national security will be significant. Our allies and
adversaries alike will take note. It is time for the House to take
action and send this bipartisan legislation to my desk immediately so
that I can sign it into law.
