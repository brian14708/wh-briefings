National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is traveling to Brussels,
Belgium on February 7.  There, he will meet with NATO Secretary General
Stoltenberg and join a North Atlantic Council meeting of his
counterparts from our NATO Allies.  In these meetings, Mr. Sullivan will
discuss a variety of key issues ahead of the 75th Anniversary Summit in
Washington, including our continued support of Ukraine, our response to
Russian aggression, and the investments that NATO Allies are making in
strengthening our defense and deterrence postures including by investing
in our defense industrial bases.
