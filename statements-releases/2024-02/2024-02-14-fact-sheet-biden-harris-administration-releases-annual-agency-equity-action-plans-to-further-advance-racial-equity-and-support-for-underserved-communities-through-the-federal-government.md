title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Releases Annual Agency Equity\
  \ Action Plans to Further Advance Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities\
  \ Through the Federal\_Government"
---
 
Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has championed an
ambitious equity and racial justice agenda to ensure the full and fair
participation of all communities in American life. Despite progress
being made, entrenched disparities in our laws and public policies have
often denied equal opportunity to historically underserved communities,
including rural communities, Black, Latino, Asian American, Native
Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) communities, Tribal
communities, LGBTQI+ individuals, religious minorities, people with
disabilities, women and girls, and other communities impacted by
persistent poverty. Redressing these opportunity gaps can drive stronger
economic growth for all Americans. For example, research finds that the
gaps in labor market opportunities for women and people of color cost
the U.S. $2.6 trillion in foregone GDP in 2019; closing these gaps would
increase economic output by an additional $3.1 trillion in 2029 alone. A
[report](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strategic-sector-investments-are-poised-to-benefit-distressed-us-counties/)
released this week from Brookings and MIT illustrated the success of
these efforts – supporting economic comebacks in communities across the
country.

Through the implementation of [two historic Executive
Orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/equity/) on equity and the
President’s landmark [Investing in America
Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) and
other key legislation, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to
advance opportunity and make real the promise of America for everyone.

Today, marking the first anniversary of the signing of President Biden’s
[second Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/)
on equity, federal agencies, including all Cabinet-level agencies, [are
releasing their 2023 Equity Action
Plans](http://www.performance.gov/equity), which include over 100
community-informed strategies and actions to address systemic barriers
in our Nation’s policies and programs. The Biden-Harris Administration
also released a new [White House Progress Report on
Equity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/White-House-Equity-Action-Plan-Progress-Report.pdf),
which highlights examples of the more than 650 actions agencies have
undertaken since the release of their 2022 Equity Action Plans. Agencies
acted to increase access to federal contracting dollars, capital, and
lending programs for small disadvantaged businesses; reduce
discrimination in the housing market; advance environmental justice and
invest in disadvantaged communities; address health disparities,
including disparities in maternal health outcomes in communities of
color; build economic prosperity in rural communities; promote equity
and fairness in the justice system; support victims and survivors of
gender-based violence; root out bias in the design and use of new
technologies, such as artificial intelligence; and bolster civil rights
enforcement.

“Since day one of our Administration, President Biden and I have been
fully committed to ensuring that every person in America has equitable
access to opportunity and the ability to thrive – whether that be
supporting small businesses, forgiving $137 billion in student loan
debt, investing billions of dollars in our Historically Black Colleges
and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, removing lead pipes,
cutting prescription drug prices, and taking on the maternal health
crisis with the urgency it demands,” **said Vice President Kamala
Harris.** “As we mark the one-year anniversary of the second equity
Executive Order, we celebrate the hundreds of government-wide equity
accomplishments and recommit to addressing the barriers that remain.
Together, we will continue to advance equity across the federal
government, not only in hiring and appointments but in the historic
investments we are making in communities that had been overlooked for
far too long.”

Now more than ever, it is critical to reject the narrow, cramped view of
American opportunity as a zero-sum game. When we lift each other up, we
are all lifted up.  Across the Federal Government, agencies will take
new actions to advance equity and justice for underserved communities,
including by:

**Addressing Inequity in Economic Opportunity**

-   **Improving Financial Health of Underserved Businesses and
    Communities.** Families build wealth by starting small businesses,
    yet many entrepreneurs who are veterans, women, or people of color
    still face discrimination by U.S. banks, are charged higher interest
    costs, and experience difficulties when trying to obtain the fair
    and affordable financing options needed to grow their businesses.
    Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority
    Depository Institutions (MDIs), such as banks and credit unions,
    serve as frontline financial supports to low- and moderate-income
    communities by providing loans, grants, and financial products to
    businesses and consumers who otherwise are unable to access capital
    and services through traditional banking institutions. **The
    Department of the Treasury** invested nearly $9 billion through
    investment through the [Emergency Capital Investment
    Program](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-small-businesses/emergency-capital-investment-program)
    that scales the capacity of these low- and moderate-income community
    financial institutions in providing loans, grants, and forbearance
    for businesses and consumers, especially in low-income and
    underserved communities. In addition, for the first time in 40
    years, the Small Business Administration issued new Small Business
    Lending Company licenses for nonbank lenders to expand capital
    access to traditionally hard to reach small businesses. These
    actions will enable these critical institutions to better serve
    their local communities and ensure that all people have equal
    opportunity to prosper through business ownership.
-   **Ending** **Gender-based Workforce Discrimination.** Women have
    persistently lower wages and fewer workplace benefits than men, with
    disparities that are even more pronounced for many women of color.
    **The Department of Labor (DOL)** will implement [Good Jobs
    Principles](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/principles) aimed
    at improving wages in female dominated sectors and administer the
    [Fostering Access, Rights, and
    Equity](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/grants/fare) grant program
    for women impacted by gender-based violence and harassment in the
    workplace. DOL will also work to reduce caregiving penalties for
    women and low-paid workers by expanding and tailoring the [National
    Database of Childcare
    Prices](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/featured-childcare),
    key analytical tools to evaluate how childcare prices are linked
    with gender and racial inequality in the labor force.

**Addressing Inequity in Housing and Community Investment**

-   **Ending Discrimination in Home Appraisals.** Every American
    deserves the opportunity to be a homeowner. But many Black and Brown
    families still face housing discrimination, like the indignity of
    removing family photos from their walls just to obtain a fair
    valuation when they put their home up for sale. One study by Freddie
    Mac found that 12.5% of appraisals for home purchases in
    majority-Black neighborhoods and 15.4% in majority-Latino
    neighborhoods resulted in a value below the contract price (the
    amount a buyer is willing to pay for the property), compared to only
    7.4% of appraisals in predominantly white neighborhoods. To combat
    property appraisal bias, the **Department of Housing and Urban
    Development** (HUD) launched the [PAVE
    Initiative](https://pave.hud.gov/). As part of the Equity Action
    Plan, HUD [will partner with the National Association of Real Estate
    Brokers to tackle appraisal bias and discrimination in the housing
    market](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_23_157).
    The new collaboration will include online training for counselors,
    roundtable discussions on bias and discrimination, educational
    material distribution, and appraisal-related training—all aimed to
    promote fairness in the housing market.
-   **Expanding Safe, Accessible, Affordable Transportation.** The
    **Department of Transportation** (DOT) estimates that at least 1
    million people and businesses were displaced by decades of harmful
    urban renewal projects and legacy policy decisions in the buildout
    of the Federal highway system. From 1955 to 1977, the federal
    government selected land that cut through low-income communities and
    communities of color to build the Nation’s highway system –
    destroying once vibrant and affordable neighborhoods, exacerbating
    racial segregation, stifling economic mobility, widening disparities
    in health outcomes and furthering community isolation in areas with
    low access to jobs and institutions such as grocery stores and
    banks. DOT will redress these chronic disinvestments by implementing
    the [Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhood Grants
    Program](https://www.transportation.gov/grants/rcnprogram/about-rcp),
    a first-of-its-kind federal program funded through the President’s
    Investing in America agenda. Over $4 billion is available over five
    years through this program, with nearly $3.4 available in the latest
    round. In the first round of the program DOT awarded a total of $185
    million to 45 projects through the Reconnecting Communities Program,
    aimed at restoring community connectivity through the removal,
    retrofit, mitigation, or replacement of eligible transportation
    infrastructure facilities. As these place-based construction
    projects begin to reach completion in 2024, they will cumulatively
    help combat transit-related burdens faced by 47% of the U.S.
    population who spend at least 15% of their annual income on
    transportation and the 8% of American households without access to
    vehicles.

**Addressing Inequity in Health**

-   **Making Childbirth and the Postpartum Period Safer.** The
    **Department of Health and Human Services** (HHS) will [improve
    maternal health
    outcomes](https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/maternal-health/index.html)
    to combat the maternal health crisis which disproportionally impacts
    Black women, Native women, and women in rural communities by
    addressing gaps in insurance coverage and disparities in the
    birthing care infrastructure. This includes expanding postpartum
    coverage through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance
    Program from 60 days to 12 months of continuous care, with the
    potential to reach an estimated 720,000 Americans annually who would
    be eligible for essential care for a full year after pregnancy if
    all states extended postpartum coverage. Data from Medicaid and the
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate thatmore than
    one-half of pregnancy-related mortality occurs in the 12-month
    postpartum period and about one-third occurs between 7 and 365 days
    post-delivery. Additionally, pregnancy-related deaths are three to
    four times more common among Black or African American and American
    Indian/Alaska Native women than among white women. Asian American
    and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women, experience
    [disparities in delivering at
    term](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7547364/).
-   **Combatting Child Food Insecurity.** The **Department of
    Agriculture** (USDA) will help close the summer hunger gap for
    children eligible for free and reduced price school meals by
    implementing [new summer nutrition
    options](https://www.fns.usda.gov/summer), including [to-go or
    home-delivered summer
    meals](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/non-congregate) in certain
    rural communities and a summer grocery benefit for children known as
    [Summer EBT](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sebt). For Summer EBT’s
    inaugural year this summer, 36 states, D.C., all five U.S.
    territories, and four Tribes launched the program in January 2024,
    which will serve close to 21 million children with a total of nearly
    $2.5 billion in grocery benefits. This is around 70% of the total
    population of children eligible for Summer EBT. USDA expects
    additional states and Tribes will provide Summer EBT in 2025.
    [Rigorous
    evaluations](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/summer-electronic-benefit-transfer-children-sebtc-demonstration-summary-report) of
    a multi-year demonstration project showed that summer grocery
    benefits decreased the number of kids with very low food security by
    about one-third and supported healthier diets featuring more fruits,
    vegetables and whole grains.  

**Addressing Inequity through Environmental and Climate Justice**

-   **Tackling Environmental Injustice.** Every person in this country
    deserves to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live in a
    healthy environment. However, for far too long, communities across
    our country – including many communities of color, Tribal
    communities, low-income communities, and people experiencing
    persistent poverty – have faced environmental injustices, such as
    bearing the brunt of toxic pollution, enduring underinvestment in
    infrastructure and critical services, and suffering disproportionate
    impacts from climate change. President Biden is advancing the most
    ambitious environmental justice agenda in history to address this,
    including [signing a historic Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/21/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-to-revitalize-our-nations-commitment-to-environmental-justice-for-all/)
    that calls on the Federal Government to bring clean energy and
    healthy environments to all and mitigate harm to those who have
    suffered from toxic pollution and other environmental burdens like
    climate change; replacing lead pipes and taking action to protect
    communities from PFAS pollution; accelerating Superfund cleanups;
    tightening air quality enforcement near polluting facilities; and
    more. HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, funded by the
    Inflation Reduction Act, has already awarded nearly $300 million in
    loans and grants to improve the homes of thousands of low- and
    moderate-income Americans through clean energy and climate
    resilience projects.
-   **Delivering on the Justice40 Initiative and Reducing Pollution.**
    President Biden’s [Justice40
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/)
    set a goal to deliver 40% of the overall benefits of certain
    climate, clean air, clean water, and other federal investments to
    disadvantaged communities that have historically been left behind or
    overlooked. Over [500 programs across 19 federal
    agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/11/29/biden-harris-administration-continues-to-accelerate-environmental-justice-in-disadvantaged-communities-through-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
    are being reimagined and transformed through the Justice40
    Initiative to maximize benefits to disadvantaged communities such as
    cleaner air, good-paying jobs, and affordable clean energy. Key
    categories of federal investments included in the Justice40
    Initiative are: climate change, clean energy and energy efficiency,
    clean transit, affordable and sustainable housing, training and
    workforce development, pollution remediation and reduction, and
    water and wastewater infrastructure. The President’s Inflation
    Reduction Act also makes historic investments in environmental
    justice for all, including the **Environmental Protection Agency’s**
    (EPA) single largest investment in environmental justice in EPA
    history through the new competitive [Community Change
    Grants](https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/inflation-reduction-act-community-change-grants-program)
    program. The program will deliver $2 billion in Inflation Reduction
    Act funding to support new community-driven projects that deploy
    clean energy, strengthen climate resilience, and build capacity for
    communities to achieve a healthier, safer, and more prosperous
    future for all.
-   **Reforming Disaster Assistance Program to Help Survivors Recover
    Faster.** Studies have found that people of color and low-income
    communities experience significant barriers to recovery following
    natural disasters. To improve the **Federal Emergency Management
    Agency’s** Individual Assistance program to advance equity, FEMA
    will be simplifying processes, removing barriers, and increasing
    eligibility to reach more disaster survivors. FEMA will expand home
    repair assistance, allow for the re-opening of the applicant
    registration period when the President adds new counties to the
    major disaster declaration, and simplify the documentation
    requirements for continued temporary housing assistance.

Today’s announcements build on actions the Biden-Harris Administration
has taken to advance equity, as outlined in the new White House Progress
Report on Equity. Below are examples of recent accomplishments included
in the new Equity Action Plans. Explore the 2022 and 2023 Equity Action
Plans at www.performance.gov/equity.

-   **Supporting Disadvantaged Farmers.** **USDA** has helped more than
    39,000 farmers and ranchers who were in financial distress retain
    their farms and continue farming. President Biden’s Inflation
    Reduction Act allocated $3.1 billion for USDA to provide relief for
    distressed borrowers with certain direct and guaranteed loans, and
    to expedite assistance for those whose agricultural operations are
    at financial risk due to factors outside their control, such as the
    COVID-19 pandemic. Since the law was signed in August 2022, USDA’s
    Farm Service Agency has provided over $2.1 billion and counting in
    immediate assistance (as of February 12, 2024).

<!-- -->

-   **Ensuring Contracting Opportunities for Small Disadvantaged
    Businesses (SDBs).** The **Department of** **Treasury** awarded $1.2
    billion in FY 2023 to SDBs, representing for the first almost 12% of
    eligible small business dollars available for Treasury contracts. In
    addition, Treasury awarded a total of over $2 billion to businesses
    of all sizes, including to Women-Owned Businesses and Minority-Owned
    Businesses. These steps further President Biden’s goal of ensuring
    15% of federal contracts go to SDBs by 2025.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding Mental Health Support Services for Students.** The
    **Department of Education** funded 264 grants with $1 billion in
    Bipartisan Safer Communities Act funds to more than 40 states to
    increase the supply of school-based mental health professionals
    under the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant and the Mental
    Health Services Professional Demonstration (MHSPD) Grant Program. At
    least 40 states used “high poverty” in their definition of
    high-needs school. The Department estimates these 5-year grants will
    result in an increase of 14,000 mental health professionals. In FY
    2023, nearly 50% of the MHSPD grants include a partnership with
    Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal
    Colleges, and Minority Serving Institutions, including
    Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Asian American and Native Hawaiian
    Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions. Additionally, the Department
    aims to ensure that school districts serving historically
    underserved student groups, including students of color, students
    from low-income backgrounds, students who are English learners,
    students experiencing homelessness, and others have the resources
    they need to support learning recovery. This includes the allocation
    of $122 billion in ARP funds to school districts based on their
    level of poverty under Title I and the ARP’s Maintenance of Equity
    requirements to protect high poverty schools from reductions in
    State and local education funding.

-   **Expanding Care for Women Veterans.** The **Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA)** has [expanded breast cancer screenings and mammograms
    for veterans with potential toxic
    exposures](https://news.va.gov/press-room/breast-cancer-veterans-toxic-exposures/)
    and supported access to reproductive health services for veterans
    and VA beneficiaries. VA has also [dramatically expanded one-on-one
    maternity care
    coordination](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-expands-maternity-care-coordination-for-veterans/)
    for women veterans – the fastest growing cohort of veterans at VA.
    Women [veterans are also enrolling in VA health
    care](https://www.accesstocare.va.gov/pdf/VA_PACTActQuarterlyDemographic_Issue1_Final_508.pdf)
    at higher rates under the PACT Act, and VA recently hosted its
    [first Women Veterans Experience Action
    Center,](https://news.va.gov/126268/women-veterans-experience-action-center/)
    helping more than 340 women veterans apply for the care and benefits
    they deserve.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding Language Access.** In May 2022, the **Department of
    Justice** hired its first-ever Language Access Coordinator and has
    reestablished the Language Access Working Group, which is comprised
    of representatives from various DOJ components, and meets regularly
    to provide a platform to support, guide, and oversee components’
    efforts to increase meaningful access so that communities can better
    access DOJ programs, communicate public safety concerns, and
    vindicate their rights. For example, DOJ recently published its FY
    2022-2026 Strategic Plan in Spanish. DOJ also published key excerpts
    in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog in order to reach more
    limited English proficient communities, including those in AA and
    NHPI communities. In August 2023, the Department also released its
    updated Language Access Plan, which improves translation and
    interpretation services, promotes quality assurance of those
    services, and expands the range of tools available to serve the
    public. Additionally, the **General Services Administration** also
    worked to expand access to voter registration information in
    communities that face voter participation difficulties due to
    language barriers. Vote.gov added several Asian, Native Hawaiian,
    and Pacific Islander languages including: Bengali, Khmer, Korean,
    Hindi, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, with Chinese (both simplified and
    traditional) and its first Alaska Native language, Yup’ik-Akuzipik.
    Vote.gov is also accessible in Arabic, Spanish, French, Haitian
    Creole, Navajo, Portuguese, and Russian languages.

<!-- -->

-   **Fostering Community Development in Rural and Tribal Communities.**
    The **Department of the Interior’s** (DOI) made $725 million in FY
    2023 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Abandoned Mine Land grants
    available to eligible states and the Navajo Nation. The funding will
    provide good-paying jobs to coal communities and at the same time
    return legacy coal sites to productive uses, fostering community and
    economic development.  Additionally, DOI announced [new
    regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-48/chapter-14/subchapter-H/part-1480)
    to improve implementation of the Buy Indian Act to promote economic
    development opportunities in Indian Country. The final rule was
    developed in consultation with Tribes and ultimately is working to
    eliminate barriers that inhibit Indian Economic Enterprises (IEEs)
    from competing on certain construction contracts and expanded IEEs’
    ability to subcontract construction work consistent with other
    socio-economic set-aside programs.

<!-- -->

-   **Using Rental Payment History to Advance Home Ownership.** **HUD**
    has taken additional steps through the Office of Single-Family
    Housing (SFH) to support wealth-generation activities for
    prospective and current homeowners. Specifically, SFH expanded
    access to credit by incorporating a borrower’s positive rental
    payment history into the mortgage underwriting process. Using rental
    payment history promotes a more inclusive credit evaluation, which
    in turn can expand homeownership opportunities to first-time
    homebuyers. This guidance is expected to continue to expand
    homeownership opportunities for borrowers where a positive rental
    payment history can make a difference when combined with other
    assessment factors for determining eligibility for Federal Housing
    Administration-insured mortgage financing. HUD estimates this policy
    change will enable up to 5,500 borrowers per year to qualify for an
    FHA-insured loan.
