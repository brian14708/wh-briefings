title: "Readout from the White\_House and USDA\u2019s Discussion on Advancing Equity\
  \ and Opportunity in\_Agriculture"
---
 
Yesterday, the White House and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
convened 30 stakeholders representing minority farmers and farmers of
small- or mid-sized operations for an event focused on President Biden’s
efforts to ensure all farmers have the tools they need to succeed and
thrive, including fair and equitable access to USDA programs and
services.

Stephen Benjamin, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the
Office of Public Engagement, and Neera Tanden, White House Domestic
Policy Advisor, welcomed participants to the discussion, providing
updates on the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to uphold civil rights
and promote equity, including in agriculture, through implementation of
President Biden’s [Executive Order On Further Advancing Racial Equity
and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal
Government](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/).
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack then shared details on USDA’s
vision for and concrete progress in promoting equity, supporting family
farmers and ranchers, and ensuring that underserved groups and rural
communities have access to critical resources.

Over the past three years, under the Biden-Harris Administration, the
USDA has worked hard to deliver a significant and meaningful list of
actions to uphold civil rights, advance equity and ensure the promise of
America for all communities across the country.

A roundtable conversation was then moderated by Dr. Dewayne Goldmon,
USDA Senior Advisor for Racial Equity. Zach Ducheneaux, Administrator of
USDA’s Farm Service Agency, also took part in the conversation. Topics
discussed included, but were not limited to: the barriers small-scale
farmers confront when it comes to securing funding for USDA farm and
conservation programs, and USDA’s work through to address these barriers
in recent years; the need to engage a more diverse group of young people
in agriculture and agriculture-related professions; the need to build
lasting partnerships and for producers of all types to have a seat at
the table; the unique constraints that state- or county-based policies
create for Tribal farmers; and an acknowledgement of USDA’s success in
diversifying its leadership and Farm Service Agency county committees,
which must be followed by diversification of state and local level staff
to better reflect the people they serve.

Following the roundtable at the White House, participants continued the
conversation at USDA.
