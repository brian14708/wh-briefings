Last week, the White House Office of Public Engagement convened over 90
Afro-Latino Leaders to celebrate the first in-person Afro-Latino
Heritage Day as a part of this year’s Black history Month theme;
“African Americans & the Arts.” This event highlighted the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to Black and Latino communities and to
racial diversity by celebrating the Afro-Latino identity.

During the event, participants enjoyed a panel on Black Latinidad in the
Arts and a fireside chat with TV Host Sunny Hostin and actress and
producer Gina Torres. The participants highlighted the importance of
Afro-Latino representation in the arts and the entertainment industry
and praised the administration’s efforts to uplift the Afro-Latino
identity and recognize the community’s contributions across various
sectors of the arts.

Participants also enjoyed special performances by Composer and Actor
Mauro Castillo and Afro-Cuban singer Cimafunk.
