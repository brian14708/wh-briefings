title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Attack on Magdeburg Christmas\_Market"
---
 
The United States extends our deepest condolences to the people of
Germany grieving the terrible attack at a Christmas market yesterday in
Magdeburg, Germany.  No community—and no family—should have to endure
such a despicable and dark event, especially just days before a holiday
of joy and peace.  My team has been in close touch with German
officials.  We’ve made it clear that the United States stands ready to
offer all available resources and assistance if needed.  And while this
situation remains under investigation, make no mistake:  the United
States will always stand with our Allies against violent terror.  In the
coming days, we will keep all those injured or killed—and their beloved
families—close in our hearts.
