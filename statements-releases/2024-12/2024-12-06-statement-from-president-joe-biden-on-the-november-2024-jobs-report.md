title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the November 2024 Jobs\_Report"
---
 
America’s comeback continues. Today’s report shows that the economy
created 227,000 jobs in November, as Boeing machinists returned to work
with record wage gains and hurricane recovery continued. Unemployment of
4.2% is in the same low range of the past seven months. This has been a
hard-fought recovery, but we are making progress for working families.

Since I took office, the economy has created more than 16 million jobs,
with jobs created every single month. Unemployment has been the lowest
on average of any administration in 50 years. Incomes are up almost
$4,000 more than prices. While there is more to do to lower costs, we’ve
taken action to lower prescription drug prices, health insurance
premiums, utility bills, and gas prices that will pay dividends for
years to come.
