On December 17, the Biden-Harris Administration hosted the first-ever
White House Sustainable Freight Workshop, bringing together nearly 100
public and private stakeholders from across the freight sector to
discuss a path forward to reducing emissions from the freight system
while protecting the economic vitality created by President Biden’s
Investing in America agenda. Recognizing the critical importance of the
freight sector and the associated challenge of reducing emissions to
improve global and local environmental and public health impacts, the
workshop convened Federal agency and White House staff alongside leaders
representing the freight industry, civil society, and environmental
justice organizations to realize the Administration’s commitment to
developing a national zero-emissions freight strategy.

The freight sector, including maritime, rail, and trucking, is a
critical part of the Nation’s transportation system, [transporting more
than 20 billion tons of freight worth more than $18 trillion dollars
annually.](https://data.bts.gov/stories/s/Freight-Transportation-System-Extent-Use/r3vy-npqd)
The economic impact of freight helps make it the largest source of
climate pollution in the U.S. In the United States, the transportation
sector (including the freight sector) is a leading contributor to local
pollution, responsible for more than [50% of total NO<sub>x</sub>
emissions, over 30% of volatile organic compound emissions, and over 20%
of particulate matter
emissions](https://www.epa.gov/smartway/why-freight-matters-supply-chain-sustainability),
pollution that particularly impacts communities of color and low-income
families. Worldwide, the freight sector contributes approximately eight
percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Historically, challenges to
decarbonize the freight sector have been in part due to slow fleet
turnover and associated acquisition costs.

The transformative economic agenda of the Biden-Harris Administration
has helped accelerate the freight sector toward a cleaner future. Recent
historic investments include $3 billion from the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)’s Clean Ports Program and $735 million from
EPA’s Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicle Program to help applicants purchase 2,400
zero-emission commercial vehicles; $2.4 billion from the Department of
Transportation’s Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety
Improvements ([CRISI)
grants](https://railroads.dot.gov/sites/fra.dot.gov/files/2024-10/FY23-24%20CRISI%20Selections.pdf)
program administered by the Federal Rail Administration for low- and
zero-emission locomotives; and [$150 million in
grants](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/grants-help-reduce-truck-air-pollution-ports)
from the Federal Highways Administration to reduce truck emissions at
port facilities. The Biden-Harris Administration has also upheld its
commitment to protecting communities that have historically suffered
disproportionate public impacts of the freight sector.

Taking a holistic approach to freight sustainability, the Workshop
presented opportunities to align as an integrated freight ecosystem
across the maritime, rail, and trucking industries and builds on the
Administration’s 2023 [National Blueprint for Transportation
Decarbonization](https://www.energy.gov/eere/us-national-blueprint-energy-and-emissions-innovation-transportation),
the March 2024 release of a [National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor
Strategy](https://driveelectric.gov/files/zef-corridor-strategy.pdf),
and the April 2024
[announcement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-sets-first-ever-national-goal-of-zero-emissions-freight-sector-announces-nearly-1-5-billion-to-support-transition-to-zero-emission-heavy-duty-vehicles/)
of the first-ever national goal to transition to a zero-emissions
freight sector. The workshop also served as an opportunity to launch the
[Action
Plans](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/national-blueprint-decarbonizing-transportation-what-comes-next)
for freight sector all stemming from the National Blueprint for
Transportation Decarbonization.

The following actions were announced at Tuesday’s workshop:

-   The Electrification Coalition, an industry consortium and
    nonpartisan organization, announced the launch and call to action of
    the Sustainable Freight Partners Group to align interests and
    coordination on the deployment low to zero-emission freight
    solutions across the maritime, rail and trucking industries. The
    Group will serve as a critical platform to regularly convene on
    freight sustainability priorities, communicate the value of emission
    reduction solutions, and facilitate strategic vision on competitive
    and economic approaches across the freight ecosystem.
    -   The Department of Energy, along with its Blueprint agency
        partners, brought to life the recently announced modal action
        plans through results-driven discussions on measures for
        implementation on the top modal actions including;  
        -   Maritime: Scaling the production of low and zero-emission
            fuels for marine vessels through the “Sustainable Grand
            Maritime Challenge.”

        <!-- -->

        -   Rail: Designing the future rail network for low to
            zero-emission short and line haul freight locomotives
            through a public-private partnership framework.

        <!-- -->

        -   Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles: Developing the Play Book
            for Phase I and 2 of the National Zero-Emission Freight
            Corridor Strategy to deploy charging and refueling
            infrastructure in freight hubs and along corridors for
            battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks.

    <!-- -->

    -   A Zero Emissions Freight Map developed by the Joint Office of
        Energy and Transportation and Atlas Public Policy presented over
        700+ projects worth $12.8 billion across the freight ecosystem
        for maritime, rail and trucks showcasing strong alignment with
        the prioritization of public and private investments through the
        ‘all of government’ National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor
        Strategy.
        -   Sixty-five percent of the investments in zero-emission
            freight were funded through industry, utilities, cities and
            states where only 35% of the share is funded through the
            Federal government, demonstrating a strong commitment across
            the private and public sectors for freight sustainability.
            These projects will take fold over the next three to five
            years proving strong momentum and advancement in zero-
            emission technologies and infrastructure.

    <!-- -->

    -   Environmental groups and industry consortia participated in an
        externally led social media campaign \#RouteZeroWeek to
        celebrate clean transportation from “Sustainable Freight to
        Clean Cars” presenting supporting messages for the billions of
        dollars in public and private investment, advanced technologies
        and partnerships for clean transportation solutions throughout
        the U.S.
