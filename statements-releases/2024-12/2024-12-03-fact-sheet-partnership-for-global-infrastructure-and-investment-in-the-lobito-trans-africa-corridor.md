title: "FACT SHEET: Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment in the Lobito\
  \ Trans-Africa\_Corridor"
---
 
Today, the United States and Angola are co-hosting a Partnership for
Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor
Summit, bringing together leaders from the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), Tanzania, and Zambia, as well as the Africa Finance
Corporation (AFC).  The leaders will affirm their commitment to continue
developing the Corridor and invest in infrastructure to connect the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  They will further pledge to accelerate the
next phase of the Corridor with the new Zambia-Lobito rail project.  The
Summit will underscore the importance of enabling sustainable private
sector investments that unlock inclusive economic growth and sustainable
development for local and regional communities.  
   
Through PGI—a bipartisan initiative in partnership with G7+, for
strategic, values-driven, and high-standard infrastructure and
investment in low- and middle-income countries—the United States and our
partners aim to positively impact people’s lives, strengthen and
diversify our supply chains, protect workers, and advance shared
national security interests.  The flagship Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor,
anchored in core rail investments, is a transformative economic corridor
that connects the region and accelerates trade and the growth of key
sectors supporting the economic diversification and development
priorities of African leaders.  The United States is working with
partners around the world to replicate the success of the Lobito
Trans-Africa Corridor and help bridge the global infrastructure gap.  
   
In September 2024, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the
completion of an initial feasibility study and launch of the
environmental and social impact assessment for the Zambia-Lobito rail
project, a greenfield 800-kilometer rail line being built from scratch
linking Angola and Zambia for the first time.  Together, these studies
ensure the project is economically and financially viable and will be
delivered following international best practices on labor, community
participation, and environmental protection.  AFC, Angola, and Zambia
also celebrated the signing of the concession agreement, which allows
the next phase of development to continue.  The target date to break
ground is early 2026.  
   
Today, President Biden is announcing over $560 million in new funding,
including commitments expected to generate at least $200 million in
additional private sector capital, for infrastructure projects along the
Corridor, bringing the total for U.S. investments to more than $4
billion. With these announcements and together with G7 partners and
regional development banks, international investment in the Lobito
Corridor has exceeded $6 billion. These investments will be  mobilized
towards new and continuing projects that support the economic potential
and development impacts of the Corridor across multiple interconnected
sectors, including transportation and logistics, agriculture, clean
energy and associated supply chains, health, and digital access.  
   
**Transportation and Logistics  
**   
Rail and other transportation and logistics-related infrastructure forms
the backbone of the Corridor and will enable expanded trade and business
growth.  While these investments are traditionally public-sector
investments, the United States through PGI is supporting commercially
driven projects that lock-in efficiency and sustainable maintenance over
the long-term.  
 

-   Following the due diligence announced by President Biden in May
    2023, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)
    is announcing the commitment of a $553 million direct loan to the
    Lobito Atlantic Railway to upgrade and operate a 1,300-kilometer
    rail line from the Lobito port to the Angolan town of Luau on the
    DRC border.  This investment supports the anchor rail investment of
    the first phase of the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor and is the
    backbone on which additional high-quality investments in
    agriculture, healthcare, energy, and financial services will be
    built.  The Lobito Atlantic Railway’s operational improvements have
    already scaled up the number of freight shipments from once per
    month to two times per week.

<!-- -->

-   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the
    Angolan Ministry of Transportation are signing a MOU to support new
    personnel and IT equipment, with the aim of helping the Ministry
    leverage private investment in Angola’s infrastructure and
    development.  This followed the approximately $1 million grant
    announced earlier in 2024 by the USAID to assist the Ministry.

<!-- -->

-   The anchor rail line of the second phase of the Lobito Trans-Africa
    Corridor, the new Zambia-Lobito rail project, was launched in
    October 2023, with the AFC as the lead project developer.  Building
    on AFC’s initial $5 million for feasibility studies and project
    development, AFC is announcing its commitment to anchor and mobilize
    up to $500 million through various financial instruments to ensure
    the project reaches financial close, in line with its prior track
    record.  The announcement complements a technical assistance grant
    the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) awarded to AFC in
    September 2024 for an environmental and social impact assessment to
    facilitate this effort and to move the project towards financial
    close.

<!-- -->

-   In October 2024, KoBold Metals, a U.S. company applying artificial
    intelligence to develop a critical minerals site in Zambia, signed
    Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with AFC committing to anchor the
    commercial viability of the Zambia-Lobito rail project with more
    than 300,000 tons of copper per year from its Mingomba mine.  AFC
    will collaborate with KoBold to support the Mingomba project,
    through a combination of project development funding, equity, or
    debt financing as required.

<!-- -->

-   AFC signed MOUs this month totaling an additional 170,000 tons of
    minimum freight commitments from Zambian mining projects including
    from Kobaloni Energy, which is planning to construct the first
    cobalt sulphate refinery on the African continent, and First Quantum
    Minerals, one of the world’s top ten copper producers.  These
    commitments will help the new Zambia-Lobito rail project raise
    capital at a lower cost.  The MOUs also represent start of creating
    a diversified supply chain route for the critical minerals that
    support the global energy transition.

<!-- -->

-   Since 1995, the United States has provided over $164 million for
    humanitarian demining in Angola.  This lifesaving assistance plays a
    critical role in bolstering human security, providing safe access to
    land for economic development, and facilitating environmental
    conservation in the Okavango River Basin. The U.S. Department of
    State announced a total of $9 million in de-mining assistance over
    the next two years that will facilitate rail construction along the
    Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor, as well as other economic development
    goals across Angola, as part of a multi-year campaign for Angola to
    achieve mine-free status.  With a $10 million match from the
    Government of Angola, implementing partners will be able to clear
    the mines left from Angola’s decades-long civil war, enabling the
    land to be recultivated for farming and other uses.

<!-- -->

-   In December 2023, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Board
    of Directors selected Tanzania to develop a threshold program.  MCC
    and the Government of Tanzania are now developing a trade and
    investment program to facilitate trade between Tanzania and its
    neighbors and address trade barriers.  The program is scheduled to
    launch in late 2025 and builds on MCC’s more than $700 million in
    prior investments in governance, transportation, energy, and water
    in Tanzania.

   
**Agriculture**  
  
In support of U.S. efforts to accelerate agricultural-led economic
growth in Angola and our partners across the Lobito Trans-Africa
Corridor, the United States is investing in value-added food processing
and connecting farmers to global markets.  These investments also
deliver on President Biden’s commitment under the [U.S.-Africa
Partnership to Promote Food Security and Resilient Food
Systems](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/15/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-to-promote-food-security-and-resilient-food-systems/),
to step up our investments to build more resilient food systems in
Africa and to unlock Africa’s enormous agriculture production
potential.  
 

-   Today, President Biden will meet with businesses that are investing
    in the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor enabled by U.S. support.  He
    will visit the Lobito production facilities of the Carrinho Group,
    Angola’s largest food producer, which is rapidly expanding the
    network of family farmers from whom it sources raw produce for
    products sold across the country.  President Biden will celebrate
    the first shipment of Carrinho food products along the Lobito
    Atlantic Railway line to be sold in the DRC, supporting regional
    food security.  To enhance agriculture expansion, USAID has
    partnered with Carrinho through an existing $5.5 million program and
    public-private partnership focused on women’s empowerment, to
    facilitate the offtake of grain and crops grown by communities along
    the Corridor.  In November 2024, DFC signed a non-binding Letter of
    Interest to explore a loan that would support Carrinho to purchase
    and install grain storage equipment to reach more farmers along the
    rail Corridor and key hubs.  Complementing these investments is the
    previously announced Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM)
    financing to build 186 rural bridges.  This financing will further
    support thousands of smallholder farmers to participate in this
    sustainable agriculture value-chain as Carrinho grows its farmer
    network to two million farmers by 2030.

<!-- -->

-   The African Development Bank is announcing its intention to finance
    $370 million across three agriculture projects facilitating regional
    trade and food security and promoting sustainable commercial
    agriculture value chains.  These projects are expected to mobilize
    an additional $100 million in private sector capital and will
    enhance food security, promote the economic inclusion of local
    communities, including small- and medium-sized enterprises, and
    create jobs in agriculture and other sectors along the Lobito
    Trans-Africa Corridor.  To accelerate implementation, the U.S.
    Department of the Treasury will make a $3 million commitment to the
    Bank to support project preparation and feasibility work.  This
    complements the Bank’s November 2023 $500 million commitment to
    invest in the Zambia-Lobito rail project, and adds to the $289
    million agricultural value chain and transport infrastructure
    project in the DRC it financed in July 2024.  This brings the Bank’s
    total investment in the Corridor to more than $1 billion over the
    past 12 months.

<!-- -->

-   In October 2024, a U.S. consortium led by Amer-Con Corporation
    signed an MOU with ARCCLA, the Angolan public entity within the
    Ministry of Transportation responsible for the Lobito Trans-Africa
    Corridor, to build and operate silo terminals and collection points
    on planned logistics platforms along the Corridor and nationwide.
     The project will focus on staple crops such as corn, rice, soybean,
    and wheat.  This project will boost local production, enhance food
    security and stimulate economic growth as part of the National
    Network of Grain Silos strategy, which aims to achieve a
    2.2-million-ton storage capacity and reduce post-harvest losses.

<!-- -->

-   In fiscal year 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    committed nearly $300 million that will use U.S. commodities to help
    strengthen food security across Africa.  These programs provide
    critical school meals and literacy programming and are facilitating
    agricultural economic development in nine African countries,
    including Angola, and Tanzania.  In Angola, USDA will work with
    World Vision through a $27.5 million McGovern-Dole agreement to
    provide school meals for more than 80,000 beneficiaries in three
    provinces.  The project will provide more than 5,000 metric tons in
    nutritious U.S. commodities and more than 4,000 metric tons of
    locally procured fruits and vegetables to support the school meals
    and literacy programming in eight municipalities across the
    Benguela, Cunene, and Huila provinces.  In Tanzania, USDA will work
    with Lutheran World Relief through a more than $35 million Food for
    Progress agreement to support food security for 30,000 beneficiaries
    through the implementation of climate smart agricultural practices
    in the poultry sector for smallholder farmers.

<!-- -->

-   In October 2024, the MCC signed a $458 million compact program with
    Zambia focused on catalyzing inclusive economic growth in the
    agriculture and agro-processing sectors.  The program, which
    includes an additional $33 million contribution from the Government
    of Zambia, aims to lower the cost of transporting farm products and
    processed goods to markets, increase the availability of equipment
    for small and medium farmers and processors, increase financing for
    infrastructure projects that support agriculture, and catalyze
    reforms in the agriculture sector to attract greater private
    investment.  The compact will build on MCC’s $378 million in prior
    investments in Zambia to remove barriers to trade and improve water
    infrastructure, distribution, and reforms.

<!-- -->

-   In September 2024, DFC committed a $5 million loan to Community
    Markets for Conservation Limited in Zambia to expand its food
    processing business to support the adoption of sustainable,
    conservation-based practices in rural Zambia.  This builds on DFC’s
    $10 million loan to Seba Foods Zambia Ltd., which was announced at
    the PGI Lusaka Investment Forum in February 2024.  DFC also reached
    a commitment on a $6 million USAID-sponsored loan portfolio
    guarantee for Angolan company Kixicrédito S.A. that will support
    lending to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises targeting the
    agriculture sector, including firms along the Lobito Trans-Africa
    Corridor.

   
**Clean Energy   
**   
Africa has approximately 39 percent of the world’s renewable energy
potential.  The United States is committed to supporting the growing
energy needs of people and businesses across the Lobito Trans-Africa
Corridor with renewable sources that power communities and industry.  
 

-   The United States supports Angola’s objective to generate 73 percent
    of its energy from clean sources by 2027 as well as current and
    anticipated energy needs across the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor as
    new companies and sectors develop.  Through PGI, the Department of
    State is providing technical assistance to strengthen the Angolan
    government’s capacity to meet national energy goals, reduce
    greenhouse gases, and expand access to electricity.

<!-- -->

-   In Angola, U.S. company Sun Africa, is part of a historic EXIM
    financing commitment of over $2.4 billion connecting a million
    Angolans to clean electricity.  This second phase of the project
    includes an additional 320 megawatts from distributed minigrid
    systems across four southern provinces alongside clean drinking
    water projects.  Sun Africa is receiving support from Power Africa,
    and has received support from a number of Power Africa interagency
    partners, including USAID, the Department of Commerce, the State
    Department, and EXIM.

<!-- -->

-   Through USAID’s Empower Southern Africa program under Power Africa,
    the United States plans to enter a formal partnership with the
    Angolan National Transmission Company to realize important
    cross-border and domestic transmission lines that will help
    integrate Angola into the Southern and Central Africa Power Pools
    and supply electricity to the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor. USAID is
    launching a new $1.5 million grant from the Power Africa Opportunity
    Fund to provide solar powered irrigation and refrigeration equipment
    to support farming communities along the Corridor.

<!-- -->

-   In September 2024, DFC committed a $40 million liquidity facility to
    Africa GreenCo, a company operating in Zambia that is expanding
    renewable energy access.  Africa GreenCo procures renewable
    electricity through power purchase agreements from independent power
    producers to sell on the Southern African Power Pool, to both public
    utilities and private sector buyers.  DFC’s support will help
    provide a credit enhancement to Africa GreenCo, enabling it to
    establish a track record as an energy aggregator and trader.

<!-- -->

-   To accelerate private investment in African infrastructure projects,
    and in the Lobito Corridor in particular, the U.S. Department of the
    Treasury will make a $4.2 million contribution to the Alliance for
    Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA) via the African Development
    Bank, one of the partners collaborating on the development of the
    Lobito Corridor.  AGIA aims to mobilize private capital at a rate of
    20 times donor contributions, meaning that our contribution should
    catalyze approximately $100 million to build quality, sustainable
    infrastructure projects.

   
**Critical Minerals Supply Chains   
**   
Africa will play a central role in the global energy transition and the
Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor is rich in the critical minerals that will
power the 21stcentury.  The United States is committed to ensuring
reliable supply chains by supporting the development of this sector with
environmentally respectful processing so more of the value is captured
on the continent.  
 

-   Through the Kabanga Nickel project, LifeZone Metals Ltd., a company
    listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is investing in bringing
    critical mineral value addition to Tanzania.  Their support of the
    development of the Kahama special economic zone, which will include
    a first of its kind nickel processing facility in the region, can
    serve as a hub and training center for Tanzanians working across the
    clean the energy supply chain.  In August 2024, DFC signed a
    retainer letter with Kabanga Nickel Limited, a subsidiary of
    Lifezone Metals Ltd., to begin due diligence on political risk
    insurance to support the Kabanga Nickel underground
    nickel-copper-cobalt mine site and the Kahama Hydromet refinery
    site.  In September 2024, DFC also signed a non-binding letter of
    interest with Kabanga Nickel Limited expressing DFC’s interest in
    considering a potential direct loan to support the project.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Angola are collaborating on principled
    investments to advance critical minerals projects along the Lobito
    Trans-Africa Corridor through technical assistance to prepare new
    operations to secure future debt or equity financing.  During the
    June 2024 U.S.-Angola Energy Security Dialogue, the Department of
    State and Angola agreed to elevate our critical mineral partnership.
     In September 2024, Pensana PLC received a $3.4 million grant from
    DFC to fund a feasibility study to double the capacity of its
    Longonio rare earths mine, design in-country refining capacity, and
    conduct test work on new ore bodies.  It also includes a $3.2
    million DFC technical assistance grant to Chillerton to support the
    development of a green copper mining project in Zambia.

<!-- -->

-   USAID, the State Department, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
    is announcing $2 million in technical assistance for responsible
    development and management of Angola’s mining sector.  In November
    2023, USGS and the Angolan Geological Institute (IGEO) signed an MOU
    to enhance scientific collaboration.  This partnership will foster
    transparency and attract principled investment in Angola’s mineral
    sector through a three-year program to analyze and interpret newly
    acquired geoscience data to document Angola’s critical mineral
    potential while building capacity within the IGEO.

   
**Health **  
   
The United States is committed to expanding access to health care and
strengthening health security, including through PGI investments in
health-related infrastructure in the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor.  
 

-   The United States and Angola are working together to help accelerate
    development progress in Angola, including by mobilizing critical
    investments in Angola’s health infrastructure under PGI.  To support
    the Angolan government’s priorities in a fiscally responsible
    manner, DFC has committed to providing up to $150 million in
    political risk insurance for new water treatment plants to expand
    access to potable water to underserved communities in southern
    Angola.  This will further expand DFC’s portfolio of investments in
    Angola – more than $700 million in commitments – all of which have
    been committed during the Biden-Harris Administration.

   
**Digital Access  
**   
Access to high-speed internet and associated digital resources helps
fuel technological and economic innovation in Africa.  The United States
is committed to connecting citizens and businesses across the Lobito
Trans-Africa Corridor with highly reliable and trusted vendor
technology.  
 

-   In alignment with the Digital Transformation with Africa initiative,
    the United States is investing in Angola’s digital architecture,
    supporting reliable telecommunication networks—using trusted
    vendors—that will benefit the Angolan people and improve Angola’s
    digital connectivity to the global economy.  EXIM announced a
    non-binding, preliminary board commitment to provide $100 million
    financing for U.S.-owned telecommunications company Africell to
    expand its high quality, reliable, and affordable wireless cell
    service to all corners of Angola and upgrade equipment in the DRC
    with trusted vendor technology.  This builds on USAID’s 2023 launch
    of a nearly $5 million “Dinheiro Digital é Melhor” or “Mobile Money
    is Better” project with Africell to spur the development of a
    vibrant and secure mobile money and digital finance ecosystem in
    Angola.  USAID and partners are connecting approximately 12,000 new
    mobile phone users to the Afrimoney platform per month, with 240,000
    new users joining in 2024.  In combination with financial literacy
    training and policy engagement with Angola’s government, USAID and
    partners are breaking down barriers and reaching those previously
    excluded from the formal financial system.

<!-- -->

-   To date, USTDA has provided $13.2 million in funding to prepare
    digital, transportation, and clean energy projects that will help
    develop the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor.  These activities are
    designed to help unlock several billion dollars in financing and
    deploy innovative U.S. technologies for the Trans-Africa Corridor’s
    implementation.

<!-- -->

-   In November 2024, USTDA awarded a feasibility study grant to
    Javilian Civils (Proprietary) Limited to support the deployment of
    terrestrial fiber and access infrastructure connecting inland
    locations in Central and Southern Africa with subsea cables along
    the Atlantic Coast.  The project will ultimately increase internet
    connectivity in Angola, the DRC, and Namibia.

<!-- -->

-   In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce led a large
    whole-of-government delegation to the NewSpace Africa Conference
    held in Angola, representing a growing US interest in space-related
    cooperation and trade, and in engaging African nations in
    development of norms for satellite operations.  Part of the Commerce
    Department, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    offers a wide range of free, open source data, information, and
    tools that are available to help businesses, communities, and
    nations address climate adaptation and mitigation, sea-level rise,
    flooding, coral reef monitoring, and space weather, including a
    range of early-warning systems for weather, climate, and
    hydrological disasters.

   
**Investment   
**   
PGI leverages public funds to unlock private capital investment.  In the
Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor, the United States is supporting
sustainable economic growth by helping secure investment for firms
across many sectors and sizes.

-   In September 2024, DFC committed a $13 million equity investment in
    the African Rivers Fund IV, which will support small and
    medium-sized businesses in frontier markets in Central and Southern
    Africa, including Angola, the DRC, and Zambia.

<!-- -->

-   To promote U.S. investment in Angola, the DRC, and Zambia, Prosper
    Africa is providing roughly $600,000 of transaction advisory
    services to firms along the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor.  These
    services aim to connect local firms, accelerate economic progress,
    and increase local and regional involvement in the growing economy
    around the Corridor.

<!-- -->

-   Through the United States’ Economic Resilience Initiative, USAID
    will help advance the economic opportunities presented by the Lobito
    Trans-Africa Corridor for inclusive growth.  Working with Congress,
    $4.5 million will support workforce development that matches private
    sector needs and the industrialization of agricultural inputs and
    outputs for regional export markets along the Corridor.
