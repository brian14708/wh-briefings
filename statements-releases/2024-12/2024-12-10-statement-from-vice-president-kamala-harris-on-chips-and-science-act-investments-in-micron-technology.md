title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on CHIPS and Science Act Investments\
  \ in Micron\_Technology"
---
 
The spirit of innovation is central to who we are as Americans. America
invented the semiconductor, the building blocks of the technology of
today and tomorrow. Through our CHIPS and Science Act, President Biden
and I have made the historic investments necessary to ensure
semiconductor manufacturing returns to and remains here in America.  
   
Today, thanks to our historic legislation, the Department of Commerce
has finalized one of its largest awards to date with Micron Technology,
the only U.S. based manufacturer of memory chips. This more than $6.1
billion investment in Clay, NY and Boise, ID supports the construction
of several state-of-the-art memory chips facilities as part of Micron’s
total $125 billion investment over the next few decades, creating at
least 20,000 jobs by the end of the decade. These investments will help
the U.S. grow its share of advanced memory manufacturing from nearly 0%
today to 10% over the next decade.  
  
I am also proud to say that Micron is building these facilities by
utilizing project labor agreements and registered apprenticeship
programs, which will further strengthen local economies, support
workers, and ensure the construction is completed on time and within
budget. Additionally, the Department of Commerce announced that it
agreed to preliminary terms with Micron for an additional $275 million
investment to expand Micron’s Manassas, VA facility and onshore a
critical technology relied upon by our defense industry, automotive
sector, and national security community.  
   
Our administration knows these landmark announcements are more than
investments; they are catalysts for sustained economic growth. When
President Biden and I took office, supply chain disruptions led to chips
and semiconductor shortages. That is why we worked with Republicans,
Democrats, and Independents in Congress to pass legislation to make
these unprecedented investments that are creating opportunity in red and
blue states alike. At the same time, our work has bolstered our national
and economic security by promoting the domestic creation of the chips
that are responsible for powering nearly every device Americans rely on
– from smartphones and vehicles to advanced defense systems and
artificial intelligence data centers. This work will make a lasting
difference for decades to come and proves that in the competition for
the 21st century, we can invest in American industries and American
workers at the same time.
