title: "Statement from President\_Biden on CBO Report on Health Insurance\_Coverage"
---
 
Health care should be a right, not a privilege, and every American
should be able to access quality affordable coverage. My Administration
has worked tirelessly to make it happen, and our plan is working:
premiums for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are more
affordable, Medicare and Medicaid are strong, seniors are paying less
for prescription drugs, and more Americans have health insurance than
ever before in American history.

A new report from the Congressional Budget Office underscores just how
critical the legislation to bring down health care costs, enacted under
my Administration, have been. Millions of Americans are benefiting from
expanded premium tax credits that lower their premiums. If Congress
takes that benefit away, premiums will spike and 3.8 million people will
become uninsured. That’s simply wrong. The American people don’t deserve
to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket. That’s why I’ll
continue to call on Congress to continue the Affordable Care Act tax
credits, and protect affordable health insurance for millions of
Americans.
