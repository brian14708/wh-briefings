title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Former Prime Minister\
  \ Manmohan Singh of\_India"

Jill and I join the people of India in grieving the loss of former
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

The unprecedented level of cooperation between the United States and
India today would not have been possible without the Prime Minister’s
strategic vision and political courage. From forging the U.S.-India
Civil Nuclear Agreement to helping launch the first Quad between
Indo-Pacific partners, he charted pathbreaking progress that will
continue to strengthen our nations—and the world—for generations to
come. He was a true statesman. A dedicated public servant. And above
all, he was a kind and humble person. 

I had the chance to meet Prime Minister Singh as Chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee in 2008 and as Vice President during his
Official State Visit to the United States in 2009. He also graciously
hosted me in New Delhi in 2013. As we discussed then, the U.S.-India
relationship is among the most consequential in the world. And together,
as partners and friends, our nations can unlock a future of dignity and
unlimited potential for all of our people. 

During this difficult time, we recommit to this vision to which Prime
Minister Singh dedicated his life. And Jill and I send our deepest
condolences to former First Lady Gursharan Kaur, their three children,
and all the people of India.
