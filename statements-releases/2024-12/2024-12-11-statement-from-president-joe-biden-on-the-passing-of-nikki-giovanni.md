title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Nikki\_Giovanni"
---
 
In 2020, Nikki Giovanni’s majestic voice echoed her powerful words,
“*and sometime, there has to be something called courage. You have it in
your hands*.”

Born in segregated Knoxville, Tennessee, she became a renowned activist,
professor, and literary legend who had that courage in her hands and in
her heart.

A pioneering poet of the Black Arts Movement and the Civil Rights era,
she used her pen to advance racial and gender equality and confront
violence, hate and injustice, alongside some of the most esteemed
artists and icons of the past century.

Author of over 25 books, her wit and intellect earned her numerous
accolades, including the Langston Hughes medal, an Emmy award, and a
Grammy award nomination. A three-time cancer fighter, Nikki offered
words of wisdom that gave hope to countless others fighting disease and
despair.

Jill and I send our love and condolences to her family—including her
wife Virginia, her son Thomas, and her granddaughter Kai—and all those
who loved and admired that something special, her courage.

May God bless Nikki Giovanni.
