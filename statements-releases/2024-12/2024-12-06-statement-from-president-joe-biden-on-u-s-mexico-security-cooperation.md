title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on U.S.-Mexico Security\_Cooperation"
---
 
As Commander in Chief, I have one solemn responsibility: protect the
American people from harm. That’s why, over the last four years, I made
beating the opioid epidemic a central focus of my Unity Agenda at
home—and my cooperation with world leaders abroad.  
   
Earlier this week, we saw the impact: Mexican security forces seized
more than twenty million doses of illicit fentanyl—enough to kill 15
percent of all Americans. I want to thank President Claudia Sheinbaum
for her leadership and partnership that made this possible, and the many
military and law enforcement officials on both sides of the border who
have dedicated their lives to countering fentanyl, disrupting
traffickers, and saving their fellow citizens. It matters.  
   
And we won’t let up. Under my Administration, we have seized more
fentanyl at our border in the last two years, than the previous five
years combined. We’ve put dozens of major cartel leaders and money
launderers behind bars. And latest data shows over a 14 percent drop in
overdose deaths across the nation—that’s the largest decrease on
record.  
   
These aren’t just facts and figures. They are families. Families who
don’t have to bear the loss of a child, or parent, or spouse. So today,
with partners around the world—including Mexico—we vow to double down on
our work to size more drugs. To stop more traffickers. To save more
lives. And to we make it clear: enough is enough.
