President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President João Lourenço,
highlighting the transformation of the U.S.-Angolan relationship and
reaffirming our joint commitment to continue working together to address
global challenges. The two leaders discussed significant trade and
investment opportunities that keep our companies competitive and defend
the interests of workers, addressed the shared responsibility to protect
and strengthen democracy in Angola and around the world, and celebrated
the continued growth of the U.S.-Angola defense relationship. President
Biden underscored the significance of the more than $3 billion in U.S.
commitments to infrastructure projects in Angola in support of the
Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor, a multinational initiative to help
accelerate inclusive economic growth and connect markets along the
Corridor to the world, all while creating quality jobs and improving
lives and livelihoods both along the Corridor and in the United States.
He also expressed appreciation for Angola’s role in promoting peace and
security in sub-Saharan Africa, including its efforts to mediate the
conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
