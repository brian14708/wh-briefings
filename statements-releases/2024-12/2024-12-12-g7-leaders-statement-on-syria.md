title: "G7 Leaders\u2019 statement on\_Syria"
---
 
We, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), reaffirm our commitment to
the people of Syria, and lend our full support for an inclusive
Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition process in the spirit
of the principles of UN Security Council Resolution 2254. We call on all
parties to preserve Syria’s territorial integrity and national unity,
and respect its independence and sovereignty.

We reiterate our support for the UN Disengagement Observer Force
monitoring the Golan Heights between Israel and Syria.

We stand ready to support a transition process under this framework that
leads to credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance that ensures
respect for the rule of law, universal human rights, including women’s
rights, the protection of all Syrians, including religious and ethnic
minorities, transparency and accountability.

The G7 will work with and fully support a future Syrian government that
abides by those standards and results from that process.

Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of holding the Assad regime
accountable for its crimes and will continue to work with the OPCW and
other partners to secure, declare and destroy Syria’s remaining chemical
weapons stockpiles.

After decades of atrocities committed by the Assad regime, we stand with
the people of Syria.

We denounce terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms. We are
hopeful that anyone seeking a role in governing Syria will demonstrate a
commitment to the rights of all Syrians, prevent the collapse of state
institutions, work on the recovery and rehabilitation of the country,
and ensure the conditions for safe and dignified voluntary return to
Syria of all those who were forced to flee the country.
