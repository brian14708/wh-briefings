title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Trip to\_Angola"
---
 
On the occasion of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s visit to Angola, we
celebrate the transformation and deepening of the U.S.-Angola
relationship.  This trip marks the first visit ever by a sitting U.S.
president to the Republic of Angola, and the first visit of a U.S.
president to sub-Saharan Africa since 2015.  
   
This visit comes on the heels of a meeting in November 2023, when
President Biden hosted President João Lourenço in the Oval Office in
Washington, D.C.  In the time before and since, U.S. and Angolan
counterparts have worked closely to advance both Presidents’ visions to
expand impactful high-standard economic opportunities and improve global
and regional security.  Together, the United States and Angola
acknowledge the past horrors of slavery and its legacy, while looking
forward to a bright future of continually deepening collaboration
between our nations.  Today, President Biden and President Lourenço will
meet in Luanda at the Presidential Palace to discuss trade, investment,
and infrastructure; security and stability; and deepening U.S.-Angolan
cooperation.  Tomorrow, President Biden will travel to Lobito, Angola
for a Summit on infrastructure investment in the region with leaders
from Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Tanzania, and
Zambia. Information on continuing and new U.S.-Angolan partnership
initiatives is provided below.  
   
**TRADE, INVESTMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND DEVELOPMENT**  
   
At the [U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit](https://www.state.gov/africasummit/)
in 2022, the United States committed to focus on partnership with Africa
through investment.  Advancing two-way trade and investment bolsters
participation in the global economy, accelerates sustainable
development, and scales innovation and entrepreneurship, resulting in
increased economic opportunity for citizens on both sides of the
Atlantic.  The United States and Angola are also working with other
partners through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
Investment (PGI) to enhance trans-continental connectivity from the
Atlantic to the Indian Oceans that enables additional commercial
investment.  Tomorrow, President Biden and President Lourenço will
co-host a multilateral Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor Summit to further
accelerate the development of this critical economic corridor.  

-   The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) is an important U.S.
    initiative to enhance trade with African countries, under which
    Angola has benefited from trade preferences since 2004 and leveraged
    the annual AGOA Forum to advance trade and economic ties with the
    United States.  In 2023, two-way U.S.-Angola trade totaled
    approximately $1.77 billion, making Angola the United States’ fourth
    largest trade partner in sub-Saharan Africa.   
-   In November 2024, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo
    signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Angola’s Ministry of
    Industry and Commerce establishing the U.S.-Angola Commercial and
    Investment Partnership.  This Partnership will formalize regular
    collaboration between the two governments and with U.S. and Angolan
    industry stakeholders to enhance commercial ties and increase the
    ease of doing business.  Separately, the U.S. Department of Commerce
    is developing a Sub-Saharan Africa Rail and Port Trade Mission to
    Angola and South Africa in 2025 to connect U.S. companies with
    opportunities to meet demand for U.S. rail and port solutions in
    African markets.  Members of the [President’s Advisory Council on
    Doing Business in
    Africa](https://www.trade.gov/presidents-advisory-council-doing-business-africa)
    (PAC-DBIA)—which advises the President, through the Secretary of
    Commerce, on ways to strengthen commercial engagement between the
    United States and African countries—also traveled to Angola to join
    President Biden for a portion of the trip.  
-   In February 2024, to support trade between the U.S. and Angolan
    agricultural sectors, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) led
    an Agribusiness Trade Mission to Angola.  The mission supported 140
    business-to-business meetings among sector leaders, with U.S.
    participants reporting $13.3 million in projected 12-month sales
    stemming from the trip.  
-   In October 2024, the United States and Angola signed an [Open Skies
    Agreement](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-and-angola-sign-open-skies-agreement/)
    to facilitate increased air connectivity and provide significant new
    opportunities for trade, tourism, and investment.  This follows a
    deal announced by Boeing and Angolan flag carrier TAAG in 2023 to
    purchase four new 787s, increasing TAAG’s capacity for long-haul
    flights.    
-   To facilitate U.S.-Angola bilateral commercial relations in sectors
    such as energy, manufacturing, equipment and machinery, and
    aerospace and defense, the United States is connecting U.S. and
    African businesses with new buyers, suppliers, and investment
    opportunities through the [Prosper
    Africa](https://www.prosperafrica.gov/) initiative.  Since January
    2021, U.S. departments and agencies in the Prosper Africa initiative
    have closed 12 business deals and investments in Angola with a
    combined value of $6.9 billion.  
-   Since 2022, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) has
    provided $2.9 billion in financing toward projects in Angola across
    the renewable energy, infrastructure, and telecom sectors.  For
    example, in May 2024, EXIM signed a final $363 million loan
    agreement for Acrow Bridge Corporation to install bridge
    infrastructure connecting rural communities across Angola in support
    of PGI. The projects financed in Angola support an estimated 6,200
    U.S.-based jobs.  In 2024 alone, EXIM has issued an additional $2.7
    billion in non-binding Letters of Interest across the agricultural,
    power, rail, health, education, and hospital sectors in Angola.  
-   For the past four years, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has
    closely supported Angola’s efforts to reduce its debt
    vulnerabilities through technical assistance.  The program has
    successfully enabled the Angolan government to reprofile its
    domestic debt and lower interest costs.  In December 2024, the U.S.
    Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide an
    additional $650,000 in technical assistance to support the Angola
    Ministry of Finance with debt and financial risk management.

**LEADING GLOBALLY AND REGIONALLY TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND PROMOTE
THRIVING SOCIETIES**  
  
Together the United States and Angola are enhancing the security,
safety, and well-being of their people by tackling shared challenges. 
In addition to traditional security challenges, increasingly, we face
also threats such as climate change, food insecurity, and disease that
do not recognize or respect national borders.  Together, we are enabling
more professional and accountable government actors that protect
civilians, safeguard natural resources, and build more resilient health
systems, and ensure no one is left behind.

-   In September 2023, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin became the
    first U.S. Secretary of Defense to visit Angola.  In June 2024, the
    U.S. Department of Defense hosted the inaugural Joint
    Angolan-American Defense Cooperation Committee (DEFCOM) at the
    Pentagon.  During DEFCOM, representatives signed an agreement to
    allow the exchange of logistics goods and services between our
    respective militaries, which facilitates cooperation as we continue
    to build our growing defense partnership.  Angola and the U.S.
    Department of Defense, with the Department of State as appropriate,
    are continuing to plan for cooperative work in the areas of
    engineering, medicine, cyber, peacekeeping, maritime security, and
    the development of a coast guard.  The next DEFCOM meeting is
    planned to be held in Angola in 2025.    
-   In September 2024, Angola agreed to join Department of Defense’s
    State Partnership Program (SPP) executed by the National Guard
    Bureau.  Through the SPP, Guard units work with partner militaries
    to bolster capabilities, improve interoperability, and enhance
    principles of responsible governance.  The SPP fosters long-term
    relationships across all levels of society and encourages the
    development of economic, political, and military ties between U.S.
    states and partner nations.  The National Guard Bureau is currently
    in the process of pairing Angola with a State National Guard that is
    well-aligned with Angola’s requirements.  
-   Since 2020, the United States has dedicated nearly $17 million
    toward training and professionalization for the Angolan military,
    including English language training, expanding women’s access to
    military education courses in the United States, and maritime
    security-focused training.  In just the past year, the U.S.
    increased annual International Military Education and Training
    assistance to Angola from $500,000 to $600,000.  The United States
    is also providing the Angolan Marines with eight rigid-hull
    inflatable boats and other critical equipment, with the final four
    boats scheduled to be delivered to Angola by the end of 2025.    
-   The United States has been proud to partner with Angola to address
    regional and global issues, and it remains a steadfast partner in
    navigating challenging and complex situations.  The United States is
    providing more than $1 billion in additional humanitarian funding
    which will assist countries across Sub-Saharan Africa, including
    Angola, to respond to humanitarian crises including displacement and
    El Nino-induced drought.  
-   The United States is supporting Angola’s development of a cyber
    security strategy through almost $1.4 million in projects providing
    training and mentorship to the future cybersecurity workforce and
    assisting the Angolan Ministry of Defense’s creation of a cyber
    defense capability.  
-   The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has initiated discussions
    with the Angolan Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Trade on a
    three-year, $5 million program to bolster the two countries’
    management, oversight, and accountability of their trade and travel
    sectors.  The program would focus on modernizing information
    sharing, allowing the governments to interdict threats and hazards
    at the earliest possible point, and mitigate and monitor threats
    from transnational criminal organizations and other malign non-state
    actors.  
-   Between 2019 and 2023, the Treasury Department provided technical
    assistance to help strengthen Angolan institutions’ ability to
    identify, detect, and prosecute money laundering, terrorist
    financing, and other crimes in support of Angola’s political and
    economic reforms.  USAID and the State Department are working with
    various Angolan institutions—including Parliament, the National
    Court of Accounts, and the Ministries of Health, Education and
    Finance—to build their public financial management, debt management,
    and anti-corruption capacity.  Capacity is also being built to
    support Angola’s implementation of the Extractive Industries
    Transparency Initiative standard.  
-   The United States and Angola are working together to combat timber
    trafficking through the creation of a National Forest Inventory, a
    critical tool for any country that seeks to conserve and manage its
    forest resources sustainably.  The State Department, through the
    Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs
    (INL), announced $750,000 in new programs in Angola to improve the
    identification, interdiction, and confiscation of illicit
    commodities.  USAID will add $1.3 million from fiscal year 2023
    Southern Africa regional Sustainable Landscapes resources to an
    existing partnership of $1.3 million to expand the partnership
    between the U.S. Forest Service and the Government of Angola’s
    Ministry of Agriculture and Forests to continue work on the forest
    inventory, establish a partnership for carbon market utilization,
    and develop a Forest Monitoring System.  
-   The State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration
    provides funding to support refugee assistance, as well as regional
    funding to UNHCR to support the nearly 56,000 refugees and asylum
    seekers in Angola.    
-   Angola is a founding member of the [Partnership for Atlantic
    Cooperation](https://www.state.gov/atlantic-cooperation/#:~:text=Recognizing%20the%20Atlantic%E2%80%99s%20importance%20to%20our%20lives%20and%20our),
    an initiative committed to the interconnected goals of advancing a
    peaceful, stable, prosperous, open, safe, and cooperative Atlantic
    as well as to conserving the Atlantic Ocean as a healthy,
    sustainable, and resilient resource for generations to come.  To
    develop Angola’s capacity for ocean science research and support for
    ocean-based food security, the United States is collaborating with
    the Atlantic community to leverage support for Angola’s ocean
    research vessel Baia Farta.  The United States and Angola have
    concluded a Letter of Intent to formalize collaboration, including,
    for example, on bringing U.S. experts to Angola to support ocean
    science capacity building and training through the Fulbright
    Specialist program.  In addition, the U.S. public-private
    partnership with OceanX will identify opportunities for Angolan
    early career scientists and youth to access ocean science research,
    foster a new generation of ocean advocates, and collaborate on
    initiatives with NGOs and philanthropies, including with OceanX
    aboard the research vessel OceanXplorer in early 2025.  
-   Through the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
    (PEPFAR), more than 25,000 people living with HIV in Angola are
    receiving life-saving treatment, building efforts to reduce
    mother-to-child HIV transmission.  Over the past two decades, the
    United States has invested nearly $251 million to provide HIV
    testing, prevention, care, and treatment services, and to strengthen
    public health systems through optimized laboratory services, quality
    data management, and supply chain security in Angola.  
-   Since 2006, USAID has provided nearly $415 million to address
    malaria through the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) in Angola. 
    In the past year, PMI distributed almost 5 million fast-acting
    malaria medicines and more than 9 million rapid diagnostic tests to
    clinics and communities to protect and treat Angolans.  More than
    12,000 Angolan health workers have been trained since 2023 to
    diagnose and treat malaria.  Angola experienced a 29 percent
    decrease in malaria deaths in PMI-focused provinces in 2023 compared
    with 2020 levels.  
-   USAID is in the process of re-establishing a bilateral Mission in
    Angola to continue expanding the presence of the United States in
    Angola and further strengthen our emerging strategic partnership.
       
-   The United States, in partnership with COVID-19 Vaccines Global
    Access (COVAX) and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT),
    [donated more than 11 million safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine
    doses](https://www.state.gov/covid-19-recovery/vaccine-deliveries/)
    to the people of Angola.  
-   The United States is proud to work with Angola on bolstering
    African-led solutions to current and future health emergencies.  In
    September 2024, the United States announced [$500
    million](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/24/fact-sheet-the-united-states-commitment-to-address-the-global-mpox-outbreak/)
    and one million mpox vaccine doses to support African countries to
    prevent and respond to the current mpox outbreak.  We are delivering
    on that commitment, with two thirds of the more than $500 million of
    support to mpox preparedness and response already available and at
    work supporting countries in the region.  All one million vaccine
    doses are currently available for allocation by WHO and Africa CDC
    based on needs and demand in the region.  Angola has joined the
    United States as a [Global Health
    Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/16/fact-sheet-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-releases-strategy-to-strengthen-global-health-security/)
    partner, which will foster greater collaboration as both countries
    strive to protect the health, lives, and economic well-being of our
    citizens and people throughout the world.  

**CELEBRATING THE U.S.-ANGOLA RELATIONSHIP**  
  
The United States and Angola are bound by enduring historical ties and
invigorated by our dynamic future.  We share a commitment to reckon with
the horrific history of the trans-Atlantic trade of enslaved people by
striving to reconnect cultures and celebrating collaboration between our
nations.  People are at the heart of this connection.  Today, there are
nearly 12 million Americans of Angolan descent.  These
relationships—rooted in family, friendship, and community—improve and
enrich our lives.  They drive our cooperation, underpin our shared
values, and elevate our aspirations.

-   In 1619, a vessel carrying enslaved Africans who had been captured
    in Angola and forcibly marched over one hundred miles along a route
    known as the Kwanza Corridor landed in present-day Hampton,
    Virginia.  As many as 6 million enslaved people were kidnapped from
    their homes and forced from Angolan shores.  We are committed to
    learning from the horrors endured by enslaved people and honor their
    descendants, who continue to fight for civil rights, justice, and
    freedom.  The United States supports Angola’s nomination of the
    [Kwanza Corridor](https://whc.unesco.org/fr/listesindicatives/6250/)
    to UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites as a way to look forward,
    to reconnect cultural ties, and to celebrate Angola’s richness and
    beauty.    
-   The United States is pleased to announce a grant of $229,000 to
    support restoration and conservation of the 1786 Álvaro de Carvalho
    Matoso Residence, Angola’s National Slavery Museum Building. 
    Founded in 1977, the Museum offers programming promoting a message
    of harmony, humanism, and respect for human rights.  The funds will
    go toward the restoration of the building’s exterior and interior
    galleries.  
-   The United States and Angola look forward to a future strengthened
    by people-to-people ties that reconnect cultures, promote dialogue,
    and encourage creative collaboration between our nations.  In August
    2024, the City of Hampton, Virginia, the Fort Monroe Authority, the
    U.S. National Park Service, and Project 1619, Inc. hosted the annual
    African Landing Day Commemoration at the future site planned to
    honor the lives of the enslaved Africans stolen from Angola and
    taken to modern-day Hampton.  In September 2024, Hampton and the
    City of Malanje in Angola signed a Sister City agreement, which will
    further enshrine the deep connections between our citizens.    
-   The United States and Angola share a commitment to enhancing
    dialogue with the African Diaspora.  President Biden established the
    [President’s Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement
    (PAC-ADE)](https://www.state.gov/african-diaspora/) in December
    2022.  PAC-ADE members discussed this historic visit to Angola with
    Assistant to the President, Senior Advisor to the President, and
    Director of the Office of Public Engagement Stephen Benjamin in
    October 2024.  PAC-ADE members also traveled to Angola to join
    President Biden for a portion of the trip.  
-   The United States supports Angola’s efforts to combat corruption,
    enhance accountability, and institutionalize the rule of law.  In
    October 2024, the United States and Angola agreed to schedule the
    next iteration of our bilateral human rights dialogue. We are
    collaborating on multiple human rights-focused initiatives.  These
    efforts require advancing democratic governance and respecting human
    rights, including the fundamental rights to freedoms of expression,
    press, association, peaceful assembly, and religion or belief.  The
    United States continues to support Angola’s commitment to reforms,
    including by amplifying civil society and faith-based organizations’
    roles in improving the quality of elections and local
    decision-making.  The State Department has provided $10.5 million
    since 2021 in support of these goals, and plans to continue
    providing such funding, subject to the availability of funds.    
-   The United States is moving forward with Angola to protect and
    improve democracy as the work of our time.  The State Department is
    building on its existing governance investments with an additional
    $700,000 for capacity building and specialized training to lawyers
    engaged in human rights defense and similar fields, to strengthen
    the efficiency and independence of the judicial system, and for the
    Angolan Ombudsperson’s office to increase engagement with citizens,
    supporting transparency and good governance.  In October 2024, the
    United States and Angola agreed to schedule the next iteration of
    our bilateral human rights dialogue.  
-   People-to-people ties are essential to the U.S.-Angola
    relationship.  Since 1968, more than 1,200 Angolans have
    participated in U.S. Government-sponsored educational and
    professional exchange programs, including the [Fulbright
    Program](https://ao.usembassy.gov/education-culture/fulbright-program/),
    the [International Visitor Leadership
    Program](https://exchanges.state.gov/non-us/program/international-visitor-leadership-program-ivlp),
    the [Mandela Washington
    Fellowship](https://www.mandelawashingtonfellowship.org/), and the
    [Pan-Africa Youth Leadership
    Program](https://ao.usembassy.gov/education-culture/educational-exchange/pan-africa-youth-leadership-program-paylp/),
    among others.  Through these programs, we are reconnecting cultures,
    promoting dialogue, and nurturing collaboration between our
    nations.  
-   In 2024, the United States is contributing almost $140,000 to expand
    English-language training through the English Access Scholarship
    Program (Access) and the Learning is Never Too Late program.  Access
    provides vocational English and 21st-century skills to 100
    participants ages 17 to 25 in Angola.  The Learning is Never Too
    Late program offers English and digital journalism instruction to 40
    girls in Luanda.  The U.S. Embassy in Luanda is also providing
    curriculum development training valued at $100,000 for English
    department faculty and conducting capacity building for English
    educators and university administrators.  
-   [EducationUSA](https://ao.usembassy.gov/education-culture/study-usa/?_ga=2.136481845.426526048.1727748544-1519749593.1714768664)
    offers advising services at the U.S. Embassy in Luanda to Angolan
    students interested in pursuing higher education opportunities in
    the United States.  University partnerships have strengthened
    capacity in higher education administration, fostered joint research
    efforts, created faculty exchanges, and developed new academic
    programs in STEM-related fields.  Notably, a collaboration between
    the University of California, Berkeley, and Agostinho Neto
    University has led to significant advancements in agricultural
    research, benefiting both institutions and their communities.    
-   In November 2023, Angola become the third African nation to sign the
    Artemis Accords, signaling its commitment to promoting the
    responsible use of space.  The United States and Angola will
    continue to work together to advance a common vision of space
    exploration for the benefit of all humankind.  
-   Since 2020, the U.S. Embassy in Angola has issued more than $490,000
    in grants to support initiatives that are important to the Angolan
    people.  These grants have funded programs in entrepreneurship,
    English language, journalism, music, and intellectual property
    rights.  By addressing these critical areas, the Embassy aims to
    empower individuals and strengthen communities throughout Angola.
