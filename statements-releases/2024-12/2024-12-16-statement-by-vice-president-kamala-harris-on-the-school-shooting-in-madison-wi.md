title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the School Shooting in Madison,\_\
  WI"
---
 
Over the weekend, our nation paused to remember the innocent children
and brave educators who were taken from us 12 years ago when someone
armed with a weapon of war walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in
Newtown, CT. Today, senseless gun violence has once again visited our
classrooms as students and teachers in Madison, WI had their last week
of school before Christmas break tragically interrupted by a deadly
shooting.  
   
Doug and I are mourning the student and teacher who were killed and we
are praying for all those who were injured, including those who remain
hospitalized. We are also thinking of the young people and families who
have had their lives forever changed by this act of gun violence. And we
are sending our gratitude to the educators, members of law enforcement,
first responders, and medical professionals who quickly and selflessly
jumped into action to ensure that even more lives were not lost in this
community.   
   
As we hold our loved ones closer this holiday season, we must resolve to
do everything in our power to end this epidemic that has become the
leading cause of death for kids throughout America. While we have made
necessary progress together over the last four years, including through
the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years and our
first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, there is more
work to be done to ensure that every person has the freedom to live safe
from the horror of gun violence. Congress and state legislatures must
make background checks universal, pass red flag and safe storage laws,
and ban assault weapons. These commonsense solutions will save lives and
make our children and communities safer.
