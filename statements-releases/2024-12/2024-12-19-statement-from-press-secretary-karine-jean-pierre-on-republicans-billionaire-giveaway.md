  Giveaway"

Republicans are doing the bidding of their billionaire benefactors at
the expense of hardworking Americans. Republicans are breaking their
word to support a bipartisan agreement that would lower prescription
drug costs and make it harder to offshore jobs to China—and instead
putting forward a bill that paves the way for tax breaks for
billionaires while cutting critical programs working families count on,
from Social Security to Head Start. President Biden supports the
bipartisan agreement to keep the government open, help communities
recovering from disasters, and lower costs—not this giveaway for
billionaires that Republicans are proposing at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour.
