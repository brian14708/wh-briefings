title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Nikki\_Giovanni"
---
 
Nikki Giovanni was a brilliant poet, a big-hearted educator, and an
unapologetic voice for justice and equality.

As a leading voice of the Black Arts Movement, she used her poetry to
celebrate Black joy and resilience – while also speaking out for racial
and social justice.

Nikki was committed to lifting up the next generation too. Over more
than three decades as an educator, she empowered her students to express
themselves through creative writing, mentoring hundreds of them along
the way.

Throughout her career, Nikki never stopped demanding, and fighting for,
an America that lives up to our highest ideals: of freedom, opportunity,
fairness, and dignity for all. She leaves behind a storied legacy — in
literature, education, and in the fight for a more just America.

Doug and I send our prayers to her family, and to all who were touched
by her work.
