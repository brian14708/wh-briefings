title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Republicans Threatening\
  \ a Government\_Shutdown"
---
 
Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement
or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across
the country. President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Vance
ordered Republicans to shut down the government and they are threatening
to do just thatâ€”while undermining communities recovering from disasters,
farmers and ranchers, and community health centers. Triggering a
damaging government shutdown would hurt families who are gathering to
meet with their loved ones and endanger the basic services Americans
from veterans to Social Security recipients rely on. A deal is a deal.
Republicans should keep their word.
