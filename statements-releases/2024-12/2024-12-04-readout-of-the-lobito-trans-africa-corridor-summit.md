Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Angolan President João
Lourenço co-hosted African leaders from the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Zambia, and Tanzania, as well as private sector CEOs,
U.S. development and finance institutions, and the Africa Finance
Corporation, to celebrate and highlight progress on the development of
the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor and the partnership of the Lobito
Corridor consortium. President Biden praised the progress made on the
Corridor since its launch under the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) at the 2023 G7 Summit, and today
announced more than $560 million in new funding, including commitments
expected to generate at least $200 million in additional private sector
capital, for infrastructure projects along the Corridor, bringing the
total for U.S. investments to more than $4 billion. The Leaders
discussed the transformative impact the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor has
had on enhancing access to the critical minerals needed for the clean
energy transition and digital connectivity, strengthening food security,
boosting regional trade, and empowering communities all along the
Corridor. To date, the United States regional development banks, and
international partners have mobilized over $6 billion in high-standard,
public and private investments along the Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor.
