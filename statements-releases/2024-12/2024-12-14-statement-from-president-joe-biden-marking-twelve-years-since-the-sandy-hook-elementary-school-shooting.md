title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Marking Twelve Years Since the Sandy Hook\
  \ Elementary School\_Shooting"
---
 
Twelve years ago today, the community of Newtown, Connecticut, and the
entire nation were forever changed when twenty innocent children and six
brave educators were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School by a
single individual armed with a weapon of war. Jill and I still grieve
this unimaginable loss and continue to pray for the victims’ families
and others traumatized by this senseless violence.   
   
Many individuals impacted by the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary
School have turned their pain into purpose. Some families established
foundations to carry on their loved ones’ memories—others chose to use
their voices to fight for commonsense gun safety reform, hold the gun
industry accountable with groundbreaking litigation, and fight back
against those who spread misinformation and further victimize those
impacted by gun violence. The elementary school children who survived
the shooting are now young adults and many of them have also joined the
effort to reduce gun violence and save lives.  
   
The legacy of this tragedy is one of great loss—but also hope. Twelve
years ago, moms sitting at their kitchen counters went online, expressed
their outrage, and organized for commonsense gun safety legislation.
Congresswoman Gabby Giffords decided enough was enough and started her
own effort to combat gun violence. Gun violence prevention organizations
that had been invested in the cause for decades reemerged with renewed
strength. Today’s gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever
before because of survivors and other Americans who saw the Sandy Hook
shooting and said “enough.”  
   
With the strength of this emboldened movement by our side, we have made
historic progress to reduce gun violence over the past four years. I
signed into law the most significant piece of gun safety legislation in
nearly 30 years. I announced dozens of executive actions to keep guns
out of dangerous hands and get especially dangerous weapons off our
streets. I established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris, to accelerate this work.
After four years under my administration, homicides are down, crime is
falling, and we are seeing fewer mass shootings. This progress is no
accident.   
   
Still, more must be done. Congress has an obligation to ‘do something’
in order to protect our children and communities from this scourge of
gun violence. We are the only nation experiencing this epidemic and
there are common sense policies that the majority of Americans agree
with and that Congress can easily take action on. We need universal
background checks, red flag laws, safe storage requirements, and a ban
on assault weapons like the one used at Sandy Hook. I remain hopeful
that we will continue to make progress on these priorities. This hope is
rooted in the history of what we have accomplished already and the
strength of all the survivors of gun violence that I have had the
privilege of working with during my career.
