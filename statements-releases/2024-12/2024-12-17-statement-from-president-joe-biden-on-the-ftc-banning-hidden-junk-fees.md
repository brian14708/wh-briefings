title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the FTC Banning Hidden Junk\_Fees"
---
 
I’ve always put families and hardworking Americans first. That’s why I
called on my Administration to do everything we can to lower costs.
Today, the Federal Trade Commission is doing just that by banning hidden
junk fees when you book a hotel or purchase event tickets. We all know
the experience of encountering a hidden fee at the very last stage of
check out—these junk fees sneak onto your bill and companies end up
making you pay more because they can. Those fees add up, taking real
money out of the pockets of Americans.

Today’s announcement builds on work across my Administration to ban junk
fees and lower costs—saving many families hundreds of dollars each year.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau lowered overdraft and credit
card late fees, the Department of Transportation proposed a ban on
family seating fees and required upfront disclosure of baggage and
change fees, and the Federal Communications Commission ensured consumers
see upfront the full price and terms for their internet service.
Wherever big corporations try to sneak fees onto bills, my
Administration has been fighting on behalf of American families to ban
them.
