TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:  
   
   
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to
ratification, I transmit herewith the Agreement under the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use
of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction
(the “Agreement”).  I also transmit, for the information of the Senate,
the report of the Department of State with respect to the Agreement.  
  
    The purpose of the Agreement is to ensure the conservation and
sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national
jurisdiction (ABNJ), often referred to as the high seas, which are under
threat from a multitude of stressors.  The high seas includes ocean
areas beyond countries’ 200-mile exclusive economic zones and covers
about two-thirds of the global ocean.  
  
     The Agreement will create a mechanism to establish marine protected
areas in ABNJ, a vital step in the global effort to conserve or protect
at least 30 percent of the global ocean by 2030.  It will create a
system for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of
marine genetic resources from ABNJ.  The Agreement also includes
provisions ensuring that Parties conduct rigorous environmental impact
assessments for their activities in ABNJ and provisions on
capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology related to the
Agreement.  The Agreement is key to supporting the sustainable use of
marine resources, maintaining the integrity of ocean ecosystems, and
conserving marine biological diversity.  Implementation of the Agreement
will respect the competences of and not undermine other international
bodies and will require consultations with those organizations to
enhance cooperation and coordination on the conservation and sustainable
use of the marine resources of the high seas.  
  
     I believe joining the Agreement to be fully in the interest of the
United States.  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable
consideration to the Agreement and give its advice and consent to
ratification.
