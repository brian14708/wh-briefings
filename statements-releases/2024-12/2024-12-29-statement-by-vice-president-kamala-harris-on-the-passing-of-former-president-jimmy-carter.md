title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Former President\
  \ Jimmy\_Carter"
---
 
President Jimmy Carter was guided by a deep and abiding faith — in
God, in America, and in humanity.   
   
Jimmy Carter’s life is a testament to the power of service — as a
Lieutenant in the United States Navy, the 76th Governor of Georgia, and
the 39th President of the United States. He reminded our nation and the
world that there is strength in decency and compassion.  
   
As President, he protected our air and water, promoted transparency in
government, and brokered an historic peace treaty between Egypt and
Israel at Camp David.    
   
Throughout his life, President Carter was strengthened by the love and
support of his partner of 77 years, First Lady Rosalynn Carter, whose
life President Biden and I had the opportunity to celebrate in Georgia
last year. After leaving office, President Carter continued his fight
for peace, democracy, and human dignity through the Carter Center.  
   
I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will always
remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy
continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come. Our world
is a better place because of President Carter.  
   
Doug and I send our love and prayers to the Carter family.
