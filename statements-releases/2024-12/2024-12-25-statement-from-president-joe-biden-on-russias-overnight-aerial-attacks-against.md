title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Russia\u2019s Overnight Aerial Attacks\_\
  against"
---
 
In the early hours of Christmas, Russia launched waves of missiles and
drones against Ukrainian cities and critical energy infrastructure. The
purpose of this outrageous attack was to cut off the Ukrainian people’s
access to heat and electricity during winter and to jeopardize the
safety of its grid. Let me be clear: the Ukrainian people deserve to
live in peace and safety, and the United States and the international
community must continue to stand with Ukraine until it triumphs over
Russia’s aggression. In recent months, the United States has provided
Ukraine with hundreds of air defense missiles, and more are on the way.
I have directed the Department of Defense to continue its surge of
weapons deliveries to Ukraine, and the United States will continue to
work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in its defense against
Russian forces.
