  \ the Federal Government to Catalyze Clean Energy Jobs and Cut Costs and\_Pollution"
---
 
*Three years in, President Biden’s executive order has catalyzed global
markets and put the U.S. Government on track to meet his ambitious
sustainability goals and save taxpayers money*

When President Biden entered office, he pledged to restore America’s
climate leadership and charged the Federal Government to deliver on that
promise. He recognized that as the single largest land owner, energy
consumer, and employer in the nation, and the largest purchaser on
Earth, the Federal Government can catalyze private sector investment and
expand the economy and American industry. The Biden-Harris
Administration has transformed how we build, buy, and manage
electricity, vehicles, buildings, infrastructure projects, and other
operations to be clean and sustainable, while creating good clean energy
jobs, supporting American manufacturing, and saving taxpayers money by
cutting energy and operating costs.  
   
The President’s [*Executive Order (E.O.)
14057*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/08/executive-order-on-catalyzing-clean-energy-industries-and-jobs-through-federal-sustainability/)
*on Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal
Sustainability* and the accompanying [Federal Sustainability
Plan](https://www.sustainability.gov/federalsustainabilityplan/index.html)
directs the U.S. Government to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions by 2050 while boosting domestic manufacturing, supporting
clean energy industries, creating high-paying union jobs, and cutting
energy costs. As part of the President’s Investing in America agenda,
the U.S. government has invested over $12 billion and launched thousands
of projects to transition to electric vehicles, clean construction
materials, and energy-efficient buildings powered by 100% clean
electricity.  
   
The President’s actions have created a bold new playbook to turn the
climate crisis into economic opportunity. Just three years after
President Biden signed E.O. 14057, GHG emissions from Federal operations
are down 38% from 2008 levels. This puts the U.S. Government over
halfway to the President’s goal of a 65% emissions reduction from
Federal operations by 2030.  
   
Take a look at the Biden-Harris Administration’s Federal sustainability
progress by the numbers:  
 

-   Ordered nearly 82,000 zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs) for the Federal
    fleet and installed 10,500 charging ports at Federal facilities
    nationwide, with an additional 52,500 charging ports in progress;  
-   Supported the U.S. Postal Service’s commitment to acquire 100%
    electric delivery trucks by 2026 – the first of which have already
    started to roll through neighborhoods – by leveraging an investment
    of $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act;  
-   Developed a clean electricity procurement pipeline with energy
    suppliers across 36 states that would move the Federal Government
    from its current 40% clean electricity match to 70% by 2027, on its
    way to 100% by 2030;  
-   Generated over $8 billion in private sector funding to launch
    thousands of modernization projects that will deliver energy-
    efficient, climate resilient, and all-electric Federal buildings,
    including at least 2,700 net-zero emissions buildings that are
    complete or underway today;  
-   Catalyzed America’s clean manufacturing industry by deploying nearly
    $4.5 billion in Inflation Reduction Act funding to use American-made
    low-carbon steel, concrete, asphalt, and glass in Federal
    infrastructure projects;  
-   Released the first comprehensive measurement of the Federal Scope 3
    GHG footprint, launched a Federal supplier climate scorecard, and
    took additional actions that put the Federal Government on track to
    cut its Scope 3 emissions by 30% by 2030;  
-   Established the Federal Government’s first-ever goal to phase-out
    Federal procurement of single-use plastics from food service
    operations, events, and packaging by 2027, and from all Federal
    operations by 2035;  
-   Directed the nation’s two million Federal employees to prioritize
    the use of sustainable transportation, including electric vehicles
    (EVs), for business travel;  
-   Rallied other countries to accelerate their climate ambition by
    launching the U.S.-led Net-Zero Government Initiative, under which
    the United States and 33 partner countries have committed to achieve
    net-zero emissions from national government operations by 2050 and
    to publish roadmaps for reaching this goal; and  
-   Powering the White House complex with carbon-free electricity that
    will account for 95% of its total usage and installed new EV
    charging infrastructure to power its vehicle fleet, which will soon
    include electric vehicles. White House buildings have also been
    upgraded to reduce energy use and costs.

President Biden has taken the most significant and comprehensive actions
ever to set the Federal Government on a course toward a cleaner, more
efficient, and resilient future – establishing a historic legacy with
benefits that will continue to be felt for years to come. With broad
support from America’s manufacturers, clean energy developers, labor
organizations, business leaders, states, and communities, the Federal
Government’s 300,000 buildings, 600,000 vehicles, and $750 billion in
annual procurement power will continue to be more sustainable and
resilient while supporting good jobs, cutting costs, and saving
taxpayers money.  
   
**Delivering on President Biden’s** **Federal Sustainability Plan**  
   
**Electrifying the Federal Fleet:** With more than 600,000 cars and
trucks, the Federal Government is the largest vehicle fleet owner in the
world. Transitioning this fleet to ZEVs is a core focus of President
Biden’s Federal Sustainability Plan, which targets 100% ZEV acquisitions
by 2035, including 100% light-duty acquisitions by 2027. At the start of
the Administration, the Federal fleet included fewer than 2,000 ZEVs.
Since President Biden took office, the Federal Government has ordered
nearly 82,000 electric vehicles and installed 10,500 EV charging ports
at Federal facilities, with an additional 52,500 ports in progress.  
  
New, American-made electric United States Postal Service (USPS) delivery
trucks are also beginning to roll through neighborhoods. USPS, which
maintains over 200,000 vehicles, has committed that [all Next Generation
Delivery Vehicles in 2026 and thereafter will be electric
vehicles](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2022/1220-usps-intends-to-deploy-over-66000-electric-vehicles-by-2028.htm).
As part of that transition, the Postal Service [is
equipping](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2024/0122-usps-unveils-first-postal-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-and-electric-delivery-vehicles.htm)
hundreds of its sorting and delivery centers with electric vehicle
charging stations.  
   
**Advancing Carbon-Free Electricity:** Federal agencies have moved
expeditiously to meet President Biden’s charge of powering all Federal
operations with 100% carbon pollution-free electricity (CFE) by 2030,
including 50% on a 24/7 basis, by taking a new approach to procuring
electricity. Through engagement with energy suppliers across 36 states,
the Biden-Harris Administration developed a clean electricity
procurement pipeline that would move the Federal Government from its
current 40% clean electricity match to 70% by 2027 on its way to 100% by
2030.  
   
The General Services Administration (GSA) made history by executing the
first-ever whole-of-government approach to procuring CFE clean
electricity. GSA also executed the Federal Government’s [first-ever
contract for locally-supplied
CFE](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/bidenharris-administration-announces-us-governments-first-initiative-with-a-utility-to-work-toward-247-carbon-pollutionfree-electricity-11152022)
delivered on a 24/7 hourly basis in Arkansas. Utilities have responded
enthusiastically to GSA’s new approach, entering agreements to power
Federal facilities in 24 states and the District of Columbia with 100%
CFE by 2030.  
  
Under this Administration, the Department of Defense (DOD) also executed
the government’s [first “sleeved” power purchase
agreement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3810465/dod-announces-two-solar-projects-to-supply-five-military-installations-in-north/),
which will power five military installations in North and South Carolina
with over 135 megawatts (MW) of newly built solar power; and cut the
ribbon on the [Edwards Air Force Base Solar
Array](https://www.edwards.af.mil/News/Article/3289170/largest-private-public-collaboration-in-department-of-defense-history-reflects/),
one of the world’s largest solar and battery storage projects, spanning
more than 4,000 acres of public and private property lands. DOD also
demonstrated leadership in engaging with the market on potential nuclear
power from next generation
[microreactors](https://www.eielson.af.mil/microreactor/) and small
[modular](https://www.ans.org/news/article-6466/us-navy-soliciting-ideas-for-nuclear-energy/)
reactors (SMRs). The Department of Energy has entered into realty
agreements to develop 14,000 acres of DOE land for 1,550 MWs of new CFE
generation through its Clean Up to Clean Energy Initiative. In total,
the Federal Government has leveraged federal properties to site CFE
projects equivalent to approximately 10% of all USG electricity
consumption, or 5 terawatt hours annually.  
   
The Federal Government has also engaged in energy regulatory processes
in a new way, working with Entergy Arkansas to design a
first-of-its-kind 24/7 hourly matched CFE tariff, and intervening as a
large customer in integrated resource planning processes in Georgia,
North Carolina, and Tennessee to achieve greater affordability,
resilience and reductions to emissions.   
   
**Reducing Building Emissions:** The Federal Government has paved the
way toward cost effective, super-efficient, all-electric buildings, with
the goal of achieving a net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045,
including a 50% emissions reduction by 2032. Today, projects are
complete or underway to bring 2,700 Federal buildings to net-zero
emissions, covering over 40 million square feet, which puts the U.S.
Government on track to achieve the goal set by the first-ever [Federal
Building Performance
Standard](https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/federal-building-performance-standard.pdf).
These leading-edge projects are energy efficient, climate resilient,
all-electric, and better positioned to deliver on agencies’ missions.  
   
Federal building emissions have been reduced by 39% since 2008, and 8%
of reductions were delivered over the past 4 years, far outpacing
historic trends. Energy savings from this Administration are comparable
to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of over 300,000 homes. Further,
agencies have built a strong pipeline of projects that will continue to
deliver savings in years to come.  
   
Investments in Federal buildings leveraged over $8 billion in private
sector funding through performance contracting to launch thousands of
modernization projects that will deliver energy- efficient, climate
resilient, and all-electric Federal buildings. They also are expected to
cut annual utility costs by over $175 million annually and create over
80,000 jobs.  
   
The Administration has proven net-zero emissions buildings are cost
effective through showcase projects at the [Ronald Reagan Building and
International Trade
Center](https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2023/06/21/gsa-makes-electrifying-move-at-ronald-reagan-building-and-international-trade-center),
the largest building in Washington, D.C., which is now 100% electric;
[Fort Hunter
Liggett](https://www.army.mil/article/247052/microgrid_to_generate_net_zero_for_fort_hunter_liggett),
the first U.S. Army base to achieve net-zero energy designation; and the
[Oklahoma City Federal
Building](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-administrator-cuts-ribbon-on-gridinteractive-05112023),
which cut energy costs and is pioneering power grid resilience
strategies.  
   
**Building Sustainable Supply Chains:** The Biden-Harris Administration
has shown how the Federal Government, as the single largest purchaser in
the world, can lead by example to reduce harmful emissions and catalyze
climate action across its thousands of suppliers. Last month, the
Administration released the first comprehensive measurement of
the [Federal Government’s Scope 3 emissions
footprint](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2024/11/21/at-cop29-biden-harris-administration-highlights-actions-to-cut-u-s-government-emissions-lead-on-federal-sustainability/),
including the emissions associated with the $730 billion of goods and
services that the government purchases annually. The Administration also
released a [Federal supplier climate
scorecard](https://www.sustainability.gov/federalsustainabilityplan/federal-scope-3-emissions.html)
that tracks the Federal Government’s top 200 suppliers’ progress toward
addressing their climate risks.  
  
To help Federal suppliers reduce their carbon footprints, the
Administration launched a new
[webpage](https://www.sustainability.gov/federalsustainabilityplan/supplier-accelerator.html)
that connects suppliers with Federal programs, tools, and information
that they can use to accelerate their decarbonization efforts. To
further curb emissions, the Administration directed the Federal
Government’s two million Federal employees to [prioritize the use of
sustainable
transportation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/14/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-action-to-accelerate-americas-clean-transportation-future/),
including electric vehicles, for official and local travel. Together,
these actions are expected to cut Federal Scope 3 emissions by 30% by
2030 – the equivalent of 40 million metric tons of **CO2 emissions
(MTCO2e)** annually.  
  
To further advance a more sustainable supply chain, the Biden-Harris
Administration [established the first-ever goal to phase out procurement
of single-use plastic
products](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-new-strategy-to-tackle-plastic-pollution-takes-action-to-reduce-single-use-plastics-in-federal-operations/)
from all Federal operations by 2035, and directed agencies for the first
time to prioritize the purchase of sustainable products without added
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  
   
**Buying Clean:** The Biden-Harris Administration has delivered on the
President’s charge to “buy clean” by using American-made low-carbon
steel, concrete, asphalt, and glass in Federal infrastructure projects.
The Administration’s landmark [Federal Buy Clean
Initiative](https://www.sustainability.gov/buyclean/) leverages the sway
of the U.S. government, as the largest purchaser on Earth, to spur
demand for clean American manufacturing of materials that form the
bedrock of our economy.  
   
Since 2023, GSA has incorporated Buy Clean requirements in the
construction specifications for more than [150 Federal building and
infrastructure
projects](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/bidenharris-administration-announces-2-billion-for-cleaner-construction-projects-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-spur-american-innovation-and-create-goodpaying-jobs-as-part-of-investing-in-america-agenda-11062023).
Manufacturers have responded by [publishing over 17,000 new
environmental product declarations
(EPDs)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-celebrates-twoyear-anniversary-of-inflation-reduction-act-08142024)
for low-carbon construction materials, demonstrating that industry is
reacting to market demand for materials made with lower emissions. The
150 GSA-led projects are expected to support an estimated 6,000 jobs per
year across the U.S. during construction and generate $2.7 billion in
GDP. A complementary EPA [grant
program](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-160-million-grants-support-clean-us)
awarded $160 million from the Inflation Reduction Act to help
manufacturers develop and verify additional EPDs.  
  
The Department of Transportation (DOT) has [awarded $1.2 billion in
grants](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/investing-america-usdot-awards-1-billion-grants-help-state-departments-transportation)
to 39 State Departments of Transportation to purchase American-made
low-carbon construction materials. DOT anticipates awarding an
additional [$800 million in Inflation Reduction Act
funds](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/fhwa-opens-applications-800-million-funding-reduce-climate-pollution-transportation)
to cities, metropolitan planning organizations, Tribal governments and
other Federal, State and local agencies in the coming weeks.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has also partnered with state
governments to accelerate action. The [Federal-State Buy Clean
Partnership](https://www.sustainability.gov/buyclean/index.html#aboutpartnership)
includes 13 states that have committed to prioritizing the procurement
of low-carbon infrastructure materials in state-funded projects, and to
collaborate with the Federal Government and one another to send a
harmonized demand signal to the marketplace.  
   
**Advancing Climate Adaptation and Resilience:** When President Biden
took office, he prioritized the revitalization of Federal agencies’
climate adaptation and resilience planning efforts. Today, [24 Federal
agencies have adopted adaptation and resilience
plans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-agency-climate-adaptation-plans-demonstrates-leadership-in-building-climate-resilience/)
that address their most significant climate risks and vulnerabilities
from [2024 to
2027](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-agency-climate-adaptation-plans-demonstrates-leadership-in-building-climate-resilience/)
and outline the steps they are taking to strengthen their facilities’,
employees’, resources’, and operations’ resilience to climate change
impacts. For the first time, agencies have identified senior resilience
leaders and created new accountability structures that integrate
adaptation and resilience throughout their missions while also meeting
the resilience requirements for the Disaster Resiliency Planning Act, as
well as best practices for advancing climate-smart infrastructure.
Agencies have also adopted common indicators to assess their progress
towards identifying and addressing the risks that climate change poses
to them and the people and communities they serve.  
   
**Partnering for a Broader Impact:** The Biden-Harris Administration has
prioritized partnering with other state, local, and international
governments to accelerate sustainability initiatives at every level. The
[Greening Government
Initiative](https://www.sustainability.gov/ggi/index.html) (GGI), which
the United States launched in 2021, is a first-of-its-kind initiative
that enables over 60 member countries to exchange information, promote
innovation, and share best practices to support global efforts to green
national government operations and meet their commitments under the
Paris Agreement.  
  
Building on GGI’s success, in 2022 the U.S. launched the [Net-Zero
Government
Initiative](https://www.sustainability.gov/federalsustainabilityplan/net-zero-initiative.html)
(NZGI) to increase countries’ ambition to green their national
government operations. NZGI countries commit to achieving net-zero
emissions from national government operations by 2050, and hold
themselves accountable by publishing roadmaps that establish long-term
and interim targets and plans. To date, 34 countries have joined this
initiative.  
  
Most recently, the U.S. launched the [Government Scope 3
Alliance](https://www.sustainability.gov/federalsustainabilityplan/global-initiatives.html),
a first-of-its-kind international alliance to reduce Scope 3 emissions
from the public sector, whose members commit to set Scope 3 emissions
reduction targets for their government operations and to report on their
progress.  
   
**Climate Smart White House:** Leading by example, the Administration
has worked to secure clean electricity that will power 95% of White
House complex operations, including its facilities, vehicle fleets and
new EV charging infrastructure. These climate smart improvements
increase resilience and energy efficiency across multiple buildings that
make up the Executive Office of the President campus, saving taxpayer
dollars through lower utility bills and operating costs.  
   
**Fostering a Climate-Focused Workforce and Advancing Environmental
Justice and Equity:** The Biden-Harris Administration launched multiple
programs for Federal employees to enhance their sustainability and
climate literacy and learn about the critical role they play in shifting
to more sustainable and resilient operations. This included a
[sustainability speaker
series](https://www.sustainability.gov/sustainability-series.html)
featuring climate change experts Al Roker, Bill Nye, and Kathryn Hayhoe,
along with launching a first-of-its-kind climate adaptation training
that has supported 1,500 Federal program acquisition managers with
preparing for and managing climate risks. The Administration also
established a [Presidential Federal Sustainability Awards
program](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2024/06/25/biden-harris-administration-honors-presidential-federal-sustainability-award-winners/)
to recognize federal agencies and employees who have tackled complex
challenges and delivered results for a cleaner, more efficient Federal
Government.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has delivered on President Biden’s
commitment to not only advance sustainability and resilience within the
Federal Government, but to do so in ways that advance environmental
justice and equity. For the first time ever, Federal agencies are
required to link climate adaptation and sustainability planning efforts
with advancing environmental justice and the [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
which seeks to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain
Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are
marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. The
Administration also issued a [final rule
promoting](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-finalizes-sustainable-and-equitable-siting-rul-04222024)
sustainability, equity, and community engagement in decisions on where
federal facilities are located. As part of President Biden’s Investing
in America agenda, the General Services Administration [announced $23.8
million](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/general-services-administration-announces-238-million-for-projects-to-improve-federal-facilities-and-benefit-local-communities-as-part-of-president-bidens-investing-in-america-agenda-04102024)
for 13 projects at federal buildings across 10 states through GSA’s Good
Neighbor Program. The 13 federal building improvement project sites were
selected for their opportunity to make a positive impact on local
communities.
