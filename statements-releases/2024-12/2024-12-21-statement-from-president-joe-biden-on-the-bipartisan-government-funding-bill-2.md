title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Bipartisan Government Funding\_\
  Bill"
---
 
The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open and
delivers the urgently needed disaster relief that I requested for
recovering communities as well as the funds needed to rebuild the
Francis Scott Key Bridge. 

This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got
everything it wanted. But it rejects the accelerated pathway to a tax
cut for billionaires that Republicans sought, and it ensures the
government can continue to operate at full capacity.

That’s good news for the American people, especially as families gather
to celebrate this holiday season.
