  \ of Former President Jimmy\_Carter"

Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman,
and humanitarian.

Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear
friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that
millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him
thought of him as a dear friend as well.  

With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease,
forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and
fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least
among us. He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across
the globe.

He was a man of great character and courage, hope and optimism. We will
always cherish seeing him and Rosalynn together. The love shared between
Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter is the definition of partnership and their
humble leadership is the definition of patriotism.

We will miss them both dearly, but take solace knowing they are reunited
once again and will remain forever in our hearts.

To the entire Carter family, we send our gratitude for sharing them with
America and the world. To their staff – from the earliest days to the
final ones – we have no doubt that you will continue to do the good
works that carry on their legacy.

And to all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search
of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life –
study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility. He showed
that we are great nation because we are a good people – decent and
honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.

To honor a great American, I will be ordering an official state funeral
to be held in Washington D.C. for James Earl Carter, Jr.,
39<sup>th</sup> President of the United States, 76<sup>th</sup> Governor
of Georgia, Lieutenant of the United States Navy, graduate of the United
States Naval Academy, and favorite son of Plains, Georgia, who gave his
full life in service to God and country.
