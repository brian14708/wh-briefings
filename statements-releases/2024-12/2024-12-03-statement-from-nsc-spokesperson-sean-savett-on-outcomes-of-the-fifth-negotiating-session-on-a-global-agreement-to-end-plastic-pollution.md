title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Sean Savett on Outcomes of the Fifth Negotiating\
  \ Session on a Global Agreement to End Plastic\_Pollution"
---
 
The United States is disappointed in the lack of a legally binding
international agreement fit to meet the moment on addressing plastic
pollution at the INC-5 and we are resolved to make more progress in the
next stages of this negotiation. While the global movement to reign in
the urgent threats of plastic waste in the environment has gained
tremendous momentum, a small group of countries and producers stood in
the way of progress to protect their profits and perpetuate an
inadequate status quo. The United States spearheaded an ambitious
approach in Busan, reflected in our own domestic efforts, and we
continue to back a global framework that supports private investment,
good jobs, and our environment.
