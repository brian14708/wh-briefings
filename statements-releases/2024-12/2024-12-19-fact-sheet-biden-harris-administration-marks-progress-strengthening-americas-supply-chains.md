title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Marks Progress Strengthening\
  \ America\u2019s Supply\_Chains"
---
 
Upon taking office in 2021, President Biden and his Administration
immediately got to work addressing the shocks that were roiling global
supply chains and moved swiftly to secure key industries for America’s
economy and national security. Everything in our lives—the food we eat,
the medicines in our hospitals, the energy that powers our homes, the
computer chips in our devices—relies on supply chains, and the
disruptions sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine
showed what happens when they are neglected for decades.

Four years later, America’s supply chains are stronger and more
resilient. Working hand in hand with industry and all stakeholders, this
Administration has cleared bottlenecks, increased investments in
critical sectors, and shored up the transportation sector that move the
goods that Americans rely on. Ocean shipping prices have fallen more
than 70 percent from their peak, and today fewer than 20 containerships
are waiting to dock at U.S. ports, compared to over 150 backed up during
the peak of congestion. **That progress has made supply chains more
reliable for businesses and lowered inflation for the goods that
families buy every day.**

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing the first-ever
[Quadrennial Supply Chain
Review](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20212024-Quadrennial-Supply-Chain-Review.pdf),
a formal assessment of four years of strengthening America’s critical
supply chains, and announcing additional actions to support American
businesses and consumers.

**<u>Progress to Date</u>**

The [Quadrennial Supply Chain
Review](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20212024-Quadrennial-Supply-Chain-Review.pdf)
assesses the progress made over the past four years to bolster the
resilience of our most critical supply chains. This strategic approach
has included:

-   **Responding to disruption**. The Administration quickly set to work
    to develop new government tools and capacity to respond to
    disruptions, both active ones when it took office, and new ones that
    have occurred since. The President’s Supply Chain Disruptions Task
    Force (SCDTF) has effectively coordinated federal authorities and
    resources and also established a process to work with state and
    local authorities and the private sector in real time. This work has
    helped improved the flow of goods into and around the United States
    during disruptions—getting products critical to American families
    moving again through ports and to shelves.

<!-- -->

-   **Investing in infrastructure and manufacturing and lowering
    costs.** Over the past four years, the Biden-Harris Administration
    has taken a made historic investments to strengthen our industrial
    bases and lower costs. U.S. Government investment has helped
    catalyze over $1 trillion in private-sector announced investments
    since January 2021. These investments are supporting the
    construction of new factories and creating manufacturing jobs across
    the country.
-   **Responding to non-market policies and practices.** On a level
    playing field, American businesses and workers can compete and win.
    However, our strategic competitors are continuing to engage in
    non-market policies and practices (NMPP) that undercut our
    collective resilience—directing their systems to target key
    industries for dominance by using excessive state subsidies and
    other forms of state support to dominate critical industries. As
    part of the Quadrennial Supply Chain Review process, the
    Biden-Harris Administration has developed a strategy to address
    NMPP, recognizing the need for early, comprehensive action to
    prevent harm to U.S. workers and industry, as well as modernized
    trade authorities that account for NMPP’s continued effects on
    global supply chains. This work has included raising tariffs on a
    select number of key sectors to safeguard U.S. supply chains in the
    face of unfair competition. These tariff modifications will protect
    historic domestic investments under BIL, the CHIPS and Science Act,
    and the Inflation Reduction Act, while also shielding American
    businesses and workers from unfair trade practices.

The Review builds on comprehensive efforts undertaken by the
Administration over the last four years, including President Biden’s
2021 [Executive Order on America’s Supply
Chains](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/)
(E.O. 14017), which directed [rapid supply chain
assessments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf)
for four critical products in the first 100 days of the Administration,
a [one-year
review](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Capstone-Report-Biden.pdf)
of six key supply chains in 2022, and the [establishment of the White
House Council on Supply Chain
Resilience](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-strengthen-americas-supply-chains-lower-costs-for-families-and-secure-key-sectors/)
to support the enduring resilience of America’s critical supply chains
in 2023.

**<u>Additional Actions to Strengthen Supply Chains</u>**

Continuing to strengthen supply chains over the next four years—and
beyond—will require the United States to deliver on historic domestic
investments, maintain and strengthen international partnerships, harness
innovation to tackle 21st-century challenges, and mobilize and
facilitate ongoing private investment and public-private partnerships.
The work of the last four years has laid a strong foundation for the
United States to continue safeguarding the enduring resilience of our
supply chains for years to come, including for emerging industries of
the future.

Below are additional steps the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to
strengthen supply chains, including for energy, critical minerals,
agricultural commodities and food products, medical products,
information and communications technology, transportation, and defense.

**Energy**

-   **Announcing up to $6 billion in incentives to strengthen U.S.
    energy supply chains.** Over the coming weeks, the IRS, supported by
    the Department of Energy’s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply
    Chains (MESC), is set to announce up to $6 billion in additional tax
    credits to strengthen U.S. energy supply chains through the
    Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program. This builds
    on the first round of [$4 billion in announced tax
    credits](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-4-billion-tax-credits-build-clean-energy-supply)
    for over 100 projects in 35 states to accelerate domestic clean
    energy manufacturing and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at
    industrial facilities. This also builds on over $12 billion of
    investment from the DOE MESC Office in domestic manufacturing
    capacity to strengthen the U.S. energy supply chains.
-   **Improving risk mitigation across the energy supply chain.** To
    improve visibility across multiple technologies in the energy
    industrial base, DOE and a consortium of the National Laboratories
    have developed a new analytic framework—the Supply Chain Readiness
    Level—to quantify risks, gaps, and vulnerabilities, and to identify
    investment opportunities across the energy sector.

**Critical Minerals**

-   **Mapping America’s critical minerals deposits.** The U.S.
    Geological Survey (USGS) is announcing new airborne geophysical
    mapping in the Ozarks Plateau (Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas) and
    Alaska over areas known to host minerals such as antimony, tin,
    tungsten, and lead and zinc ores, as well as byproduct critical
    minerals such as gallium and germanium. USGS’s mapping work, funded
    by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), is revolutionizing the
    U.S. Government’s understanding of the nation’s mineral and geologic
    resources. USGS and NASA are partnering to complete [the largest
    high-quality hyperspectral survey in the
    world](https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/seeing-earth-a-new-light-how-earth-mri-data-deepening-our-understanding),
    surveying more than 180,000 square miles of the Southwest with
    sensors that make it possible to “see” nuanced differences between
    materials.
-   **Updating the U.S.’s critical minerals market data.** Next month,
    USGS will publish its 2025 Mineral Commodity Summaries.These annual
    reports help forecast supply chain disruptions resulting from a
    variety of risks including pandemics, natural disasters, and trade
    wars, and are the U.S.’s authoritative source of data on the supply,
    demand, and consumption of 100 mineral commodities. Additionally,
    last month, researchers at the USGS National Minerals Information
    Center developed a [new model to assess how disruptions of critical
    mineral
    supplies](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/usgs-critical-minerals-study-bans-gallium-and-germanium-exports-could) may
    affect the U.S. economy. This model reflects the latest
    whole-of-government risk and resilience methodology.

**Food and Agriculture**

-   **Making** **$116 million in new investments to expand domestic
    fertilizer production. **Today, the Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    is announcing eight new awards through its Fertilizer Production
    Expansion Program, part of a broader effort to increase
    American-made fertilizer production to spur competition and combat
    price hikes on U.S. farmers. Since President Biden announced the
    program in 2022, USDA has invested $517 million in 76 fertilizer
    production facilities to expand access to domestic fertilizer
    options for American farmers in 34 states and Puerto Rico. These
    investments will increase U.S. fertilizer production by 11.8 million
    tons annually and create more than 1,300 jobs in rural
    communities.This funding builds on the more than $1.4 billion USDA
    has invested to build or expand small and medium sized processing
    facilities and to create a more resilient U.S. food supply chain
    which gives farmers more market options while providing consumers
    with more choices and affordable grocery prices.

**Medical Products**

-   **Investing an additional $26 million in domestic sterilization
    capacity.** Building on recent investments in industrial base
    capability and capacity expansion through DPA Title III authorities
    and Public-Private Partnerships, the Department of Health and Human
    Services (HHS) expects additional investments of $26 millionin
    alternative sterilization capacity before the end of 2024.

<!-- -->

-   **Releasing an action plan for the next four years.** HHS will
    publish its Draft 2025-2028 Action Plan for Addressing Shortages of
    Medical Products and Strengthening the Resilience of Medical Product
    Supply Chains, outlining supply chain resilience goals and a
    strategic plan to achieve them. The HHS Action Plan will also
    include an HHS Research Plan to collate HHS and academic research
    priorities that would promote Action Plan goals.
-   **Issuing stronger supply chain standards for hospitals to combat
    drug shortages.** In notice and comment rulemaking, CMS intends to
    propose new Conditions of Participation requiring hospitals to have
    certain processes to address and prevent medication shortages.

**Semiconductors and Other Technologies**

-   **Investing in domestic production.** CHIPS for America has awarded
    over $26 billion in incentives to advance domestic production in
    semiconductors and the supply chain. Now, America is home to all
    five of the world’s leading-edge logic and memory providers, while
    no other economy has more than two. Since the beginning of the
    Biden-Harris Administration, semiconductor and electronics companies
    have announced nearly $450 billion in private investments, catalyzed
    in large part by public investment.
-   **Reducing national security risks in federal supply chains.** The
    Department of Defense, General Services Administration (GSA), and
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are finalizing
    a rule implementing Section 5949 of the James M. Inhofe National
    Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which prohibits
    agencies from procuring or obtaining certain products and services
    that include semiconductors from entities of concern.
-   **Promoting the U.S. government’s use of domestically manufactured
    semiconductors.** The Made in America Office and Office of Federal
    Procurement Policy (OFPP) has released a Request for Information
    (RFI) to gauge the best ways for government contractors to scale up
    their use of domestically manufactured chips, particularly for
    critical infrastructure. Responses solicit commercial ideas from
    industry that may inform future policymaking in support of the
    government-wide effort to leverage existing manufacturing capacity.
-   **Incentivizing supply chain diversity, competition, and
    transparency.** The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is issuing
    guidance to help the Federal Government—the world’s largest
    buyer—organize its demand for domestic semiconductors so that
    agencies can mitigate the risk posed by undue dependence on foreign
    manufacturing, limited competition, and possible higher
    manufacturing costs. The effort encourages agencies to develop
    strategies to dual or multiple source semiconductors, increase
    transparency for critical infrastructure supply chains, and provide
    the government’s forecasted demand for the products and services
    that use these chips.
-   **Protecting American businesses from unfair trade practices.** In
    May, the President announced increased Section 301 tariffs on
    semiconductor imports from China, which were finalized by the USTR
    in September, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts
    to further protect American semiconductor manufacturing and the
    sustainability of domestic investments.

**Transportation**

-   **Helping states improve their supply chain operations.** The
    Department of Transportation (DOT) continues to advance this work by
    working closely with other levels of government and industry
    stakeholders. DOT’s Freight Office is establishing the National
    Multimodal Freight Network to assist States in strategically
    directing resources toward improved system performance for the
    efficient movement of freight on the Network, to inform freight
    transportation planning, and to assist in the prioritization of
    Federal investment.
-   **Expanding visibility into ocean freight supply chains.** Today,
    DOT is announcing that it has added more members to the Freight
    Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) program, a public-private
    partnership to build an integrated view of U.S. supply chain
    conditions, and which supported the response to the Francis Scott
    Key Bridge collapse. Today, FLOW now includes eight of the largest
    ten container ports representing over 80% of all U.S. imports; nine
    of the largest ten ocean carriers representing over 70% of all U.S.
    imports; and six of the largest ten importers.
-   **Building the transportation of tomorrow.** USTDA, DFC, and EXIM
    are all making investments to improve transportation across air,
    land, and sea. EXIM’s investments will expand U.S. exports of all
    electric-powered aircraft, while USTDA is improving the efficiency
    and safety of freight rail and digital customs processes. In areas
    around the world with high vessel traffic, DFC is also developing
    new ports to move goods in critical supply chains from place to
    place. Since its creation, DFC investments in critical
    infrastructure have transported over 64 million passengers alone.

**Defense**

-   **Releasing a National Defense Industrial Strategy and
    Implementation Plan.** This fall, the Department of Defense (DoD)
    released the Implementation Plan to accompany its first-ever
    National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS). The NDIS is guiding
    investments to strengthen supply chain resilience, including by
    purchasing key elements that we need for sustainable defense
    production. For example, the United States has invested $215 million
    to boost production of solid rocket motors, which are one of the
    most critical components used in our advanced missile systems.
-   **Establishing domestic manufacturing capability for strategic and
    critical materials.** From mid-2023 through September 2024, DoD
    invested $250 million in defense-critical materials such as
    graphite, lithium, niobium oxide, and manganese. These investments
    will ensure secure access to sources and to domestic separation and
    processing in support of a range of defense applications, from
    large-capacity batteries to advanced aircraft to microelectronics.
-   **Investing in the defense industrial base workforce.** The defense
    supply chain depends in large part on a strong and vibrant
    workforce. The Administration has pursued numerous initiatives to
    ensure Americans can access jobs in the defense industrial sector
    that pay competitive wages and get the training they need to turn
    these jobs into meaningful careers. Earlier this year, the Navy
    partnered with the Departments of Education and Labor and with the
    State of Michigan to launch the Michigan Maritime Manufacturing
    Initiative, which expands regional training pipelines for the
    submarine industry into the Great Lakes region.

**Strengthening U.S. Government Data, Analytics, and Response Capacity**

-   **Preparing for a second Supply Chain Summit.** In September 2024,
    the Department of Commerce held its first Supply Chain Summit.
    Commerce convened officials from government, industry, academia, and
    civil society to discuss how to effectively prepare for and respond
    to supply chain disruptions, as well as proactively improve supply
    chain resilience. Commerce will host another Supply Chain Summit
    in 2025. The Summit will bring together government, industry, and
    other stakeholders to examine continual progress made in increasing
    American supply chain resiliency. The date of the Summit will be
    announced in the months ahead.
-   **Upgrading the new SCALE diagnostic tool.** The Department of
    Commerce’s Industry and Analysis unit developed a first-of-its-kind
    supply chain diagnostic tool to assess supply chain risk across the
    whole of the U.S. economy. The tool proactively helps identify risks
    and strengthen the resilience of supply chains key to U.S. national
    and economic security. The Department of Commerce plans to launch a
    competition aimed at developing new data or analysis that can be
    used to expand the indicators of risk incorporated into the SCALE
    tool.
-   **Conducting supply chain tabletop exercises with industry.** In
    2025, Commerce will conduct two tabletop exercises with industry to
    better understand opportunities to address structural supply chain
    risks faced by the United States. One exercise will focus on supply
    chain risks in the chemicals industry; the second will focus on an
    emerging technology where it is critical the United States maintain
    a strategic advantage.
-   **Addressing supply chain risks for “critical chemicals.”** Working
    with the interagency, Commerce is developing a list of chemicals
    that are essential to critical supply chains, and where supply is
    insecure. Alongside this effort, Commerce is finalizing short-,
    medium- and long-term policy proposals to strengthen the supply
    chain. Elements of this work will form the basis of the Chemical
    Tabletop Exercise in 2025.

**Emerging Technologies**

-   **Convening industry on AI data centers.** Commerce continues to
    drive efforts to get ahead of supply chain risks in critical and
    emerging technologies by developing playbooks and conducting deep
    dive assessments into emerging technologies such as quantum
    computing and clean hydrogen. In the second half of 2024, Commerce
    carried out a sprint to assess under-the-radar risks in AI data
    center supply chains, engaging more than 35 companies and leveraging
    in-house industry expertise and the SCALE tool to assess the
    highest-risk components and identify steps that government and
    industry can take to address them. In December, Commerce convened
    companies to share the results of its analysis and identify next
    steps.

**Building Resilience with Allies and Partners**

-   **Presidential Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience.** In
    October 2021, President Biden convened over a dozen world leaders to
    improve international collaboration on supply chain resilience.
    Following the President’s convening, the Secretaries of State and
    Commerce hosted a Supply Chain Ministerial to further advance this
    work. The original Joint Statement from the ministerial now has 31
    signatories who have agreed to make global supply chains more
    transparent, diverse, secure, and sustainable.
-   **Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Supply Chain
    Agreement.** The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement entered into force in
    February 2024 and will improve the preparedness, resilience, and
    competitiveness of regional supply chains. The United States and 13
    Indo-Pacific partners have established a Supply Chain Council. In
    2025, the Council will develop and implement action plans to
    strengthen supply chains across several critical industries. A
    Crisis Response Network will serve as a warning system for potential
    supply chain disruptions, and a Labor Rights Advisory Board will
    convene IPEF government officials, employers, and labor officials to
    improve labor rights and workforce development across regional
    supply chains.
-   **Eradicating forced labor from supply chains.** As part of the
    [Partnership for Workers’
    Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/11/19/fact-sheet-continuing-a-legacy-of-leadership-at-the-g20/)
    launched in 2023, the U.S. and Brazil worked with businesses and
    unions to address worker vulnerability to forced labor in supply
    chains for cattle, coffee, gold, charcoal, and other goods.
-   **Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI).** PGI
    is a bipartisan initiative in partnership with the G7 to provide
    strategic, values-driven, and high-standard infrastructure and
    investment in low- and middle-income countries. Through initiatives
    like the [Lobito Trans-Africa
    Corridor](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/03/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-in-the-lobito-trans-africa-corridor/),
    highlighted on the President’s recent visit to Angola, the United
    States is working with partners to strengthen and diversify supply
    chains.
-   **G7 Surge Financing Initiative.** The U.S. International
    Development Finance Corporation (DFC), G7 development finance
    institutions (DFIs), European Investment Bank (EIB), International
    Finance Corporation (IFC), and MedAccess announced the Surge
    Financing Initiative for Medical Countermeasures (MCMs). Together,
    partners are working closely with global and regional health
    organizations to establish frameworks and innovative financing
    mechanisms to support more rapid and equitable pandemic response.
-   **Boosting critical mineral capacity with partners.** DFC invested
    over $220m in rare earth, graphite, and nickel projects in the last
    four years, reducing dependence on strategic adversaries and
    improving resilience in the critical mineral supply chain. The
    Department of Labor, USAID, United States Trade and Development
    Agency (USTDA), and the State Department through the Minerals
    Security Partnership have also provided technical support to bring
    new capacity online to process critical minerals in line with
    international best practices.
-   **Strengthening resilient telecommunications.** In Costa Rica, EXIM
    approved a preliminary commitment to support Costa Rica’s use of
    trusted vendors to deploy its 5G network. With Japan and Australia,
    DFC is supporting the delivery of high-quality telecommunication
    services for over 2.5 million subscribers across Papua New Guinea,
    Fiji, Vanuatu, Samoa, Tonga, and Nauru.
