title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Student Debt Cancellation for Public\
  \ Service\_Workers"
---
 
Today, my Administration is announcing student debt cancellation for
another 55,000 public service workers, bringing the total number of
individuals who have been approved for student debt relief under my
Administration to nearly 5 million people through various actions. The
public servants approved for debt cancellation today include teachers,
nurses, service members, law enforcement officials, and other public
service workers who have dedicated their lives to giving back to their
communities and who are finally earning the relief they are entitled to
under the law.

Over the last four years, we have made significant progress for students
and borrowers â€“ including securing the largest increase to the maximum
Pell Grant award in over a decade; holding institutions accountable for
taking advantage of students; and fixing broken student loan programs
such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Income Driven Repayment.

From Day One of my Administration, I promised to make sure that higher
education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.
Because of our actions, millions of people across the country now have
the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement, and pursue
life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan
debt.
