title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Secures Confirmation of 235th Federal\_Judge"
---
 
Today, President Biden’s 235th life-tenured federal judicial nominee was
confirmed. This marks the largest number of confirmations in a single
term since the Carter administration. These highly qualified men and
women—all committed to the rule of law and the Constitution—will serve
the federal Judiciary for decades to come.  
   
Dating back to his time leading the Senate Judiciary Committee,
President Biden has made the confirmation of federal judges a top
priority. During his four years in office, President Biden has
transformed the federal bench and appointed over a quarter of all active
judges, and helped to ensure that the Judiciary looks like the
communities it serves.  
   
The 235 confirmations include:  

-   One to the United States Supreme Court
-   45 to the nation’s courts of appeals
-   187 to the nation’s district courts
-   Two to the United States Court of International Trade

President Biden has worked closely with Senators from both sides of the
aisle to fill vacancies at the circuit and district level. He has
achieved this milestone despite significant structural disadvantages,
including the longest 50-50 Senate in history.  
  
Importantly, President Biden has followed through on one of his earliest
campaign promises—to put forward highly-qualified judges from
underrepresented professional backgrounds and to instill confidence in
the Judiciary by ensuring that federal judges reflect the nation as a
whole.   
  
**Professional Diversity**  
  
No President has done more to bring professional and experiential
diversity to the federal bench than President Biden.  
  
Not only did President Biden appoint the first former public defender to
the United States Supreme Court, but he broke records across the board
on professional diversity—appointing more than 45 public defenders, more
than 25 civil rights lawyers, and at least 10 individuals who have
represented workers.  
  
President Biden is also proud to have put forward nominees who come from
private legal practice, prosecutors’ offices, and a host of other legal
backgrounds, including immigration law, municipal law, and
plaintiff-side law. As a lifelong advocate for our men and women in
uniform, veterans, and their families, President Biden is proud to have
put forward judicial nominees who have served on active duty or in the
reserves, in both legal and non-legal roles.  
  
**Demographic Diversity**  
President Biden has set records when it comes to the demographic
diversity of his appointees. In doing so, he has helped to ensure that
the Judiciary looks like the communities it serves—vital to instilling
confidence in both judicial decision-making and outcomes—while refusing
to sacrifice on ability or qualifications.  
  
The 235 confirmations include:

-   The first Black woman ever to serve on the United States Supreme
    Court.
-   A record number of women, Black, Latino, AANHPI, Native American,
    Muslim-American, and LGBTQ judges.
-   More Black women appointed to the circuit courts than every other
    presidential administration combined.

   
**Impact**    
   
Judges have an enormous impact on the everyday lives of Americans.  
   
These men and women have the power to uphold basic rights or to roll
them back. They hear cases that decide whether women have the freedom to
make their own reproductive healthcare decisions; whether Americans have
the freedom to cast their ballots; whether workers have the freedom to
unionize and make a living wage for their families; and whether children
have the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water.  
   
Judges are also crucial to protecting against overreach and
unconstitutional action by the Executive and Legislative Branches.  
   
President Biden is proud of his record of appointments and grateful to
the Senate for its partnership in reaching this historic achievement.
