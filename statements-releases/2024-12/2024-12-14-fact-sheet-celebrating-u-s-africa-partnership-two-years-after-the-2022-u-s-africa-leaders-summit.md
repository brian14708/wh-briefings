title: "FACT SHEET: Celebrating U.S.-Africa Partnership Two Years After the 2022 U.S.-Africa\
  \ Leaders\_Summit"
---
 
In the two years since the December 2022 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the
Biden-Harris Administration significantly expanded engagement and
partnership with African nations, driven by the conviction that the
future of Africa and the United States depends on what we can achieve
together.  At the Summit, the United States [pledged to invest $55
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/15/u-s-africa-leaders-summit-strengthening-partnerships-to-meet-shared-priorities/)
in Africa over three years.  We have surpassed that goal – the
Administration has committed and spent over $65 billion in Africa since
the Summit.  These investments have enabled the Administration, together
with African partners, to accelerate development progress, advance
trans-continental infrastructure, expand trade and economic
opportunities, and support African-led efforts on conservation, climate
adaptation, and a just energy transition.  
   
But the achievements go beyond numbers, underpinned by our belief that
solving global challenges requires African leadership and African
partnership.  The United States championed—and ultimately helped
secure—the African Union’s permanent membership in the G20 and announced
our support for creating two permanent United Nations (UN) Security
Council seats for African states.  Since the Summit, we have laid out a
[vision](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/23/the-nairobi-washington-vision/)
alongside Kenya to help developing countries facing mounting debt
burdens.  Our partnerships enhanced food security and helped build more
sustainable and resilient food systems, improved governance and
security, and advanced shared public health goals.  We catalyzed
landmark diaspora-driven engagement, fostered an inclusive and resilient
African digital ecosystem, and made strides to promote gender equality
and women’s empowerment.   
   
**High-Level Engagements**  
   
Throughout the Biden-Harris administration, President Biden has
prioritized high-level engagement with African countries and partners.  
   
Following the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2022, President Biden
directed an unprecedented pace of senior-level U.S. Government visits to
the continent. Twenty Cabinet Members and leaders of U.S. Government
Departments and Agencies have visited the region since the Summit, with
visits centered on deepening partnerships with African countries,
institutions, and people. In March and April 2023, Vice President Harris
visited Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia, where she announced [more than $8
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/24/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-public-and-private-sector-commitments-to-advancing-digital-inclusion-in-africa/)
in public and private sector investment commitments towards climate and
food security, women’s empowerment, and digital inclusion across
Africa.   
   
In May 2024, President Biden then
[hosted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/23/fact-sheet-kenya-state-visit-to-the-united-states/)
President Ruto of Kenya for a State Visit and Dinner, the first State
Visit of an African head of state since 2008. During that visit, which
highlighted 60 years of official U.S.-Kenyan partnership, President
Biden announced a slew of deliverables to improve economic opportunities
for both our peoples, strengthen democratic resilience and safeguard
human rights, and bolster our work together on a range of pressing
issues, including climate and health.  
   
In December 2024, President Biden traveled to the continent, becoming
the first-ever U.S. president to visit Angola and the first sitting
President to visit sub-Saharan Africa since 2015.  During the visit,
President Biden spoke about the [past horrors of
slavery](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/12/03/remarks-by-president-biden-honoring-the-past-and-future-of-the-angolan-u-s-relationship-belas-angola/)
and its legacy, while welcoming a bright future of deepening
collaboration between the United States and the continent.  He announced
more than [$1
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/02/fact-sheet-president-bidens-trip-to-angola/)
in additional humanitarian funding and co-hosted a [Summit on the Lobito
Trans-Africa
Corridor](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/03/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-in-the-lobito-trans-africa-corridor/),
underscoring the importance of private sector investments, inclusive
economic growth, and sustainable development. One year earlier,
President Biden had
[hosted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/30/readout-of-meeting-between-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-and-president-joao-manuel-goncalves-lourenco-of-angola/)
President Lourenço of Angola for an Oval Office meeting. President
Biden’s historic trip to Angola topped off significant engagement with
the continent throughout the entire Biden-Harris administration.   
   
**Trade and Investment**  
   
The Administration harnessed the dynamism of people from across the
African continent and throughout the United States to expand prosperity
on both sides of the Atlantic. In the past two years, the United States
has supported and helped close **1,385 new deals for a total estimated
value of $62.6 billion in new two-way trade and investment** between the
United States and African countries.  **This represents a more than
five-fold increase in the value of closed deals over the two years
preceding the Summit.**  Illustrative highlights of these trade and
investment initiatives include:  
 

1.  The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has
    investments of over $13 billion in more than 300 projects across 36
    countries in Africa.  Since the Summit, DFC has committed over $5.3
    billion to new projects in Africa in key sectors such as energy,
    healthcare, infrastructure, mineral resources, and support for small
    businesses.  
2.  Since the Summit, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has
    funded 24 project preparation activities to advance the
    implementation of over $7 billion in digital connectivity, clean
    energy, and healthcare infrastructure projects on the continent.  In
    2024, USTDA arranged 10 reverse trade missions and workshops focused
    on regulatory convergence for healthcare products, transportation,
    green hydrogen development, cybersecurity, methane abatement, and
    sustainable energy, connecting African public and private sector
    representatives with the latest U.S. technologies, services, and
    financing solutions.  
3.  Since 2022, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) has
    strengthened partnerships across Africa, approving approximately $4
    billion in authorizations for sub-Saharan Africa.  This includes
    transactions across a wide variety of sectors including two of the
    largest renewable energy projects in EXIM’s history, aircrafts,
    civil works infrastructure, and radio equipment.  
4.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, the EXIM Board of Directors approved a
    $281 million transaction to support the export of several Boeing 737
    MAX 8 aircraft to Ethiopian Airlines Group.  This transaction
    supported 1,600 U.S. jobs across Indiana, North Carolina, and
    Washington.  In FY 2024, the EXIM Board of Directors approved an
    additional transaction of more than $456 million for Ethiopian
    Airlines for the purchase of five Boeing aircraft, supporting an
    estimated 2,200 new U.S. jobs in North Carolina, Ohio, and
    Washington.  
5.  Since 2022, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has invested
    almost $2.4 billion through agreements with African partner
    countries who have demonstrated their commitment to good governance,
    democratic values, and investing in their people.  Funding is
    expanding energy markets, furthering private sector energy
    generation, enhancing farmers’ supply chain integration, and
    improving education access to increase long-term employment
    opportunities.  
6.  Prosper Africa funded and supported several initiatives to boost
    two-way trade and investment for key markets in Kenya, South Africa,
    and Morocco, to include the “[Why Kenya, Why
    Africa](https://ke.usembassy.gov/why-africa-why-kenya-2/)” Roadshow
    in New York, San Francisco, and Chicago, the launch of [Atlanta
    Phambili](https://za.usembassy.gov/atlanta-phambili-a-gateway-for-u-s-south-africa-partnership/)
    with South African business and government leaders in Atlanta, and
    the [U.S.-Morocco Venture Capital
    Forum](https://ma.usembassy.gov/u-s-mission-morocco-prosper-africa-host-venture-capital-forum/). 
    Prosper Africa also provided technical assistance to Togo-based
    Caisse Régionale de Refinancement Hypothécaire, supporting a $275
    million housing deal with Bank of America.   
7.  At the Summit, Prosper Africa announced the [Catalytic Investment
    Facility](https://www.prosperafrica.gov/blog/four-new-african-asset-funds-announced-under-the-prosper-africa-catalytic-investment-facility/),
    which provides first-loss and operational funding support to 10
    African asset managers to mobilize $600 million from private
    investors, to deploy into African tech startups.  To date, $93
    million has been raised by the 10 African asset managers, and $44
    million has been deployed into 61 startups throughout the
    continent.  
8.  In September 2024, Prosper Africa announced a [catalytic pooled
    fund](https://www.prosperafrica.gov/news/the-african-venture-philanthropy-alliance-avpa-announces-the-catalytic-pooled-fund-to-expand-social-financing-in-africa/)
    to drive social investment.  In partnership with the Children’s
    Investment Fund Foundation, and in support of the Africa Venture
    Philanthropy Alliance, the fund aims to pool $200 million of
    catalytic capital over the next five years from African and global
    philanthropies and government donors.  This capital is expected to
    leverage up to $2 billion in private capital.  
9.  Prosper Africa provided a $1.275 million grant to the Liquidity and
    Sustainability Facility (LSF) to cover operational costs of LSF’s
    work enhancing trading liquidity for African countries and lowering
    the cost of financing.  LSF builds free and transparent capital
    markets in Africa and provides investors with an investible
    benchmark for evaluating the performance of African sovereign debt
    instruments such as the IBoxx LSF USD African Sovereign index, in
    conjunction with Standard & Poor’s.   
10. The Small Business Administration (SBA) provided 34 small businesses
    with export financing that supported approximately $185.7 million in
    export sales involving the African continent from December 2023 to
    October 2024.  Building on the SBA Administrator’s visit to Cote
    d’Ivoire and Togo in 2023, SBA also undertook new activities in 2024
    to connect members of the African diaspora in the United States with
    businesses in both continents.   
11. In [November
    2023](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/01/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-african-growth-and-opportunity-act-agoa-reauthorization/)
    and [July
    2024](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/23/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-african-growth-and-opportunity-act-agoa-forum-in-washington-dc/),
    President Biden reiterated his strong support for the
    reauthorization and modernization of the African Growth and
    Opportunity Act (AGOA) to deepen trade relations between the U.S.
    and Africa, strengthen regional integration, and realize Africa’s
    immense economic potential.  In 2023, AGOA imports totaled $9.7
    billion and supported tens of thousands of jobs in the United States
    and Africa. 

**Infrastructure**  
  
President Biden’s flagship G7+ initiative, the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment (PGI), advances strategic, values-driven,
and high-standard infrastructure, investment, and sustainable
development in low- and middle-income countries—with Africa as a key
continent of focus.  At the G7 Summit in June, leaders [celebrated
progress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/13/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-at-the-g7-summit-2/)
toward PGI’s ambitious goal of mobilizing $600 billion by 2027 in global
infrastructure investments that will make a difference in people’s lives
around the world, strengthen and diversify our supply chains, and
advance shared national security interests.  During his historic trip to
Angola December 2-4, President Biden co-hosted a [Summit on the Lobito
Trans-Africa
Corridor](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/03/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-in-the-lobito-trans-africa-corridor/),
bringing together leaders from the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Tanzania, and Zambia, as well as the Africa Finance Corporation. 
Leaders affirmed their commitment to investing in infrastructure that
will one day connect the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to expand economic
growth and sustainable development across the region.  More information
on PGI/Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor can be found
[here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/03/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-in-the-lobito-trans-africa-corridor/).  
  
**Conservation, Climate Adaptation, and a Just Energy Transition**  
  
Many of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change are in
Africa.  The Biden-Harris Administration has marshalled unprecedented
resources to bolster climate resilience and protect development
progress.  During her 2023 trip to the African continent, Vice President
Harris worked with African partners to galvanize more than [$7
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/31/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-over-7-billion-in-private-sector-and-u-s-government-commitments-to-promote-climate-resilience-adaptation-and-mitigation-across-africa/)
in public and private sector climate adaptation, resilience, and
mitigation commitments.  Some of the U.S.  initiatives to support
African-led efforts on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and a just
energy transition include:

1.  Since the Summit, DFC has committed over $1.8 billion to new climate
    focused projects in Africa and also committed over $520 million
    across 12 new projects in Africa focused on expanding access to
    power.  Notably, DFC provided $500 million in political risk
    insurance to support marine conversation in Gabon through the Gabon
    Blue Bonds project, the first DFC-supported debt conversion for
    impact project in Africa.  In Sierra Leone, DFC provided $412
    million in financing and political risk insurance to support the
    Nant Energy project, a 105-megawatt thermal power plant that is
    Sierra Leone’s first gas-to-power plant and will double the
    country’s energy capacity and address a critical need for the Sierra
    Leonean people’s access to reliable energy infrastructure.  In
    Mozambique, DFC committed $179 million in debt and political risk
    insurance to support the development of Central Eléctrica da
    Namaacha’s 120 megawatt wind power project, the country’s first
    utility-scale wind power project.  
2.  In November 2023, Prosper Africa, the United States Agency for
    International Development (USAID), and the State Department provided
    $10 million to seed a $100 million balance sheet under the Green
    Guarantee Company (GGC), the first-ever privately run guarantee
    company devoted to catalyzing green bonds and loans focusing on
    Africa.  GGC is expected to unlock an estimated $1 billion in new
    private capital for climate finance.  
3.  In September 2024, Prosper Africa announced a $5 million catalytic
    capital award to ImpactA Global, aimed at mobilizing $300 million in
    private investment for sustainable infrastructure in emerging
    markets.  The award serves as first-loss capital designed to reduce
    investment risk and attract new institutional investors who might
    otherwise be hesitant to engage in Africa-focused investments.  
4.  Bolstering Power Africa, USTDA has invested $5 million to support a
    just energy transition across several African countries.  These
    investments are supporting solar energy generation in Zambia, wind
    energy generation in Malawi, strengthening the power grid in Cote
    d’Ivoire, promoting clean energy in South Africa, and supporting
    climate innovation through reverse trade missions.  
5.  At the Summit, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced its intent
    to develop a case study in partnership with the Ghanaian Ministry of
    Energy on integrating nuclear and renewable energy systems.  Under
    the Clean Energy Ministerial, DOE is leading a $300,000 initiative
    to evaluate the potential roles for nuclear and renewable energy to
    support Ghanaian energy needs for both electric and non-electric
    applications.  DOE and Ghana also launched Africa’s first regional
    Clean Energy Training Center in Accra, Ghana, providing courses on
    large and small modular reactors, financing, contract structures,
    risk management, and legal issues.  
6.  DOE is working with Mozambique on methane mitigation from the gas
    sector and clean hydrogen development, with Kenya on a $250,000
    project to examine opportunities for direct air capture combined
    with geothermal energy, with Nigeria on a $250,000 study supporting
    their regulatory framework for carbon management, and with Morocco
    on solar energy.  DOE and the Moroccan Research Institute in Solar
    Energy and New Energies hosted a Solar Decathlon Design Challenge
    for collegiate teams from across Africa and around the world to
    design buildings powered by renewable energy.     
7.  Under its [Climate Change and Health
    Initiative](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclimateandhealth.nih.gov%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cadaugo.mbagwu-mahlik%40hhs.gov%7C7d6ed495c6fe45ac65b208dcfdc39cab%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C638664265539782511%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=PP2zUOKkDGJYoLkSRYtxwHE6HWA%2BKnskyfAZw2h2bS0%3D&reserved=0),
    the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established Exploratory
    Research Centers that bring together scientists to work with
    affected communities to build resilience and adapt to climate driven
    stressors.  Three of the centers have focus areas in Kenya,
    Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.  These
    centers are conducting research on early warning models for vector
    borne diseases, the effects of extreme weather events on mental
    health and interpersonal violence, and pilot solutions for climate
    risks to human health.  
8.  At the Summit, the Department of State announced the Accelerating
    Women’s Empowerment in Energy (AWEE) project to help secure women’s
    economic futures through green jobs.  Since then, the State
    Department launched AWEE with an initial investment of $1 million. 
    The project has funded 11 small grants to local organizations in
    South Africa and Kenya to address barriers to the entry, promotion,
    and retention of women in each country’s clean energy sector.

**Promoting Food Security and Resilient Food Systems**  
  
At the Summit, President Biden launched the [U.S.-African Union (AU)
Strategic
Partnership](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/15/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-to-promote-food-security-and-resilient-food-systems/)
to accelerate progress in tackling food insecurity, build stronger and
more diversified food systems and supply chains, scale Africa’s
agricultural production capacity, and expand African countries’ access
to agricultural markets.  Since the launch of the partnership, we have
aligned our food security assistance and programming and leveraged our
convening power and partnerships, including through PGI, to build
sustainable food systems, expand investments in agricultural
infrastructure, and tackle trade policy reforms. 

1.  Since FY 2022, the United States provided nearly $20 billion in
    life-saving humanitarian assistance and early recovery, risk
    reduction, and resilience programming in Africa.  Humanitarian
    assistance addresses acute food insecurity caused by conflicts,
    including Russia’s war in Ukraine and natural disasters, including
    climate shocks impacting millions of people across the African
    continent.   
2.  Since 2023, MCC has committed over $1.6 billion toward food security
    initiatives through newly signed or launched programs.  These
    projects are boosting farm productivity and increasing rural incomes
    by investing in better irrigation methods, increasing production of
    high-value crops, and improving road conditions.  
3.  During his historic trip to Angola, President Biden announced
    additional humanitarian funding, including more than $200 million to
    purchase, ship, and distribute surplus agricultural commodities from
    American farmers to provide life-saving food assistance for refugees
    and other food-insecure populations in Africa.  
4.  Since December 2022, DFC has provided over $180 million to 15 food
    security focused projects in Africa.  These include a $20 million
    DFC loan to Victory Farms in Kenya to support expansion of
    sustainable tilapia production on Lake Victoria; a $75 million loan
    to Indorama Eleme Fertilizer & Chemicals Limited to finance the
    development, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a
    urea-ammonia fertilizer facility in Port Harcourt, Nigeria; and
    project development technical assistance and loans to Ifria, a
    developer of cold chain warehouses in Morocco and Senegal.  
5.  As part of the U.S. Government’s [Feed the
    Future](https://www.feedthefuture.gov/) initiative, the global
    Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS) program helps build
    resilient food systems in partner countries using diverse,
    nutritious, and climate resilient crops grown in healthy, fertile
    soils.  Since 2023, the United States has donated $150 million and
    mobilized another $60 million from international partners for VACS
    programming.  Implementing partner organizations include the
    International Fund for Agricultural Development, the UN Food and
    Agriculture Organization, and the Consultative Group on
    International Agricultural Research.   
6.  USAID and the AU launched the “Feed the Future Accelerator” in
    September 2024 with a new commitment, working with Congress, of more
    than $80 million to deepen food security partnerships in Malawi,
    Tanzania, and Zambia.  U.S. investments will harness the region’s
    combination of fertile land, diverse farming systems, and
    highly-motivated governments to support a regional breadbasket. 
    These funds complement a diverse Feed the Future portfolio including
    over $497 million of ongoing U.S. investments in these three
    countries, plus more than $150 million in private sector
    investments.  
7.  As part of the larger U.S. Government response to the global food
    crisis through Feed the Future, USAID and the African Development
    Bank (AfDB) completed an agreement in January 2024 to fund a $9.5
    million project—Technologies for African Agricultural
    Transformation—to help Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia increase
    food production and introduce climate-smart technologies.  
8.  Building on the U.S.-AU Strategic Partnership on Food Security, the
    United States supported the AU process to refresh the Comprehensive
    African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) 10-year strategic
    plan focused on food security and increased agricultural trade. 
    USAID provided analytical work that fed into CAADP Technical Working
    Groups and submitted an independent memorandum to the AU Commission
    with recommendations on how to achieve agricultural transformation,
    wealth creation, food security and nutrition, and economic growth.

**Promoting Peace, Security, and Democratic Governance**  
  
The United States supported peace as the largest single humanitarian
donor for refugee and migration-related needs in Sub-Saharan Africa,
working with international organization and NGO partners to support over
eight million refugees and asylum seekers and over 30 million internally
displaced persons.  President Biden also launched the 21st Century
Partnership for African Security (21PAS), to expand support to African
partners with a focus on promoting effective, responsible, and
accountable defense institutions able to meet the emerging threats of
our time.  At the Summit, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to
support complex political transitions in Africa through launching the
African Democratic and Political Transitions (ADAPT) initiative. 

1.  In FY 2024, the United States, through the State Department’s Bureau
    of Population, Refugees, and Migration, provided more than $1.37
    billion in Africa to support urgent and lifesaving needs for
    refugees, asylum seekers, conflict victims, stateless persons, and
    vulnerable migrants, including those affected by climate change. 
    Since December 2022, the United States has resettled over 56,000
    refugees from Sub-Saharan Africa, welcoming them as they build new
    lives in communities across the United States.  The majority of
    refugees resettled were from the Democratic Republic of Congo,
    Eritrea, the Republic of South Sudan, Somalia, and Sudan.  
2.  The United States, Gabon, Ghana, and Mozambique worked together to
    successfully authorize UN Security Council Resolution 2719, which
    outlines a process for the AU to receive UN funding for Peace
    Support Operations (PSOs).  UN Security Council Resolution 2719 is a
    testament to the U.S. and AU commitment to addressing conflict in
    the region through African-led solutions.  The United States is
    supportive of the UN and the AU utilizing the Resolution to support
    PSOs on the continent while working together to ensure that human
    rights, transparency, and accountability mechanisms are
    successful.   
3.  Through 21PAS, the Department of Defense is focusing on improving
    the capacity of African partners to plan, resource, and sustain
    their defense and security forces.  21PAS values partnerships rooted
    in transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights,
    recognizing that these values are foundational to lasting security. 
    Using these criteria, the Department of Defense identified a broad
    array of security cooperation programming totaling $73 million for
    Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, and countries along the Gulf of Guinea and
    Western Indian Ocean.  
4.  The United States continues to bolster democratic governance through
    the ADAPT initiative.  For example, in Gabon, U.S. technical
    assistance to government entities, civic groups, media outlets, and
    women- and youth-focused organizations supports inclusive
    constitutional and electoral legal reforms and free, fair, and
    peaceful transitional elections.  
5.  Since 2022, USAID, through the Elections and Political Processes
    Fund, has provided $48.9 million for critical election support in 28
    countries in Africa for unanticipated needs such as snap elections
    or other unforeseen political developments.  USAID provided an
    additional $17.4 million through the Defending Democratic Elections
    Fund to 10 countries to tackle deeply rooted electoral integrity
    issues, especially during inter-election periods.  Through the
    Women’s Political Participation and Leadership fund, USAID provided
    $8.36 million in FY 2022 and 2023 to four countries to build and
    sustain the pipeline of women leaders and facilitate their safe and
    meaningful participation in political, peacebuilding, and transition
    processes.  
6.  Since 2022, the U.S. Government has dedicated over $181 million
    through the Prevention and Stabilization Fund to enhance
    partnerships with Mozambique, Libya, Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana,
    Guinea, and Togo.  Efforts focus on 10-year objectives to include
    promoting reconciliation and unification; accelerating inclusive and
    sustainable economic development; improving responsive governance
    and security institutions; promoting respect for human rights;
    strengthening justice systems; building capacity and resilience in
    historically marginalized, at-risk, and conflict-affected areas; and
    advancing meaningful participation of women and youth.

**Deepening Health Cooperation**  
  
The United States works in partnership with African nations and regional
and global partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and
its Africa Regional Office (AFRO), the AU, the Africa Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and the private sector, to
save lives and build more resilient health systems that are better able
to prevent and respond to current and future health threats. 

1.  The Administration has built on the United States’ longstanding
    leadership in the fight to end HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria
    as public health threats, including by investing more than $15.55
    billion through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
    (PEPFAR), the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), the Global Fund
    to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund), and Gavi,
    the Vaccine Alliance.  These investments have reduced the burden of
    HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and vaccine-preventable diseases and
    have strengthened health systems in more than 30 countries on the
    African continent.  
2.  Over the past two years, the United States provided more than $3
    billion in global health funding to support health workers,
    including funding through PEPFAR to support more than 346,000 health
    professionals to deliver HIV and tuberculosis services in the past
    year.  PEPFAR is also providing $8 million to support nurses, who
    are the backbone of patient care, in Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire,
    Eswatini, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zambia.  In FY 2024,
    USAID provided $10 million to support the [Global Health Worker
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/15/fact-sheet-global-health-worker-initiative-ghwi-year-two-fact-sheet/)
    to build on the Primary Impact Initiative in countries including
    Ghana.  
3.  PEPFAR has been central to reversing the HIV/AIDS pandemic’s
    trajectory—in Sub-Saharan Africa, there were 56 percent fewer new
    HIV infections in 2023 than in 2010.  Nine African countries are
    nearing or achieving the [UNAIDS 2025 global
    goal](https://aidstargets2025.unaids.org/) that 95 percent of people
    living with HIV will know their status and benefit from treatment
    that keeps them healthy and helps prevent further spread, with
    several more countries on track to reach these goals by the end of
    2025.   
4.  Since FY 2021, PMI has invested more than $100 million to support
    100,000 community health workers across its partner countries to
    rapidly detect and treat malaria in their communities.  These
    investments in integrated platforms also enable treatment of other
    common childhood illnesses such as diarrhea and pneumonia, improve
    the quality and reach of primary health care, and strengthen
    countries’ ability to prevent, detect, and respond to disease
    outbreaks.   
5.  PMI has supported African manufacturing to promote more resilient
    and sustainable commodity supply chains.  In FY 2023, PMI sourced
    approximately 10% of its commodity procurements from Africa, more
    than double what was procured from the continent in FY 2021.  From
    FY 2019 to FY 2023, PMI transitioned from primary reliance on air
    freight to using sea and land freight to transport malaria
    commodities, reducing transportation-related greenhouse gas
    emissions by 85% and generating $66 million in cost savings, which
    PMI used to expand other malaria-related programs.  
6.  In April 2024, the Administration launched the [U.S. Global Health
    Security
    Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/16/fact-sheet-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-releases-strategy-to-strengthen-global-health-security/)
    to strengthen pandemic preparedness and response and welcomed [six
    new Global Health Security Partners in
    Africa](https://www.state.gov/united-states-global-health-security-partnerships/where-we-work/).
     The United States continues working in partnership with African
    nations to support outbreak responses, including on
    [Marburg](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/07/statement-from-nsc-spokesperson-sean-savett-on-marburg-virus-disease-outbreak/),
    [mpox](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/24/fact-sheet-the-united-states-commitment-to-address-the-global-mpox-outbreak/),
    Ebola, and cholera.   
7.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of
    NIH, has been partnering with research agencies and institutions in
    Africa for decades.  Longstanding research programs have enabled
    collaboration on research responses to emerging and re-emerging
    infectious diseases.   
8.  From 2022 to 2023, the U.S. Government provided more than $22
    million to support the Government of Uganda’s Ebola response and an
    additional $7 million to help neighboring countries prepare for
    potential outbreaks.  In 2023, the United States worked with the
    Governments of Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea and other
    international partners to address simultaneous but unrelated Marburg
    virus disease outbreaks, providing over $5.8 million to support key
    response and prevention efforts.  In response to the Marburg virus
    disease outbreak in Rwanda starting in September 2024, the United
    States has provided technical support, vaccines, diagnostics,
    therapeutics, and personal protective equipment and plans to
    allocate over $11 million regionally to address urgent health
    needs.  
9.  The United States partners with biological laboratories in the
    public, private, and academic sectors in 20 African countries to
    provide trainings and assist partner institutions with performing
    laboratory risk assessments.  These partnerships improve biosafety,
    biosecurity, and cybersecurity.  The United States also provides
    training to technical staff and biomedical engineers responsible for
    upkeep of laboratory equipment for high containment laboratories.  
10. DFC continues to catalyze investments to strengthen regional
    manufacturing capacity in Africa, including by providing input into
    the design of Gavi’s African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator to
    ensure long-term sustainability of African vaccine manufacturers. 
    Following DFC’s loan of €100 million to Aspen Pharmacare in 2021, in
    2024 DFC committed a direct loan of up to €110 million to expand
    Aspen’s capacity to manufacture pediatric vaccines, insulin, and
    other essential medicines in South Africa. DFC collaborated with the
    International Finance Corporation, the German Development Finance
    Institution, and Proparco to [co-finance expansion of
    Aspen](https://www.dfc.gov/media/press-releases/dfc-ifc-proparco-and-deg-support-aspen-strengthen-africas-pharmaceutical).  
11. DFC also invests in health services, and technology to improve
    access to affordable, high-quality health care and products.  For
    example, in 2023 DFC committed a $10 million loan to Hewatele, a
    medical oxygen manufacturer in Kenya to expand production and
    distribution of medical oxygen.  DFC also provided a $10 million
    loan guaranty to KCB Bank in Kenya to increase financing available
    to small and medium enterprises in the health sector.   
12. In December 2022, USTDA launched the Coalition for Healthcare
    Infrastructure in Africa, a collaboration between USTDA and U.S.
    industry to help meet the healthcare needs of African partners and
    to increase access to quality healthcare products and services for
    millions of individuals across the continent.  From November 2023 to
    July 2024, USTDA hosted three healthcare workshops that convened
    U.S. and African public and private sector representatives with the
    aim of strengthening regulatory systems and facilitating broader
    market access for healthcare products across the continent.  
13. Since 2022, the United States has donated over $50 million to
    projects in support of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Rays
    of Hope initiative, which provides assistance in nuclear and
    radiation medicine to advance cancer diagnosis and treatment in low-
    and middle-income countries.  In 2024, the United States provided an
    additional $6 million to Rays of Hope projects in Benin, Chad, the
    Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Malawi, Niger, and
    Senegal.   
14. At the Summit, First Lady Jill Biden highlighted the U.S.
    Government’s unwavering commitment [to improving cancer outcomes in
    countries in
    Africa](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/12/14/fact-sheet-cancer-moonshot-announces-new-actions-aimed-to-reduce-the-cancer-burden-in-africa-as-part-of-the-u-s-africa-leaders-summit/). 
    In July 2024, the Biden Cancer Moonshot hosted the White House
    Africa Cancer Care Forum, which convened health leaders from Benin,
    DRC, Lesotho, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania,
    and Zambia committed to expanding national capacity for cancer
    diagnosis and treatment.  During the forum, the United States
    announced [over $100
    million](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/07/15/fact-sheet-the-biden-cancer-moonshot-announces-over-100-million-in-new-actions-to-decrease-the-burden-of-cancer-in-africa/)
    in commitments to reduce the burden of cancer, bringing the
    collective total to over $400 million.   
15. The U.S.-South Africa Cancer Care and Research Alliance
    (U.S.-SACCRA) was established in December 2023 to deliver improved
    health outcomes in Africa, including by reducing the burden of
    cancer.  U.S.-SACCRA partners with several South African academic
    and research institutions; government departments, and leading U.S.
    cancer institutes to design, share, and fast-track scientific
    exchanges and capacity development for cancer care and research in
    both countries.

**Elevating African Diaspora Engagement**  
  
Since the Summit, the Administration has aimed to harness the dynamism
of the African Diaspora to enrich lives on both sides of the Atlantic. 
The Administration has strengthened educational, cultural, social,
political, and economic ties among African communities, the global
African Diaspora, and the United States.  As Vice President Harris said
during her 2023 trip to the African continent, “The fates of America and
the continent of Africa are interconnected and interdependent.” 

1.  In December 2022, President Biden established the [President’s
    Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in the United States
    (PAC-ADE)](https://www.state.gov/african-diaspora/) to provide
    advice on strengthening connections between the U.S. Government and
    the African Diaspora in the United States.  The Council members held
    their inaugural meeting in October 2023 with Vice President Harris
    and Secretary Blinken presiding.   
2.  Since the Summit, PAC-ADE conducted its first plenary session
    meeting at Spelman College, and [developed the EdTech initiative
    announced during Kenyan President Ruto’s visit to Spelman
    College](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/23/fact-sheet-kenya-state-visit-to-the-united-states/).
    The Council also conducted its [inaugural
    visit](https://ng.usembassy.gov/u-s-presidents-advisory-council-on-african-diaspora-engagement-concludes-landmark-visit-to-nigeria/)
    to the continent in July 2024 to Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria, where
    they met with government, civil society, and private-sector partners
    to discuss diaspora-led investments in education, entrepreneurship,
    health, technology, youth and women empowerment, and the creative
    industries.  The Council held its final meeting of the year in
    October 2024, with remarks by Assistant to the President, Senior
    Advisor to the President, and Director of the White House Office of
    Public Engagement Mayor Steve Benjamin. Several members of the
    Council joined President Biden on his trip to Angola in December
    2024.  
3.  In concert with PAC-ADE’s keen focus on increasing business ties
    with the continent, Prosper Africa has prioritized the support of
    Diaspora firms and investors, resulting in a portfolio of notable
    transactions with Diaspora-owned and led firms.  These include
    Cybastion’s partnership with Cisco Systems on over $800 million of
    cybersecurity and digital upgrade contracts in six countries. 
    Prosper Africa also established active partnerships with leading
    Diaspora organizations, including joining with USAID to sign a
    Memorandum of Understanding with the National Alliance for Black
    Business, an organization founded in 2022 by the National Black
    Chamber of Commerce, the National Business League, and the World
    Conference of Mayors.  
4.  In addition to PAC-ADE, the U.S. Government is investing in Diaspora
    engagement through education.  The Young African Leaders Initiative
    (YALI) embodies our investment in our shared future by providing
    training opportunities for diverse African youth.  At the Summit,
    Vice President Harris announced plans to expand YALI.  As part of
    this expansion, in September 2023, USAID launched the YALI Legacy
    Localization award to expand the work of the four Regional
    Leadership Centers on the continent that provide transformative
    leadership training.  In November 2024, the USAID-led YALI Alumni
    Expo and Trade Show took place in Cape Town, South Africa, where
    over 500 YALI alumni showcased their innovations and fostered
    connection with experts and officials from the private sector, civil
    society, government, and the diaspora community.

**Digital Transformation with Africa**  
  
Launched at the Summit, the [Digital Transformation with Africa
(DTA)](https://www.state.gov/digital-transformation-with-africa/)
initiative aims to expand digital access in Africa, increase commercial
engagement between U.S. and African companies in the digital sector,
support increased digital literacy, and strengthen digital enabling
environments across Africa.  DTA works in alignment with the priorities
outlined in the AU’s [Digital Transformation
Strategy](https://au.int/sites/default/files/documents/38507-doc-dts-english.pdf)
to enable innovative, inclusive and sustainable growth and development. 
DTA’s work is organized across the following three pillars:  
  
*Digital Economy and Infrastructure*

1.  In May 2024, Vice President Harris launched [two public-private
    partnerships](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/24/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-public-and-private-sector-commitments-to-advancing-digital-inclusion-in-africa/)—the
    Mobilizing Access to the Digital Economy (MADE) Alliance:  Africa
    and the Partnership for Digital Access in Africa (PDAA). Both focus
    on increasing digital inclusion across Africa.  The MADE Alliance
    aims to provide digital access to critical services for 100 million
    individuals and businesses in Africa over the next 10 years.  PDAA
    will support African institutions to double the number of people
    connected to the internet in Africa from 40% to 80%, connect one
    billion people to the internet by 2030, and increase internet
    connectivity for women and girls from 30% to 80%.    
2.  Since December 2022, USTDA has funded 20 activities to build the
    business case for innovative U.S. technologies that help to advance
    inclusive, secure, and sustainable digital infrastructure across
    Africa, including priority connectivity, cybersecurity, and smart
    cities projects.  USTDA is leveraging its grant-based funding for
    project preparation, which mitigates risk and unlocks bankable
    infrastructure projects.  
3.  Prosper Africa leads the Africa Tech for Trade Alliance (AT4T) with
    the support of USAID.  AT4T unites leading American and African tech
    companies to accelerate e-commerce and digital trade in Africa. 
    Alliance members include Visa, Mastercard, Intel, Cisco, Google, AWS
    and others. By leveraging U.S. companies’ technology assets,
    services, and expertise, the alliance fosters U.S.-Africa trade in
    fintech, ag-tech, eHealth and more.  
4.  In April 2024, the President’s Advisory Council on Doing Business in
    Africa (PAC-DBIA), the Department of Commerce, and USTDA led a
    mission to the American Chamber of Commerce Business Summit in
    Kenya.  In Nairobi, they [announced U.S. private sector commitments
    and
    collaborations](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2024/04/during-presidents-advisory-council-doing-business-africa-mission-kenya),
    including initiatives in data protection, artificial intelligence,
    digital upskilling, and new investments in digital connectivity,
    women’s tech leadership, and a cybersecurity experience center.

*Human Capital Development*

1.  In May 2024, USAID announced the DTA-YALI Partnership to leverage
    YALI Regional Leadership Centers to expand digital skills and
    literacy, support digital entrepreneurs and start-ups, and increase
    private sector engagement in 49 African countries.  USAID is also
    expanding the “Responsible Computer Challenges” to universities and
    educators in Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa.  This activity aims to
    empower students to account for the social and ethical context and
    impact of digital technologies, including frontier technologies such
    as artificial intelligence.  
2.  The Department of State prioritizes biosafety and biosecurity
    capacity building in Africa.  Over the past two years, the State
    Department has conducted trainings on cyberbiosecurity and secure
    data sharing to promote safe and timely coordination during outbreak
    responses.  The Department of State has ongoing efforts in practical
    cyberbiosecurity literacy for high containment laboratories to
    institutionalize cyberhygiene practices and to build both in-country
    and regional networks of leaders in cyberbiosecurity.  
3.  USAID and MCC are supporting the DigiFemmes program as part of MCC’s
    $536 million Compact with the Government of Côte d’Ivoire. 
    DigiFemmes provides the leadership, innovation, and technical
    training women need to grow their businesses through data and
    digital tools.  Nearly 9,000 women-owned small and medium
    enterprises have benefited from the $5.3 million program. 
    DigiFemmes graduates also accessed a total of $525,000 in follow-on
    funding distributed as small grants by the U.S. African Development
    Foundation to help refine their products and expand their markets
    through digital tools and innovations.  
4.  In March 2024, MCC and the Government of Togo launched Nanatech, a
    program designed to equip Togolese women and entrepreneurs with the
    digital skills they need to benefit from the growing digital
    economy.  To date, nearly 2,000 women and 200 supporting
    organizations have benefited. 

*Digital Enabling Environment*

1.  In September 2024, the United States hosted the landmark [Global
    Inclusivity and Artificial Intelligence:
    Africa](https://ng.usembassy.gov/united-states-and-african-partners-advance-inclusive-ai-dialogue-at-lagos-conference/)
    (GIAA) Conference in Lagos, Nigeria, bringing together over 400
    stakeholders, including government officials, industry leaders,
    civil society members, startup founders, and academics, to discuss
    the safe, secure, inclusive, and trustworthy deployment of
    artificial intelligence on the continent.  The GIAA conference
    underscored the growing importance of Africa’s inclusion in
    artificial intelligence development and the continent’s key role in
    the global emerging technology landscape.  
2.  In November 2024, representatives from the Department of Commerce,
    Department of State, USAID, and USTDA participated in a variety of
    engagements during the [Africa Tech
    Festival](https://africatechfestival.com/) in Cape Town, South
    Africa.  DTA hosted a U.S. Government side event for over 100
    stakeholders from the U.S. and African public and private sectors to
    discuss key challenges to expanding digital access, increasing
    digital literacy, and strengthening digital enabling environments
    across Africa.   Participants discussed innovative U.S. and African
    solutions and collaborative strategies to advance Africa’s digital
    transformation.  
3.  USAID is working with Afrobarometer, through the United States
    Institute of Peace, to conduct public surveys to assess public
    awareness, perception, and understanding of digital threats, online
    safety, and cybersecurity in Benin, Kenya, Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire,
    Tanzania, Senegal, and Angola.  
4.  USAID continues to facilitate discussions, build capacity, and
    deliver expert advisory services to the African Continental Free
    Trade Area Secretariat to develop and implement the Digital Trade
    Protocol to help advance international and intra-African digital
    economy and regulatory standards.

**Partnerships in Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment**  
  
The Administration has elevated gender equity and equality across our
foreign policy in Africa and around the world.  Societies—including the
United States—do better when women participate and have equal
opportunities.  Advancing the status of women and girls reduces poverty
and promotes sustainable economic growth, increases access to education,
improves health outcomes, advances political stability, and fosters
democracy.  During the Summit, Vice President Harris announced new
commitments to advance women’s economic participation in Africa,
including the revitalization of the African Women’s Entrepreneurship
Program (AWEP). 

1.  Vice President Harris launched the [Women in Digital Economy Fund
    (WiDEF)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/29/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-global-initiatives-on-the-economic-empowerment-of-women-totaling-over-1-billion/) 
    in 2023 to accelerate efforts to close the gender digital divide. 
    WiDEF and the corresponding Women in the Digital Economy Initiative
    have together catalyzed over $1 billion in commitments from
    governments, the private sector, foundations, and civil society to
    accelerate digital gender equality – including $102 million in U.S.
    direct and aligned commitments.  In addition, President Biden
    secured a historic commitment from G20 leaders to halve the digital
    gender gap by 2030.  Vice President Harris also launched the [Women
    in the Sustainable Economy
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-women-in-the-sustainable-economy-initiative-totaling-over-900-million-in-commitments/)
    (WISE) in 2023 to promote women’s participation in sectors that
    address climate change.  Together, WiDEF and WISE represent a
    commitment of over $3 billion, including millions to empower African
    women and girls.   
2.  In July 2024, SBA, Howard University’s Small Business Development
    Center, AWEP, the State Department, and the Department of Commerce
    cooperated on an event uniting local and African women-owned
    businesses on the margins of the 2024 AGOA Forum.  The program and
    marketplace facilitated business networking and an exchange of best
    practices on inclusive trade and to support for small business
    partnerships.  The event built on SBA’s February 2024 virtual event
    “Connecting U.S. and West African Small Businesses.”  
3.  Over the past two years, DFC has deepened its commitment to
    advancing economic empowerment across Africa through a range of
    impactful investments.  Key investments include a $100 million loan
    to First City Monument Bank, Ltd., expanding access to longer-term
    loans for women-owned small- and medium-sized enterprises in
    Nigeria; the 2X Ignite Africa Warehousing Facility, providing
    critical portfolio-building capital to female-led and
    gender-balanced fund managers; and a $10 million equity investment
    in Janngo Capital Startup Fund to fuel the growth of African
    startups, with at least 50% of funding to women-led enterprises. 
    Each of these investments reflects DFC’s dedication to empowering
    women, driving innovation, and building sustainable pathways for
    economic independence.  
4.  The Department of State, through the Support Her Empowerment-Women’s
    Inclusion in New Security (SHE WINS) initiative, has invested more
    than $9 million globally and supported seven women-led and
    women-serving civil society organizations in Cameroon, the Central
    African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  In August
    2024, under the SHE WINS Rapid Response Fund, the United States, in
    partnership with Norway and Canada, convened a group of Sudanese
    women civil society leaders to inform discussions on a ceasefire,
    humanitarian access, and monitoring mechanisms.  
5.  Announced during Vice President Harris’ visit to Ghana in 2023, the
    [Imarisha Women’s
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/29/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-global-initiatives-on-the-economic-empowerment-of-women-totaling-over-1-billion/)
    is helping women advance in their careers, improve their skill sets,
    and increase their income, while creating more flexible and
    supportive workplaces.  The first cohort of four companies in East
    Africa are providing leadership, mentorship, and skill trainings;
    menstrual health and hygiene and lactation support; and programs on
    the prevention of and response to gender-based violence and
    harassment in the workplace.
