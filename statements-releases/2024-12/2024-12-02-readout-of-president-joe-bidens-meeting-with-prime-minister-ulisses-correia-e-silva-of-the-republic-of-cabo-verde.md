President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Ulisses
Correia e Silva of the Republic of Cabo Verde in Sal, Cabo Verde. The
two leaders discussed the growing U.S.-Cabo Verdean relationship,
bolstered by the vibrant Cabo Verdean diaspora in the United
States; support for democratic freedoms and human rights;
and strengthening our collaboration to increase climate resilience.
President Biden expressed his appreciation for Cabo Verde’s unwavering
support for Ukraine as it continues to defend against Russian aggression
and for the continued strength and value of U.S.-Cabo Verdean
cooperation on security and law enforcement issues. President Biden also
reiterated his support for expanding the United Nations Security Council
to create two permanent seats for African countries, increasing
representation of global voices to tackle global issues.
