Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office,
I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s
decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being
selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like
use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw
purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges
solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying
their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back
subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given
non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated
differently.   
   
The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political
opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my
election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the
Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room – with a number of my
political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political
pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a
fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases.     
   
No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach
any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my
son – and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter – who
has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting
attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve
tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here.
Enough is enough.   
   
For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the
American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I
believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also
believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a
miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend,
there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will
understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.
