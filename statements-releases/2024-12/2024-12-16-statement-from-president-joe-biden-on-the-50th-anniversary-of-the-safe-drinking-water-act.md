  \ Water\_Act"

Today, as we commemorate the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Safe
Drinking Water Act of 1974, we celebrate the tremendous progress our
country has made in bringing clean drinking water to all Americans – and
we recommit ourselves to the work still to come.  

I am proud to have been one of the Senators who supported this landmark
legislation. Before the Safe Drinking Water Act, America’s drinking
water was unreliable and too often polluted with industrial waste or
disease-causing contaminants. The Act was passed to meet these
challenges head-on, and five decades later, our nation enjoys some of
the safest drinking water in the world.

Along with the long-standing leadership of Vice President Harris, I have
fought to ensure that the full vision of the Safe Drinking Water Act is
realized by tackling the key challenges facing our drinking water system
today, including toxic lead pipes, PFAS “forever chemicals,” aging water
infrastructure, and pollution impacting our rivers, streams, and
wetlands. Our Administration combined historic investments – including
more than $50 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – and
regulatory policies – including the first-ever requirement to identify
and replace lead pipes within ten years – to make historic progress
investing in key water infrastructure, including in Indigenous and rural
communities, while also creating good-paying jobs and helping advance
environmental justice.

Vice President Harris and I have always believed that every person in
this country deserves to turn on a faucet and have clean drinking water.
And because of my Administration’s investments and actions in water
safety, a new legacy of clean, high-quality drinking water for our
families and communities will continue to be felt for generations to
come.
