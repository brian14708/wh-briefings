title: "FACT SHEET: The United\_States and India Advance Growing Space\_Partnership"
---
 
On December 17, U.S. Principal Deputy National Security Advisor (PDNSA)
Jon Finer, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, and Indian
Ambassador to the United States Vinay Kwatra traveled to the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, Texas, to mark the significant progress the
United States and India have made to strengthen space cooperation,
including under the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging
Technology (iCET).  Following President Biden and Prime Minister Modi’s
June 2023 commitment to work together to “reach new frontiers across all
sectors of space cooperation” and India’s signing of the Artemis
Accords, our two nations reached an inflection point on collaboration
across civil, security, and commercial space sectors.  This includes
human spaceflight, joint space exploration, and a commitment to
facilitating commercial partnerships between U.S. and Indian space
companies to advance our shared interests in the growing space economy.

As part of their visit to Houston, PDNSA Finer and Deputy Secretary
Campbell met with representatives from the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO),
and space industry leaders to identify new opportunities to further
strengthen our burgeoning space partnership.  They also reflected on the
accomplishments of the past few months and charted next steps to take
our partnership to the next level, including:  

-   Selecting two ISRO astronauts to train at NASA’s Johnson Space
    Center for the first-ever joint effort between American and Indian
    astronauts at the International Space Station, with Axiom Space
    serving as the provider of the mission; the [launch of the Axiom-4
    mission as soon as spring
    2025](https://www.axiomspace.com/missions/ax4) will mark a
    significant milestone in the U.S.-India space partnership and space
    exploration;

<!-- -->

-   Celebrating the completion of a Strategic Framework for Human
    Spaceflight Cooperation to deepen interoperability in space and
    working toward the conclusion of a new arrangement on advanced
    astronaut training;

<!-- -->

-   Noting continued progress toward the launch of the [NASA-ISRO
    Synthetic Aperture
    Radar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6A6BaPKJk) (NISAR) in early
    2025 from the Satish Dhawan Space Center on India’s southeastern
    coast; the NISAR satellite integrates two radars – one from NASA and
    one from ISRO – which will together map the motion of the Earth’s
    surface twice every 12 days, as the United States and India work
    together to predict and respond to hazards, measure and quantify
    changes to infrastructure and resources, and address other global
    challenges;

<!-- -->

-   Exploring the creation of a new space innovation bridge to promote
    partnerships between U.S. and Indian startups focused on advancing
    space situational awareness, satellite technology, and space launch
    and exploration;

<!-- -->

-   Promoting defense space cooperation through the U.S.-India Advanced
    Domains Defense Dialogue, India’s participation in U.S. Space
    Command’s annual Global Sentinel exercise, and a recently launched
    space situational awareness joint challenge under the India-U.S.
    Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X);

<!-- -->

-   Advancing reviews of Missile Technology exports to generate new
    opportunities for bilateral industry partnerships on space launch
    technology, including for commercial satellite launches.
