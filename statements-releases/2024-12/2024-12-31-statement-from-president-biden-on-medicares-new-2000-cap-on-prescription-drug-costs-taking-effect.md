  \ Drug Costs Taking\_Effect"

I believe that health care should be a right – not a privilege – and
throughout my presidency I have advanced that goal. This week, we take
another step closer to an America where everyone can afford the quality
health care they need, as Medicare’s new $2,000 cap on prescription drug
costs from my Inflation Reduction Act goes fully into effect.

Before I took office, people with Medicare who took expensive drugs
could face a crushing burden, paying $10,000 a year or more in copays
for the drugs they need to stay alive. When I took on Big Pharma and
won, we changed that, capping seniors’ out-of-pocket spending on drugs
they get at the pharmacy for the first time ever. Costs were capped at
about $3,500 in 2024, and in just the first six months of the year, this
policy saved people with Medicare $1 billion in cost-sharing. On January
1, 2025, the cap on drug costs fully phases in, and costs are now capped
at $2,000 per year. As a result, 19 million people are expected to save
an average of $400 each. That’s a game changer for the American people.

My Inflation Reduction Act has changed Medicare for the better, and as a
result Americans will have more money back in their pockets in the years
to come.
