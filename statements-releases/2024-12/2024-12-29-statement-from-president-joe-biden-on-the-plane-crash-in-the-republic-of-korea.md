Jill and I are deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life that
occurred as a result of the Jeju Airlines accident in Muan, Republic of
Korea. As close allies, the American people share deep bonds of
friendship with the South Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are
with those impacted by this tragedy. The United States stands ready to
provide any necessary assistance.
