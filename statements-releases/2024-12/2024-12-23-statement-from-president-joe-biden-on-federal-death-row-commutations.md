title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Federal Death Row\_Commutations"
---
 
Iâ€™ve dedicated my career to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair
and effective justice system.

Today, I am commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 individuals on
federal death row to life sentences without the possibility of parole.
These commutations are consistent with the moratorium my Administration
has imposed on federal executions, in cases other than terrorism and
hate-motivated mass murder.

Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of
their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered
unimaginable and irreparable loss.

But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President, and now
President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of
the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot
stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.
