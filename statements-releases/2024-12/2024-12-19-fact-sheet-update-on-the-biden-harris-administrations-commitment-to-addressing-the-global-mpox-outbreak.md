title: "FACT SHEET: Update on the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Commitment\
  \ to Addressing the Global Mpox\_Outbreak"
---
 
For decades, the United States has been a leader in combatting
infectious diseases. During the 2022 global outbreak of clade II mpox,
the Biden-Harris Administration mounted a robust response by making
vaccines, tests, and treatment available to those at risk in the United
States and abroad. Now, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is
experiencing its largest mpox outbreak ever recorded, with more than
50,000 suspect cases in 2024. Multiple neighboring countries have
confirmed their first ever mpox cases, and some are also experiencing
widespread outbreaks. A handful of travel-related cases have also been
recorded in countries outside the Africa region. As we face this
outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa, the United States is again
acting quickly to respond. At the UN General Assembly in September,
President Biden announced that the United States is prepared to commit
at least $500 million and to donate up to one million doses of mpox
vaccines to support African countries in preventing and responding to
this outbreak. *We are delivering on that commitment*, with two-thirds
of our global mpox funding pledge fulfilled, and all of our pledged
vaccine doses available now for countries that are ready to receive the
doses.  
   
The United States is also prepared to respond to clade I and clade II
mpox cases domestically, with early detection and a robust testing
landscape across the country, increased clinician education and
community outreach, and widely available mpox vaccines in retail
pharmacies and clinics. Travel-associated cases have been detected in
Canada, Germany, India, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. In
November 2024, the United States also identified one case of clade Ib
mpox in a California resident who had recently traveled to an affected
country. No further domestic detections have occurred as of December 5,
2024, and the risk to the general public remains low.  
  
**<u>Update on the United States’ Support for the Global Mpox
Response</u>**  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration is working closely with countries, as
well as regional and global partners, to address the mpox outbreak in
Central and Eastern Africa.  
   
President Biden’s announcement of United States’ support to the global
mpox response aligned with the United States’ longstanding partnership
with countries around the world to prepare for health emergencies and to
rapidly respond when they occur. To facilitate more effective global and
regional collaboration on the mpox response, the United States has
worked with partners, including the World Bank, the World Health
Organization, and Brazil as G20 President, to transparently compile and
share all pledges to support the mpox response, identifying resources
that are currently available and remaining financing gaps. This
information, captured in the WHO/World Bank Mpox Financial Tracking
Mechanism (FTM), will help donors and response countries to more easily
identify remaining gaps and sources of financing to fill those gaps.
More than 90% of the financing needs for the response have been met.  
   
**Key Updates on U.S. Support to the Global Mpox Response: **  

1.  **Delivering on Our Commitment to Vaccine Donations:** The U.S.
    government is delivering on our commitment to ensure mpox vaccines
    get to those most at risk, including by making more than one million
    vaccine doses available for distribution in countries that are ready
    to receive them. Vaccine administration is underway using
    U.S.-donated vaccines. On November 6, WHO and Africa Centres for
    Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) allocated the first
    305,000 mpox vaccine doses from President Biden’s one million dose
    commitment to recipient countries via the Access and Allocation
    Mechanism (AAM). With support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and
    its partners, these doses are being shipped as soon as recipient
    countries have accepted the offer of vaccines and confirmed their
    ability to receive, store, and use the vaccine to protect those at
    risk. The remaining 695,000 vaccine doses are also available for
    allocation through the AAM, and will be distributed by the United
    States as soon as impacted countries are ready to receive them. The
    U.S. Government has already delivered 50,000 mpox vaccines to
    Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and 10,000 mpox vaccines to
    Nigeria. Beyond donating vaccine doses, the United States is working
    with partner governments to get those vaccines to the people who
    need them most. For example, in DRC, the U.S. government is
    supporting risk communication and community engagement to raise
    awareness about mpox vaccination and help reach priority
    populations, and coordinating with PEPFAR and other programs to
    leverage existing service delivery channels to reach high-risk
    populations.   
2.  **Increasing Testing and Treatment Capacity:** In addition to
    financial resources and vaccines, the United States has provided
    in-kind donations of more than 65,000 individual mpox tests to
    countries in the region, along with donations of other laboratory
    supplies and personal protective equipment. For example, in DRC the
    U.S. Government has trained 80 field epidemiologists working to
    detect cases, trace and monitor contacts, and increase community
    awareness of mpox. These epidemiologists are collecting and sending
    samples to labs for testing, and at the same time, training
    additional healthcare workers how to do this work. In Burundi, the
    U.S. government is working with partners to expand mpox treatment
    capacity at hospitals in the hardest-hit districts, enabling
    patients to receive the highest-quality clinical care, nutrition,
    and psychosocial support closer to home.  
3.  **Delivering on Our Commitment of Financial Support to Mpox
    Preparedness and Response**: The United States Government, through
    the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S.
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are providing more
    than $57 million to directly support mpox-specific response
    activities, including disease surveillance, laboratory diagnostic
    supplies and testing, clinical case management, risk communication
    and community engagement, infection prevention and control, access
    to vaccines, and research. This funding is in addition to the more
    than $487 million in bilateral global health security (GHS)
    preparedness and response support provided by the United States to
    mpox-affected countries through USAID and CDC. Ongoing global health
    security investments protect the health and livelihoods of people
    living in other countries and prevent health emergencies from
    threatening the United States. The country-by-country breakdown of
    U.S. support to mpox preparedness and response is included in the
    WHO/World Bank Mpox Financial Tracking Mechanism.  
4.  **Strengthening Global Health Security:** The United States is
    working with more than 50 countries around the world – including
    most mpox-affected countries and those at-risk of an mpox outbreak –
    to build stronger global health security capacities, ensuring
    countries are better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to
    health emergencies while protecting U.S. national and homeland
    security. These ongoing partnerships in mpox-affected countries were
    in place before the current outbreak, and have played a critical
    role in supporting the response, especially in the early days before
    mpox-specific response funding became available. Examples of how
    this U.S. global health security support has been used to prevent,
    detect, and respond to the mpox outbreak include:

<!-- -->

1.  In **DRC**, building on multi-year investments to strengthen
    laboratory capacity, the United States supported mpox laboratory
    capacity building and biosafety and biosurveillance training in
    provincial labs, enabling these labs to safely test for mpox. In
    addition, the U.S. Government supported the Ministry of Health to
    develop a national Mpox Risk Communication and Community Engagement
    Strategy, which was rapidly adapted for the clade I mpox outbreak.

<!-- -->

1.  When mpox cases were detected in **Rwanda**, U.S.
    Government-supported partners deployed epidemiologists to 10
    high-risk districts to provide technical guidance to Public Health
    Emergency Management Committees and to train 17 Rapid Response
    Teams. The U.S. Government also supported procurement of test kits
    and provided training for over 12,600 frontline health workers
    across 20 districts in infection prevention and control, mpox
    screening, and case management.

<!-- -->

1.  When the mpox outbreak spread to **Burundi**, U.S.
    Government-supported partners immediately deployed a mobile
    laboratory to provide faster mpox testing. U.S. Government support
    for building mpox laboratory capacity continues in Burundi with the
    recent delivery of additional supplies and training and support to
    decentralize laboratory testing for mpox and improve the speed of
    laboratory confirmation.

<!-- -->

1.  The U.S. Government has partnered with countries in the region to
    help prepare for potential mpox cases before they occur, including
    training in surveillance, lab capacity, and risk communication
    activities. Last month, the Ministry of Health in **Angola** was
    facing a severe shortage of mpox testing kits. Without these
    essential supplies, the country would have had limited, if any,
    visibility into the size of the outbreak. U.S. Government
    representatives delivered diagnostic kits to assist in testing
    nearly 500 suspect mpox cases, helping to confirm the first mpox
    cases in the country. The U.S. Government is supporting
    **Liberia’s** mpox preparedness, including technical assistance for
    surveillance and laboratories as part of broader activities
    responding to zoonoses in Liberia. The U.S. Government is supporting
    **Mozambique** to develop an Mpox Contingency Preparedness and
    Response Plan, and supporting the Ministry of Health to conduct mpox
    outbreak simulation exercises for 11 provinces to help prepare for
    Mozambique’s potential first case.

<!-- -->

1.  **Investing in Research to Advance Mpox Preparedness:** U.S.
    Government research investments to advance mpox preparedness have
    been ongoing for decades. International researchers, including some
    from the U.S. Government, have identified three critical areas of
    research needed to support the mpox response: 1) reduce mpox
    transmission, 2) optimize mpox treatment to save lives, and 3)
    accelerate the development of mpox vaccines, therapeutics, and
    diagnostics. Recent U.S. Government investments in each of these
    areas include:

<!-- -->

1.  **Reducing Mpox Transmission:** Research partnerships between the
    United States Government and the Government of DRC led to the
    identification of the newly-emerged clade Ib mpox, which is driving
    the current regional and global spread of mpox. During the current
    outbreak, the U.S. Government is investing in research to: improve
    case detection, understand clade-specific transmission dynamics,
    identify at-risk populations, characterize mpox disease including
    length of viral shedding to inform vaccination strategies, as well
    as determine the most effective public health interventions to stop
    transmission. Before the current outbreak, U.S. Government
    investments and technical expertise led to the development of
    existing investigational antivirals and the JYNNEOS mpox vaccine
    which, when used broadly in the United States during the height of
    2022 mpox outbreak, significantly reduced the spread of mpox and
    contributed to the drop in new cases reported from hundreds per day
    in 2022 to single digit figures over the last two years.

<!-- -->

1.  **Optimizing Mpox Treatment to Save Lives:** The U.S. Government is
    conducting research, in partnership with the Government of DRC, to
    understand how this disease affects adults, children, infants, and
    pregnant women, as well as the risk factors for severe disease. This
    knowledge is critical to improving standards of care and developing
    safe and effective post exposure prophylaxis. A U.S. Government and
    Government of DRC-supported randomized controlled trial (PALM 007)
    of TPOXX (an antiviral drug developed and approved to treat
    smallpox) in adults and children with clade I mpox found no evidence
    of faster clinical improvement in the TPOXX arm compared to the
    placebo arm. However, PALM 007 did find that optimized standard of
    care resulted in reduced mortality for adults and children with
    clade I mpox. These learnings are being applied to the current
    outbreak.

<!-- -->

1.  **Accelerating the Development of Mpox Vaccines, Diagnostics, and
    Therapeutics:** Currently, there are no licensed mpox vaccines for
    children and adolescents, who are disproportionately impacted by the
    current mpox outbreak in Africa. The U.S. Government study of the
    JYNNEOS mpox vaccine showed that adolescents in the U.S, ages 11-17
    years, have similar immune responses to the vaccine as adults. This
    led to the accelerated emergency approval of JYNNEOS for adolescents
    by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and approval through WHO’s
    pre-qualification process. JYNNEOS has been available in the United
    States for individuals under 18 years through an Emergency Use
    Authorization issued by the FDA in August 2022. The U.S. Government
    is also investing in new mpox diagnostics and mpox therapeutics. For
    example, CDC is working on a new test to better differentiate mpox
    clade I from clade II that can be used by both public and commercial
    laboratories. To improve our current investigational therapeutic
    options, NIH and ASPR are supporting the development of new
    orthopoxvirus monoclonal antibody therapeutic products.

**Key Updates on Domestic Preparedness for Mpox**: The Biden-Harris
Administration has led numerous efforts to prevent and prepare for clade
I mpox in the United States:

1.  **Providing ongoing** c**ommunication and education:** In [December
    2023](https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00501.html), the U.S. CDC
    issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory to U.S. clinicians,
    public health departments, and partners. CDC has since issued
    multiple HAN Health Updates to further increase awareness of clade
    Ib mpox, its distinction from clade II mpox and the less common
    clade Ia, and to provide updated recommendations to prevent, detect,
    and treat both clades of mpox. Following the first case of clade I
    mpox diagnosed in the United States, CDC released an [updated HAN
    advisory](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00519.asp#:~:text=The%20Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention%20%28CDC%29,about%20preventing%2C%20diagnosing%2C%20treating%2C%20and%20reporting%20mpox%20c)
    on November 18, 2024 and a Dear Clinicians letter on December 5,
    2024 to promote the importance of mpox vaccination and increase mpox
    detection nationwide.

<!-- -->

1.  **Assessing risk through modeling**: Throughout the outbreak in
    Central and Eastern Africa, CDC has conducted modeling to assess the
    level of risk to the U.S. public. [The risk to the general U.S.
    public remains
    low](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcfa-qualitative-assessments%2Fphp%2Fdata-research%2Fmpox-risk-assessment%2Findex.html),
    and the risk to men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who have
    sex with MSM is low to moderate (updated November 18, 2024). CDC
    further modeled [the risk of transmission of clade I mpox if
    introduced into MSM
    networks](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/mpox-gbmsm-technical-brief/nov24-update/)
    in the United States. Simulations of 50 U.S. counties identified
    that counties with lower population-level immunity had a greater
    chance of large or prolonged outbreak. CDC is applying these
    findings to target outreach for vaccination promotion efforts to
    counties at higher risk.

<!-- -->

1.  **Strengthening surveillance:** The United States monitors for the
    virus that causes mpox in wastewater samples, which can provide an
    early warning of mpox activity and community spread. In addition,
    aircraft wastewater samples are collected at select U.S. airports
    for early detection of mpox in the U.S. State and commercial
    laboratories have put in place a robust mpox diagnostic testing
    capacity for both clades, and the United States continues to work
    with public health partners to further increase domestic
    surveillance and diagnostic testing capacity.

<!-- -->

1.  **Minimizing risk to travelers:** CDC issued an [updated Level 2
    Travel Health
    Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/clade-1-mpox-central-eastern-africa)
    (THN) for travelers to Central and Eastern Africa recommending that
    travelers practice enhanced precautions and be aware of mpox
    exposure risks and symptoms. The THN also includes vaccination
    recommendations for travelers to affected countries who are eligible
    for vaccination.  
2.  **Vaccination and treatment:** During the 2022 mpox outbreak, the
    Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), part
    of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), distributed
    more than one million vials of JYNNEOS mpox vaccine across the
    United States. Now, the JYNNEOS mpox vaccine is commercially
    available. Individuals interested in vaccination can consult [CDC’s
    guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/vaccines/index.html) and should
    contact their physician, local retail pharmacy, health department or
    community health center for mpox vaccine availability in their
    community. Clinicians should refer to [CDC’s clinical considerations
    for use of vaccine to prevent mpox in both adults and
    children](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/vaccine-considerations/vaccination-overview.html).
    The high standard of care in U.S. health care can greatly improve
    mpox outcomes relative to other parts of the world. Symptomatic
    individuals are highly encouraged to seek care for further
    evaluation and treatment if needed.
