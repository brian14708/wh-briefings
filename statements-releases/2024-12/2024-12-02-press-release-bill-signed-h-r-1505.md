On Sunday, December 1, 2024, the President signed into law:

H.R. 1505, the “No Stolen Trademarks Honored in America Act of 2023,”
which modifies the prohibition on recognition by United States courts of
certain rights relating to certain marks, trade names, or commercial
names.

Thank you to all the Representatives and Senators who helped advance
this legislation for their leadership.
