  \ Individuals on Home Confinement and Pardons for 39 Individuals Convicted of Non-Violent\_\
  Crimes"

America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances. As
President, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who
have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for
Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their
communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for
non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses.

That is why, today, I am pardoning 39 people who have shown successful
rehabilitation and have shown commitment to making their communities
stronger and safer. I am also commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500
people who are serving long prison sentences – many of whom would
receive lower sentences if charged under today’s laws, policies, and
practices. These commutation recipients, who were placed on home
confinement during the COVID pandemic, have successfully reintegrated
into their families and communities and have shown that they deserve a
second chance.

I will take more steps in the weeks ahead. My Administration will
continue reviewing clemency petitions to advance equal justice under the
law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and
provide meaningful second chances.
