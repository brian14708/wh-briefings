title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Securing 235 Judicial Confirmations"
---
 
Today, we reached a major milestone in our efforts to protect our
Nation’s freedoms: the United States Senate confirmed the 235th federal
judge during my presidency – marking the largest number of confirmations
in a single term since the 1980s. This includes one Supreme Court
Justice, 45 Circuit Court Judges, 187 District Court Judges, and two
judges on the Court of International Trade.

These men and women represent the best of America. They are all highly
qualified. And they have had distinguished legal, judicial, and academic
careers.

When I ran for President, I promised to build a bench that looks like
America and reflects the promise of our nation. And I’m proud I kept my
commitment to bolstering confidence in judicial decision-making and
outcomes.

The 235 confirmed judges include a record number of judges with
backgrounds and experiences that have long been overlooked: advocates
for civil rights, workers’ rights, immigrants’ rights, and more. I
appointed the first former public defenders to sit on the Seventh and
First Circuits. I have also put forth men and women who have been
prosecutors and plaintiffs’ attorneys.

In addition, I appointed the most demographically diverse slate of
judicial nominees ever. This includes: the first Black woman and public
defender on the United States Supreme Court, and appointing more Black
women to the Courts of Appeals than all previous administrations
combined. I also appointed the first Hispanic-American judge to serve on
the D.C. Circuit, and the first openly LGBTQ woman on any federal court
of appeals; the first AANHPI judge on the Third and Seventh Circuits;
the first Muslim-American judge to ever serve as a life-tenured judge;
and the first Native Hawaiian woman to ever serve as a life-tenured
judge.

And no matter who they are or where they come from, all of these
appointees are supremely qualified to serve in the role of Judge, and
remain committed to the rule of law and the Constitution.

We reached this milestone thanks to bipartisan support in the Senate,
and as a result of the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer, and Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin.

Judges matter. They shape the everyday lives of Americans, preserving
our freedoms and defending our liberties. They hear cases and issue
rulings on whether Americans can cast their ballots, whether workers can
unionize and make a living wage for their families, and whether children
can breathe clean air and drink clean water.

I am proud of the legacy I will leave with our Nation’s judges. And I am
proud of those who have stepped forward and heeded the call to serve.
