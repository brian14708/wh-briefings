In September, the President announced a surge in security assistance for
Ukraine to put Ukrainian forces in the strongest possible position
before he leaves office. As part of that effort, he directed his team to
fully utilize all funding available for Ukraine’s defense. Today, we are
announcing a $725 million security assistance package for Ukraine, which
includes substantial quantities of artillery, rockets, and air defense
capabilities. The President has directed the Department of Defense to
deliver the materiel to Ukraine rapidly — to ensure that Ukraine has the
equipment it needs to defend itself. Between now and mid-January, we
will deliver hundreds of thousands of additional artillery rounds,
thousands of additional rockets, and other critical capabilities to help
Ukraine defend its freedom and independence. 

In addition to this surge in assistance, the President has authorized a
series of additional steps to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war.
Earlier this year, the President decided to prioritize U.S. air defense
exports for Ukraine, and as a result of this decision, Ukraine has
received hundreds of additional air defense missiles, with more
deliveries on the way. To help Ukraine stabilize its lines in the east,
the President has authorized the provision of non-persistent
anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine as a limited exception to the
Administration’s continuing landmine policy.  In response to the entry
of North Korean soldiers into this war, the President has decided to
adjust permissions on Ukraine’s use of U.S.-provided long-range
missiles. And to disrupt Russia’s war machine, the United States has
implemented major sanctions against Russia’s financial sector, with more
sanctions to follow. 

The President is seeking to put Ukraine in the strongest possible
position, and we will continue to execute upon this strategy in support
of Ukraine and its fight for freedom.
