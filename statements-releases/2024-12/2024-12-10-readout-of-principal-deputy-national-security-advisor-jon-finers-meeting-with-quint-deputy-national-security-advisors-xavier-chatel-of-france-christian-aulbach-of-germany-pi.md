On December 9, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer met
virtually with the Deputy National Security Advisors of France, Germany,
Italy and the United Kingdom.  Mr. Finer discussed with his counterparts
the fall of the Assad regime in Syria and the importance of working
closely together across their respective capitals and with partners in
the region to support the aspirations of the Syrian people and manage
risks associated with the ongoing transition. The group discussed
efforts to reinforce the ceasefire in Lebanon and reach a ceasefire and
hostage deal in Gaza.  Mr. Finer also noted the Biden-Harris
Administration’s efforts to ensure Ukraine has the strongest hand
possible heading into 2025 and to increase costs on Russia for its
continued aggression. The group discussed shared concerns over
democratic backsliding in Georgia, including through last month’s
elections and more recent violence against protestors.
