title: "Statement from National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard on November 2024 PCE\
  \ and Third Quarter 2024\_GDP"
---
 
Today’s report shows that PCE inflation has remained below 2.5% for four
months in a row, while yesterday’s report showed GDP grew by 3.1% in the
third quarter. Growth has been 3% per year on average since the
beginning of 2021, higher than any other presidential term in the
21<sup>st</sup> century. Prices remain too high for working families,
and we will keep fighting to lower costs for families on key items like
housing, groceries, and health care.
