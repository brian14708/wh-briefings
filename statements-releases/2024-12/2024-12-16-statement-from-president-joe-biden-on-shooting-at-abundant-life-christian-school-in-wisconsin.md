title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Shooting at Abundant Life Christian\
  \ School in\_Wisconsin"
---
 
Today, families in Madison, Wisconsin, are grieving the loss of those
who were killed and wounded at Abundant Life Christian School. It’s
shocking and unconscionable.

We need Congress to act. Now.

From Newtown to Uvalde, Parkland to Madison, to so many other shootings
that don’t receive attention – it is unacceptable that we are unable to
protect our children from this scourge of gun violence. We cannot
continue to accept it as normal. Every child deserves to feel safe in
their class room. Students across our country should be learning how to
read and write – not having to learn how to duck and cover.

Jill and I are praying for all the victims today, including the teacher
and teenage student who were killed and those who sustained injuries. We
are grateful for the first responders who quickly arrived on the scene,
and the FBI is supporting local law enforcement efforts. At my
direction, my team has reached out to local officials to offer further
support as needed.

My administration has taken aggressive action to combat the gun violence
epidemic. We passed the most significant gun safety legislation in
nearly 30 years, I have taken more executive action to reduce gun
violence than any other President in history, and I created the
first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. But more is
needed. Congress must pass commonsense gun safety laws: Universal
background checks. A national red flag law. A ban on assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines.

We can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children, their
families, and tears entire communities apart.
