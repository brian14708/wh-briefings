  \ to Fund the\_Government"

A government shutdown heading into the holidays would mean service
members and air traffic controllers go to work without pay, essential
government services for hardworking Americans would be paused, and
economic disruption would occur. 

Following an order by President-elect Trump, yesterday Republicans
walked away from a bipartisan deal and threatened to shut down the
government at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour in order to pave the way to
provide tax breaks for billionaires. This revised legislation does <span
style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> do that. 

While it does not include everything we sought, it includes disaster
relief that the President requested for the communities recovering from
the storm, eliminates the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for
billionaires, and would ensure that the government can continue to
operate at full capacity. President Biden supports moving this
legislation forward and ensuring that the vital services the government
provides for hardworking Americans – from issuing Social Security checks
to processing benefits for veterans — can continue as well as to grant
assistance for communities that were impacted by devastating hurricanes.
