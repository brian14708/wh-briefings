title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on U.S. Support for Ukraine\u2019s\_Defense"
---
 
Today, I am proud to announce nearly $2.5 billion in security assistance
for Ukraine, as the Ukrainian people continue to defend their
independence and freedom from Russian aggression.  

Since Russia launched its further assault against Ukraine in February
2022, the United States has rallied the world to stand with the
Ukrainian people, and it has been a top priority of mine to provide
Ukraine with the support it needs to prevail. Today’s announcement—which
includes an additional $1.25 billion drawdown package for the Ukrainian
military and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative
(USAI) package—builds on this effort and will provide Ukraine with both
an immediate influx of capabilities that it continues to use to great
effect on the battlefield and longer-term supplies of air defense,
artillery, and other critical weapons systems.

As I committed earlier this year, the Department of Defense has now
allocated all remaining USAI funds appropriated by Congress in the
supplemental that I signed in April, and my Administration is fully
utilizing the funding appropriated by Congress to support the drawdown
of U.S. equipment for Ukraine. I’ve directed my Administration to
continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as
possible—including drawing down older U.S. equipment for
Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing
the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our
stockpiles with new weapons. The Department of Defense is in the process
of delivering hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of
rockets, and hundreds of armored vehicles which will strengthen
Ukraine’s hand as it heads into the winter.  At my direction, the United
States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s
position in this war over the remainder of my time in office.
