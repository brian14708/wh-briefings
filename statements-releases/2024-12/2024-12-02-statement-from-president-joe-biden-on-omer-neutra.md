title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Omer\_Neutra"
---
 
Our hearts are heavy today. Jill and I are devastated and outraged to
learn of the death of Omer Neutra, an American citizen, whose body Hamas
has apparently been holding since they killed him during their brutal
terrorist attack on October 7.

Omer was just 21 years old when he was taken by Hamas. He was serving as
a tank commander in an Israel Defense Forces unit that was among the
first to respond to Hamas’s campaign of cruelty— risking his life to
save the lives of others. A Long Island native, Omer planned to return
to the United States for college. He dreamed of dedicating himself to
building peace.

Less than a month ago, Omer’s mother and father joined me at the White
House to share the pain they’ve endured as they prayed for the safe
return of their son – pain no parent should ever know. They told me how
Omer’s grandparents were Holocaust survivors and how their family’s
strength and resilience has been carried through the generations.

During this dark hour—as our nation joins Omer’s parents, brother, and
family in grieving this tragic loss—we pray to find strength and
resilience. And to all the families of those still held hostage: We see
you. We are with you. And I will not stop working to bring your loved
ones back home where they belong.
