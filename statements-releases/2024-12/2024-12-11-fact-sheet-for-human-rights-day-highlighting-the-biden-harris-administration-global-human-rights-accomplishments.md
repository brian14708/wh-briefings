title: "Fact Sheet: For Human Rights Day, Highlighting the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\
  \ Global Human Rights Accomplishments"
---
 
Over the last four years, President Biden and Vice President Harris have
taken action to uphold universal human rights around the world. From
protecting brave individuals defending life and liberty to securing some
of the largest political prisoner releases in recent history, to holding
account those who misuse technologies like commercial spyware for human
rights violations and abuses, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked
to support human rights defenders, civil society and journalists. Three
historic Summits for Democracy generated millions of dollars in
commitments from the U.S., international partners, and the private
sector to support civil society and investments in democratic renewal.
Through our engagement in multilateral organizations, we have held
countries that have violated human rights to account, advanced the
status of women and girls, and safeguarded protection for LGBTQI+ human
rights defenders. The United States is strongest when we protect people
fighting for justice for all at home and abroad through these actions:

*<u>Protected Human Rights Defenders and Secured the Release of
Political Prisoners</u>*

-   **Advocated for the Release of** **Unjustly Detained Individuals
    Globally**.  The U.S. raised international awareness of the plight
    of political prisoners and their families and advocated for the
    release of all unjustly detained individuals worldwide. Notable
    accomplishments included: working with international partners to
    secure the release of 16 unjustly detained prisoners held by the
    Russian government, including four Americans, in the largest
    prisoner swap since the Cold War and securing the release of 357
    Nicaraguan political prisoners, including human rights defenders and
    Catholic leaders.
-   **Empowered Journalists, Civil Society, Workers, and Reform-Minded
    Leaders**.  The Department of State protected journalists and
    promoted media freedom through the Journalism Protection Platform
    and [joint efforts with
    UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-and-united-states-sign-agreement-support-safety-journalists-worldwide?),
    provided direct financial support to almost 900 civil society
    organization (CSOs) in 86 countries through the Lifeline: Embattled
    CSOs Assistance Fund since 2021; promoted inclusive labor markets
    and protecting the rights of all workers in line with the
    [Presidential Memorandum on Advancing Worker Empowerment, Rights,
    and High Labor Standards
    Globally](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/11/16/memorandum-on-advancing-worker-empowerment-rights-and-high-labor-standards-globally/),
    worked with partners to equip young leaders with essential skills,
    such as through the Community of Democracies’ [Youth Democracy
    Network](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-and-the-community-of-democracies-launch-global-youth-democracy-network-to-support-next-generation-democratic-leaders/);
    and elevated the voices of Indigenous youth into global civic
    conversations by establishing the [Indigenous Youth Leadership
    Coalition](https://www.state.gov/indigenous-youth-leadership-coalition-launches-with-arrival-of-inaugural-cohort/).
-   **Supported Local Human Rights Defenders and Organizations through
    USAID’s Powered by the People (PxP) Award.** In 2024, USAID
    channeled over $2.5 million to human rights defenders, and
    organizations protecting and promoting human rights across 28
    countries. This included providing rapid relocation, emergency legal
    assistance, digital security, psychosocial support, and a global
    help desk.
-   **Sustained Support to Human Rights Defenders in Ukraine.** The U.S.
    continued to support human rights defenders working to promote human
    rights and fundamental freedoms around the world. For example, since
    the start of the war, USAID has helped more than 50 civil society
    organizations, including the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties
    (CCL), which documented possible Russian crimes against Ukrainian
    civilians. In recognition of this work, CCL was awarded the Nobel
    Peace Prize in 2022.
-   **Strengthened Civilian Protection.** The State Department elevated
    human rights considerations in security decisions and partnerships,
    including U.S. arms transfers and security trainings, to higher
    standards through efforts such as the Civilian Harm Incident
    Response Guidance (CHIRG).
-   **Expanded Human Rights Programming.** In 2024, USAID provided
    $19.25 million 19 Missions to support human rights defenders and
    address human rights violations and abuses, combat digital
    repression and cyber threats faced by HRDs, enhance protection of
    environmental rights defenders, combat Gender-Based Violence (GBV)
    and trafficking in persons, support access to justice for victims of
    human rights violations, and support comprehensive programming to
    enable persons with disabilities to understand and realize their
    rights. In 2024, USAID’s Justice, Human Rights, and Security Rapid
    Response Award supported 20 USAID Missions nearly $7 million for
    rapid response activities to meet urgent crises.
-   **Worked to protect Human Rights Online.** Outlined best practices
    and actions that online platforms can take to implement for robust
    support for human rights defenders under threat through the
    [Guidance for Online Platforms on Protecting Human Rights Defenders
    Online](https://www.state.gov/recommended-actions-for-online-platforms-to-improve-human-rights-defender-protection/).

*<u>Mobilized Action to Address the Misuse of Commercial Spyware</u>*

-   **Protected Against Commercial Spyware Misuse.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration advanced a whole-of-government approach to curb the
    misuse and proliferation of commercial spyware. The President’s
    [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/27/executive-order-on-prohibition-on-use-by-the-united-states-government-of-commercial-spyware-that-poses-risks-to-national-security/#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20I%20hereby%20establish%20as,foreign%20government%20or%20foreign%20person.)
    set standards and safeguards for the domestic government use of
    these commercial surveillance tools, while the novel application of
    visa restrictions—including dozens of new designations announced
    this week, financial sanctions, and trade restrictions has
    discouraged commercial spyware companies from targeting U.S.
    citizens or undermining human rights globally.  The Administration
    has successfully internationalized this pioneering effort through
    the [Joint
    Statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/18/joint-statement-on-efforts-to-counter-the-proliferation-and-misuse-of-commercial-spyware/)
    on Efforts to Counter the Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial
    Spyware, now endorsed by 22 countries with this week’s formal
    addition of Latvia. The U.S. has also driven global consensus
    through language in the Human Rights Council resolution on *the
    Promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the
    Internet*, which for the first time recognizes the threat commercial
    spyware misuse poses to democratic values and the exercise of human
    rights. The United States has committed $3 million in programming
    for capacity building, research, and advocacy for the private
    sector, academia, and government partners.

*<u>Upheld Human Rights and Accountability</u>*

-   **Expanded Tools for Accountability**.

<!-- -->

-   To date this year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated
    more than 100 individuals and entities associated with human rights
    abuse across more than 20 jurisdictions. These actions targeted an
    array of activities, including national and transnational
    repression, forced disappearances and hostage taking, gender-based
    violence, forced labor and human trafficking, and human rights
    abuses perpetrated by terrorist groups and criminal organizations.
-   The State Department publicly designated over 80 officials for their
    [involvement in gross violations of human
    rights](https://www.state.gov/reports/report-to-congress-on-anti-kleptocracy-and-human-rights-visa-restrictions-public-listing/),
    sanctioning over 240 individuals and entities for serious human
    rights abuses under the [Global Magnitsky Sanctions
    Program](https://www.state.gov/global-magnitsky-act/), and taking
    steps to impose visa restrictions on over 8,000 individuals for
    undermining democracy, repressing marginalized groups, transnational
    repression, and other activity adverse to U.S. interests, including
    additional actions announced today.
-   The State Department also released business advisories to highlight
    the legal, financial, and reputational risks posed to businesses, 
    including  those operating in [Russia and Russia-occupied
    territories of
    Ukraine](https://www.state.gov/russia-business-advisory/), and [Hong
    Kong](https://www.state.gov/hong-kong-business-advisory/).

<!-- -->

-   **Fought Political Repression.** The U.S. Department of the
    Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) worked to target
    political repression in 2024 through related actions in Georgia,
    Iran, Burma, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe.  OFAC designated an
    international assassination network led by a narcotrafficker
    operating at the behest of the Iranian government in January and, in
    March, the designation of a commercial spyware consortium that
    distributed spyware technology that was used to target Americans. 

<!-- -->

-   **Reduced Human Trafficking and Forced Labor.** OFAC focused on
    actions to disrupt human trafficking and forced labor throughout
    2024, including actions targeting the Venezuela-based criminal
    organization; a Syria-based narco-trafficker also under legal
    prosecution for human trafficking; and a Cambodian businessman and
    four companies he owns for forced labor in online virtual currency
    investment cyber scam centers.

<!-- -->

-   **Administered International Justice.**
-   The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) secured historic sentences in
    three high profile cases this year concerning human rights
    violations in
    [Iraq](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/pennsylvania-man-sentenced-prison-torture-and-illegally-exporting-weapons-parts-and-related),
    [Ethiopia](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/human-rights-violator-sentenced-immigration-fraud-and-us-citizenship-revoked),
    and
    [Croatia](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ohio-man-who-concealed-croatian-war-crime-charge-sentenced-prison-immigration-fraud).
    In addition, the Department charged three individuals with fraud
    related to their alleged participation in human rights violations in
    [Rwanda](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/ohio-man-indicted-concealing-his-involvement-rwandan-genocide),
    [Syria](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-syrian-prison-official-charged-immigration-fraud),
    and
    [Bosnia](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-charged-torturing-prisoners).
-   On December 9, 2024, DOJ
    [unsealed](/Users/MMBrinkman/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/CJHUNXYY/oOn%20December%209,%202024,%20DOJ%20unsealed%20an%20indictment%20in%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Illinois%20charging%20two%20high-ranking%20Syrian%20officials%20under%20former%20President%20Bashar%20al-Assad%20with%20war%20crimes.%20The%20indictment%20charges%20the%20former%20Syrian%20intelligence%20officials%20with%20engaging%20in%20a%20conspiracy%20to%20commit%20cruel%20and%20inhuman%20treatment%20of%20civilian%20detainees,%20including%20U.S.%20citizens,%20during%20the%20course%20of%20the%20Syrian%20civil%20war.)
    an indictment in the Northern District of Illinois charging two
    high-ranking Syrian officials under former President Bashar al-Assad
    with war crimes. The indictment charges the former Syrian
    intelligence officials with engaging in a conspiracy to commit cruel
    and inhuman treatment of civilian detainees, including U.S.
    citizens, during the course of the Syrian civil war.
-   On December 5, 2023, following a joint FBI-HSI investigation, DOJ
    indicted four persons affiliated with the Russian military for war
    crimes.  The defendants allegedly interrogated, severely beat, and
    tortured a U.S. national during Russia’s full-scale invasion of
    Ukraine.  The Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District
    of Virginia initiated the case, the first such indictment since the
    amendment of the War Crimes Act.

-   **Empowered Human Rights and Defense.** U.S. Southern Command
    (USSOUTHCOM) dedicated [Human Rights
    Office](https://www.southcom.mil/Commanders-Priorities/Strengthen-Partnerships/Human-Rights/)
    continued human rights training and education for partner forces,
    the implementation of civil-military dialogues including the human
    rights NGO community, and the integration of human rights
    considerations into Command exercises.

<!-- -->

-   **Provided Human Rights and Law of Armed Conflict Training.** The
    Defense Institute of International Legal Studies (DIILS) provided
    Human Rights and Law of Armed Conflict training to foreign security
    partner forces that receive resources and support pursuant to 10
    U.S.C. Sec. 333.  Over the last year, DIILS faculty conducted
    numerous advanced-level trainings across dozens of countries and
    resident courses on a variety of legal topics attended by
    participants from over 70 countries.

*<u>Bolstered Atrocity Prevention and Response</u>*

-   **Issued a National Atrocity Prevention and Response Strategy.** The
    U.S. Government takes timely and effective action to anticipate,
    prevent, and respond to atrocities, in coordination with partner
    governments, and international, civil society, and local partners.
    The White House-led Atrocity Prevention Task Force coordinates these
    efforts and the [United States Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and
    Respond to
    Atrocities](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CSO-2022-SAPRAv2b-FINAL_2022-06-03_508v9-Accessible-06292022a.pdf)
    was launched in 2022 to achieve impact through concerted action in
    countries at risk of atrocities.
-   **Documented Atrocity Risk.** This year’s [Elie Wiesel Act
    Report](https://www.state.gov/2024-elie-wiesel-act-report-to-congress/#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20Department%20of%20State,against%20humanity%20around%20the%20world.)
    reflects several Administration priorities.  As part of ongoing work
    to incorporate women’s rights and inclusion into atrocity prevention
    efforts, the report incorporates gender-based violence as a
    potential early warning sign of atrocities and reinforces that
    conflict-related sexual violence should never be considered an
    inevitable result of armed conflict.  The report also notes U.S.
    leadership in training on how to address atrocity risk and critical
    documentation work through the Conflict Observatory program.

*<u>Engaged Multilateral Institutions to Hold Countries to Account</u>*

-   **Re-Engaged with the UN Human Rights System.** The United States
    rejoined the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to highlight and
    address pressing human rights concerns and to uphold the universal
    values, aspirations, and principles that have underpinned the UN
    system since its founding. We also issued a standing invitation to
    all UN thematic human rights monitors to visit the U.S. and assess
    our human rights record at home.
-   **Called Attention to Concerning Human Rights Situations.** U.S.
    leadership led to the establishment of mechanisms through the UN
    Human Rights Council to investigate human rights violations and
    abuses in situations around the world, including Ethiopia,
    Nicaragua, Iran, Russia, Sudan, and Ukraine.
-   **Kept Human Rights Violators Off UN Bodies.** The U.S. led
    successful efforts to remove Iran from the Commission on the Status
    of Women and deprive Russia of a seat on the Human Rights Council.
-   **Aided Human Rights Integration in Haiti.** U.S. support for the
    Multinational Security mission (MSS) has been critical in responding
    to the crisis in Haiti. The MSS and the Office of the United Nations
    High Commissioner for Human Rights established a partnership focused
    on integrating human rights into security operations since the
    deployment of the MSS to Haiti.
-   **Supported Intersex Persons.** The U.S. supported the first-ever
    [UN resolution on combatting discrimination, violence, and harmful
    practices against intersex
    persons](https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2024/04/big-victory-intersex-people-and-their-rights),
    raising the credibility and influence of intersex advocates and
    their allies and meaningfully updating how gender is understood in
    the UN’s work.

*<u>Addressed Threats Posed by Transnational Repression</u>*

-   **Combatted Transnational Repression**.  The United States worked
    with multilateral partners to raise awareness, counter the threat,
    and promote accountability for acts of transnational repression
    (TNR) —by leading a working group on transnational repression under
    the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism, aiming to raise international
    awareness of the threat TNR poses, affirming our shared commitment
    to countering the threat, and sharing best practices and lessons
    learned. We delivered a [statement on behalf of more than 45
    countries](https://geneva.usmission.gov/2024/06/26/joint-statement-on-transnational-repression/)
    at the 56th Session of the Human Rights Council to address the
    urgent and growing threat of transnational repression, and announced
    the [Khashoggi
    Ban](https://www.state.gov/accountability-for-the-murder-of-jamal-khashoggi/),
    a policy restricting those engaged in TNR from obtaining U.S. visas
    and traveling to the United States.

*<u>Prevented and Responded to Gender-Based Violence</u>*

-   **Preventing and Responding to Gender-Based Violence Globally.**
    Over the last two fiscal years, the United States maintained the
    highest-ever level of investment—$250 million—to address
    gender-based violence globally. This work is guided by the U.S.
    Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally.
    In the third and most recent iteration of the Strategy released in
    2022, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking decisive action to
    further our commitment to prevent and respond to gender-based
    violence globally through programming, policy, and diplomatic
    efforts. The Strategy also made updates to address 21st century
    threats, such as online harassment and abuse, and the ways in which
    climate change exacerbates the risk of gender-based violence.

<!-- -->

-   **Promoted Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence**.
    President Biden issued a historic
    [Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/11/28/memorandum-on-promoting-accountability-for-conflict-related-sexual-violence/)
    on Promoting Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence in
    November 2022 directing federal agencies to marshal sanctions
    authorities to promote justice and accountability specifically for
    conflict-related sexual violence. The Administration has since
    issued nearly two dozen sanctions against perpetrators of
    conflict-related sexual violence around the globe. This year
    included a designation of five armed groups and their leaders in the
    Democratic Republic of the Congo implicated in sexual violence; two
    designations in Haiti, one of a former member of Parliament and one
    of a gang leader responsible for gender-based attacks; an action
    targeting a Rapid Support Forces commander in Sudan who for CRSV;
    and sanctions against three former government of Uzbekistan
    officials for sex trafficking and sexual abuse of minors at a
    state-run orphanage.
-   **Supported Documentation of Sexual Violence.** In June, Vice
    President Harris launched the **Dignity in Documentation
    Initiative**, which provides support for survivor- and civil
    society-led efforts to investigate and document CRSV in line with
    the Murad Code, named for Nobel Laureate and survivor Nadia Murad.
    Today, we are proud to announce additional aligned commitments to
    the initiative, including $8 million from the Department of State
    and $4 million from USAID for a total of over $22 million committed
    to this work.
-   **Countered Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence.** By
    [founding and
    co-leading](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2022/03/18/launching-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/)
    the 14-country Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online
    Harassment and Abuse, the Administration has advanced global
    policies to address online safety for women and girls by shaping a
    range of multilateral policy instruments tackling online harms
    through the G7, G20, APEC, and UN. The Administration has also
    invested at least $15 million in targeted funding to prevent and
    respond to technology-facilitated gender-based violence.  

<!-- -->

-   **Advanced Women, Peace, and Security.** The United States is
    committed to addressing the root causes of violence and conflict as
    a top national security priority. In 2023, the United States issued
    a [U.S. Strategy and National Action Plan on Women, Peace and
    Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/U.S.-Strategy-and-National-Action-Plan-on-Women-Peace-and-Security.pdf),
    which is currently being implemented by the Department of Defense
    (DOD), USAID, the Department of State, and the Department of
    Homeland Security. For example, DOD has engaged in Women, Peace, and
    Security-focused security cooperation activities with Allies and
    partners to ensure meaningful participation of women in decision
    making and ensure that crisis and conflict operations do not
    negatively impact the protection of civilians or their equitable
    access to relief and recovery resources.

<!-- -->

-   **Defended the Rights of Women and Girls.** In October 2022 and
    February 2023, Secretary Blinken announced a new visa restriction
    policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality
    Act (“3C”) to restrict the issuance of visas for current or former
    Taliban members, members of non-state security groups, and other
    individuals believed to be responsible for, or complicit in,
    repressing women and girls in Afghanistan through restrictive
    policies and violence. In December 2023, the U.S. designated two
    individuals under the Global Magnitsky Sanctions Program for
    repressing women and girls in Afghanistan, including restricting
    their access to secondary education. The U.S. remains unwavering in
    our commitment to support the Afghan people, especially Afghan women
    and girls, in their struggle for an inclusive, stable, peaceful
    Afghanistan.

    (AI), humanitarian response and emergency management, and sports.

*<u>Supported and Sustained Democracy</u>*

-   **Inaugurated the Summit for Democracy.** President Biden launched
    the historic [Summit for
    Democracy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/20/fact-sheet-delivering-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-commitment-to-democratic-renewal-at-the-third-summit-for-democracy/)
    in 2021 to strengthen democratic institutions, protect human rights,
    and accelerate the fight against corruption, both at home and
    abroad.  Under President Biden’s leadership, the United States has
    taken concrete steps to advance previous commitments and initiatives

    technology for democracy, media freedom, countering the misuse of
    technology, and improving financial transparency, gender equity and
    equality, and rule of law. 
-   **Fought Anti-Corruption** **Globally.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration established countering corruption as a “core U.S.
    national security interest,” and issued the first-ever [United
    States Strategy on Countering
    Corruption](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/United-States-Strategy-on-Countering-Corruption.pdf).
    Since then, the United States has [taken

    gender issues and women’s rights across its funded portfolio of
    programs to improve women’s engagement with and access to municipal
    services.
-   **Elevated Technology and Democracy:** The Biden-Harris
    Administration set high standards for the government use of
    surveillance technologies, including AI and commercial spyware;
    expanded support for internet freedom technologies and cybersecurity
    that is essential to human rights defenders; and has used
    accountability measures, export controls, and voluntary commitments
    to enlist the private sector to combat authoritarian use of
    technology. Through the [Declaration for the Future of the
    Internet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Declaration-for-the-Future-for-the-Internet_Launch-Event-Signing-Version_FINAL.pdf),

-   The U.S. government launched the Export Control and Human Rights
    Initiative under which 26 countries have subscribed to a Code of
    Conduct by which subscribing states commit to apply export controls
    to prevent the proliferation of goods, software, and technologies
    that enable serious human rights abuses.

    Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial
    Intelligence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/)
    in part to ensure that technology is developed, deployed, and
    governed consistent with universal human rights, the rule of law,

    corruption and violations of human rights in Asia and the Pacific,
    Africa and the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Latin America and
    the Caribbean, including media outlets operating in exile. This
    support allows organizations to continue their operations and
    sustain content production to ensure continued access to
    high-quality journalism. Since 2022, IFPIM has made 45 grants in 22
    countries and territories that cumulatively represent more than $15

    business and human rights.
-   **Supported businesses to advance human and labor rights due
    diligence** by providing new guidance and resources, including a
    Labor Rights InfoHub.  
-   **Promoted access to remedy** and protected stakeholders from
    retaliation in U.S.-supported development finance projects.
-   **Combatted Industry Labor Abuses.** In June 2022, President Biden
    signed the historic [National Security
    Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/06/27/memorandum-on-combating-illegal-unreported-and-unregulated-fishing-and-associated-labor-abuses/)
    on Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing and
    Associated Labor Abuses (NSM-11), directing agencies to put their
    authorities to work to tackle the problem of IUU fishing and
    associated labor abuses in the seafood supply chain. IUU fishing can
    take many forms, ranging from the small-scale misreporting of catch,
    to large-scale, coordinated efforts by transnational crime
    syndicates that may also involve forced labor and other human rights
    abuses.
