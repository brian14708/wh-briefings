Today President Joseph R. Biden Jr. participated in the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Virtual Leadersâ€™ Retreat, hosted by Prime
Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand.  
  
President Biden welcomed the opportunity to directly engage with APEC
Leaders. He underscored the importance the United States places on the
region, noting that we are a Pacific nation and vowing that the United
States will remain deeply engaged in the region for generations to come.
President Biden emphasized the importance of multilateral cooperation
and reiterated his commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. He put
forward a vision for the region that is affirmative, values-based, and
transparent.  
  
President Biden articulated the U.S. approach for ending the pandemic
and outlined our global vaccine strategy, whereby the U.S. is donating
more than half a billion safe and effective vaccines to more than 100
countries in need around the world, several of which are APEC economies.
He made clear that the United States is donating our vaccines, not
selling them, and underscored the importance of not attaching any
political or economic conditions to the provision of vaccines. Our
singular goal remains saving lives. President Biden also discussed the
importance of investing in better global health security and
preparedness so that we are ready the next time we face a pandemic.  
  
On the global economic recovery, President Biden reaffirmed the U.S.
interest in serving as a strong, reliable partner to APEC economies as
we pursue sustained and inclusive growth. He discussed ways to unleash
the economic power of the region and to deepen U.S. economic engagement
throughout the Indo-Pacific, including through the recently announced
Build Back Better World partnership, which will provide high-standard,
climate-aligned, and transparently financed infrastructure to APEC
economies that need support.
