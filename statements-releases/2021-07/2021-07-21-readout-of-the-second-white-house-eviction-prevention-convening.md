title: "Readout of the Second White\_House Eviction Prevention\_Convening"

Today, the White House hosted a second virtual convening to help cities
quickly deliver emergency rental assistance and develop plans to prevent
evictions. The convening highlighted actions taken by cities since the
first summit on June 30<sup>th</sup> and is part of the Biden-Harris
Administration’s [broader
efforts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initiatives-to-promote-housing-stability-by-supporting-vulnerable-tenants-and-preventing-foreclosures/)
to ensure state and local governments disburse the more than $46 billion
dollars in Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) made available to them to
assist households in need. Today, Treasury released [new
data](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0284) on the ERA
program, which showed that more than $1.5 billion in assistance was
delivered to eligible households in the month of June—more than what was
provided in the previous three reporting periods combined. The number of
households served in June grew by about 85 percent over the previous
month and nearly tripled since April.

White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling opened
today’s convening, reaffirming the Biden-Harris Administration’s
commitment to do everything it can to make sure cities and states
provide relief to renters and landlords as the CDC’s eviction moratorium
comes to an end on July 31st. Sperling stressed that the Administration
has provided new flexibilities to get emergency rental assistance out
and that this is the time for state and local officials to step up and
not hide behind being overly cautious or conservative. Officials from
the Department of Treasury then shared best practices and responded to
frequently asked questions about the ERA program and updated guidance.
Speakers from across the country discussed case studies and best
practices on topics such as culturally and linguistically relevant
outreach and ways to improve the delivery of rental assistance programs.
The convening also featured panels focused on how mayors, judges, and
philanthropy can champion local efforts to prevent evictions, as well as
strategies for community and landlord engagement.

Today’s convening builds upon the June 30<sup>th</sup> [White House
Eviction Prevention
Summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/30/readout-of-the-white-house-eviction-prevention-summit/)
which brought together teams from 46 cities to commit to take swift
action to prevent evictions in their jurisdictions.

Public officials speaking at the second convening included:

-   Mayor Tom Barrett, City of Milwaukee
-   Mayor Greg Fischer, City of Louisville
-   Judge Brendan Murphy, Chief Magistrate, Cobb County (GA)
-   Judge Rachel L. Bell, Presiding Judge, General Sessions Court,
    Division VIII, Davidson County (TN)
