title: "FACT SHEET: How the Build Back Better Framework Will Support Women\u2019s\
  \ Employment and Strengthen Family Economic Security"
---
 
Despite the progress our nation has made over the last four months,
there remain two million fewer women in the workforce than there were
before the pandemic struck – taking a toll on our economy and on
millions of families across the country. Thirty years of progress in
women’s labor force participation has been eroded; millions of women are
still struggling to return to the workforce. And while the pandemic has
exacerbated this reality, many of the challenges facing women aren’t
new. Historically, women have typically held jobs with lower wages and
fewer benefits and protections. Women of color are even more likely to
work in jobs that have lower wages and few benefits and protections.  
  
Our economic recovery depends on addressing longstanding discrimination
and barriers that have hampered women—including women of color—from
fully participating in the labor force. One economist finds the
[President’s
plan](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/11/perspectives/biden-build-back-better/index.html),
and especially its investments in the care economy, would increase labor
force participation by almost a full percentage point—with even greater
gains for women—and boost the economy’s real GDP growth by 10 to 15
basis points in the long-term. Increasing women’s labor force
participation is also critical to supporting America’s working families,
including the over 4 in 10 mothers – disproportionately women of color –
who are sole or primary breadwinners for their families, contributing
significantly to their families’ total earnings.  
  
When women are better off, we’re all better off. The Build Back Better
Agenda rests on our commitment to ensuring every American is given a
fair shot to get ahead in this country. It will strengthen our families,
our communities, and our nation by making bold and necessary investments
in women’s employment and ensure a broad and deep recovery – one on
which the success of the entire U.S. economy rests. Our economy cannot
reach its full potential when half of the population is forced to leave
their jobs, cut back on their hours, or unable to access good jobs.
These issues are not simply women’s issues. They are issues that affect
all families, our economy’s stability and growth, and our nation’s
competitiveness.  
  
**<u>Supporting Women’s Caregiving Needs</u>**

Too many American women struggle with the high costs of raising
children, caring for a sick family member, providing long-term care for
people with disabilities or older adults, and addressing the myriad
other caregiving challenges. Although professional care is costly for
families, caregivers themselves – [disproportionately women of color
–](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm) remain some of the [most
underpaid
workers](https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/the-wages-of-care/)
in the country, often having to rely on public income supports to get
by. And, many American women fill the gap in professional caregiving
options by providing unpaid care to their loved ones, often causing them
to reduce working hours, choose lower-paying jobs, or leave the labor
force entirely.  
  
In part due to the [lack of family friendly
policies](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18702), the United States has
fallen behind its competitors in the share of women in the labor force.
The United States is one of the only countries in the world that does
not guarantee paid leave — [95 percent of the lowest wage
workers](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2020/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-march-2020.pdf),
who tend to be
[predominately women ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/meet-the-low-wage-workforce/#:~:text=Low-wage%20workers%20comprise%20a%20substantial%20share%20of%20the,the%20most%20likely%20to%20be%20raising%20children%20%2843%25%29.)and [workers
of
color](https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/paid-leave/paid-family-and-medical-leave-racial-justice-issue-and-opportunity.pdf),
lack any access to paid family leave. Only 57 percent of children under
six years old have parents who report there are good choices for child
care where they live. And, [high
costs](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265126/LTSSOlAmRB.pdf) and
increasing
[shortages](https://books.google.com/books?id=AtYpDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ViewAPI#v=onepage&q&f=false)
of care for disabled and elderly people leave many to rely on unpaid
caregiving – more than one in six adult women are unpaid eldercare
providers. [One
study](https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/livable-communities/old-learn/health/metlife-study-of-caregiving-costs-to-working-caregivers-2011-aarp.pdf)
estimates that women who leave the labor force early to care for elderly
parents lose $330,000 \[1\] in lifetime wages and Social Security
benefits.  
  
Research shows [investments in the care
economy](http://oro.open.ac.uk/50547/1/care_economy_en.pdf) would
increase employment, especially for women, reducing the gender
employment divide. Not only would this support women’s economic
security, it would lead to a more robust and equitable economy. The
President’s Build Back Better plan:

-   **Creates a National Comprehensive Paid Family and Medical Leave
    Program**. The program will ensure workers receive partial wage
    replacement to take time to bond with a new child; care for a
    seriously ill loved one; deal with a loved one’s military
    deployment; find safety from sexual assault, stalking, or domestic
    violence; heal from their own serious illness; or take time to deal
    with the death of a loved one. This program guarantees twelve weeks
    of annual paid parental, family, and personal illness/safe leave,
    and also ensures workers get three days of bereavement leave per
    year. The program will provide workers up to $4,000 a month, with a
    minimum of two-thirds of average weekly wages replaced, rising to 80
    percent for the lowest wage workers. In California, one study found
    that the state’s paid leave law increased new mothers’ likelihood of
    working a year after the birth of their child by [18 percentage
    points](https://equitablegrowth.org/factsheet-what-does-the-research-say-about-the-economics-of-paid-leave/).
    In addition
    [recent](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Citation/2021/04000/Association_Between_Rhode_Island_s_Paid_Family.26.aspx?context=LatestArticles)
    [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32134836/) shows that in
    the short term, paid family leave policies are associated with
    positive health outcomes including [better maternal physical
    health](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25902), infant mortality,
    improved infant attachment and childhood development. Paid family
    leave encourages men and women to take [time
    off](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pam.21894).
    This is crucial in an economy in which [fatherhood increases men’s
    wages](https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-fatherhood-bonus-and-the-motherhood-penalty-parenthood-and-the-gender-gap-in-pay)
    and motherhood decreases women’s (by four percent per child),
    exacerbating the gender wage gap.  
-   **Guarantees access to high-quality, affordable child care for low-
    and middle-income families and offers universal free preschool to
    all three- and four-year old children.** President Biden’s Build
    Back Better plan offers free, high-quality preschool to all three-
    and four-year old children, fully covers the cost of high-quality
    child care for young children for the most hard-pressed working
    families, and ensures that families earning up to 1.5 times their
    state’s median income will pay no more than 7 percent of their
    income for all children under age five. This is estimated to
    increase labor force participation of these parents, and especially
    women, by up to 20 percent. The President’s plan would also make
    permanent the dramatic expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax
    Credit (CDCTC) enacted in the American Rescue Plan. With this
    expanded credit, families can receive up to half of what they spend
    on child care for children under age 13, up to a total of $4,000 for
    one child or $8,000 for two or more children. In addition to
    reducing the cost of child care and freeing up money for other
    spending, child care and preschool programs also increase mothers’
    incomes, as mothers continue working and earn more over time.  
-   **Expands Access to Long-Term Care Services under Medicaid.** In
    addition to caring for children, families feel the financial burden
    of caring for aging relatives and family members with disabilities,
    and there is a financial strain for people with disabilities living
    independently to ensure that they are getting care in their homes.
    At the same time, hundreds of thousands of people who need better
    care are unable to access it, even though they qualify under
    Medicaid. Aging relatives and people with disabilities deserve
    high-quality care that meets their unique needs and personal
    choices. President Biden is calling on Congress to put $400 billion
    toward expanding access to quality, affordable home- or
    community-based care. One [recent
    study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kshen/files/caregivers.pdf)
    finds that for every 2.4 to 3 women whose parent receives formal
    home care through Medicaid, one additional daughter works
    full-time.  
-   **Boosts compensation of child care and home care workers.** About
    nine in ten care workers are women, and nearly [five in
    ten](https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ChildCareWorkersFS.pdf)
    child care workers are women of color. As of 2020, the median [child
    care
    worker](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/childcare-workers.htm)
    made $12.24 per hour and the median [home health and personal care
    aide](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home-health-aides-and-personal-care-aides.htm)
    made $13.02 an hour. On average, child care workers make [23 percent
    below](https://www.epi.org/publication/child-care-workers-arent-paid-enough-to-make-ends-meet/)
    workers who do not work in child care. The President’s plan would
    ensure child care and preschool teachers are paid at least $15 an
    hour and comparable to kindergarten teachers if they have similar
    credentials. The President’s plan to expand HCBS under Medicaid will
    support well-paying caregiving jobs that include benefits and the
    ability to collectively bargain. Investment in higher labor
    standards for care workers improve these jobs and supporting the
    economic security of women who fill them, help close the gender pay
    gap, and attract more workers to the care industry.  
-   **Addresses Maternal and Infant Health Disparities**. The
    Biden-Harris Administration is committed to tackling health
    disparities that are rooted in bias and systemic racism. America’s
    maternal mortality rates are among the highest in the developed
    world, and they are especially high among Black women and Native
    American women— regardless of their income or education levels. The
    Build Back Better proposal would make health insurance for women who
    buy it on their own more affordable by making the American Rescue
    Plan’s premium reductions permanent, saving women $600 a year. It
    also includes a $3 billion investment to improve maternal and infant
    health outcomes. Growing and diversifying the perinatal workforce,
    improving data collection to better understand the causes of
    maternal death and complications from birth, and investing in
    community-based organizations are priorities of this Administration.

**<u>Strengthening Family Economic Security</u>**

When households do not have enough income, they are forced to make
impossible trade-offs between paying for rent, education, healthcare,
and food. These choices have consequences and limit the investments made
in oneself and one’s children. The Build Back Better agenda makes
significant investments to increase household stability and economic
security.

-   **Supports the construction or rehabilitation of over 1 million
    affordable rental housing units in building and small towns across
    the country.** Before the pandemic, HUD estimated that nearly 5
    million female-headed households that didn’t receive federal housing
    assistance paid more than half their income in rent or lived in
    severely inadequate units. The Build Back Better plan would bolster
    funding for successful housing subsidy programs to produce and
    preserve housing that is affordable for very- and extremely-low
    income renters.  
-   **Addresses longstanding public housing capital needs.** Nearly two
    million people across the country live in public housing.
    Approximately 75 percent of households living in public housing
    units are headed by women, and 33 percent of all households are
    headed by women with children. Nearly half of the nearly 1 million
    units of public housing are over 50 years old and many contain lead
    paint, mold, and other health hazards. The President’s plan calls
    for a transformative investment of $40 billion to rehabilitate and
    preserve public housing, addressing residents’ critical health and
    safety concerns. This is not just a safety issue but a racial
    justice issue, as approximately three in four public housing
    residents are people of color.  
-   **Extends the Expanded Monthly Child Tax Credit**. The Build Back
    Better proposal would extend the Child Tax Credit (CTC) expansion
    first enacted in the American Rescue Plan – increasing the credit
    from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child six-years-old and above,
    and from $2000 to $3,600 per child for children under six. This
    means a monthly payment of $300 per month per child under 6 and $250
    a month for each child six and older. Parents can use this tax
    credit on everything from diapers, to putting more food on the
    table, to paying the rent or mortgage. An [estimated 66 million
    children](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/american-rescue-plan-act-includes-critical-expansions-of-child-tax-credit-and)
    (90 percent) and their parents will benefit from this tax credit
    expansion including 9 million Black children and 18 million Latino
    children.  
-   **Supports nutrition security**. Nutrition insecurity has a negative
    and lasting impact on a child’s ability to learn and can put
    children at higher risk for diseases such as diabetes, heart
    disease, and high blood pressure. However, provide adequate
    nutrition can be an incredible financial burden for parents. The
    Build Back Better plan will expand free meals to an additional 9.3
    million children during the school year. Additionally, the plan will
    invest more than $25 billion so that the families of all 29 million
    children eligible for free and reduced-price school meals will
    receive a $75 per child per month benefit to purchase nutritious
    foods during the summer.

**<u>Expanding Education, Training, and Job Opportunities for
Women</u>**

The Build Back Better agenda will ensure that the economy is built on a
foundation of equity, by strengthening the education and workforce
pipeline for more women to obtain high-quality in-demand jobs. These
workforce development investments are based on evidence-based approaches
to supporting workers, including women and people of color. Some of
these approaches include wraparound services –such as child care and
transportation – income supports, counseling, and case management,
paired with high-quality training and effective partnerships between
educational institutions, unions, and employers. These investments will
ensure jobs have fair and equal pay, safe and healthy workplaces, and
that workplaces are free from racial, gender, and other forms of
discrimination and harassment. They will also help more women enroll in
college, reduce their need to rely on student debt, and ensure they have
the supports they need to complete their training program, certificate
or degree.  
  
The President’s Build Back Better plan:

-   **Protects the health, safety and rights of working women.** This
    includes jobs with fair and equal pay, safe and healthy workplaces,
    and workplaces free from racial, gender, and other forms of
    discrimination and harassment. In addition to a $10 billion
    investment in enforcement as part of the plan’s workforce proposals,
    the President is calling for increased penalties when employers
    violate workplace safety and health rules. President Biden is also
    calling on Congress to ensure all workers have a free and fair
    choice to join a union by passing the Protecting the Right to
    Organize (PRO) Act. Unions benefit women’s wages; [in
    2020](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t02.htm), the median
    weekly earning of full-time workers 16+ was $1,067 for women who are
    members of unions, $1,057 for women who are represented by unions,
    and $862 for non-union women. His plan also ensures domestic workers
    receive the legal benefits and protections they deserve and tackles
    gender pay inequities.  
-   **Invests in gender equitable workforce development programs and
    creates new career pathways for women.** As more Americans
    [rejoin](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLF16OV) the workforce
    or [seek out new
    opportunities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2021/05/16/why-millions-of-employees-plan-to-switch-jobs-post-covid/?sh=13afaf2b11e7)
    in a changing economy, we must ensure workers have ready access to
    the skills they will need to succeed, and improve racial and gender
    equity. This includes registered apprenticeships and
    pre-apprenticeships, creating one to two million new registered
    apprenticeships slots, and making these opportunities accessible to
    underserved populations, including women and people of color,
    through successful pre-apprenticeship programs, such as Women in
    Apprenticeship and Non-Traditional Occupations grants that help to
    expand pathways for women to enter and lead in all industries. It
    also includes sector-based training programs that provide millions
    of workers, including women and people of color, with in-demand
    training that leads to high-quality jobs in high-growth and critical
    industries and sectors including information technology, clean
    energy, public health, home care and child care, manufacturing and
    infrastructure. The President’s plan also creates a new subsidized
    jobs program that will invest in the creation of hundreds of
    thousands of subsidized employment opportunities for workers
    adversely affected by the economic crisis, especially public
    assistance recipients, long-term unemployed individuals and the
    underemployed. These investments also include the creation of career
    pathway programs in middle and high schools, prioritizing increased
    access to computer science and high-quality career and technical
    programs that connect underrepresented students to STEM and
    in-demand sectors through partnerships with both institutions of
    higher education and employers.  
-   **Increases the affordability of, access to, and student success in
    education beyond high school.** Women constitute [more than
    half](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/TrendGenerator/app/build-table/2/2?rid=1&cid=13)
    of all college students. At the same time, [a number of women in
    higher education are raising children while pursuing a certificate
    or degree, often at community colleges. More than 20
    percent](https://iwpr.org/iwpr-issues/student-parent-success-initiative/parents-in-college-by-the-numbers/)
    of all college students are parents; of those, over 70 percent are
    mothers and 43 percent are single mothers. Only [8
    percent](https://iwpr.org/iwpr-issues/student-parent-success-initiative/investing-in-single-mothers-higher-education-state/)
    of single mothers who entered college between 2013 and 2017 earned a
    degree or certificate within six years, compared to 49 percent of
    women students who were not parents. Additionally, women are more
    likely to face financial barriers while in college. They are about
    [seven percentage
    points](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=900) more
    likely to take out federal loans than men, and have more federal
    student loan debt on average. Increased financial support for
    college
    [can](https://direct.mit.edu/edfp/article/15/1/164/10312/Does-Broad-Based-Merit-Aid-Improve-College)
    [boost](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272720301171?via%3Dihub)
    completion rates. Increased financial support for college can boost
    completion rates. The President’s $109 billion plan will ensure that
    first-time students and workers wanting to reskill can enroll in a
    community college to earn a degree or credential for free. The
    President is calling for a $39 billion investment in tuition
    subsidies to increase affordability at Historically Black Colleges
    and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and
    Minority-Serving Institutions. The plan also increases the maximum
    Pell Grant award by approximately $1,500 and allows DREAMers to
    access Pell Grants. This will support the 43 percent of women in
    college who rely on Pell to afford their higher education goals.
    Finally, the President is proposing a bold $62 billion grant program
    to invest in completion and retention activities at colleges and
    universities that serve high numbers of low-income students,
    particularly community colleges, which can be used for student
    support services that include child care.  
-   **Advances equity in research and development and science,
    technology, engineering, and math**. Discrimination leads to less
    innovation: one study found that innovation in the United States
    would quadruple if women, people of color, and children from
    low-income families invented at the same rate as other groups.
    Persistent inequities in access to R&D dollars and to careers in
    innovation industries prevents the U.S. economy from reaching its
    full potential. The President’s plan includes $10 billion in new
    grants to HBCUs and MSIs, in addition to, funding for research
    infrastructure (ex. labs) and funding for equity in STEM
    education.  
-   **Helps small businesses, including women-owned businesses and
    minority business enterprises, access capital and scale through over
    $30 billion in investments. **President Biden is calling on Congress
    to invest in federal programs that empower small firms to
    participate in federal research and other research and development
    initiatives that have the potential for commercialization. His plan
    will also support new grantmaking through the Minority Business
    Development Agency that will help small businesses owned by people
    of color access private capital. And, it will enable small
    businesses to drive the economic recovery by investing in the Small
    Business Administration’s 7(a) loan program and Small Business
    Investment Company program.  
-   **Invests in teachers.** For too long, we have underinvested in our
    teachers, [76% of
    whom](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/clr) are women.
    From teachers in training to veteran teachers, the President’s plan
    invests $9 billion in teachers, addressing teacher shortages,
    recruiting more teachers of color, improving teacher preparation and
    supporting teachers. The plan would invest in innovative and
    effective teacher training programs like residencies, that provide
    future teachers with a year of experience before they take charge of
    a classroom, double the annual scholarship for future teachers from
    $4,000 to $8,000 per year, and help schools leverage their expert
    teachers as mentors supporting new and struggling teachers, or as
    leaders in other areas, and compensate them for this work. All of
    these policies will disproportionately benefit women.
