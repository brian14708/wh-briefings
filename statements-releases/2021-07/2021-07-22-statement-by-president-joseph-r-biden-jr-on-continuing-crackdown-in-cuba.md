title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on Continuing Crackdown in\_Cuba"
---
 
I unequivocally condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are
unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort
to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence. The Cuban
people have the same right to freedom of expression and peaceful
assembly as all people. The United States stands with the brave Cubans
who have taken to the streets to oppose 62 years of repression under a
communist regime.  
   
Today, my Administration is imposing new sanctions targeting elements of
the Cuban regime responsible for this crackdown—the head of the Cuban
military and the division of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior driving
the crackdown—to hold them accountable for their actions. This is just
the beginning–the United States will continue to sanction individuals
responsible for oppression of the Cuban people.  
   
As we hold the Cuban regime accountable, our support for the Cuban
people is unwavering and we are making sure Cuban Americans are a vital
partner in our efforts to provide relief to suffering people on the
Island. We are working with civil society organizations and the private
sector to provide internet access to the Cuban people that circumvents
the regime’s censorship efforts. We are reviewing our remittance policy
to determine how we can maximize support to the Cuban people. And we are
committed to restaffing our embassy in Havana to provide consular
services to Cubans and enhance our ability to engage with civil society,
while ensuring the safety of U.S. diplomats serving in Cuba.  
   
Advancing human dignity and freedom is a top priority for my
Administration, and we will work closely with our partners throughout
the region, including the Organization of American States, to pressure
the regime to immediately release wrongfully detained political
prisoners, restore internet access, and allow the Cuban people to enjoy
their fundamental rights.
