title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala Harris on the Supreme Court\u2019s Voting\
  \ Rights Decision in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee"
---
 
Today, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a decision that will
undoubtedly restrict the right to vote, and in particular, for voters of
color. After *Shelby County v. Holder*, this is the second time in the
last eight years that the Supreme Court has dismantled crucial
protections of the Voting Rights Act.  
   
As Justice Elena Kagan stated in her dissent today, the Voting Rights
Act “represents the best of America,” while it “reminds us of the worst
of America” because “it was—and remains—so necessary.” Almost 40 years
ago, Congress worked across party lines to strengthen Section 2 of the
Voting Rights Act in response to an adverse Supreme Court decision. Now,
Congress must act again. Our democracy depends on it.
