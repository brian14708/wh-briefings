title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on DACA and Legislation for\_Dreamers"
---
 
In 2012, the Obama-Biden Administration created the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, which has allowed hundreds of
thousands of young immigrants to remain in the United States, to live,
study, and work in our communities. Nine years later, Congress has not
acted to provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers.

Yesterday’s Federal court ruling is deeply disappointing. While the
court’s order does not now affect current DACA recipients, this decision
nonetheless relegates hundreds of thousands of young immigrants to an
uncertain future. The Department of Justice intends to appeal this
decision in order to preserve and fortify DACA. And, as the court
recognized, the Department of Homeland Security plans to issue a
proposed rule concerning DACA in the near future.

But only Congress can ensure a permanent solution by granting a path to
citizenship for Dreamers that will provide the certainty and stability
that these young people need and deserve. I have repeatedly called on
Congress to pass the American Dream and Promise Act, and I now renew
that call with the greatest urgency. It is my fervent hope that through
reconciliation or other means, Congress will finally provide security to
all Dreamers, who have lived too long in fear.
