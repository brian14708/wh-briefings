title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Passing of Former United States Senator
  of Michigan Carl Levin
---
 
For thirty years, Carl Levin and I served together in the United States
Senate. He was one of the most honorable and decent people I have ever
known.  
  
Brilliant, humble, and principled, Carl earned the trust of his
constituents and colleagues by doing the work. He studied the issues in
detail. He forged consensus across the aisle. He built coalitions across
his beloved Michigan. With his head tilted down, his eyes peering over
his glasses – Carl always looked people straight into their own eyes,
listened with an open mind, and responded the way he saw it with
respect.  
  
Over the course of his thirty-six years in the Senate, the longest
serving Senator in Michigan history, he showed how democracy – and our
institutions – can deliver and work for the people.  
  
As chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee during my
time leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I saw how he built
consensus to protect our national security, uphold our values, and honor
the service of every patriot in uniform. He led on critical issues
ranging from the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, ending the use of
torture, and recognizing the dignity of every American and allowing them
to serve regardless of who they are and who they love.  
  
A son of Detroit who never forgot where he came from, Carl always stood
up for the American worker and the iconic American auto industry. In the
midst of the Great Recession in 2009, with Detroit on its back and the
industry on the brink, we worked together to do everything we could to
get them back up. And they did because of Carl.  
  
On education, gun safety, on holding corporate America accountable for
abuse and greed, and so much more – Carl always looked out for the
people.  
  
Each time I traveled to Michigan with Carl over the years was special.
We would talk about how we both got first involved in public life
because of issues of civil rights and first got started in elected
office – he on the Detroit City Council and I on the New Castle County
Council. We would talk about the beauty of the Great Lakes and the
Detroit RiverWalk. Most of all, we would talk about family.  
  
Jill and I send our love to his beloved Barbara, their children, and
grandchildren. Despite the full life he lived, we know the void his loss
leaves. We know despite his courageous fight against cancer, it still
leaves behind a heavy toll. We’re also thinking of our dear friends, his
brother and former Congressman Sandy Levin, and his nephew Congressman
Andy Levin, who share Carl’s commitment to service and country.  
  
Carl Levin embodied the character of the people of Michigan he served
throughout his remarkable career. Above all, he embodied the best of who
we are as Americans.  
  
May God bless a great American, a dear friend, and a good man.
