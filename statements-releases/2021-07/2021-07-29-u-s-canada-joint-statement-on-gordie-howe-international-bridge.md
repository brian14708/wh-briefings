title: "U.S.-Canada Joint Statement on Gordie Howe International\_Bridge"
---
 
As the importance of infrastructure becomes clearer and clearer, our two
countries have long been partnering on a once-in-a generation project of
critical importance: the Gordie Howe International Bridge. By creating
the first seamless highway-to-highway connection between Windsor,
Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan—the location of one of North America’s
busiest trade corridors—this new crossing, currently under construction,
will for decades serve to secure and spur bi-national economic growth.
Canada is financing the project, and is working hand-in-hand with the
State of Michigan (also co-owner of the Bridge), the Federal Highway
Administration, a private-sector partner, and many other partners
towards a scheduled completion by the end of 2024. As a top
infrastructure priority for both our governments, we’re committed to
continuing our support to ensure the project’s state-of-the-art ports of
entry are fully funded so vehicles can begin crossing the
architecturally stunning cable-stayed structure once completed for the
benefit of our shared prosperity.
