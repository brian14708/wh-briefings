title: Statement by Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology
  Anne Neuberger on Reporting Kaseya Compromises
---
 
Since Friday, the United States Government has been working across the
interagency to assess the Kaseya ransomware incident and assist in the
response. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been
working with Kaseya and coordinating to conduct outreach to impacted
victims. Yesterday, President
Biden [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/03/remarks-by-president-biden-after-visiting-king-orchards/) the
full resources of the government to investigate this incident. We extend
our thanks to the cybersecurity professionals across the FBI, CISA, and
the intelligence community for working around the clock to respond to
this incident.

We urge anyone who believes their systems have been compromised in the
Kaseya ransomware incident to immediately report to the Internet Crime
Complaint Center at <https://www.IC3.gov>. The FBI and CISA will reach
out to identified victims to provide assistance based upon an assessment
of national risk. We also urge you to immediately follow the [guidance
from
Kaseya ](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689-Important-Notice-July-3rd-2021)including
shutting down your VSA servers and implementing [CISA’s and FBI’s
mitigation
techniques](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/07/04/cisa-fbi-guidance-msps-and-their-customers-affected-kaseya-vsa).
