National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today in Washington with
Saudi Vice Minister of Defense Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud
to discuss the longstanding partnership between the United States and
Saudi Arabia, regional security, and the U.S. commitment to help Saudi
Arabia defend its territory as it faces attacks from Iranian-aligned
groups. They also discussed the importance of coordinating efforts to
ensure a strong global economic recovery, to advance the climate agenda,
and to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East. Mr. Sullivan emphasized
the importance of progress in advancing human rights in the Kingdom.
They agreed to stay in touch regularly over the coming months on these
and other issues.
