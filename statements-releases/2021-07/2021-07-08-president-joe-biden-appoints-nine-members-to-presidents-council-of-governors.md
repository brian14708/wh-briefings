title: "President Joe\_Biden Appoints Nine Members to President\u2019s Council of\_\
  Governors"
---
 
Today, President Biden appointed nine governors as members of the
Council of Governors for two-year terms. The bipartisan Council of
Governors serves as the lead forum to strengthen partnerships between
the Federal government and State governments to better protect our
nation from threats to our homeland security and all types of hazards.
The Council focuses on matters of homeland security; homeland defense;
civil support; synchronization and integration of state and Federal
military activities in the United States; and other matters of mutual
interest, including those involving the National Guard. Federal-state
cooperation is critical to protecting communities given the evolving
challenges and threats facing our country, which range from extreme
weather to domestic and international terrorism to a global pandemic.
The Council of Governors will closely coordinate with the Biden-Harris
administration to bolster preparedness, resilience and response on
behalf of all Americans in times of need.  
  
The Council includes leaders across the Federal government: the
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant
to the President for Homeland Security, the Deputy Assistant to the
President for Intergovernmental Affairs, the Commander of U.S. Northern
Command, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and
Global Security, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and the Chief of the
National Guard Bureau. Other key Federal officials such as the
Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are
regular participants.

-   Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer
