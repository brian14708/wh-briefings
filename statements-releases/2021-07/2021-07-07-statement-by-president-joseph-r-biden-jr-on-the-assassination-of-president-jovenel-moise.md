We are shocked and saddened to hear of the horrific assassination of
President Jovenel Moïse and the attack on First Lady Martine Moïse of
Haiti.  We condemn this heinous act, and I am sending my sincere wishes
for First Lady Moïse’s recovery. The United States offers condolences to
the people of Haiti, and we stand ready to assist as we continue to work
for a safe and secure Haiti.
