title: Readout of White House Summit on the Homebuilding Supply Chain
---
 
Today, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development Marcia Fudge, National Economic Council Director Brian
Deese, and Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse hosted a
virtual event with CEOs and senior executives across the housing and
homebuilding sector to discuss supply chain disruptions in the
homebuilding industry as well as shortages in the availability of homes
for purchase and rent. The convening included housing advocates and
representatives from builders, lumber companies, retailers, realtors,
loggers and labor unions, as well as other companies and organizations
focused on homebuilding and affordable housing.    
  
The U.S. has a longstanding shortage of affordable housing, and
participants discussed how that challenge is being exacerbated by
short-term supply chain disruptions across the homebuilding sector,
including fluctuations in lumber prices, supply chain disruptions in
other critical inputs including resins and engineered wood products,
transportation challenges with ports and trucking, and underinvestment
in training and skilled workforce development.   
  
Participants discussed core challenges across the housing supply chain,
and helped Administration leaders collect additional input to inform the
Administration’s near- and medium-term efforts to further strengthen
housing supply. Participants also focused on the demand for housing and
how the President’s necessary and historic investments in the Build Back
Better agenda will expand housing supply and strengthen the country’s
affordable housing stock.
