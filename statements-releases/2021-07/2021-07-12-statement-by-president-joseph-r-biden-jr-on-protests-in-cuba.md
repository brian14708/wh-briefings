title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on Protests in\_Cuba"

We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and
relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of
repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by
Cubaâ€™s authoritarian regime. The Cuban people are bravely asserting
fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of
peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future,
must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear
their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than
enriching themselves.
