title: Statement by Vice President Kamala Harris on the Passing of Civil Rights Leader,
  Bob Moses
---
 
Robert Parris Moses was a soft spoken and big hearted educator and
organizer—for justice, for equality, and for the right to vote. America
has lost a hero. 

When Mr. Moses left New York to travel to Mississippi in 1961, he knew
that he could face jail time and violence. And, indeed, he experienced
both. But Mr. Moses also knew what Black voters faced: poll taxes,
literacy tests, and intimidation. So, he remained undeterred, always
listening closely to the people he worked to help. For years, he
crisscrossed Mississippi, registering thousands of voters and training
young organizers to do the same.

Throughout his life, Mr. Moses continued to teach and to organize.  He
saw a nexus between mathematics literacy and economic empowerment, and
he founded the Algebra Project to expand both knowledge and opportunity
to underserved students.  

My condolences to the Moses family and to all who knew and loved him.
Let us honor his memory by continuing the fight for justice, for
equality, and for the right to vote.
