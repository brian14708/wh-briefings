title: "Readout of President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Call with President Ashraf Ghani\

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Ashraf Ghani
of Afghanistan.  President Biden and President Ghani discussed the
situation in Afghanistan and reaffirmed their commitment to an enduring
bilateral partnership.  President Biden emphasized continued U.S.
support, including development and humanitarian aid, for the Afghan
people, including women, girls, and minorities.  President Biden and
President Ghani agreed that the Taliban’s current offensive is in direct
contradiction to the movement’s claim to support a negotiated settlement
of the conflict.  President Biden also reaffirmed the United States’
commitment to continue supporting the Afghan security forces to defend
themselves. The FY2022 request to Congress for $3.3 billion for the
Afghanistan Security Forces Fund prioritizes:

1.  $1 billion to ensure the Afghan Air Force and Special Mission Wing
    have the capabilities and maintenance to support ongoing combat
    operations, including by delivering additional aircraft, such as the
    three newly-refurbished UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters delivered to
    Kabul on July 16;
2.  $1 billion to purchase and deliver key supplies for Afghan forces
    such as fuel, ammunition, and spare parts; and
3.  $700 million to fund continued payment of salaries for Afghan
    soldiers.

They deplored the loss of innocent Afghan lives, including through
continued targeted killings, as well as displacement of the civilian
population, looting and burning of buildings, destruction of vital
infrastructure, and damage to communication networks. The United States
recently announced more than $266 million in additional humanitarian
assistance and released $300 million in development and other
non-humanitarian assistance to help the Afghan people. The President has
also requested an additional $364 million in development and other
non-humanitarian assistance for the State Department and USAID for
FY2022.    
  
President Biden urged continued work for unity among Afghan leaders on
behalf of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the values on which it
is based.  The two leaders discussed the importance of Afghans coming
together to support their common interest in security and peace, and
President Biden underscored continued U.S. diplomatic engagement in
support of a durable and just political settlement.
