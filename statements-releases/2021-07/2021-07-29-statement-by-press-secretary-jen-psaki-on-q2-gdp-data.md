Today’s GDP data are further proof of the remarkable progress we’ve made
in jump-starting our economy from one of the darkest moments in its
history. With today’s numbers, the U.S. economy has now made up the
losses of the last 18 months and surpassed the pre-pandemic GDP peak. In
doing so, we’ve grown our economy the first half of this year at the
fastest rate in almost four decades, created three million new jobs, and
halved new jobless claims.  
  
Simply put, because of President Biden’s leadership, America is on the
move again. This isn’t an accident: It’s the result of a successful
campaign against the virus and an economic policy that has been focused
squarely on getting help to the working and middle-class Americans who
need it the most – ensuring that we’re rebuilding our economy in a way
that puts them first. This wasn’t preordained – in fact, just one year
ago, CBO predicted real GDP would be 3% below its pre-pandemic peak at
this time. But, thanks to shots in arms and checks in pockets, we’ve
been able to far outstrip that and power a recovery twice as fast as
after the last recession.  
  
That’s the story of this President’s economic plan: taking us from the
worst time for our economy in history to one of the best. And we’re
seeing signs of that across the economy. More than 600,000 jobs created
each month since the President took office, the fastest pace for a new
Administration in history. New unemployment claims slashed in half.
Independent forecasts of economic growth doubled for 2021.  
  
We still have work to do to build our economy back better, and we can’t
be complacent when too many Americans are still facing the squeeze of
economic uncertainty. That’s why the President and his team are going to
continue focusing squarely on curbing this virus and getting our
communities the economic support they need to thrive. And it’s why the
President has put forward a historic, and bipartisan, plan to rebuild
our infrastructure and invest in our global competitiveness, which
cleared an important hurdle last night. And it’s why he’s working with
Democrats to deliver on additional support for our middle class that
will create a fairer, more sustainable, and stronger economy.
