title: 'FACT SHEET: Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration in Central America'
---
 
On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that
called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy.  
  
Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the
Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of
migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  She has worked
with bilateral, multilateral, and private sector partners, as well as
civil society leaders, to help people from the region find hope at home.
 This complements work done throughout the U.S. government over the last
six months to learn lessons from prior efforts and to consult with a
wide range of stakeholders to inform the development of this strategy.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing the Root Causes
Strategy—a core component of our Administration’s efforts to establish a
fair, orderly, and humane immigration system.  This Strategy identifies,
prioritizes, and coordinates actions to improve security, governance,
human rights, and economic conditions in the region.  It integrates
various U.S. government tools, including diplomacy, foreign assistance,
public diplomacy, and sanctions.    
  
Implementation of the Strategy will rely on the expertise of a wide
range of U.S. departments and agencies, with support from governments in
and outside the region, civil society, the private sector, multilateral
organizations, international financial institutions, and the U.S.
Congress.  These partnerships will bolster the impact of the Strategy
through informing programmatic interventions, leveraging political will,
and mobilizing necessary resources. The U.S. government will coordinate
a place-based approach, targeting those areas where migrants are most
likely to come from.  
  
The Strategy is organized into five pillars:

-   Pillar I:  Addressing economic insecurity and inequality;
-   Pillar II:  Combating corruption, strengthening democratic
    governance, and advancing the rule of law;
-   Pillar III:  Promoting respect for human rights, labor rights, and
    free press;
-   Pillar IV:  Countering and preventing violence, extortion, and other
    crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs, trafficking networks, and
    other organized criminal organizations; and
-   Pillar V:  Combating sexual, gender-based, and domestic violence.   

The Vice President and the Administration have already taken action –
notable accomplishments include:

-   **Addressing immediate humanitarian needs including vaccines. ** On
    April 26, Vice President Harris announced $310 million in urgent
    relief to help address the acute factors of migration, including
    from hurricanes, the pandemic, and drought caused by climate change.
     To date, we have allocated over $250 million of the total funds,
    reaching over two million people.  We also provided over 10 million
    COVID vaccine doses to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  
-   **Countering corruption and democratic backsliding.**  Vice
    President Harris has been direct and unwavering in highlighting the
    problems of corruption, the need for reforms, and the vital
    importance of demonstrating commitment to the rule of law, judicial
    independence, human rights, and a strong civil society—including
    during her bilateral meeting in Guatemala.  Working with the
    Department of Justice, the Vice President launched an Anticorruption
    Task Force that will include U.S. prosecutors and law enforcement
    experts to investigate and prosecute corruption cases with a nexus
    in the United States and the region.   
-   **Addressing security concerns of mutual interest.**  Vice President
    Harris launched Anti-Migrant Smuggling Task Forces in both Mexico
    and Guatemala and secured commitments to increase border
    enforcement.  She reached an agreement with the Mexican government
    to restart the high-level dialogue focused on the trafficking of
    weapons and drugs.  
-   **Internationalizing our efforts.  **The Vice President has said,
    “The United States cannot do this work alone.”  She has reached out
    to international partners to highlight the need for increased
    support for Central America and secured commitments from a number of
    countries.  She successfully encouraged the United Nations to
    develop a regional Humanitarian Response Plan to mobilize
    international donor support for the region.   
-   **Working with the private sector.  **On May 27, Vice President
    Harris launched a *Call to Action* for the private sector to make
    new commitments in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to expand
    economic opportunities.  The initial group of 12 companies and
    organizations committed to helping over 13 million people, offered
    to provide $750 million in resources, and established a non-profit
    organization to support economic development efforts in the region –
    The Partnership for Central America.  These initial commitments will
    provide financial services to small business owners, internet access
    and digital banking to rural communities, housing for low-income
    families, and reduced barriers to higher education.  Since
    the launch, over 150 companies and organizations have
    expressed interest in joining the *Call to Action*.
