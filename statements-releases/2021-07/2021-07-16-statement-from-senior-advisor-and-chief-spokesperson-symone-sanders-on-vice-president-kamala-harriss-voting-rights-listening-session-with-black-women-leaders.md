title: "Statement From Senior Advisor and Chief Spokesperson Symone Sanders on Vice\
  \ President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Voting Rights Listening Session With Black Women\_\
  Leaders"
---
 
  
Today – one day before the anniversary of Congressman John Lewis’s death
– Vice President Kamala Harris participated in a listening session on
voting rights with Black women leaders. Several of these leaders worked
closely to organize this week’s Black Women Leaders & Allies Voting
Rights Call to Action.  
   
During the meeting, the leaders shared with the Vice President their
insights and recommendations on how to achieve voting rights reform,
ways we can work together to pass federal legislation that protects all
American voters, and what is at stake for our democracy. The Vice
President thanked the leaders for their work, their commitment to
protecting the fundamental right to vote, and their perspectives.  
   
In her role leading the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts on voting
rights, the Vice President is building a broad, national coalition and
has engaged with Senators and House Members; spoken with national voting
rights and civil rights leaders; traveled the country to meet with local
activists and faith leaders to hear their perspectives and input; met
multiple times with Texas lawmakers who recently broke quorum to block
legislation that would make it significantly harder for the people of
Texas to vote; and brought together diverse Americans to share their
stories and provide input – including a meeting the Vice President held
this week with Disabled voting rights activists who have experienced
barriers to exercising their right to vote.
