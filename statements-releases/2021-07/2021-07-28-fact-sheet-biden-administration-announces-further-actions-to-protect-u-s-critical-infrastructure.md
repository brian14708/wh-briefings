title: "FACT SHEET: Biden Administration Announces Further Actions to Protect U.S.\
  \ Critical\_Infrastructure"
---
 
The Biden Administration continues to take steps to safeguard U.S.
critical infrastructure from growing, persistent, and sophisticated
cyber threats. Recent high-profile attacks on critical infrastructure
around the world, including the ransomware attacks on the Colonial
Pipeline and JBS Foods in the United States, demonstrate that
significant cyber vulnerabilities exist across U.S. critical
infrastructure, which is largely owned and operated by the private
sector. As we have seen, the degradation, destruction, or malfunction of
systems that control this infrastructure can have cascading physical
consequences that could have a debilitating effect on national security,
economic security, and the public health and safety of the American
people.

Currently, federal cybersecurity regulation in the United States is
sectoral. We have a patchwork of sector-specific statutes that have been
adopted piecemeal, as data security threats in particular sectors have
gained public attention. Given the evolving threat we face today, we
must consider new approaches, both voluntary and mandatory. We look to
responsible critical infrastructure owners and operators to follow
voluntary guidance as well as mandatory requirements in order to ensure
that the critical services the American people rely on are protected
from cyber threats. 

Today, President Biden is signing a National Security Memorandum (NSM)
on “Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control
Systems,” which addresses cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and
implements long overdue efforts to meet the threats we face. The NSM:

-   Directs the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity &
    Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of
    Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in
    collaboration with other agencies, to develop cybersecurity
    performance goals for critical infrastructure. We expect those
    standards will assist companies responsible for providing essential
    services like power, water, and transportation to strengthen their
    cybersecurity.  
-   Formally establishes the President’s Industrial Control System
    Cybersecurity (ICS) Initiative. The ICS initiative is a voluntary,
    collaborative effort between the federal government and the critical
    infrastructure community to facilitate the deployment of technology
    and systems that provide threat visibility, indicators, detections,
    and warnings. The Initiative [began in
    mid-April](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/20/statement-by-nsc-spokesperson-emily-horne-on-the-biden-administrations-efforts-to-protect-u-s-critical-infrastructure/)
    with an Electricity Subsector pilot, and already over 150
    electricity utilities representing almost 90 million residential
    customers are either deploying or have agreed to deploy control
    system cybersecurity technologies. The action plan for natural gas
    pipelines is underway, and additional initiatives for other sectors
    will follow later this year.

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) announced a second Security Directive for critical
pipeline owners and operators.  Following the ransomware attack on a
major petroleum pipeline in May 2021, [TSA issued an initial Security
Directive](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/27/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-critical-pipeline-owners-and-operators)
requiring critical pipeline owners and operators to report cybersecurity
incidents, designate a Cybersecurity Coordinator, and conduct a review
of their current cybersecurity practices. This second Security Directive
will require owners and operators of pipelines that transport hazardous
liquids and natural gas to implement a number of urgently needed
protections, including:

-   Implementing specific mitigation measures to protect against
    ransomware attacks and other known threats to information technology
    and operational technology systems within prescribed timeframes.  
-   Developing and implementing a cybersecurity contingency and recovery
    plan.  
-   Conducting an annual cybersecurity architecture design review.

The Federal Government cannot do this alone and securing our critical
infrastructure requires a whole-of-nation effort. This NSM, the ICS
Cybersecurity Initiative, TSA’s Security Directives and the President’s
[Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s
Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/)
are parts of a focused and aggressive continuing effort to address these
significant threats to our nation.
