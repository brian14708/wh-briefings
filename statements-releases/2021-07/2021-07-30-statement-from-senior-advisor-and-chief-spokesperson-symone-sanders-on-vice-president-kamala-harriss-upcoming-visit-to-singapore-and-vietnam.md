  \ President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Upcoming Visit to Singapore and\_Vietnam"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Singapore and Vietnam next
month to strengthen relationships and expand economic cooperation with
two critical Indo-Pacific partners of the United States. During the
trip, the Vice President will engage the leaders of both governments on
issues of mutual interest, including regional security, the global
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and our joint efforts
to promote a rules-based international order. The Vice President will
also affirm and celebrate the strong cultural and people-to-people ties
between the United States and these countries.

President Biden and Vice President Harris have made it a top priority to
rebuild our global partnerships and keep our nation secure, and this
upcoming visit continues that work – deepening our engagement in
Southeast Asia. Vice President Harris will be the first Vice President
to ever visit Vietnam.
