---
 
Today, Senior Advisor and Director of the White House Office of Public
Engagement Cedric Richmond and Senior Director for the Western
Hemisphere for the National Security Council Juan Gonzalez met with
Cuban American leaders to listen to their policy recommendations and
concerns in light of the recent, unprecedented demonstrations unfolding
across Cuba. Administration officials underscored that the White House
is monitoring the situation in Cuba closely and that addressing the
moment and ongoing situation in Cuba is a top priority for the
Administration. They also affirmed what the President said last week:
that the demonstrations are the direct result of a failed communist
government, and reminded the leaders that the President stands firmly
with the people of Cuba. Stakeholders shared what they’ve done over the
last week to help elevate the voices of demonstrators in Cuba and
provided their recommendations for how the U.S. government can help.
Today’s was the latest event in ongoing work the White House has done to
reach Cuban American leaders following the historic demonstrations.
