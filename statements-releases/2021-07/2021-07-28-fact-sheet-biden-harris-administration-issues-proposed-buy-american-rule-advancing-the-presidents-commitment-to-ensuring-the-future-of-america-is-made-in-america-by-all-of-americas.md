*Biden-Harris Administration will increase American-made content in
federal purchases and bolster critical supply chains*

The President believes that when we spend American taxpayers’ dollars,
it should support American workers and businesses. In his first week in
office, President Biden signed Executive Order 14005, *Ensuring the
Future is Made in All of America by All of America’s Workers*, launching
a whole-of-government initiative to strengthen the use of federal
procurement to support American manufacturing.

Since January, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant
progress implementing the President’s vision. In April, the President
[opened](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/biden-names-trade-expert-drake-as-made-in-america-director)
his new Made in America Office. The Office reviews proposed waivers of
Made-in-America laws and helps agencies use taxpayer dollars to support
U.S. manufacturing.

The Made in America Office issued new waiver guidance to fulfill the
President’s commitment to scrutinize and reduce waivers to
Made-in-America laws. The guidance lays out a whole of government agenda
to maximize the use of taxpayer dollars on domestic products and
services to strengthen our industrial base and create good-paying, union
jobs for Americans.

Today, the President is announcing another significant step in
fulfilling his commitment: the most robust changes to the implementation
of the Buy American Act in almost 70 years. His proposal would increase
U.S. content in the products the federal government buys and support the
domestic production of products critical to our national and economic
security.

With $600 billion in annual procurement spending, almost half of which
is in manufactured products from helicopter blades to trucks to office
furniture, the Federal government is a major buyer in a number of
markets for goods and services, including the single largest purchaser
of consumer goods in the world. Leveraging that purchasing power to
shape markets and accelerate innovation is a key part of the Biden
[industrial
strategy](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/transcript/brian-deese-on-bidens-vision-for-a-twenty-first-century-american-industrial-strategy/)
to grow the industries of the future to support U.S. workers,
communities, and firms. As the pandemic has demonstrated, federal
procurement can strengthen the resiliency of domestic supply chains, and
reduce the risk of Americans being adversely impacted by the actions of
competitor nations during a time of crisis.

Today’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking marks just the first set of
proposed reforms to procurement policy under the Biden-Harris
Administration to ensure taxpayer dollars help America’s businesses
compete in strategic industries and help ensure America’s workers
thrive.

The proposed rule directs the following changes to strengthen Buy
American requirements:

-   **“Make Buy American Real” and close loopholes by raising the
    domestic content threshold.** The Buy American statute says products
    bought with taxpayer dollars must “substantially all” be made in the
    U.S. However, today, products could qualify if just 55%–just over
    half—of the value of their component parts was manufactured here.
    The NPRM proposes an immediate increase of the threshold to 60% and
    a phased increase to 75%. This proposal would close a problematic
    loophole in the current regulation, while also allowing businesses
    time to adjust their supply chains to increase the use of
    American-made components. If adopted, this change would create more
    opportunities for small- and medium-sized manufacturers and their
    employees, including small and disadvantaged enterprises, from all
    parts of the country. To support this work, the Small Business
    Administration has created a new manufacturing office in its federal
    contracting division.
-   **Strengthens domestic supply chains for critical goods with new
    price preferences.** As the pandemic made clear, supply chain
    disruptions can impact the health, safety, and livelihoods of
    Americans—leaving us without access to critical goods during a
    crisis. Some products are simply too important to our national and
    economic security to be dependent on foreign sources. The NPRM
    proposes applying enhanced price preferences to select critical
    products and components identified by the Critical Supply Chain
    review, mandated under E.O. 14017, and the pandemic supply chain
    strategy called for under E.O. 14001. These preferences, once in
    place, would support the development and expansion of domestic
    supply chains for critical products by providing a source of stable
    demand for domestically produced critical products.
-   **Increases transparency and accountability in Buy American rules.**
    Reporting challenges have hampered implementation of Buy American
    rules for decades. Currently, contractors only tell the government
    if they meet the content threshold rather than reporting the total
    domestic content in their products. The NPRM proposes to establish a
    reporting requirement for critical products. The new reporting
    requirement would bolster compliance with the Buy American Act and
    improve data on the actual U.S. content of goods purchased. More
    complete and accurate data would be used to target future
    improvements to support America’s entrepreneurs, farmers, ranchers,
    and workers— and along the way, create good jobs and resilient
    communities.

**<u>THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS ALREADY BUYING AMERICAN</u>**

The Biden-Harris Administration has not waited for new rules to go into
place in order to Buy American. At his first Cabinet meeting, the
President made it clear that supporting U.S.-based manufacturing through
procurement was a top priority. Agencies have delivered.

As part of the whole-of-government initiative, today, agencies are
highlighting more than $2 billion in new purchases to support the
manufacturing of innovative technologies and products in America.

-   **The Department of Energy** acquired new electric vehicles for its
    fleet, all of which were manufactured in the US or have batteries
    that were produced at US facilities. The Department will also
    purchase steel products, advanced computing, and hazardous materials
    isolation equipment manufactured in Texas, Iowa, Idaho, Louisiana,
    South Carolina, Ohio, Connecticut and Wisconsin.
-   **The General Services Administration (GSA)** worked with 8(a) small
    business to procure energy efficient technologies for federal
    facilities. These contracts are a part of GSA’s Green Proving Ground
    program, which tests emerging technologies at federal facilities in
    order to help them scale and become viable in the market.
-   **The Department of Defense** funded prototypes to sustainably
    source critical minerals and to create a new training hub with the
    Department of Energy to increase the productivity of the U.S.
    machine tool base.
-   **NASA** added new project recipients to its programs to rapidly
    acquire lunar delivery services from American companies to further
    U.S. capabilities for science, exploration, or commercial
    development of the Moon and to demonstrate a commercially-developed
    habitable space station elements with the potential to transition to
    free-flying, self-sustaining commercial destinations in low earth
    orbit.
-   **The Office of Naval Research** issued Phase 1 awards for a Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project to accelerate the pace,
    security and quality of autonomous vehicles.
-   **The Department of Labor** purchased $1.5 million of Made in
    America products, spanning a range of needs from office furniture to
    state of the art testing equipment to ensure America’s mines and
    other workplaces are safe.
-   **The Army Corps of Engineers** Mississippi Valley Division issued
    over $42 million in new contracts to help make communities more
    storm and flood resistant and to improve the flow of goods along the
    Mississippi River to support the region’s manufacturers.

These purchases are aligned with the President’s commitment in his Build
Back Better legislative proposal to strengthen R&D, manufacturing and
grow jobs in the industries of the future, including through a $48
billion commitment to federal procurement of clean energy and clean
technologies.

The President’s COVID-19 response has also advanced his Buy American
strategy by increasing U.S. capacity to produce critical products.

-   In March, the Department of Defense and Department of Health and
    Human Services procured over $22 million in American-made cloth face
    masks for communities hard-hit by the pandemic.
-   In May and June, the Department of Defense purchased more than $1.8
    billion in U.S.-made COVID treatment and testing supplies.
-   In addition, since February, we have invested more than a billion
    dollars in expanding American production capacity for critical
    pandemic response throughout the healthcare supply chain to meet
    current and future needs.

The President’s Build Back Better agenda will continue this work through
its call for $30 billion to prevent and prepare for future pandemics.

Beyond direct purchasing, the Biden-Harris Administration is making
investments in workforce training and small business supports that will
bolster the President’s Made in America agenda. As noted above, SBA has
created a new manufacturing office to help small manufacturers access
federal contracts, financing, and business development support. The
office will coordinate activities across the Agency in response to the
President’s Executive Orders on Made-in-America, supply chain
resiliency, and racial equity.

The Department of Labor invested $430 million in workforce training and
apprenticeships in June this year, including grantees focused on
bolstering the domestic manufacturing workforce. The funding supports
programs across the country, including in Colorado, Texas, California,
Michigan, Idaho and Nevada. These investments will ensure that as the
manufacturing sector expands, workers will be able to transition quickly
and succeed in good-quality jobs.
