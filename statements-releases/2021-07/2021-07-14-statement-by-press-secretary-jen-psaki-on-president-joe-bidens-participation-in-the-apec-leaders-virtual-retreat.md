On Friday July 16, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will participate in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Virtual Retreat, where
Leaders will discuss ending the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting the
global economic recovery, hosted by Prime Minister Ardern of New
Zealand. The President’s participation will demonstrate U.S. leadership
in the Indo-Pacific region and the President’s commitment to
multilateral institutions.  As President Biden’s first engagement with
many of the APEC Leaders, particularly those in Southeast Asia, he will
emphasize the importance he places on the region as well as his vision
for a free and open Indo-Pacific. He will provide an update to Leaders
on what the U.S. is doing to serve as an arsenal of vaccines for the
region and to support all those suffering from COVID-19. He will also
advance an economic agenda that promotes our shared prosperity,
leverages the economic potential in the region, and builds inclusive and
resilient economies.
