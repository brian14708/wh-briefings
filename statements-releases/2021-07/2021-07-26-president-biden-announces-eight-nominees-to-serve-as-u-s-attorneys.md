President Biden is announcing eight nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys
across the country, officials who will be indispensable to upholding the
rule of law as the top federal law enforcement officials for their
districts.

These individuals—many of whom are historic firsts—were chosen for their
devotion to enforcing the law, their professionalism, their experience
and credentials in this field, their dedication to pursuing equal
justice for all, and their commitment to the independence of the
Department of Justice.

The President has launched a comprehensive effort to take on the uptick
in gun crime that has been taking place for the last 18 months—putting
more cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and
cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys as
the chief federal law enforcement officers in their district is
important for these efforts.
