title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on CDC\_Guidance"

When I ran for President, I promised to be straight with you about
COVID—good news or bad. And I promised to follow the science. That
strategy has worked: in my first six months in office, we’ve given out
over 300 million shots—and have 60% of adults fully vaccinated and
nearly 70% started on vaccinations. Cases are down, and deaths are down
dramatically. One estimate suggests that our rapid deployment of the
vaccine has saved 100,000 American lives—perhaps more.

Today’s announcement by the CDC—that new research and concerns about the
Delta variant leads CDC to recommend a return to masking in parts of the
country—is another step on our journey to defeating this virus. I hope
all Americans who live in the areas covered by the CDC guidance will
follow it; I certainly will when I travel to these areas.

Today, the CDC also reaffirmed that we can safely reopen schools this
fall—full time. Masking students is inconvenient, I know, but will allow
them to learn and be with their classmates with the best available
protection.

Most importantly, today’s announcement also makes clear that the most
important protection we have against the Delta variant is to get
vaccinated. Although most U.S. adults are vaccinated, too many are
not. While we have seen an increase in vaccinations in recent days, we
still need to do better.

On Thursday, I will lay out the next steps in our effort to get more
Americans vaccinated. Vaccinations are free, safe, and effective to
every American. They’ve been available to every adult in this country
for more than three months—at locations within 5 miles of 90% of the US
population.

By following the science, and by doing our part by getting vaccinated,
America can beat COVID. In the meantime, more vaccinations and mask
wearing in the areas most impacted by the Delta variant will enable us
to avoid the kind of lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, and
disruptions we faced in 2020. Unlike 2020, we have both the scientific
knowledge and the tools to prevent the spread of this disease. We are
not going back to that.
