title: "Vice President Kamala\_Harris Statement on the Anniversary of Congressman\
  \ John Lewis\u2019s\_Death"
---
 
Today marks the one-year anniversary of the passing of Congressman John
Lewis. As we mourn his loss, we reflect on the legacy of an American
hero. Congressman Lewis fought tirelessly for our country’s highest
ideals: freedom and justice for all, and for the right of every American
to make their voice heard at the ballot box.    
  
I had the privilege of joining Congressman Lewis in Selma, Alabama for
what would be his final walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where, 55
years earlier, he and many others were beaten bloody by state troopers
as they marched for the right to vote.    
  
Today, the fight is not over. The right to vote remains under attack in
states across our nation. And the best way to honor Congressman Lewis’s
legacy is to carry on the fight – by passing the John Lewis Voting
Rights Advancement Act as well as the For the People Act, and by helping
eligible voters no matter where they live get registered and vote, and
have their vote counted.  
  
As the Congressman knew well, our democracy is stronger when everyone
participates—and it is weaker when people are left out.
