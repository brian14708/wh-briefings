title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration Blueprint for a Fair, Orderly and Humane\
  \ Immigration\_System"
---
 
The United States can have an orderly, secure, and well-managed border
while treating people fairly and humanely.

In January, the Biden-Harris Administration
[launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-sends-immigration-bill-to-congress-as-part-of-his-commitment-to-modernize-our-immigration-system/)
a broad, whole of government effort to reform our immigration system,
including sending to Congress legislation that creates a new system to
responsibly manage and secure our border, provide a pathway to
citizenship, and better manage migration across the Hemisphere.

In the six months since, the Administration has made considerable
[progress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/15/action-the-biden-harris-administration-has-taken-to-address-the-border-challenge/)
to build a fair, orderly, and humane immigration system while continuing
to call on Congress to make long overdue reforms to U.S. immigration
laws. We successfully processed over 12,500 people who had been returned
to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols. We expanded lawful
pathways for protection and opportunity, including the Central American
Minors (CAM) program to reunite children with their parents in the
United States. We strengthened collaborative migration management with
regional partners, including through a new Human Smuggling and
Trafficking Task Force to disrupt and prevent migrant smuggling and
human trafficking operations. And we continue to deter irregular
migration at our Southern border.

The Biden-Harris Administration has accomplished this and more while
reckoning with the prior Administration’s cruel and reckless immigration
policies, which exacerbated long-standing challenges and failed to
securely manage our border. Case in point: the total number of unique
encounters at the Southern border to date this fiscal year remains below
the total number of unique encounters to date during fiscal year 2019
under the Trump Administration.

Today the Administration is releasing a blueprint that outlines the next
steps Federal agencies will be taking to continue implementing the
President’s transformative vision for a 21st century immigration system
that secures the border, fairly and efficiently considers asylum claims,
strengthens regional migration management efforts in North and Central
America, and addresses the root causes of migration from Central
America. Success in building this fair, orderly, and humane immigration
system won’t be achieved overnight, especially after the prior
Administration’s irrational and inhumane policies, but this
Administration has a blueprint to get there and is making real progress.

We will always be a nation of borders, and we will enforce our
immigration laws in a way that is fair and just. We will continue to
work to fortify an orderly immigration system.

**ENSURING A SECURE, HUMANE AND WELL-MANAGED BORDER**

The United States can allow people to exercise their legal right to
apply for asylum while also reducing irregular migration and maintaining
an orderly, secure, and well-managed border.

-   **Making better use of existing enforcement resources.** Since
    fiscal year 2011, U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP)
    discretionary budget has grown from $9.9 billion to $15 billion in
    FY 2021. The President’s Budget redirects resources from a needless
    border wall to make robust investments in smarter border security
    measures, like border technology and modernization of land ports of
    entry, that are proven to be more effective at improving safety and
    security at the border. These investments will serve as a force
    multiplier to the over 19,500 Border Patrol Agents currently helping
    secure our Nation’s borders and the over 25,500 CBP Officers working
    at our land, air, and sea ports. The investments will also
    facilitate more robust and effective security screening to combat
    human smuggling and trafficking and the entry of undocumented
    migrants.
-   **Improving the expedited removal process for those who arrive at
    the border.** The Administration is working to improve the expedited
    removal process at the border to fairly and efficiently determine
    which individuals have legitimate claims for asylum and other forms
    of protection. Asylum and other legal migration pathways should
    remain available to those seeking protection. Those not seeking
    protection or who don’t qualify will be promptly removed to their
    countries of origin.
-   **Facilitating secure management of borders in the region** by
    providing training and technical assistance, supporting the
    improvement of border infrastructure and technology, and promoting
    collaborative migration and border management approaches.
-   **Strengthening anti-smuggling and anti-trafficking operations** by
    working with regional governments to investigate and prosecute
    individuals involved in migrant smuggling, human trafficking, and
    other crimes against migrants. In April 2021, DHS announced
    Operation Sentinel, a new operation targeting organizations involved
    in criminal smuggling.
-   **Bolstering public messaging on migration** by ensuring consistent
    messages to discourage irregular migration and promote safe, legal,
    and orderly migration.

**IMPLEMENTING ORDERLY AND FAIR PROCESSING OF ASYLUM APPLICATIONS**

The Administration is committed to fairly and efficiently considering
asylum claims. Asylum and other legal migration pathways should remain
available to those seeking protection. But those not seeking protection
or who don’t qualify will be returned to their country of origin.

-   **Establishing a dedicated docket to consider asylum claims.** The
    Administration has set up a special immigration court docket to
    promptly and fairly consider the protection claims of certain recent
    arrivals.
-   **Further improving the efficiency and fairness of the U.S. asylum
    system** by authorizing asylum officers to adjudicate asylum claims
    for those arriving at the border and establishing clear and just
    eligibility standards that harmonize the U.S. approach with
    international standards. The Administration has already begun to
    rescind Trump administration policies and decisions that unjustly
    prevent individuals from obtaining asylum. On June 16, the
    Department of Justice reversed two of the former administration’s
    rulings severely restricting asylum protections for victims of
    domestic and gang violence.
-   **Maximizing legal representation** and legal orientation programs
    by working closelywith pro bono legal service providers. The
    President’s FY 2022 Budget requests $15 million to provide
    representation to families and vulnerable individuals, as well as
    $23 million to support DOJ legal orientation programs.
-   **Reducing immigration court backlogs** by ensuring priority cases
    are considered in a timely manner and hiring more immigration
    judges. The FY 2022 Budget requests an additional 100 immigration
    judges and provides support for additional court staff to ensure the
    efficient and fair processing of cases.  The Department of Justice
    also restored the discretion of immigration judges to
    administratively close cases in another step to ensure priority
    cases are considered in a timely manner.

**STRENGTHENING COLLABORATIVE MIGRATION MANAGEMENT WITH REGIONAL
PARTNERS**

The United States seeks to expand U.S. and multilateral efforts to
address the dire humanitarian situation in Central America and
strengthen regional collaborative migration management.  The United
States believes that all individuals should be able to have a safe,
stable and dignified life within their own countries, while ensuring
that asylum and other legal migration pathways remain available to those
who need them.

-   **Providing humanitarian support to address the acute needs that
    pressure individuals to abandon their homes**.  U.S. efforts will
    address food insecurity and malnutrition, mitigate the impacts of
    successive droughts and food shortages, promote protection for
    vulnerable individuals, and provide materials to support rebuilding
    of homes and schools damaged by the hurricanes.  The United States
    will also work with the United Nations to mobilize international
    support for the deteriorating situation in the Northern Triangle. As
    part of these efforts, the United States in April
    [provided](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/apr-27-2021-united-states-announces-increased-assistance-people-of-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras)
    $255 million in assistance to meet immediate and urgent humanitarian
    needs for people in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, refugees,
    other displaced people, and vulnerable migrants in the region.
-   **Expanding access to international protection** to provide safety
    to individuals closer to their homes by building and improving
    national asylum systems, enhancing efforts to resettle refugees, and
    scaling up protection efforts for at-risk groups.
-   **Establishing Migration Resource** **Centers** in the Northern
    Triangle countries with the support of international organizations
    and in coordination with governments in Central America to provide
    referrals to services for people seeking lawful pathways for
    migration and protection.  The centers also provide referrals to
    reintegration support for migrants returned from the United States
    and other countries.
-   **Restarting and expanding the Central American Minors (CAM)
    program** to provide children the opportunity to receive protection
    and reunite with parents in the United States. In March 2021, the
    United States reopened the CAM program and, in June 2021, expanded
    it to additional categories of eligible U.S.-based relatives who can
    petition for their children.
-   **Expanding refugee processing in the region**, including in-country
    processing in Northern Triangle countries, and helping international
    organizations and local non-governmental organizations to identify
    and refer individuals with urgent protection needs to the U.S.
    Refugee Admissions Program and other resettlement countries. The
    U.S. Department of State and Department of Homeland Security have
    resumed interviewing individuals via the Protection Transfer
    Arrangement (PTA) to expand protection for vulnerable nationals of
    El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
-   **Expanding access to temporary work visas in the region. ** DHS
    announced a supplemental increase of 6,000 H-2B visas for temporary
    non-agricultural workers from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador in
    FY 2021. The Administration is also exploring ways to enhance access
    to H-2A visas for temporary agricultural workers when there are
    insufficient qualified U.S. workers to fill these jobs, while
    ensuring strong labor protections for all workers.  The
    Administration will also encourage other governments to develop and
    expand regional labor migration programs that protect workers’
    rights and allow access for individuals to find meaningful,
    temporary work.
-   **Reducing immigrant visa backlogs. ** The United States aims to
    reduce the backlog of immigrant visa applications for Northern
    Triangle nationals as quickly as possible.

**INVESTING IN CENTRAL AMERICA TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION**

We cannot solve the challenge at our border without addressing the lack
of economic opportunity, weak governance and corruption, and violence
and insecurity that compel people to flee their homes in the first
place.  The impact of two major hurricanes in late 2020, a prolonged
drought, and COVID-19 have aggravated these long-standing challenges. 
The FY 2022 Budget requests $861 million to address the root causes of
migration.    

-   **Addressing economic insecurity and inequality** by investing in
    programs that foster a business-enabling environment for inclusive
    economic growth; enhancing workforce development, health, and
    education; and building resilience to climate change and food
    insecurity so individuals can find economic opportunity at home. The
    U.S. will also work with stakeholders to increase trade and
    diversify industry, as well as with the private sector to build on
    the *Call to Action* to catalyze investments in the region and
    support economic development.
-   **Combatting corruption and strengthening democratic governance** by
    working with governments, civil society, and independent media to
    improve government services, increase transparency, promote
    accountability and respect for human rights, sanction corrupt
    actors, and provide protection to at-risk youth, victims of
    violence, and other marginalized populations.
-   **Promoting respect for human rights, labor rights and a free
    press** by working with governments and civil society to strengthen
    legal frameworks and build institutional capacity, hold perpetrators
    accountable, promote labor rights compliance, and ensure citizens
    have access to information from independent sources to inform their
    choices.
-   **Countering and preventing violence, extortion, and other crimes**
    by strengthening accountable law enforcement, focusing on crime
    prevention, and encouraging regional cooperation to address shared
    criminal threats.

-   **Combatting sexual, gender-based and domestic violence** by working
    with governments and civil society to prevent and prosecute violence
    and support victims.

While President Biden can implement significant parts of this strategy
within his executive authority, **<u>Congress must also act.</u>** 
Millions of noncitizens call our country home.  Immigrants are key a key
part of our communities and make significant contributions to our
economy.  Over the past year, millions of immigrants have risked their
health to work side by side with other Americans to perform jobs that
are essential to the functioning of the country.  They are Americans in
every way but on paper.  The American public supports a path to
citizenship and a fair and efficient legal immigration system that
welcomes talent from around the globe and allows families to reunite and
make a life in our country.

**Congress should pass** through reconciliation or other means:

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">The U.S. Citizenship Act
    (H.R. 1177/S. 348)</span> that reunites families, gives businesses
    access to a workforce with full labor rights, and creates a path to
    citizenship for those already living and working in the United
    States.  These critical reforms, coupled with measures to address
    the root causes of migration from Central America, will relieve
    pressure at the border by dissuading irregular migration.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Dream and Promise Act
    (H.R. 6) and Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 1603)</span> to
    create a path to citizenship for Dreamers, TPS recipients, and
    farmworkers. Both bills passed the House with bipartisan support. 
    They will protect millions of families, children, and essential
    workers who live, work, study, and worship in our communities.
