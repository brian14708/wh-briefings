title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Attack on United Nations\
  \ Compound in\_Herat"
---
 
The United States strongly condemns the attack on the United Nations
compound in Herat, Afghanistan that resulted in the death of an Afghan
guard. The United Nations in Afghanistan is a civilian entity focused on
supporting peace efforts, promoting the rights of all Afghans and
providing humanitarian and development assistance. Attacks against
civilian UN personnel and facilities are prohibited under international
law.  
  
We reiterate our call for an immediate reduction in violence in
Afghanistan, and for all regional actors to encourage the parties to
return to negotiations without delay so that the Afghan people can
achieve a durable and just political settlement that brings the peace
and security they deserve.
