President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
of Ukraine to the White House on August 30, 2021. The visit will affirm
the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and
territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression in the
Donbas and Crimea, our close cooperation on energy security, and our
backing for President Zelenskyy’s efforts to tackle corruption and
implement a reform agenda based on our shared democratic values.
