  \ Sullivan\u2019s Meeting with Iranian-American Journalist and Activist Masih\_\
  Alinejad"
---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Iranian-American
journalist and activist Masih Alinejad and her husband Kambiz Foroohar.
During the meeting, Mr. Sullivan expressed concern for Ms. Alinejad’s
family and colleagues who are detained in Iran. He affirmed the U.S.
Government’s strong continued support for Ms. Alinejad’s work to advance
universal human rights, particularly her tireless efforts on behalf of
women, the Iranian people, and all those unjustly detained by the
Iranian government. Mr. Sullivan noted with concern the growing practice
of authoritarian regimes such as Iran targeting dissidents, activists,
and journalists across international borders, including within the
United States. The U.S. Government will continue to strenuously oppose
these illegal actions, which violate human rights and threaten the
rules-based international order.
