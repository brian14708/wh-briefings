title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to\_Lebanon"
---
 
On August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441, the President declared a
national emergency with respect to Lebanon pursuant to the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States constituted by the actions of certain
persons to undermine Lebanon’s legitimate and democratically elected
government or democratic institutions; to contribute to the deliberate
breakdown in the rule of law in Lebanon, including through politically
motivated violence and intimidation; to reassert Syrian control or
contribute to Syrian interference in Lebanon; or to infringe upon or
undermine Lebanese sovereignty.  Such actions contribute to political
and economic instability in that country and the region.

Certain ongoing activities, such as Iran’s continuing arms transfers to
Hizballah — which include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems —
serve to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and
economic instability in the region, and continue to constitute an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  For this reason, the national emergency
declared on August 1, 2007, must continue in effect beyond August 1,
2021.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency with respect to Lebanon declared in Executive Order
13441.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
July 20, 2021.
