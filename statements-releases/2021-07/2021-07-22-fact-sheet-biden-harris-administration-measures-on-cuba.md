title: "FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Measures on Cuba"
---
 
*“The United States stands with the brave Cubans who have taken to the
streets to oppose 62 years of repression under a communist regime.”*

*– President Biden*

The world watched on July 11 as tens of thousands of Cuban citizens
marched in cities across Cuba to demand freedom from both the pandemic
and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they
have been subjected by Cuba’s authoritarian regime. The United States
stands with the Cuban people, and therefore addressing the moment and
the ongoing situation in Cuba is a top priority for the Biden-Harris
Administration. At President Biden’s direction, the United States is
actively pursuing measures that will both support the Cuban people and
hold the Cuban regime accountable.  

**Holding the Cuban Regime Accountable**  
On July 22, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned one Cuban individual and one Cuban
entity for serious human rights abuse, pursuant to Executive Order
13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human
Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human
rights abuse and corruption around the world. This action targets the
Cuban Minister of Defense and the Brigada Especial Nacional del
Ministerio del Interior of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior for their
role in facilitating the repression of peaceful, pro-democratic protests
in Cuba that began on July 11.

**Engaging the International Community**  
The Administration remains deeply concerned about the welfare of the
hundreds of protestors who have been unjustly detained and disappeared
simply for demanding their most fundamental rights.  The President
continues to call for the swift release of those peaceful protestors who
have been unjustly detained. The Administration is also actively engaged
with the Organization of American States (OAS), the United Nations, and
our international partners to collectively condemn the violence and
repression upon the Cuban people for demanding freedom.  
  
**Ensuring Cuban Citizens Have Internet Access**  
The Administration is actively collaborating with the private sector to
identify creative ways to ensure that the Cuban people have safe and
secure access to the free flow of information on the Internet. The
President continues to call on Cuba’s leaders to reinstate and to
maintain access to all Internet and telecommunications services for all
people within its border, and condemns the use of partial or complete
Internet shutdowns and network restrictions imposed by the Cuban
Government, which restricts the exercise of human rights and disrupts
access to essential services. The intentional blocking of access to the
Internet should be strongly condemned by the international community.  
  
**Listening to Cuban American Leaders**  
The Administration has been consistent in its belief that
Cuban-Americans are the best ambassadors for freedom and prosperity in
Cuba. The Administration will continue to meet with Cuban American
leaders and stakeholders as they work to help elevate the voices of
demonstrators in Cuba, and provide their recommendations for how the
U.S. government can help.  
  
**Reviewing the Remittances Policy**  
The Administration is focused on letting families support one another,
by maximizing the flow of remittance payments to the Cuban people. This
is a complex issue that requires a measured and thoughtful approach in
coordination with experts that will help to inform the Administration’s
policy.  The Administration’s guiding principle is ensuring that funds,
to the greatest extent possible, get to the Cuban people without a
portion of the proceeds being siphoned off by the regime. The President
remains concerned that remittances do not reach their intended
recipients, including some of the most vulnerable populations on the
island, and instead are being used as a stopgap to treat their
government’s failures.   
  
**Restaffing U.S. Embassy Havana**  
The Administration is working to enhance our ability to provide Consular
services to the Cuban people given their dire circumstances under an
oppressive authoritarian regime. The re-staffing of our Embassy in
Havana will serve to enhance our diplomatic, civil society, and Consular
service engagement all of which are part of our demonstrated effort to
support the Cuban people and their desire for freedom. The
Administration is also mindful of the fact that USG personnel have
suffered grave injuries while posted to Cuba. Before augmenting our
staff in Havana we must do our utmost to ensure that they can safely and
securely serve in Cuba.
