title: "FACT SHEET: U.S. Assistance to\_Haiti"
---
 
Haiti is a partner of the United States and we have continually sought
to provide support for Haiti’s safety, security, and development. In
January 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration announced $75.5 million in
bilateral development and health assistance for a wide range of issues,
including democratic governance, health, education, agricultural
development, and pre-election activities. The United States is working
with the Government of Haiti to deliver the first 500,000 doses of
Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to the people of Haiti—the first major
international delivery of COVID doses to Haiti, with plans to share more
doses.  
  
Since the 2010 earthquake, the United States has made available over
$5.1 billion for assistance to Haiti to support life-saving
post-disaster relief as well as longer-term recovery, reconstruction,
and development programs.  
  
The United States remains committed to helping the Haitian people build
a better future and is doing so in the following areas:  
  
**Investigation Assistance**

-   In the aftermath of the assassination of President Moise, the
    Department of Justice, together with the Department of Homeland
    Security, is providing assistance to support the Haitian authorities
    in conducting a thorough investigation of the July 7 attack.  
     
-   The Department of Justice, along with its U.S. government partners,
    will continue to support the Haitian authorities in its review of
    the facts and circumstances surrounding this heinous attack.  
     
-   The Department of Justice will also investigate whether there were
    any violations of U.S. criminal law in connection with this matter.

**Security Assistance**

-   Strengthening Haiti’s law enforcement capacity is a key U.S.
    priority. We have provided $312 million in assistance between
    2010-2020 alone to strengthen law enforcement and the capacity of
    the Haitian National Police to maintain peace and stability, and to
    respond effectively to civil unrest while respecting human rights.  
     
-   As a direct result of support to the HNP School, trained officers
    increased from less than 10,000 in 2010 to nearly 15,000 officers
    today. The Department of State supports seven embedded subject
    matter experts to specialized HNP units to enhance the institution’s
    capability to support safer communities, more secure borders, and to
    prevent civil unrest.    
     
-   In response to a recent request from the Government of Haiti for
    security support:  
      
    DHS is sending experts from the Transportation Security
    Administration (TSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
    Security Agency (CISA) to work with their Haitian counterparts in
    improving aviation and critical infrastructure security, as well as
    to provide support securing the upcoming elections.  
      
    State is deploying an advisor to the HNP judicial police and
    bringing onboard an advisor to the HNP Inspector General.  These
    advisors help the HNP improve the integrity of processing
    allegations of corruption, human rights abuses, and police
    misconduct.  Their critical investigative capacity-building support
    will complement U.S. federal law enforcement assistance.  
      
    State is supporting training and procuring vehicles, radios, and
    protective equipment to build the capacity of the HNP to protect
    Haitians from violence.   
     
-   We are also encouraging Haiti to take a holistic approach to
    countering gangs and are providing $5 million to strengthen the
    HNP’s capacity to work with communities to resist gangs. 
    We encourage Core Group members and key international partners to
    consider contributing to combatting insecurity in Haiti.

**Elections Assistance**

-   USAID is currently supporting pre-election activities that are
    intended to lay the foundation for upcoming legislative and
    presidential elections. USAID is providing more than $3 million to
    the Consortium for Elections and Political Processes Strengthening,
    which includes the National Democratic Institute, International
    Republican Institute, and International Foundation for Electoral
    Systems.   
     
-   These activities include focusing on improving electoral
    administration, strengthening the competitiveness of political
    parties, educating voters on electoral processes, promoting
    electoral transparency, and ensuring inclusive voter
    participation.   
     
-   USAID is providing technical assistance to Haiti’s Provisional
    Electoral Council (CEP) through this Consortium to build the
    capacity of electoral authorities to conduct credible elections.
    This includes technical assistance for strategic planning,
    information technology, and training for CEP staff, Communal
    Electoral Office and Departmental Electoral Office staff.

**Health and Humanitarian Assistance**

-   The United States also provides urgent humanitarian assistance via
    independent UN and NGO partners to help the most vulnerable people
    in Haiti. An estimated 4.4 million people in Haiti need humanitarian
    assistance as a result of years of civil unrest, economic
    instability, and recurrent natural disasters including hurricanes,
    droughts and a devastating earthquake in 2010.  While humanitarian
    assistance does not address the root causes of Haiti’s economic and
    political situation, it does help alleviate suffering and meet
    urgent needs of the Haitian people.  
     
-   **Improving access to primary health care services:** USAID is the
    largest bilateral health donor in Haiti. Our assistance has
    increased access to and quality of basic healthcare in 164 clinics
    reaching over 4 million of the most vulnerable among Haiti’s
    population of 11 million.  With our support, the country is
    containing the spread of HIV, reducing the prevalence rate to under
    two percent in the past decade.  
     
-   **USAID support underpins the public health sector:** USAID
    represents 25% of total health spending in Haiti.  These investments
    benefit the entire health system by ensuring quality health services
    are available to the population, with a focus on children, mothers,
    and other vulnerable populations, while strengthening the capacity
    of the Haitian government to manage the public health care system.  
     
-   **Improving nutrition through food fortification:** With USAID
    support, all Haitians now have access to staple foods fortified with
    iron, folic acid, zinc, vitamin A, and iodine. These nutrients are
    essential to reduce the number of people with dietary deficiencies,
    improve child health outcomes, and will help generations of Haitians
    grow to be healthier, more productive members of their
    communities.  
     
-   **Vaccinating children against the diseases that drive child
    mortality:** Ninety-four percent of infants between 0 and 11 months
    have received their full complement of routine vaccinations in
    USAID-supported areas, thereby preventing diseases such as
    diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, compared to the national vaccine
    coverage rate of 41 percent.  
     
-   **Ensuring pregnant mothers receive the care they need:** In areas
    that receive USAID health investments, 89 percent of pregnant women
    gave birth with the assistance of a skilled health care worker (a
    significant factor in reducing maternal and child deaths), while
    this rate was only 42 percent nationally.  
     
-   **Reducing HIV rates and ensuring HIV care and treatment during the
    COVID-19 pandemic:** USAID has helped reduce the HIV prevalence rate
    in Haiti to under 2% in the past decade. We offer life-saving
    antiretroviral treatment to more than 80% (123,000) of people living
    with HIV (PLHIV).  USAID has helped Haiti to adopt innovative drug
    distribution and dispensing methods, and limit unnecessary COVID-19
    risk exposure to PLHIV. These methods include multi-month
    dispensing, community drug distribution, group services such as
    psycho-social support groups, and mothers’ clubs implemented
    remotely online or by phone.  
     
-   **Modern Teaching Facility provides world-class training for health
    professionals:** USAID completed a modern teaching facility for
    doctors and nurses housing the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy,
    School of Nursing, and Lab Technician School, which now provides
    training to more than 1,000 students each year.  
     
-   **Re-building the premier teaching hospital in Haiti:** USAID and
    the French government are helping to rebuild Haiti’s national
    teaching hospital (HUEH), the country’s main public tertiary
    hospital which collapsed due to the 2010 earthquake. USAID
    contributed $25 million towards the reconstruction and are planning
    to offer an additional $10 million towards its completion that is
    scheduled for 2024.  
     
-   **Southern Clinic Rehabilitation: **USAID support resulted in the
    rehabilitation of five clinics in the south of Haiti impacted by
    Hurricane Matthew, enabling approximately 100,000 people to receive
    clinical care services. 

**Temporary Protected Status (TPS)**

-   In May, DHS announced a new designation of Haiti for Temporary
    Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months. Secretary Mayorkas made this
    decision after consulting with interagency partners and carefully
    considering the extraordinary and temporary conditions in Haiti,
    including the political crisis and human rights abuses; serious
    security concerns; the COVID-19 pandemic’s worsening of a dire
    economic situation and lack of access to food, water, and
    healthcare; and the continuing negative effects of the 2010
    earthquake. Such conditions prevent Haitian nationals and habitual
    residents from returning safely.  
     
-   Both existing TPS beneficiaries and new applicants must have been
    continuously residing in the United States since May 21, 2021, to be
    eligible for TPS. The TPS designation does not benefit Haitian
    nationals attempting to enter the United States after May 21, 2021.
    The United States is continuing to strictly enforce existing
    immigration laws and border security measures. Those who have newly
    arrived in the United States after the May 21, 2021, announcement
    are not eligible for TPS.  
     
-   We anticipate that the Federal Register notice putting the
    Secretary’s designation of Haiti for TPS for 18 months into effect
    will be published within the coming days.
