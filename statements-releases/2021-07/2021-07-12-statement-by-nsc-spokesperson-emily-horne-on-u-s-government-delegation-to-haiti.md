On July 11, a United States interagency delegation with representatives
from the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security,
Department of State, and National Security Council traveled to Haiti in
response to the Haitian government’s request for security and
investigative assistance following the July 7 assassination of Haitian
President Jovenel Moïse. The delegation reviewed the security of
critical infrastructure with Haitian government officials and met with
the Haitian National Police, who are leading the investigation into the
assassination. The delegation also met with Acting Prime Minister Claude
Joseph and Prime Minister-Designate Ariel Henry in a joint meeting, as
well as Senate President Joseph Lambert, to encourage open and
constructive dialogue to reach a political accord that can enable the
country to hold free and fair elections. In all their meetings the
delegation committed to supporting the Haitian government as it seeks
justice in this case and affirmed the United States’ support for the
people of Haiti in this challenging time. The United States stands with
Haiti in becoming a safer, more democratic country.
