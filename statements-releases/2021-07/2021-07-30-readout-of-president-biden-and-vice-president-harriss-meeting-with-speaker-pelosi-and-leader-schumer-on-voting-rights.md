title: "Readout of President\_Biden and Vice President Harris\u2019s Meeting with\
  \ Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer on Voting\_Rights"
---
 
President Biden, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, and Leader
Schumer reaffirmed their commitment to democracy, and to the For the
People Act (H.R.1, S.1) and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act
(H.R.4). Recognizing the challenges ahead, the four leaders agreed on
the importance of advancing legislation reflecting the priorities and
values of those two bills, having them pass the House of Representatives
and the Senate, and withstand constitutional challenge. The President,
Vice President, Speaker, and Senate Leader agreed on the moral
imperative of passing legislation to protect against voter suppression,
electoral subversion, dark money, and partisan gerrymandering, and will
continue working together toward that goal urgently.
