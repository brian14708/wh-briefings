title: "Statement from Senior Advisor and Chief Spokesperson Symone Sanders on Vice\
  \ President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Tribal leaders and Leaders from American\
  \ Indian and Alaska Native Communities about Voting\_Rights"
---
 
Today Vice President Kamala Harris hosted a discussion in her ceremonial
office to engage with Tribal leaders and leaders from American Indian
and Alaska Native communities about voting rights. She was joined by
Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. The Vice President thanked the
participants for their work to protect voting rights, and they discussed
ways to make voting more accessible.  
   
During the meeting, the leaders shared how Native Americans have long
faced challenges to exercise their fundamental right to vote–from the
long distance voters must travel to reach their polling places to
anti-voter laws that directly impact Tribal communities. The leaders
also shared how they are engaging voters–and in particular young
voters–in their communities, by connecting the issues they care about to
their vote.  
   
In her role leading the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts on voting
rights, the Vice President is working with a broad coalition to protect
and strengthen the right to vote. The Vice President has convened
Americans from all walks of life to share their stories and provide
input – including a meeting the Vice President held last week with poll
workers to hear about their experiences helping voters cast their ballot
and have their ballots counted.  
   
The leaders who participated in today’s meeting included:

-   Secretary Deb Haaland, (Pueblo of Laguna)
-   President Kevin Killer, (Oglala Lakota Nation) (SD)
-   Allie Young, (Dine’ or Navajo Nation) (AZ)
-   Chairwoman Shelly Fyant, (Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes)
    (Bitterroot-Salish) (MT)
-   Julie Kitka, (President of the Alaska Federation of Natives)
    (Chugach Eskimo Village of Nuchek) (AK)
-   Prairie Rose Seminole, (Three Affiliated Tribes of Mandan Hidatsa
    and Arikara) (ND)
