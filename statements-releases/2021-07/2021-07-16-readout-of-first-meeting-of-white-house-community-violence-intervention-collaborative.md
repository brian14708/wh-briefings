title: "Readout of First Meeting of White\_House Community Violence Intervention\_\
  Collaborative"
---
 
Yesterday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House
Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez convened the
inaugural meeting of The White House Community Violence Intervention
(CVI) Collaborative, a 16-jurisdiction cohort of mayors, law
enforcement, CVI experts, and philanthropic leaders committed to using
American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to increase
investment in their community violence intervention infrastructure.
Investing in evidence-based, community violence interventions to reduce
gun violence is a key pillar of President Biden’s comprehensive strategy
to prevent and respond to gun crime.

The Collaborative will spend the next 18 months strengthening and
scaling the jurisdictions’ community violence intervention
infrastructure to reduce gun crime and promote public safety. The effort
will include peer-to-peer learning and community-based evaluations to
strengthen the existing evidence base for community violence
interventions. National experts and federal agencies will provide
training and technical assistance to help communities assess their
existing public safety ecosystem, identify gaps, and build the capacity
to expand programming that saves lives—both this summer and beyond.

During the meeting, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice stressed that
through American Rescue Plan funding and other investments, cities have
a historic opportunity to invest in building out their community
violence prevention and intervention infrastructure. Intergovernmental
Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez thanked mayors and other participants
for their leadership and underscored the value of sharing best practices
and lessons learned through the Collaborative.

Several mayors in attendance highlighted their efforts to support
community violence interventions through the use of American Rescue Plan
funds, and how the Collaborative will allow them to strengthen their
programs. Community violence intervention experts, who will be lending
their decades of expertise to the Collaborative, noted the historic
nature of this White House initiative.
