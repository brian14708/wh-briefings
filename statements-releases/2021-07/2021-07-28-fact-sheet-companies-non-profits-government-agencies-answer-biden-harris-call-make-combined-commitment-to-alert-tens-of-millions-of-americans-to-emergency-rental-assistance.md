title: "FACT SHEET: Companies, Non-Profits, Government Agencies Answer Biden-\u2060\
  Harris Call: Make Combined Commitment to Alert Tens of Millions of Americans to\
  \ Emergency Rental\_Assistance"
---
 
Major companies, non-profits, and government agencies from the Social
Security Administration to the Department of Veterans Affairs, to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have answered the
Biden-Harris Administration’s Call to Action to spread the word and
alert Americans that emergency rental assistance is available.  The
combined commitments announced today – part of an ongoing all-out push
to make sure tenants and landlords take advantage of federal rental
assistance to help cover rent, utilities, and other housing costs and
keep people in their homes – could reach tens of millions of Americans.

The continued call to action coincides with the launch of a new rental
assistance finder produced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB). Americans who may be behind on rent can go to
[ConsumerFinance.gov/RentHelp](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/?utm_source=vanity&utm_medium=outreach&utm_campaign=renthelp)
and input information on their location to find local rental assistance
programs in their area and apply for assistance.

Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, billions of dollars in federal
rental assistance is available to renters who are behind on housing
costs, as well as landlords who have struggled during the pandemic. The
Administration is building on a whole-of-government effort and engaging
a wide variety of stakeholders to spread awareness of the CFPB’s new
tool, as well as the resources available to assist tenants and
landlords.

Emergency rental assistance is available to tenants in all 50 states,
Washington, D.C., territories, and in Tribal areas, and will continue to
be available after the expiration of the CDC eviction moratorium on
August 1, 2021. The continued Call to Action builds on the [groundwork
laid over the past several
months](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initiatives-to-promote-housing-stability-by-supporting-vulnerable-tenants-and-preventing-foreclosures/)
by the Administration to engage renters and landlords, including hosting
two virtual convenings with thousands of participants to share best
practices on eviction prevention and build local plans of action,
streamline guidance for the rental assistance program to make it easier
and more efficient, and engage agencies across the federal government to
help get the word out to households in need.

program, [visit the unified federal housing assistance portal hosted by

Agencies across the federal government, non-profit groups, faith-based
organizations, and private sector companies are responding to the

expect that these efforts will reach tens of millions of Americans.
