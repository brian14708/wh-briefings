title: Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of
  the Senate on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Transnational
  Criminal Organizations
---
 
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to significant
transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581
of July 24, 2011, under which additional steps were taken in Executive
Order 13863 of March 15, 2019, is to continue in effect beyond July 24,
2021. 

The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have
reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of
international political and economic systems.  Such organizations are
becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States;
they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign
governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening
democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining
economic markets.  These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent
civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other
dangerous persons.

The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  For these
reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national
emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal
organizations declared in Executive Order 13581, under which additional
steps were taken in Executive Order 13863.

Sincerely,

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
