title: Readout of White House Meeting with Congressional Hispanic Caucus
---
 
Today, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese met with the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) to discuss the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Framework and the President’s legislative priorities.
During a productive meeting, Deese and members of the CHC spoke about
how elements of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, including
investing in clean drinking water, public transit, and high speed
internet, would directly benefit the Latino community. Deese underscored
the President’s two-track strategy and commitment to the rest of his
agenda being pursued in the budget resolution and a reconciliation bill,
and thanked the members for being partners in the fight to advance
racial equity in underserved communities.
