  \ Rights Organizations"

President Biden and Vice President Harris met today with leaders from
legacy Black civil rights organizations. The group discussed the wave of
anti-voter legislation that has recently passed or is pending in state
legislatures across the country and the path forward to protect the
right to vote. The group also discussed steps the Administration
recently announced to address the rise in gun violence and the status of
the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that is currently being
negotiated in the Senate. The President and Vice President reiterated
that they will continue to push for Congress to pass critical
legislation that protects the right to vote and combats subversion of
the election process, while continuing to utilize all existing
authorities in an all-of-government effort to ensure full voter
participation and elections that reflect the will of the people.
