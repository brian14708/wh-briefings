title: "FACT SHEET: The Collaborative Migration Management\_Strategy"
---
 
On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that
called for the development of a Collaborative Migration Management
Strategy (Migration Strategy).  Over the last six months, the
Administration has consulted with partner governments, Members of
Congress and their staff, international organizations, civil society
organizations, labor unions, and the private sector to inform its
development.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing the Migration
Strategy.  It is the first U.S. government strategy focused on
strengthening cooperative efforts to manage safe, orderly, and humane
migration in North and Central America.  In line with our Nation’s
highest values, the Migration Strategy contributes to a humane and
secure approach by improving regional cooperation to manage migration,
expanding protection, and enhancing access to lawful pathways for
migration.  It is driven by the U.S. government’s belief that all
individuals should be able to find safety and achieve a stable and
dignified life within their own countries.  When that is not the case,
asylum and other legal migration pathways should be available to those
who need them.  
  
The United States has strong national security, economic, and
humanitarian interests in promoting safe, orderly, and humane
migration.  By enhancing humanitarian support, regional protections, and
investing in migration management, the United States will help build a
more stable region, strengthen legal pathways for those who must
migrate, and reduce irregular migration.  
  
The Migration Strategy includes the following lines of effort:

-   Stabilize populations with acute needs
-   Expand access to international protection
-   Expand access to protection in countries of origin
-   Improve and expand temporary labor programs in the region with
    worker protections
-   Assist and reintegrate returned persons
-   Foster secure and humane management of borders
-   Strengthen regional public messaging on migration
-   Expand access to lawful pathways for protection and opportunities to
    the United States

Implementation of the Migration Strategy will integrate various U.S.
government tools, including diplomacy, foreign assistance, public
messaging, and U.S. immigration initiatives.  It will rely on the
expertise of a wide range of U.S. departments and agencies, with support
from governments in and outside the region, international organizations,
civil society, the private sector, multilateral organizations,
international financial institutions, and the U.S. Congress.  These
partnerships will bolster the impact of the Migration Strategy through
informing programmatic interventions, leveraging political will, and
mobilizing necessary resources.
