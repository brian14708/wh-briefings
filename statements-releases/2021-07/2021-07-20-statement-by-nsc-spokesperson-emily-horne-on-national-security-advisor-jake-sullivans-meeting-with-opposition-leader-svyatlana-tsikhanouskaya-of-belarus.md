National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with democratic
opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya of Belarus. Mr. Sullivan
conveyed American support for the people of Belarus and respect for the
courage and determination of the opposition, including Mrs.
Tsikhanouskaya, in the struggle for democracy and human rights.  The
United States, together with partners and allies, will continue to hold
the Lukashenka regime accountable for its actions, including through the
imposition of sanctions.  Mr. Sullivan reiterated the Biden
Administration’s demand that the Lukashenka regime allow a credible
international investigation into the events of May 23, immediately
release all political prisoners, and enter into a comprehensive and
genuine political dialogue with the leaders of the democratic opposition
and civil society groups that leads to the conduct of free and fair
Presidential elections under OSCE observation.
