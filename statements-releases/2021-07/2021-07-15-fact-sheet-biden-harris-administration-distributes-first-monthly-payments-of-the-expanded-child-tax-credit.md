title: "FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Distributes First Monthly\
  \ Payments of the Expanded Child Tax Credit"
---
 
Today, tens of millions of American families will begin to see their
first monthly Child Tax Credit payments. The Department of Treasury
estimates that $15 billion were distributed today to tens of millions of
working families with 60 million children. For the 86% of families using
direct deposit, they will receive their child payment today, July
15<sup>th</sup>, and the 15<sup>th</sup> of every month for the rest of
2021. It will show up in their bank accounts described as “ChildCTC.”
Others will receive their check in the mail today or in the coming days.

The American Rescue Plan is providing the **<u>largest-ever</u>** Child
Tax Credit – increasing from $2,000 per child to $3,000 for each child
between the ages of 6 and 17, and to $3,600 for each child under the age
of 6. This historic increase will provide middle-class families with
critical tax relief and will lift millions of children out of poverty.

**<u>Major Tax Cut for Middle Class Working Families:</u>** Nearly all
middle-class families will receive the expanded child tax credit, to
help them meet the costs of raising children with the security and
dignity they deserve. And because monthly payments start today, they
won’t have to wait until tax season for tax relief that millions of
families need now.

-   *<u>Full Payment for Most Families</u>*. All families will get the
    full Child Tax Credit if they make up to $150,000 for a married
    couple or $112,500 for a family with a single parent (also called
    Head of Household). Eligible families will receive monthly payments
    of the Child Tax Credit *<u>automatically</u>* if they filed taxes
    in the last two years.

<!-- -->

-   *<u>$7,200 for Typical Family with Young Children</u>*: For a
    married couple earning a combined $60,000 per year with two children
    under age 6, their Child Tax Credit will equal $7,200, providing an
    ***<u>additional $3,200 tax cut</u>*** in 2021 thanks to the
    expansion***.***

**<u>The first monthly Child Tax Credit ever:</u>** Today, ***four
months*** after the American Rescue Plan was signed into law, tens of
millions of families with nearly 60 million children are receiving the
first-ever ***monthly payments*** of the Child Tax Credit***.*** This
reflects the swift implementation efforts of the White House, Treasury,
and the IRS.

-   *<u>$250-$300 a Month Per Child</u>*: Starting today, working
    families will receive monthly payments of $250 for each child ages 6
    to 17 and $300 for each child under 6 years old.
-   *<u>Helping Working Families Meet the Costs of Raising
    Children</u>:* Tens of millions of working families will be able to
    rely on these monthly payments to help with the costs of raising
    their children – from putting food on the table, to covering the
    costs of school supplies, new clothes, and unexpected expenses.

**<u>Over 97 percent of Families Receiving the 2021 Child Tax Credit are
Working</u>:** The Treasury Department estimates that ***<u>over 97
percent</u>*** **** of families that will receive the expanded Child Tax
Credit are working familieswith wages or self-employment income. And for
the families that don’t have income, many of those are seniors taking
care of grandchildren or people with serious disabilities and health
issues.

**<u>More than 26 million Children from Hard-Pressed Families will now
get a full Child Tax Credit:</u>** Treasury estimates that the
hard-pressed low-income families of over 26 million children that
previously would have gotten a smaller Child Tax Credit than families
with higher earnings, will now receive the full expanded Child Tax
Credit. Prior to the American Rescue Plan, researchers found that over
half of Black and Hispanic children were in families ineligible for the
full Child Tax Credit because of too little earnings.

**<u>A Historic Reduction in Child Poverty</u>:** The expanded Child Tax
Credit is the main driver in experts’ projections that the American
Rescue Plan could cut child poverty by around half. Even by the most
conservative estimates, the Child Tax Credit alone is projected to
reduce child poverty by a multiple of any [previous
year](http://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/1-27-21pov-data.xlsx).

**<u>Administration-wide effort to help sign up additional children and
their families:</u>**

-   **<u>Simplified non-filer portal</u>:** The Child Tax Credit has
    been around for more than twenty years, but there has never been a
    tool to help non-filers claim the credit. Thanks to the
    implementation efforts of the White House, Treasury, and the IRS,
    the first-ever non-filer portal for the Child Tax Credit was
    launched by the IRS in June.
-   **<u>ChildTaxCredit.gov:</u>** The White House launched
    [ChildTaxCredit.gov](https://childtaxcredit.gov/) – a one-stop-shop
    in English and Spanish for user-friendly information on the Child
    Tax Credit, including a step-by-step guide to using the non-filer
    portal in multiple languages.
-   **<u>Working with Major Non-Profit Organizations and Community
    Groups that Fight for Children:</u>** For months, the White House
    has worked closely with children’s advocacy groups, women’s
    organizations, committed faith-based organizations, and other
    nonprofit organizations in an on-going collaborative effort to find
    the most effective strategies for signing-up families who aren’t
    receiving the credit, through creating awareness, developing
    navigator and trusted messenger sign-up strategies, and working to
    improve website accessibility.

**<u>Investment with a high return:</u>** Studies show that children
whose families get more in refundable credits do [better in
school](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/03/11/new-child-tax-credit-could-slash-poverty-now-and-boost-social-mobility-later/)
and [score higher on standardized
tests](https://www.jstor.org/stable/prancotamamnta.104.116?seq=1), are
more likely to [graduate high
school](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/697477) and
[attend
college](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20160298), and
[make more
money](https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2020/adrm/CES-WP-20-35.html)
as adults. These children are also less likely to face the early onset
of disabilities and health issues like
[diabetes](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/income-support-associated-with-improved-health-outcomes-for-children-many)
that can represent key barriers to employment later in life. In fact,
research from Columbia University
[shows](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/605978841a7c672eaed64ec6/1616476294180/Child-Allowance-CBA-brief-CPSP-March-2021.pdf)
that each $1 invested in the Child Tax Credit returns over $8 to society
in improved health for children and their parents, better educational
outcomes and higher future incomes, and reduced crime and criminal
justice costs.

**<u>Extending the new Child Tax Credit for years to come:</u>** The
American Rescue Plan’s expanded Child Tax Credit is only for 2021. This
is a historic investment that will lift children and working families
out of poverty. That’s why President Biden believes that we should
extend the new Child Tax Credit for years and years to come. He is
proposing that we do so in his American Families Plan and Build Back
Better agenda.
