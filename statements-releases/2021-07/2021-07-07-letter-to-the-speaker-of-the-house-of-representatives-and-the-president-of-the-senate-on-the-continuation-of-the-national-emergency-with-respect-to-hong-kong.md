title: "Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of\
  \ the Senate on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Hong\_\
  Kong"
---
 
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in
Hong Kong declared in Executive Order 13936 of July 14, 2020, is to
continue in effect beyond July 14, 2021.   
  
The situation with respect to Hong Kong, including recent actions taken
by the People’s Republic of China to fundamentally undermine Hong Kong’s
autonomy, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat, which
has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
 Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13936 with respect
to the situation in Hong Kong.   
                              

Sincerely,  
  
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
