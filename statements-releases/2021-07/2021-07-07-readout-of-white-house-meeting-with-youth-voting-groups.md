title: Readout of White House Meeting with Youth Voting Groups
---
 
Yesterday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Public
Engagement Director and Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond marked the
50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the ratification of the 26<sup>th</sup>
Amendment, which effectively lowered the national voting age to 18, by
meeting with the leadership of non-partisan groups who are focused on
youth voting access and civic participation. During the meeting, senior
White House officials expressed their gratitude for the work the groups
are doing and reiterated the President’s strong commitment to protecting
the sacred right to vote.

The advocates shared updates on their work in states across the country
to increase civic participation, including both fighting back against
laws that suppress voter turnout as well as advocating for federal and
state laws that expand access to the ballot box by making voter
registration and casting a ballot more streamlined. They also shared
recommendations for how the Administration can do more to advance youth
voting rights, including through the President’s [Executive Order on
Promoting Access to
Voting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/).
