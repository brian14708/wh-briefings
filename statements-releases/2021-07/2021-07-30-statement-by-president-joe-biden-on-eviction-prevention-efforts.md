title: Statement by President Joe Biden on Eviction Prevention Efforts and Emergency
  Rental Assistance
---
 
As the eviction moratorium deadline approaches tomorrow, I call on all
state and local governments to take all possible steps to immediately
disburse these funds given the imminent ending of the CDC eviction
moratorium. State and local governments began receiving Emergency Rental
Assistance funding in February and were eligible for an additional $21.5
billion passed in the American Rescue Plan. Five months later, with
localities across the nation showing that they can deliver funds
effectively – there can be no excuse for any state or locality not
accelerating funds to landlords and tenants that have been hurt during
this pandemic.  Every state and local government must get these funds
out to ensure we prevent every eviction we can. State and local
governments can and should use both the Emergency Rental Assistance and
their American Rescue Plan state and local funds to support policies
with courts, community groups, and legal aid to ensure no one seeks an
eviction when they have not sought out Emergency Rental Assistance
funds. State and local governments should also be aware that there is no
legal barrier to moratorium at the state and local level. My
Administration will not rest – nor should state and local governments –
until Emergency Rental Assistance dollars reach Americans in need.
