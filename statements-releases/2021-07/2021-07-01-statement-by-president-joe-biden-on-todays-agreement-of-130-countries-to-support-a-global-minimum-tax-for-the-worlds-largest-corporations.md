title: "Statement by President Joe Biden on Today\u2019s Agreement of 130 Countries\
  \ to Support a Global Minimum Tax for the World\u2019s Largest Corporations"

Today marks an important step in moving the global economy forward to be
more equitable for workers and middle class families in the United
States and around the world. I want to thank all the signatories of the
Paris OECD statement — 130 countries — for coming together to endorse a
global minimum tax rate of at least 15 percent. These nations make up
more than 90 percent of the world’s economy, which puts us in striking
distance of full global agreement to halt the race to the bottom for
corporate taxes.

With a global minimum tax in place, multinational corporations will no
longer be able to pit countries against one another in a bid to push tax
rates down and protect their profits at the expense of public revenue.
They will no longer be able to avoid paying their fair share by hiding
profits generated in the United States, or any other country, in
lower-tax jurisdictions. This will level the playing field and make
America more competitive. And it will allow us to devote the additional
revenue we raise to making generational investments, which are necessary
to keep America’s competitive edge razor sharp in today’s global
economy.

I promised to lead the world to deliver a foreign policy for the middle
class, and today, we are doing just that.

Reaching this consensus wasn’t easy. It took American vision, as well as
a commitment to closely cooperate with our partners around the world.
It’s a testament to how leadership rooted in our values can deliver
important progress for families everywhere.

Building on this agreement will also require us to take action here at
home. It’s imperative that we reform our own corporate tax laws, as I
proposed in my Made in America tax plan. We must adopt the global
minimum tax, among other measures I have proposed, to make sure
corporations pay their fair share. Congress should pass my Made in
America tax plan to bring good paying jobs home and make sure our tax
code works for families, workers, and small businesses, not just
profitable corporations and billionaires.

I commend Secretary Yellen for her efforts championing these discussions
and look forward to continued productive negotiations. I look forward to
full agreement in the fall.
