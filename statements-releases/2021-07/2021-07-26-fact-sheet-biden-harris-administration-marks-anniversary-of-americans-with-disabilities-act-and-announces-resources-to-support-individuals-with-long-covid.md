title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Marks Anniversary of Americans\
  \ with Disabilities Act and Announces Resources to Support Individuals with Long\_\
  COVID"
---
 
Today, on the 31st Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), we celebrate the inclusion and access promoted by the landmark
civil rights law for disabled Americans. Grounded in four core outcomes
of full participation, equal opportunity, independent living, and
economic self-sufficiency, the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis
of disability in contexts such as of public accommodation, employment,
transportation, and community living and provides recourse for people
with disabilities who faced discrimination. The nation has made
significant progress since the law was signed.  To commemorate this day,
President Biden will sign a proclamation marking the 31st anniversary of
the Americans with Disabilities Act.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant steps to achieve a
more inclusive, accessible, and equitable country for people with
disabilities, including people with disabilities that experience
multiple forms of discrimination and bias on the basis of race, gender,
sexual orientation and other factors. Through quick policy action, the
Administration has ensured disabled Americans are receiving resources
and are included in key administrative proposals. Specifically, the
Administration has:

-   **Centered Equity as a Priority on Day One.** President Biden’s
    Inauguration Day Executive Order 13985 on [Advancing Racial Equity
    and Support for Underserved
    Communities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/)
    Through the Federal Government directs the whole of federal
    government to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity
    for all, including with respect to persons with disabilities.
    Additionally, the EO establishes an Equitable Data Working Group to
    assess federal data, including on disability, to advance equity.  
-   **Increased Access to Democracy for Voters with Disabilities.**
    Executive Order 14019 on [Voting
    Access](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/)
    ensures people with disabilities can access key voting resources,
    requires an assessment of barriers to the right to vote
    independently and privately, and will help ensure that all
    Americans, including voters with disabilities, can exercise their
    right to vote.  
-   **Raised Wages for Federal Contractors to $15.** In April, President
    Biden signed Executive Order 14026 raising the minimum wage for
    workers employed by [federal
    contractors](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/27/executive-order-on-increasing-the-minimum-wage-for-federal-contractors/),
    including with respect to workers with disabilities.   
-   **Advanced Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Across
    the Federal Government.** In June, President Biden signed Executive
    Order 14035 advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and
    accessibility
    ([DEIA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/))
    across the Federal government.  The EO charges agencies with
    assessing their state of DEIA to eliminate barriers employees face. 
    For federal workers with disabilities, the EO sets a path for the
    Federal government to become a model employer to improve
    accessibility, ensure accommodations can be requested, increase
    opportunities for advancement and hiring, and reducing physical
    accessibility barriers.  
-   **Provided Billions of Dollars to Children and Adults with
    Disabilities.** President Biden’s American Rescue Plan is the first
    COVID relief bill to include explicit provisions for people with
    disabilities.   
    -   The American Rescue Plan provides states with billions in
        additional Medicaid funding for home- and community-based
        services (HCBS) for one year.  The additional Medicaid funding
        will help expand access to home and community-based services for
        people with disabilities as well as older adults and ensure that
        caregivers are fairly compensated for their work.  The Centers
        for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently [released
        guidance](https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/smd21003.pdf)
        on the use of funds for HCBS and the Administration for
        Community Living released an accompanying [blog
        post](https://acl.gov/news-and-events/acl-blog/acl-policy-update-american-rescue-plans-additional-funding-medicaid-hcbs).  
    -   The American Rescue Plan also provides direct support to
        students with disabilities and infants and toddlers with
        disabilities through the Individuals with Disabilities Education
        Act. On July 1, the Department of Education
        [released](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-more-3-billion-american-rescue-plan-funds-support-children-disabilities)
        $2.58 billion to elementary and secondary education students
        with disabilities, $200 million for preschool students with
        disabilities, and $250 million for infants and toddlers with
        disabilities and their families.  
-   **Produced Critical Resources for Americans with Disabilities:**  
    -   **Expanded Access to Competitive Integrated Employment.**  The
        Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education
        and the Social Security Administration released a [fact
        sheet](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ODEP/pdf/508_odep_cie_07152021.pdf?utm_source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ODEP_Newsletter_7-16-21)
        on funding opportunities to expand access to competitive
        integrated employment for youth and adults with disabilities.  
    -   **Supported Economic Self-Sufficiency.** Office of Disability
        Employment Policy, Employee Benefits Security Administration,
        and Employment and Training Administration within Department of
        Labor announced a webinar and toolkit to support a successful
        financial future for disabled individuals.  The
        [webinar](https://www.addevent.com/event/iy7331133?utm_source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ODEP_Newsletter_7-16-21)
        and
        [toolkit](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/secure-your-financial-future?utm_source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ODEP_Newsletter_7-16-21)
        are designed for people with disabilities who are experiencing
        new levels of financial stress and unemployment. Organized
        around the five phases of the work-life cycle — (1) preparing
        for a job, (2) starting a job, (3) maintaining a job, (4)
        changing or losing a job, and (5) retiring from a job — it
        offers users tools and resources to help them address financial
        questions.  
    -   **Reflected on 30 years of Independent Living.** The
        Administration for Community Living (ACL) at the Department of
        Health and Human Services released *30 Years of Community Living
        for Individuals with Intellectual and/or Developmental
        Disabilities* *(1987-2017)*, a
        [report](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20America/PNS_Book_FINAL_07-12-21.pdf)
        about community living for people with intellectual and
        developmental disabilities over the last 30 years.  The report
        was developed through of a collaboration among three ACL
        grantees conducting the longitudinal studies about services for
        people with developmental disabilities.   
    -   **Leveraged Technology to Support Reengagement with
        Communities.** CMS hosted the second of two webinars for states,
        associations, and other stakeholders to explore lessons learned
        during the COVID-19 public health emergency to discuss the use
        of technology in supporting reintegration into the community for
        people with disabilities leveraging in-person services and home
        and community-based services (HCBS).  This second webinar
        addressed critical considerations for states as they explore
        incorporating technology into state HCBS waivers.  
    -   **Expanded Opportunities for Accessible, Affordable Housing.**
        The Departments of Health and Human Services and Housing and
        Urban Development [announced a
        partnership](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/ada/HHS-HUD_HousingFactSheetpdf.pdf)
        to increase access to accessible, integrated, affordable housing
        and the services that support community living for people with
        disabilities.  One focus of the collaboration is working with
        states participating in the Money Follows the Person program and
        public housing authorities with available housing choice
        vouchers targeted to people leaving or at risk of entering
        nursing homes and other institutions, which can include people
        experiencing homelessness. The Departments also are working to
        strengthen partnerships between housing and service networks at
        the state and local levels to streamline access to both housing
        and community services for people with disabilities .  
    -   **Provided Guidance on School Reopening for Students with
        Disabilities.** The Department of Education’s Office for Civil
        Rights released a [questions and answers
        document](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-reopening-202105.pdf)
        on civil rights and the reopening of schools during the
        pandemic.  The document helps students, families, schools and
        the public understand their rights and responsibilities in
        remote, hybrid, and in-person educational environments,
        including rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and
        Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  
    -   **Increased Access to COVID-19 Vaccinations and Affirmed the
        Civil Rights of Americans with Disabilities in Vaccine
        Distribution**. Agencies within the Department of Health and
        Human Services released funding and resources during the first
        100 days to increase access for people with disabilities to the
        COVID-19 vaccine, provide [guidance on
        discrimination](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/federal-legal-standards-prohibiting-disability-discrimination-covid-19-vaccination.pdf)
        when distributing the vaccine, and [support best
        practices](https://acl.gov/covid19/VaccineAccessStrategies) in
        vaccine access.  The Administration for Community Living in
        partnership with the Centers for Disease Control provided
        [nearly $100
        million](https://acl.gov/news-and-events/announcements/partnership-cdc-increase-access-covid-19-vaccines)
        in grants to help expand access.  Additional resources include
        an overview of [disability rights
        laws](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/disability-access-vaccine-distribution.pdf)
        in vaccine distribution from the Office for Civil Rights, and
        information from the Assistant Secretary for Planning and
        Evaluation on barriers faced by older adults who cannot leave
        their homes when trying to [access the
        vaccine](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/aspe-files/265346/homeboundvaccovid.pdf). 

In addition, President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda outlines a path
towards a more competitive, inclusive, and resilient America.  If
enacted, these plans will provide significant investments to children
and adults with disabilities to achieve independent living, economic
self-sufficiency, equitable educational opportunities, and full
participation in the workforce and communities.   
  
They include the following key elements:

-   **Invest in the Caregiving Economy.** The Build Back Better agenda
    would expand access to long-term services and supports for people
    with disabilities. This investment will also support well-paying
    caregiving jobs that include benefits and the ability to
    collectively bargain as well as building state infrastructure to
    improve the quality of services and to support workers. The funding
    will take significant steps to help people with disabilities access
    high-quality care in their homes and communities.  
-   **Phase Out of Subminimum Wages.** The Build Back Better agenda
    proposes a phase out of the subminimum wage provision in section
    14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  In addition, President Biden
    proposes investments to expand access to competitive, integrated
    employment opportunities for workers with disabilities.  
-   **Expansion of Inclusive, Accessible Preschool.**  The Build Back
    Better Agenda calls for a national partnership with states to offer
    free, high-quality, accessible, and inclusive preschool to all 3-and
    4-year-olds—benefitting five million children.  Children with
    disabilities benefit from inclusive, accessible pre-school programs
    with their peers, and all children benefit when we create
    socio-economically diverse preschool classrooms where all students
    can thrive.  
-   **Address Teacher Shortages** **through the Development of Special
    Education Teachers**.  The Build Back Better agenda invests in
    personnel preparation funds under the Individuals with Disabilities
    Education Act (IDEA), funding pathways to additional certifications,
    and strengthening existing teacher preparation programs for special
    educators.  
-   **Paid Leave that Supports *All* Families**. President Biden’s Build
    Back Better agenda proposes a guarantee of 12 weeks of paid
    parental, family, and personal illness/safe leave by year 10 of the
    program, and also ensures workers get three days of bereavement
    leave per year starting in year one. The program will provide
    workers up to $4,000 a month, with a minimum of two-thirds of
    average weekly wages replaced, rising to 80 percent for the lowest
    wage workers. The plan has an inclusive definition of family,
    ensuring workers can care and be cared for by a loved one who is not
    related by blood, which will greatly benefit many communities,
    including LGBTQ+ individuals and people with disabilities.

Today the Administration is also releasing a package of guidance and
resources to support individuals experiencing the long-term symptoms of
COVID-19 or “Post-​Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC),” known
commonly as “long COVID.” The announcements from the Departments of
Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, Education, and Labor provide
information about where individuals can access resources and
accommodations and clarifies the rights for health and educational
services and supports. This includes:

-   **Guidance explaining that long COVID can be a disability under
    various Federal civil rights laws.** The Office for Civil Rights at
    HHS and Department of Justice released guidance (available
    [here](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/civil-rights-covid19/index.html)
    and [here](https://www.ada.gov/long-covid-joint-guidance.html))
    explaining that some individuals with long COVID may have a
    disability under various civil rights laws that entitles them to
    protection from discrimination.  
-   **Guidance that addresses the needs of children with long COVID who
    may be children with disabilities.** The Department of Education
    Office for Civil Rights and Office of Special Education and
    Rehabilitative Services issued a resource document providing
    information about schools’ and public agencies’ responsibilities for
    the provision of services and reasonable modifications to children
    and students for whom long COVID is a disability.   
-   **Access to resources on disability support services.** The
    Administration for Community Living at HHS released a
    [guide](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/COVID19/ACL_LongCOVID.pdf)
    to community-based resources that can help people if they now need
    assistance to live in their own home, go to work or school, or
    participate in the community. These resources can provide
    information about what is available locally; help people connect to
    services, such as transportation and personal care attendants; help
    arrange reasonable accommodations and access vaccinations; and more.
        
-   **Information about accommodations in the workplace.**  The Office
    of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) at the Department of Labor
    launched a new
    [webpage](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/topics/coronavirus-covid-19-long-covid)
    that includes resources on long COVID organized by stakeholder
    groups, such as workers, youth and young adults, and employers.  The
    resources include information on requesting and providing workplace
    accommodations for individuals with long COVID. In addition, ODEP
    released a
    [blog](https://blog.dol.gov/2021/07/06/workers-with-long-covid-19-may-be-entitled-to-accommodations)
    discussing the impact of long COVID on workers with disabilities.
