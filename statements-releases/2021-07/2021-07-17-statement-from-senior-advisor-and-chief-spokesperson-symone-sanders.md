On Tuesday, July 13th, Vice President Harris met with members of the
Texas state legislature who are temporarily in Washington, D.C. Earlier
today, it was brought to our attention that two of the members at that
meeting tested positive for COVID-19. Based on the timeline of these
positive tests, it was determined the Vice President and her staff
present at the meeting were not at risk of exposure because they were
not in close contact with those who tested positive and therefore do not
need to be tested or quarantined. The Vice President and her staff are
fully vaccinated.
