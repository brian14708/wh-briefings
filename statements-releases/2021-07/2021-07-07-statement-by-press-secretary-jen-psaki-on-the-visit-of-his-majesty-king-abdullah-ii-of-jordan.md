Majesty’s visit will highlight the enduring and strategic partnership
between the United States and Jordan, a key security partner and ally of
the United States. It will be an opportunity to discuss the many
challenges facing the Middle East and showcase Jordan’s leadership role
in promoting peace and stability in the region. President Biden looks
