On behalf of the United States, I offer our deep condolences to the
people of the Philippines regarding the tragic plane crash in which
several dozen service members were killed. Our thoughts are with those
who were injured and the families of those who were lost. We stand
shoulder to shoulder with our Philippine allies at this difficult time
and are ready to provide all appropriate support to the Philippinesâ€™
response effort.
