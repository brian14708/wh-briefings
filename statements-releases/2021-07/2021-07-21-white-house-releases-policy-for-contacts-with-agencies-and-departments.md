title: "White\_House Releases Policy for Contacts with Agencies and\_Departments"
---
 
Today, the White House sent the Senate and House Judiciary Committees
our policy on contacts between the White House and agencies and
departments, and the Department of Justice formally updated their policy
on contacts with the White House. These policies reaffirm President
Biden’s commitment to restoring faith in institutions of government and
the independent role of the Department of Justice in law enforcement
matters.
