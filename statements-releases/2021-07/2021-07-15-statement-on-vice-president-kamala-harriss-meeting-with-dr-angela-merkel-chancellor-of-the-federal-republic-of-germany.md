Vice President Kamala Harris hosted Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany
for breakfast at her residence today to convey her appreciation for the
close friendship and shared values between Germany and the United
States. Vice President Harris and Chancellor Merkel had a candid and
wide-ranging discussion about current and future geopolitical threats
and challenges. They agreed on the urgent need to invest in democratic
institutions anchored in the rule of law and grounded in the fundamental
rights and dignity of all people. They expressed their shared desire to
strengthen the transatlantic partnership and continue robust cooperation
in areas such as pandemic response and recovery, global health, and the
environment. The Vice President thanked Chancellor Merkel for Germany’s
contributions to global vaccination efforts and its leadership in
combatting climate change. They discussed the need for concrete actions
to create norms around emerging technology, and for more coordinated
international efforts to address the root causes of migration.
