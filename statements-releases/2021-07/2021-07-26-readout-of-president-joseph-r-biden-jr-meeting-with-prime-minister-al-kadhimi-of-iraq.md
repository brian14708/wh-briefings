President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Al-Kadhimi
of Iraq to strengthen bilateral coordination under the Strategic
Framework Agreement.  Together they discussed expanded initiatives on
climate, energy, education, and combatting the COVID-19 pandemic.  They
committed to a continued security partnership to ensure that ISIS can
never resurge and to allow communities recovering from terror to rebuild
with dignity even as the United States shifts to a purely advisory role.
The leaders reaffirmed their respect for Iraq’s democracy, the rule of
law, and promoting a secure environment for Iraq’s upcoming elections in
October. The leaders agreed on the vital importance of holding these
elections on time, and welcomed the UN monitoring mission to support
their full transparency and fairness. 

Together, they discussed the important role of Iraq in the region and
the significant diplomatic efforts led by Prime Minister Al-Kadhimi to
improve and strengthen Iraq’s relationships in the region.  They lauded
the historic visit of Pope Francis to Iraq earlier this year, the
trilateral summit with Egypt and Jordan, and the important role Iraq
plays in promoting interfaith tolerance and the common bonds of humanity
in the Middle East.  They agreed that Iraq’s stability was central to
the stability of the entire region.
