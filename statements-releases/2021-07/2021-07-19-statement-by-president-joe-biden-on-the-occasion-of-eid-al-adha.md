title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Occasion of Eid al-Adha
---
 
Jill and I send our warmest greetings to those celebrating Eid al-Adha
around the world. The Eid traditions and Hajj rituals of providing for
those less fortunate in commemoration of Abraham and his son’s devotion
to God carry a special meaning this year as we continue to navigate the
challenges of COVID-19 and work to respond to and recover from the
global pandemic. The American people are proud to be helping lead the
fight to end COVID-19 globally by donating more than half a billion
vaccines to countries around the world, including Muslim-majority
nations. We must all work together to save lives and end this pandemic
everywhere. 

The Hajj, which convenes people from all walks of life and from every
corner of the globe, is also a reminder of Islam’s commitment to
equality and the shared roots of the world’s Abrahamic faiths. The
United States is committed to working with the international community
to emerge stronger from the pandemic, and thousands of Muslim Americans
are among those eager to perform the pilgrimage next year, God willing.
 

On behalf of the American people, we wish all those celebrating a safe
and wonderful holiday. Eid Mubarak.
