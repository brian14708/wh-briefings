  \ Sullivan\u2019s Call with President Kais Saied of\_Tunisia"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with President Kais
Saied of Tunisia. In an hour-long discussion, he conveyed President
Biden’s strong support for the people of Tunisia and for Tunisian
democracy based on fundamental rights, strong institutions, and a
commitment to the rule of law. In this spirit, the call focused on the
critical need for Tunisian leaders to outline a swift return to
Tunisia’s democratic path. National Security Advisor Sullivan
underscored that this will require rapidly forming a new government, led
by a capable prime minister to stabilize Tunisia’s economy and confront
the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ensuring the timely return of the
elected parliament. As Tunisia’s leaders answer the widely expressed
demands of Tunisians for improved standards of living and honest
governance, the United States and other friends of the Tunisian people
stand ready to redouble our efforts to help Tunisia move toward a
secure, prosperous, and democratic future.
