The Presidential Delegation to the funeral of President Moise is safe
and accounted for, and those traveling from Washington, D.C. have
arrived safely back in the United States.   
  
The United States remains deeply concerned about the situation on the
ground in Haiti. We strongly urge all parties to express themselves
peacefully, and call on Haiti’s leaders to be clear that their
supporters must refrain from violence. In this critical moment, Haiti’s
leaders must work together and engage in a broad and inclusive dialogue
that is reflective of the will of the Haitian people. The Presidential
Delegation, led by Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and joined by
Representative Meeks and Representative Fortenberry, met with senior
Haitian officials and civil society leaders and shared this message
directly.  
  
The United States will continue to provide requested assistance,
including equipment and training, to the Haitian National Police and the
Government of Haiti amid ongoing security challenges. Additionally, the
Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are providing investigative
assistance to the Haitian authorities at the request of the Government
of Haiti, and will keep working closely with our international partners
to support the Haitian government as it seeks to hold accountable those
responsible for the assassination of President Moïse.  
  
The United States stands with the people of Haiti in this challenging
time.
