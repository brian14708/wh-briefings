This week Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and Co-Chair of the Gender
Policy Council Julissa Reynoso hosted a roundtable at the White House
with transgender women of color advocates from around the country. This
event was the first in a series of listening sessions that will be
convened by the White House-led Interagency Working Group on Safety,
Inclusion, and Opportunity for Transgender Individuals, which was
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/30/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-equality-for-transgender-americans/)
by the White House in June.

Participants discussed the epidemic levels of violence and harassment
faced by transgender women and girls of color. They noted that
discrimination, homelessness, intimate partner violence, poverty,
unemployment, immigration and other systemic barriers take a
disproportionate toll on transgender women and girls of color and are
drivers of the violence visited upon transgender women of color.
Participants shared their policy recommendations for advancing economic
justice, opportunity, health equity, and safety for transgender
individuals. They also highlighted the strength, resilience, and hope
that drive their advocacy and the importance of creating more
opportunities to lift up diverse voices from the transgender community
and support their leadership.

Ambassador Rice and Co-Chair Reynoso shared their appreciation for the
advocacy and policy recommendations provided by the participants. They
reiterated that the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to
advancing justice, opportunity, and safety for transgender women of
color and all LGBTQ+ people and families in America. They emphasized
that the Domestic Policy Council and Gender Policy Council will take an
intersectional approach to advancing gender equity and racial justice as
they lead the Interagency Working Group on Safety, Inclusion, and
Opportunity for Transgender Individuals.

Participants in today’s roundtable included:

-   Tori Cooper, Director of Community Engagement for the Transgender
    Justice Initiative, Human Rights Campaign
-   Ruby Corado, Founder, Casa Ruby
-   Sage Dolan-Sandrino, youth advocate, National Black Justice
