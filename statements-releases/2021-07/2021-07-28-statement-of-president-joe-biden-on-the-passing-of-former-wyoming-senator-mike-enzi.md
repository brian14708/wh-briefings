title: Statement of President Joe Biden on the Passing of Former Wyoming Senator Mike
  Enzi
---
 
For twelve years, I had the privilege of serving with Mike Enzi in the
United States Senate. While we sat on different sides of the aisle, I
always saw him first as a public servant who conducted himself with
decency, honor, and integrity.  
  
The Eagle Scout and National Guardsman, the small business owner and
small-town mayor, the state legislator who became a U.S. Senator â€” Mike
never forgot where he came from, and never forgot the people of his
beloved Wyoming who placed their trust in him election after election.  
  
Jill and I are saddened to learn of his passing, and our prayers are
with his wife Diana, their children and grandchildren, and his countless
friends, colleagues, and staff.
