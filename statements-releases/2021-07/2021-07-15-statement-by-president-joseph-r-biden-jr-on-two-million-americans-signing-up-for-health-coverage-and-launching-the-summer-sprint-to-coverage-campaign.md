  \_Campaign"

When I ran for President, I promised the American people that I would
build on the historic foundation of the Affordable Care Act to ensure
that every American has access to quality, affordable health care. As
part of that promise, just weeks after taking office, my Administration
opened a special enrollment period through HealthCare.gov to provide all
Americans the opportunity to sign up for health insurance.  
   
Five months later, the results are clear: two million Americans have
signed up for the peace of mind that health insurance brings. That’s two
million more Americans who can sleep soundly at night, no longer having
to worry whether their family would lose everything due to a heart
attack, a cancer diagnosis, or an accident. This milestone is in
addition to our progress expanding access to health insurance through
vital programs like Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance
Program, which now cover more than 81 million Americans.  
   
I pledged to lower the cost of health care — and that’s exactly what we
did with my American Rescue Plan. Thanks to the law, nine million
Americans who buy their coverage through the Affordable Care Act have
lower premiums, saving families an average of $50 per person per month —
that’s $2,400 per year for a typical family of four. In fact, four out
of five people can now find a quality plan with a premium of $10 or less
per month. And my Build Back Better agenda will expand on these efforts
and make health care more affordable — including by adding dental,
vision, and hearing coverage to Medicare; closing the Medicaid coverage
gap for low-income Americans; and making the premium reductions in the
American Rescue Plan permanent.  
   
With 30 days to go until the opportunity for special enrollment closes
and more affordable quality plans, now is the time to sign up for health
coverage. Today, my Administration is launching a final 30-day “Summer
Sprint to Coverage” campaign to help people and communities across
America who still need health insurance sign up for it. I encourage
everyone who is not yet covered to visit HealthCare.gov and sign up by
August 15. If you already have coverage, help get your friends, family,
neighbors, and others in your community signed up as well.  
   
More than a decade after the landmark passage of the Affordable Care
Act, as we emerge from a once-in-a-century pandemic, we are on our way
to truly making health care a right and not a privilege. I urge Congress
to do its part by passing the critical health care reforms in my Build
Back Better agenda — and I urge all Americans to get covered today.
