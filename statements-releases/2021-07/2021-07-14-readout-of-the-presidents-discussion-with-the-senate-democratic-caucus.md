title: "Readout of the President\u2019s Discussion with the Senate Democratic\_Caucus"
---
 
This afternoon the President thanked the Senate Democratic Caucus for
the groundbreaking work they had done to reach the budget resolution
agreement announced last night, and highlighted that it would grow the
middle class, generate strong economic growth, and create millions of
jobs.   
  
He also touted the benefits of the historic bipartisan infrastructure
framework that forms the other half of his domestic economic agenda,
describing how he’s travelling the country and making a case about it
and that polling data show the framework resonating strongly with voters
in both parties.  
  
The President credited the Senators for their successful work to pass
the American Rescue Plan, noting that economic experts have cited it as
a leading cause for the record job creation that has taken place since
he took office and the doubling of the rate of economic growth in
forecasts. And he described the Build Back Better agenda as a follow on
to the Rescue Plan, to ensure that we’re rebuilding a stronger, more
inclusive and more resilient middle class.   
  
He emphasized that what tied the economic policies they are working on
together was that they were built from the bottom up, with a recognition
for the role that a good job plays in peoples’ lives, the rising costs
families have had to bear from child care, elder care, and tuition, and
the fact that when working and middle class families do well, everyone
does well.  
  
He also discussed how the means for funding these critical investments
is popular with the American people, who know that the wealthiest
individuals and corporations often pay a lower tax bill than teachers
and firefighters.   
  
The President repeatedly hit on how the effects of climate change are
undeniable, and that the public is demanding action that the budget
resolution will deliver. And he also spoke to the urgent need to
overcome anti-voter laws, especially in a time when autocracies are
trying to undermine democracy around the world.
