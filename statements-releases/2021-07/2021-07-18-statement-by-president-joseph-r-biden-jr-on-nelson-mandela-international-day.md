  Day"

For the last 12 years, the world has celebrated July 18 as Nelson
Mandela International Day to honor the memory of a truly transformative
leader and to shine a light on the legacy of South Africa’s first
President elected by its citizens of all races. Nelson Mandela fought
apartheid, presided over a new, democratic constitution for all the
people of South Africa, and showed the world the power of leadership
that prioritized human dignity above all—that lifted up the rights of
everyone rather than seeking to elevate oneself. Today, I join people
around the world in commemorating and honoring Nelson Mandela’s
extraordinary global legacy by renewing our commitment to root out
systemic racism and to champion equity and equality for all people.

Mandela’s commitment to justice, peace, and democracy allowed him to
build bridges that spanned the artificial lines and divisions that tear
people apart. Through dialogue, partnership, and respect for the
capacity of every individual, he helped deliver a rainbow nation of all
South Africans that was able to grow and thrive—but the work he began is
never finished. I extend my condolences to the families of the victims
of recent violence in South Africa. South Africa’s efforts to heal
divisions are Nelson Mandela’s legacy carried forward, and it is in this
spirit we reiterate our unwavering support to equity, peaceful dialogue,
and respect for the rule of law.

On behalf of the people of the United States, we honor Nelson Mandela,
and his vision for Africa and a brighter world.
