title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Cameron\_Kinley"
---
 
Today, I was pleased to learn from Secretary of Defense Austin that he
has granted Cameron Kinleyâ€™s request to pursue a playing career in the
National Football League prior to his service as a naval officer.

I am confident that Cameron will represent the Navy well in the NFL,
just as he did as a standout athlete and class president at the Naval
Academy. After his NFL career is over, he will continue to make us proud
as an officer in the United States Navy.
