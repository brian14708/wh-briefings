title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Representative Bill\_\
  Pascrell"
---
 
Jill and I and the entire Biden family are deeply saddened to learn of
the passing of Bill Pascrell, Jr., a 27-year Congressman for New Jersey
at the U.S. House of Representatives.

Bill was a colleague and dear friend. I had the privilege of working
with him for decades on issues ranging from the Fire Grants and Safety
Act for the wellbeing of first responders and their families, to
veterans’ medical care, international trade, tax fairness, labor
unions, and so much more.

Over the course of our 30-year friendship, Bill defined himself as a
devoted patriot, a gentleman, and an exemplary leader. A beloved
bridge-builder and champion for working-class people,
Bill fought relentlessly to ensure their voices and needs were at the
center of policymaking. I always knew Bill’s positions were guided by
his deep conscience and convictions.

Throughout his career, Bill carried with him the memory of his humble
beginnings. A grandson of Italian immigrants, Bill was raised in
Paterson, New Jersey to a loving mother and devoted father who worked on
the railroad. He went on to serve in the Army and the Reserves, then as
a public high school teacher, a state legislator, a mayor, and a
Congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives for nearly three
decades. He lived an extraordinary life of accomplishment and service.

Along with his remarkable contributions, Bill will be sorely missed and
lovingly remembered for his fighting spirit, his kindness, and his
warmth.

On behalf of a grateful nation, we send our love to Bill’s beloved wife,
Elsie Marie, as well as his sisters, sons, and grandchildren.

May God bless our dear friend.

May God bless a great American.
