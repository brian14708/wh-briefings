President Biden spoke today with President José Raúl Mulino of Panama to
congratulate him on a successful start to his new administration and
emphasize our strong commitment to advancing the United States-Panama
partnership based on shared democratic values.  The two leaders
discussed joint efforts to address the challenges stemming from
irregular migration through Panama, including the regularization of
migrant populations and increased humane enforcement efforts. 

President Biden recognized President Mulino as a valued ally in
advancing safe, orderly and humane migration throughout the hemisphere,
and thanked him for the important steps that his government has taken in
this regard so soon after his July 1 inauguration.  President Biden and
President Mulino also discussed their shared concerns about the serious
flaws that accompanied the vote-counting process following Venezuela’s
July 28 election.  President Biden thanked President Mulino for his
effort to advance democracy in both Panama and the hemisphere, including
Panama’s efforts to mobilize regional support to restore democratic
norms in Venezuela and condemn political repression.
