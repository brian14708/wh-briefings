title: "Statement from President Joe\u202FBiden on the Two-Year Anniversary of the\
  \ CHIPS and Science\u202FAct"

America invented the semiconductor – those tiny chips that power
electric vehicles, appliances, cell phones, satellites, and are critical
in AI. But over time we went from manufacturing 40% of the world’s
semiconductors, to just over 10%. When Vice President Harris and I came
into office, we were determined to change that.  

Since I took office, companies have announced nearly $400 billion in
investments in semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, spurred
in large part by support from the CHIPS and Science Act. As a result of
these investments, we’re creating over 115,000 manufacturing and
construction jobs in the semiconductor industry. And America is now on
track to produce nearly 30% of the global supply of leading-edge chips
by 2032, up from zero only two years ago.  

While there is more to do, my CHIPS and Science Act is bringing chips
manufacturing back to America, strengthening global supply chains, and
is making sure the United States remains a world leader in AI and other
technologies that families, businesses, and our military rely on each
and every day.
