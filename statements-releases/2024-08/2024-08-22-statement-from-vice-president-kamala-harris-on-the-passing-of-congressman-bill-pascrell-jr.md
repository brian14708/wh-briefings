title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Congressman\
  \ Bill Pascrell,\_Jr."
---
 
Congressman Bill Pascrell, Jr. was a dedicated public servant and an
unwavering force for good who knew that government is at its best when
it is delivering for the people. From his time in City Hall and the
State House to his nearly three decades of service in the House of
Representatives, Congressman Pascrell fought to improve the lives of his
constituents, his fellow New Jerseyans, and our fellow Americans.  
  
While in Congress, Representative Pascrell was focused on issues that
have a direct impact on the health, wellbeing, and safety of families.
He was a fierce advocate for health care, to the benefit of millions of
Americans who are now able to see a doctor, afford their prescriptions,
and get the care they need and deserve. He was a champion for the
environment – fighting for clean air, safe drinking water, and our
public lands. As a veteran, he founded the Congressional Brain Injury
Task Force to raise awareness of the dangers of traumatic brain
injuries. And as chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus and the
Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus, he protected those who protect all
of us by spearheading legislation to meet the needs of first
responders.  
  
Congressman Pascrell should also be applauded for his leadership on the
House Ways and Means Committee where he fought for middle-class
families. He worked tirelessly to increase the minimum wage, invest in
our small businesses, and protect American workers. His initiatives
advanced economic opportunity and made our tax system more fair.  
  
This belief in using public service to improve lives was nothing new for
Congressman Pascrell. He proudly served our nation in the United States
Army and Army reserves. He spent more than a decade teaching our
children in the classroom. He served his neighbors as Mayor of Paterson.
And he delivered transformative investments while working across the
aisle in the State Assembly and as Minority Leader.   
  
For the Congressman, there was no project too small or idea too big.
Those who knew Representative Pascrell well knew that he was perhaps
most proud of the fact that he lived his entire life in his beloved
Paterson, NJ. During his lifetime of service to this community, he
successfully fought to recognize his childhood park and the crown jewel
of Paterson as the Great Falls National Historical Park. He also helped
restore one of the only remaining Negro League stadiums left in
America.  
  
Doug and I send our prayers to his wife, Elsie, their three children,
and their six grandchildren. We will be thinking of the Congressman’s
friends, constituents, and all those who knew him in the days and weeks
ahead. His legacy will live on for generations.
