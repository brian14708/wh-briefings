title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Inflation Reduction Act\_Anniversary"
---
 
Two years ago, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate
investment in history that is lowering energy costs and creating
good-paying union jobs, while taking on Big Pharma to lower prescription
drug costs—with Vice President Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.
Already, this law is lowering health care costs for millions of
families, strengthening energy security, and creating more than 330,000
clean energy jobs according to outside groups.  It has also unleashed
$265 billion in clean energy and manufacturing investments from the
private sector in the last two years—part of the nearly $900 billion
invested in America since we took office.

This historic legislation is fiscally responsible. It lowers the deficit
over the long run by cutting wasteful spending on special interests and
making big corporations and the wealthy pay more of their fair share.
And just yesterday, my Administration announced lower prescription drug
prices for the first ten drugs that have been negotiated by Medicare,
which will cut the prices of drugs used to treat blood clots, heart
disease, cancer, and more by nearly 40% to 80%, and save taxpayers $6
billion in the first year alone.

While Republicans in Congress try to repeal this law—which would
increase prescription drug costs and take good-paying jobs away from
their constituents, all to give massive tax cuts to big
corporations—Vice President Harris and I will keep fighting to move our
country forward by investing in America and giving families more
breathing room.
