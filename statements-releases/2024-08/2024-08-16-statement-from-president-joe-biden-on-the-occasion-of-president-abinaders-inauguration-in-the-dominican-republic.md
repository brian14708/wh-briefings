  s Inauguration in the Dominican\_Republic"

I congratulate President Luis Abinader on his inauguration.  Bound by
our common commitment to democracy—and deep cultural ties—the Dominican
Republic and the United States are [close friends and
partners](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/15/fact-sheet-celebrating-the-strength-of-the-united-states-dominican-republic-partnership/). 
As President Abinader begins his second term, we stand ready to support
him and his administration in their efforts to secure a prosperous
future for the people of the Dominican Republic.
