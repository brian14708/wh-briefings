title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Hersh Goldberg-Polin"
---
 
Earlier today, in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, Israeli forces
recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas. We have now confirmed
that one of the hostages killed by these vicious Hamas terrorists was an
American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

I am devastated and outraged. Hersh was among the innocents brutally
attacked while attending a music festival for peace in Israel on October
7. He lost his arm helping friends and strangers during Hamas’ savage
massacre.  He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world. I have
gotten to know his parents, Jon and Rachel. They have been courageous,
wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable. They
have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all
the hostages held in unconscionable conditions. I admire them and grieve
with them more deeply than words can express.  I know all Americans
tonight will have them in their prayers, just as Jill and I will.  I
have worked tirelessly to bring their beloved Hersh safely to them and
am heartbroken by the news of his death. It is as tragic as it is
reprehensible. Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes.
And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the
release of the remaining hostages.
