title: "Statement from Joe\_Biden on the Second Anniversary of the PACT\_Act"

As Americans, we have a sacred obligation to care for veterans and their
families. We owe them a debt we can never fully repay. Two years ago, I
signed the bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our
Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins (PACT) Act enacting the most
significant expansion of benefits and health care for toxic exposed
veterans and their survivors in over thirty years.

Vice President Harris and I moved swiftly in making sure this law was
fully implemented as soon as possible, so veterans and their survivors
would be able to get the expanded services they deserve. Today, because
of the PACT Act, over 1 million veterans and more than 10,000 survivors
are now getting monthly disability benefits related to toxic related
illnesses. Over 5.7 million veterans have been screened for toxic
exposure and over 333,000 toxic-exposed veterans have enrolled in VA
health care. These benefits have been life-changing for so many
families. For survivors of veterans who died from a toxic related
illness, the PACT Act provides a pathway to benefits including monthly
stipends, access to home loans and education benefits as well. Surviving
veteran spouses with children could qualify for over $2,000 per month
and funding toward college tuition.

While we have made great strides in addressing military related toxic
exposures, we still have work to do. My Administration continues to
study other illnesses for presumptive status and to sign up more
veterans for health care. And today, I am announcing that the Department
of Veterans Affairs will take additional steps to close loopholes for
certain veterans exposed to harmful toxins during their military
service. No one should be left behind if they were exposed to toxins and
are experiencing health related problems. My message to veterans, their
families, caregivers and survivors is simple: Jill and I will always
have your back.
