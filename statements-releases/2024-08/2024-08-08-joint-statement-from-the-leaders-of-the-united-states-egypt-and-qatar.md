It is time to bring immediate relief both to the long-suffering people
of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families.  The
time has come to conclude the ceasefire and hostages and detainees
release deal.

The three of us and our teams have worked tirelessly over many months to
forge a framework agreement that is now on the table with only the
details of implementation left to conclude.  This agreement is based on
the principles as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024, and
endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2735. 

There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further
delay.  It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and
implement this agreement.

As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging
proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner
that meets the expectations of all parties.

We have called on both sides to resume urgent discussion on Thursday,
August 15 in Doha or Cairo to close all remaining gaps and commence
implementation of the deal without further delay. 

*President of the United States Joe Biden  *

*President of the Arab Republic of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi*

*Amir of the State of Qatar HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani*
