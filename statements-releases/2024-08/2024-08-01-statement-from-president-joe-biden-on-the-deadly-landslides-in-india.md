Jill and I extend our deepest condolences to all those affected by the
deadly landslides in the state of Kerala in India.  Our prayers are with
the victims of this tragic event, and we mourn with the families who
have lost loved ones. We commend the bravery of the Indian service
members and first responders supporting the complex recovery effort. We
will continue to hold the people of India in our thoughts during this
difficult time.
