title: "Joint Statement from the United\_States, United Kingdom, France, Germany,\
  \ and Italy on the Middle\_East"

We, the leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom, France,
Germany, and Italy discussed the situation in the Middle East. We
expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions
and reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. We endorsed the
joint call from President Biden, President Sisi of Egypt, and Amir Tamim
of Qatar to renew talks later this week with an aim to concluding the
deal as soon as possible, and stressed there is no further time to lose.
All parties must live up to their responsibilities. In addition,
unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed. We expressed our
support for the defense of Israel against Iranian aggression and against
attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups. We called on Iran to stand down
its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed
the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack
take place.
