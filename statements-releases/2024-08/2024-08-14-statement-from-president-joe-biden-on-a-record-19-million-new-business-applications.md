title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on a Record 19 Million New Business\_\
  Applications"
---
 
As of today, entrepreneurs across the country have filed 19 million new
business applications since Vice President Harris and I took office.
That’s 19 million acts of hope and confidence in our economy. A record
number of those businesses are being opened by Black, Latino, and women
entrepreneurs—and it’s no accident. Our Administration supported small
businesses when hundreds of thousands were at risk of closing during the
pandemic and continues to invest in underserved businesses—more than
doubling the number of loans to Black-, Latino-, and women-owned small
businesses. While we fight to support entrepreneurs and build up the
middle class, Congressional Republicans are threatening small businesses
with cuts to the Small Business Administration and by putting big
corporations first to cut their taxes and protect their loopholes.
