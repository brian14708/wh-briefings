title: "Statement from President\_Biden Congratulating President To Lam on His Selection\
  \ as the General Secretary of\_Vietnam"
---
 
I congratulate President To Lam on his selection as the General
Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam’s Central Committee. Nearly
one year ago, Vietnam and the United States launched our Comprehensive
Strategic Partnership—marking a new era of strong cooperation between
our nations. Vice President Harris and I look forward to working with
General Secretary Lam to continue advancing this historic progress,
which supports a strong, independent, prosperous, and resilient Vietnam.
