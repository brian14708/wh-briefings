*Companies have announced $395+ billion in investments in semiconductors
and electronics and the creation of over 115,000 jobs since President
Biden and Vice President Harris took office* 

Two years ago, President Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act
(CHIPS), aimed at reestablishing United States’ leadership in
semiconductor manufacturing, shoring up global supply chains, and
strengthening national and economic security. America invented the
semiconductor, and used to produce nearly 40 percent of the world’s
chips, but today, we produce only about 10 percent of global supply—and
none of the most advanced chips. The CHIPS and Science Act aimed to
change that by investing nearly $53 billion in U.S. semiconductor
manufacturing, research and development, and workforce.  

Dozens of companies have committed to nearly $400 billion in total
semiconductor investments across the country. These investments
have been spurred in large part by the Department of Commerce’s CHIPS
Incentives program, which has signed preliminary agreements with
15companies across 15 states to provide over $30 billion in direct
funding and roughly $25 billion in loans for semiconductor manufacturing
projects. These projects will support the creation of more than 115,000
direct construction and manufacturing jobs, with further investments in
workforce development and training to come – helping to ensure more
chips are made in America by American workers. As a result of these
investments, the United States is on track to produce nearly 30% of the
global supply of leading-edge chips by 2032, up from zero percent when
President Biden and Vice President Harris took office. 

As part of the CHIPS Act, the Biden-Harris Administration has also made
regional investments to spur centers of innovation across America
through the Tech Hubs program, has made investments to revitalize
communities historically overlooked by federal investment through the
Recompete program, and is making critical investments in research and
development and workforce initiatives across the semiconductor
ecosystem.   

**<u>Two Years of Progress on Semiconductor Manufacturing and
Innovation</u>** 

In the past two years, agencies across the federal government have
developed and executed on programs established under CHIPS to restore
domestic semiconductor manufacturing, invest in research and
development, support supply chain resiliency and national security, and
catalyze economic and workforce development. Key milestones in the
Administration’s implementation of CHIPS include: 

***Reshoring U.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing*** 

Thanks to CHIPS Act, the United States will once again be a world leader
in manufacturing the semiconductors that power our lives. In the two
years since President Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law: 

-   The Department of Commerce CHIPS Incentives Program announced
    preliminary agreements with 15 companies, totaling over
    $30 billion of the total available $39 billion in direct incentives
    funded by the CHIPS and Science Act. Commerce is on track to
    allocate all remaining funds with CHIPS grantees by the end of
    2024. 
-   Two years ago, the U.S. produced none of the world’s most advanced
    chips. Now, America is home to all five of the world’s leading-edge
    logic, memory, and advanced packaging providers, while no other
    economy has more than two. Collectively, these fabs will enable the
    United States to produce nearly 30% of the global supply of
    leading-edge chips by 2032.  
-   The CHIPS Act is creating a robust semiconductor ecosystem by
    supporting multiple high-volume advanced packaging facilities,
    expanded production of current and mature-node semiconductors, and
    critical supply chain components, all by the end of the decade to
    support critical industries from automobiles and medical devices to
    artificial intelligence and aerospace.  
-   The Department of the Treasury continues to work on a final rule on
    the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit, which provides a 25%
    investment tax credit for companies engaged in semiconductor
    manufacturing and producing semiconductor manufacturing
    equipment.   
      

***Creating Jobs and Workforce Pipelines for American Workers*** 

A centerpiece of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America
agenda is to create good paying job opportunities for Americans across
the country. CHIPS has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars to
ensuring that America’s semiconductor comeback will serve to benefit
American workers. For example: 

-   CHIPS-funded projects are creating more than 115,000 construction
    and manufacturing jobs with over $250 million of CHIPS funding
    earmarked for local community workforce development, the use of
    which will be guided by local stakeholder input, including from
    academic institutions, training providers, and labor unions, and
    federal partners, including the Departments of Labor and
    Education. These projects will also pay construction workers
    prevailing wages, which ensures they earn family-sustaining wages
    and benefits, and include some of the largest Project Labor
    Agreements in history, establishing that the future of this industry
    in America will be built by union workers. 
-   The Biden-Harris Administration launched Investing in America
    Workforce Hubs in Upstate New York, Phoenix, Arizona, and Columbus,
    Ohio to support the training needed for the growing industries
    there, including booming semiconductor ecosystems. These are just
    three of the nine Workforce Hubs across the country which are
    creating pipelines for Americans to access good-paying jobs in the
    industries seeing increased investments thanks to President Biden’s
    Investing in America agenda.  
-   The Department of Commerce expects to invest hundreds of millions of
    dollars into the National Semiconductor Technology Center’s (NSTC)
    workforce efforts, including the Workforce Center of Excellence
    which will collaborate with industry, academia, labor unions, the
    Departments of Labor and Education, the National Science Foundation,
    and local government partners to address end-to-end workforce
    training needs from access to adoption. 
-   The National Science Foundation (NSF) launched its Future of
    Semiconductors (FuSe) initiative, a $45.6 million investment to
    conduct frontier research and develop the future microelectronics
    workforce. The NSF also announced its inaugural Regional
    Innovation Engines, 10 locations receiving a $150 million investment
    with the potential for up to $2 billion in funding over the next
    decade. 
-   Companies applying for more than $150 million in grants were
    required to submit a robust child care plan that reflects the needs
    of their workers in communities where they plan to build.  Some of
    the largest projects, such as those of Micron and Intel, have
    committed to providing affordable, accessible, high-quality child
    care for thousands of workers across multiple facilities in multiple
    states. This has already led to a dramatic expansion of benefits
    including the construction of dedicated child care facilities at
    multiple project sites as well as discount and reimbursement
    programs in collaboration with local child care providers. 

***Accelerating Regional Economic Development and Innovation*** 

President Biden and Vice President Harris are investing in regions that
suffered from disinvestment for too long despite their economic
potential. Through the Investing in America Agenda, this Administration
is building an economy that brings innovation and opportunity for
hardworking American families. The CHIPS Act expanded the suite of
place-based investment efforts under the Biden-Harris Administration to
build on the momentum of programs under the American Rescue Plan. In the
two years since the CHIPS Act was signed: 

-   The Department of Commerce announced $504 million for 12 Tech Hubs
    to give regions across the nation the resources and opportunities
    needed to lead in the economies of the future, such as
    semiconductors, clean energy, biotechnology, AI, quantum computing,
    and more.  
-   The Department of Commerce is awarding $184 million to six Recompete
    Pilot Program finalists; creating renewed opportunity in
    economically distressed communities through good-paying,
    high-quality jobs. The Recompete Pilot Program targets areas where
    prime-age employment is significantly lower than the national
    average and provides flexible and locally-drive investments to
    support economic comebacks. 
-   The National Science Foundation announced $150 million for 10
    inaugural awards that has already been matched by more than $350
    million in commitments from state and local governments, the private
    sector and philanthropy. These 10 NSF Engines have the potential to
    receive over $2 billion over the next decade, paving the way toward
    a new frontier in American innovation.  
-   The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program will announce
    nearly $54 million in funding that will help small businesses
    explore innovative ideas and the commercial microelectronics
    marketplace. 

***Protecting National Security and Working with Allies and Partners*** 

In September 2023, the Department of Commerce finalized rules to
implement the national security guardrails laid out in CHIPS. These
guardrails are preventing technology and innovation funded by the
program from being misused by foreign countries of concern and
protecting our industrial ecosystem. CHIPS manufacturing funds are also
going towards companies building the semiconductors that are essential
to our aerospace and defense industries. 

-   CHIPS grant funds are directly supporting our national security by
    increasing the supply of critical technologies needed to protect
    Americans, including the production of chips necessary for critical
    defense programs including the F-35 fighter jet program, and chips
    for everyday applications that impact all Americans, from cars to
    secure Wi-Fi.  
-   The Department of Defense’s Microelectronics Commons Program has
    announced an initial $280 million in first year projects to create
    resilient onshore ecosystems for cutting-edge applications in six
    key areas: secure edge/internet of things, electromagnetic warfare,
    5G/6G, Quantum technology, artificial intelligence hardware, and
    commercial leap ahead technologies. These projects build off the
    Commons regionals hubs and are set to kick off, along with
    additional awards for human, digital, and physical infrastructure,
    by the end of the year. 
-   The State Department recently launched the CHIPS Act International
    Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI) Fund supported ITSI
    Western Hemisphere Semiconductor Initiative, which will enhance
    assembly, testing and packaging capabilities in partner countries
    including Mexico, Panama, and Costa Rica. New partnerships have also
    been announced with Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Kenya
    to explore semiconductor supply chain coordination opportunities to
    develop trust, transparency, and resiliency with our allies across
    the globe. 
-   The Department of Commerce announced that the Indo-Pacific Economic
    Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Agreement Relating to Supply Chain
    Resilience entered into force on February 24, 2024. This agreement,
    led by the United States, is ensuring a more resilient, efficient,
    productive and sustainable supply chain for semiconductors and other
    industries. 
-   The Department of Commerce awarded $140 million across 17 projects
    in its first funding opportunity through the Public Wireless Supply
    Chain Innovation Fund, which will drive American wireless
    innovation, competition, and supply chain resilience.   

***Investing in Innovation*** 

The semiconductor was invented here in the United States, and America
has continued to be a leader in the research and development in
semiconductors and some of the most advanced technologies. The CHIPS Act
is helping advance those goals by: 

-   Investing approximately $3 billion in the National Advanced
    Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP) to establish and accelerate
    domestic capacity for semiconductor advanced packaging which will
    drive U.S. technological leadership in leading-edge semiconductors
    and underpin future innovation areas, including artificial
    intelligence. Over 100 concept papers were submitted for the first
    funding opportunity and a second funding opportunity for $1.6
    billion will be announced in the fall. 
-   Establishing Natcast, a non-profit, to operate the NSTC to enable
    rapid adoption of innovations that will enhance domestic
    competitiveness for decades to come. The Department of Commerce,
    together with Natcast, announced the focus of its first three CHIPS
    R&D research facilities: a NSTC Prototyping and National Advanced
    Packaging Manufacturing Program facility, an NSTC Administrative and
    Design facility, and an NSTC Extreme Ultraviolet EUV center – which
    will be complemented by affiliated technical centers.  
-   Issuing funding opportunities through the Department of Commerce for
    a first-of-its kind Manufacturing USA Institute focused on the
    development, validation, and use of digital twins – virtual models
    that mimic the structure, context, and behavior of a physical
    counterpart.
