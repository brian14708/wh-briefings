  \ Security Advisor Eduardo M. A\xF1o of the\_Philippines"
---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with Philippine
National Security Advisor Eduardo M. Año.  Mr. Sullivan and
Mr. Año discussed the continued historic momentum in the
U.S.-Philippines Alliance, including the recent announcement of $500
million in U.S. Foreign Military Financing from the FY 2024 Indo-Pacific
Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, which, working with the U.S.
Congress, will help modernize the Philippine armed forces and coast
guard.  Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Año discussed how this additional security
assistance can bolster U.S.-Philippines cooperation in support of
international maritime law in the South China Sea.  

Mr. Sullivan also condemned the People’s Republic of China’s deliberate
collision with two Philippine Coast Guard vessels operating lawfully
near Sabina Shoal in the Philippines ‘exclusive economic zone on August
19.  Mr. Sullivan reiterated the ironclad U.S. commitment to the
U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty, which extends to armed attacks
on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft—to include those
of its Coast Guard—anywhere in the South China Sea.
