  \ Tice\u2019s\_Captivity"
---
 
This week marks 12 long, terrible years since American Austin Tice was
abducted in Syria. We have repeatedly pressed the government of Syria to
work with us so that we can, at last, bring Austin home. Today, I once
again call for his immediate release<s>.</s>

The freedom of the press is essential, and journalists like Austin play
a critical role informing the public and holding those in power
accountable. We stand in solidarity with Austin, his family, and all
Americans wrongfully detained and held hostage abroad. I will continue
to do everything possible to advocate for and pursue his release and
support his loved ones until he is safely returned home.
