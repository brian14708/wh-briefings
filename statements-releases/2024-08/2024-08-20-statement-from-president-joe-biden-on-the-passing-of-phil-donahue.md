title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Phil\_Donahue"
---
 
In Phil Donahue, our nation has lost a trailblazing television icon who
held up a mirror to America and united us around the toughest issues of
our time.

A son of a working-class, Irish-Catholic family from Cleveland, Phil
first honed his craft as a radio station assistant in university, before
rising to transform television and reshape the national conversation.

Over close to 30 years, nearly 7,000 episodes, and 20 Emmys, he
pioneered the live daytime talk show, helping change hearts and minds
through honest and open dialogue. He broadcast the power of personal
stories in living rooms across the country, interviewing everyone from
our greatest stars to our forgotten neighbors. Insatiably curious and
accepting, Phil saw every guest as worthy of interest and worked to
build understanding, helping us see each other not as enemies, but as
fellow Americans.

Through his extraordinary career in television and through thousands of
daily conversations, Phil Donahue steered the national discourse and
spoke to our better angels. He will be sorely missed.

Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the Donahue family and keep
them close in our hearts—including his beloved wife of 44 years, Marlo
Thomas, and his sister, children, and grandchildren.

May God bless you, Phil.
