title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Lower Prescription Drug\_Prices"
---
 
For years, millions of Americans were forced to choose between paying
for medications or putting food on the table, while Big Pharma blocked
Medicare from being able to negotiate prices on behalf of seniors and
people with disabilities. But we fought back – and won.

Today, for the first time in history, my Administration is
announcing that Medicare has reached agreements on new, lower prices
with the manufacturers of all 10 drugs selected for the first round of
drug price negotiation. When these lower prices go into effect, people
on Medicare will save $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs for their
prescription drugs and Medicare will save $6 billion in the first year
alone. It’s a relief for the millions of seniors that take these drugs
to treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes,
arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and more – and it’s a relief for American
taxpayers.

This historic milestone is only possible because of the Inflation
Reduction Act, which passed with the leadership of Democrats in
Congress, and with Vice President Harris casting the tie-breaking vote
in the Senate – without a single Republican voting for it. We showed
that major progress can be made for the American people when we work
together to take on special interests, even as Big Pharma continues to
go to court to try to block lower prices for consumers. But the Vice
President and I are not backing down. We will continue the fight to make
sure all Americans can pay less for prescription drugs and to give more
breathing room for American families.
