title: "Fact Sheet: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces $150 Million from\
  \ ARPA-H to Deliver Progress on Biden Cancer Moonshot Goals and Improve Health\_\
  Outcomes"
---
 
More than two years ago, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden
reignited the Cancer Moonshot with the goals of reducing the cancer
death rate in the United States by at least half—preventing more than 4
million cancer deaths—by 2047, and improving the experience of people
who are touched by cancer. As part of this effort, President Biden and
Vice President Harris secured bipartisan Congressional support to
establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to
generate breakthroughs in ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and
other diseases. In its first two years, ARPA-H has invested more than
$400 million to fast-track progress on how we prevent, detect, and treat
cancer.

Today in New Orleans, the President and First Lady will announce up to
$150 million in ARPA-H awards to develop technologies that will allow
surgeons to provide more successful tumor-removal surgeries for people
facing cancer. These awards will support researchers from eight teams
across the country who are pursuing innovative ideas as part of ARPA-H’s
Precision Surgical Interventions (PSI) program.

For the nearly two million Americans who are newly diagnosed with solid
tumor cancers each year, surgical removal is often the first step in
their treatment. PSI aims to make these surgeries more effective,
reducing the need for repeat surgeries and decreasing the damage to
healthy tissue, ultimately saving and extending lives.

The first eight awardees include: Dartmouth College (Hanover, NH), Johns
Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD), Rice University (Houston, TX),
Tulane University (New Orleans, LA)**,** University of California, San
Francisco (San Francisco, CA), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
(Champaign, IL), University of Washington (Seattle, WA), and Cision
Vision (Mountain View, CA). These projects are working to improve key
aspects of the surgical experience from improving surgeons’ ability to
visualize important structures like blood vessels and nerves throughout
surgery, to developing next-generation microscopes and imaging
technology that help them remove all cancerous cells in one surgery.

Since reigniting the Cancer Moonshot in 2022, the Biden-Harris
Administration has mobilized the Federal Government and private
companies, healthcare providers, research institutions, and patient and
advocacy groups to accelerate progress on prevention, early detection,
innovation, and support for patients and their families.

Today’s announcement builds on recent efforts by the Biden-Harris
Administration to end cancer as we know it:

-   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in early August [issued
    $9 million in new
    awards](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/07/biden-harris-administration-awards-nearly-9-million-improve-access-cancer-screening-connections-follow-up-treatment-underserved-communities.html)
    to 18 HRSA-funded health centers to improve access to life-saving
    cancer screenings in underserved communities. As part of these
    Accelerating Cancer Screening grants, a program created as part of
    the Biden Cancer Moonshot in 2022, health centers partner directly
    with National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers to expedite
    patient access to diagnosis and cancer treatment.
-   ARPA-H announced a new program in early August,
    [POSEIDON](https://arpa-h.gov/research-and-funding/programs/poseidon),
    which will invest in new technologies to develop cancer screenings
    that accurately detect a number of cancers, even at home, a
    reality.  These innovative Multi-Cancer-Early Detection (MCED) tests
    could improve outcomes for millions of Americans facing cancer.
-   Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a [proposed
    rule](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/07/10/deputy-assistant-to-the-president-for-the-cancer-moonshot-dr-danielle-carnival-on-new-proposed-cms-rules-to-expand-access-to-high-cost-drugs-and-cancer-treatment-at-tribal-facilities/)
    in July that would, for the first time ever, enable Indian Health
    Services (IHS) and Tribal facilities to receive separate payment for
    high-cost drugs for people with Medicare, allowing clinics to
    provide certain health care services, like cancer treatment, in
    Tribal communities.

President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden believe beating cancer is
something we can do, if we do it together. The $150 million in ARPA-H
awards announced today fund research efforts across the country,
including:

-   Tulane University (award of up to $22.9M), Rice University ($18.0M),
    and the University of Washington ($21.1M) will develop imaging
    systems and new techniques to visualize individual cells on the
    surface of a tumor that has been removed. With these advances, if
    successful, a surgeon will be able to examine the surface of the
    removed tissue and assess whether more cancer cells remain in the
    patient before the surgery is complete. These projects will generate
    solutions that will be used in operating rooms, in real-time, and
    without the need for an on-site pathologist.

<!-- -->

-   Johns Hopkins University ($20.9M), University of California, San
    Francisco ($15.1M), and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
    ($32.6M) will invent new microscopes and other tools to identify
    microscopic cancer remnants inside the patient to help the surgeon
    remove all remaining cancer cells before the end of the procedure.

<!-- -->

-   Dartmouth College ($31.3M), Johns Hopkins University, and Cision
    Vision ($22.3M), a company specializing in medical imaging, will
    develop dye-based and other novel techniques that can be used during
    surgery to help visualize critical, and often hidden, structures
    like blood vessels and nerves so that damage to the patient is
    minimized.
