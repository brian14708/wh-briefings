President Biden spoke today with President Abdel-Fattah El Sisi of
Egypt. They discussed the urgency of bringing the ceasefire and hostage
release deal to closure under the comprehensive bridging proposal that
is now in the table, which would free the hostages, bring life-saving
relief to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and de-escalate regional
tensions. They discussed upcoming talks in Cairo and efforts to remove
any remaining obstacles to the deal. The President thanked President El
Sisi for his leadership. Both leaders agreed to remain in close
coordination directly and through their teams over the coming days.
