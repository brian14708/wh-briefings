title: "Fact Sheet: Celebrating the Strength of the United\_States-Dominican Republic\_\
  Partnership"
---
 
The United States and the Dominican Republic share a strong partnership
based on democratic values and historic people-to-people ties. On the
occasion of the inauguration of President Luis Abinader for his second
term as the president of the Dominican Republic tomorrow, President Joe
Biden sent a senior Presidential Delegation led by Secretary of Energy
Jennifer Granholm to extend his heartfelt congratulations to the
government and the people of the Dominican Republic. Furthermore, the
Biden-Harris Administration commits to continuing our support to the
Dominican Republic in the areas of economic growth, energy, security,
health, and human rights, and promoting a more democratic, secure, and
prosperous Western Hemisphere.  Here are some of the examples of the
strength of our partnership:

**INVESTING IN PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE TIES**  
   
Our two countries benefit from unique, shared bonds of friendship and
community.  Millions of Dominicans enrich communities across the United
States and more than 4 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican
Republic each year.    

-   **Investing in the Next Generation of Dominican Leaders: ** Embassy
    Santo Domingo has a collective educational and cultural exchange
    program alumni community of 31,000 emerging Dominican leaders. The
    two leading exchange programs are the Fulbright Foreign Student
    program consisting of almost 900 alumni, and the International
    Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) with almost 1,000 alumni.
-   **English Language Education:**  Embassy Santo Domingo has provided
    technical and funding support to bolster the Dominican government’s
    English language immersion program at the university level. Over
    20,000 students learned advanced English thanks to this program.
-   **Peace Corps:**  Since 1962, more than 5,000 Peace Corps Volunteers
    have served in the Dominican Republic.  Currently, 93 volunteers
    work throughout the country in primary and secondary schools
    promoting literacy, life skills, and business and work skills in
    their communities. 

**PROMOTING INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH**  
  
The United States and the Dominican Republic are working together to
promote inclusive economic growth, including through the Americas
Partnership for Economic Prosperity, launched in 2023 by President Biden
and 11 regional partners, and a wide range of development programs. 

-   **Open Skies Agreement: ** The United States and Dominican Republic
    signed a historic Open Skies Agreement on August 2, 2024.  Once in
    effect, the Agreement will expand our strong economic and commercial
    partnership and create new opportunities for airlines, travel
    companies, and customers.
-   **U.S. International Development Finance Corporation Support: ** The
    Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is providing a $200 million
    direct loan to Banco Popular Dominicano to support the institution’s
    lending to small businesses and women entrepreneurs – groups often
    underserved by traditional financial institutions. In addition, the
    DFC is providing a $42 million loan portfolio guaranty to
    Banreservas designed to support women entrepreneurs as well as small
    businesses and to promote green lending.
-   **The Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement: **
    This agreement, known as DR-CAFTA has created new economic
    opportunities by eliminating tariffs, opening markets, reducing
    barriers to services, and promoting transparency.  Various agencies
    within the United States have provided technical assistance to the
    Dominican Republic to address issues that arise under DR-CAFTA in
    areas including intellectual property, labor rights, the
    environment, and wildlife protection.
-   **Port of Manzanillo: ** The U.S. Agency for International
    Development (USAID) provided $1.3 million to support the planning
    process of the port in coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of
    Engineers.  This project advised the Dominican government on port
    planning and project implementation, strengthening technical
    capacity to meet international standards and transparently tender
    approximately $2.5 billion in contracts for the port.  
-   **Youth Opportunities: ** Through its $4.6 million Youth-Led
    Activity, USAID focuses on strengthening institutions and improving
    youth-friendly services to contribute to community resilience.  We
    seek to expand the economic opportunities for vulnerable youth from
    poor and marginalized neighborhoods to ensure that youth find
    economic and social opportunities that offer a way of life free from
    crime and violence. 
-   **Higher Education:**  USAID works with ISA University, the
    Technology University of Santiago, and the Autonomous University of
    Santo Domingo to replicate and test access and retention best
    practices for youth from high-risk environments. This $4.3 million
    investment promotes higher education attainment for these youth,
    improving their economic prospects and social stability.   

**INVESTING IN CLEAN ENERGY, CLIMATE RESILIENCE**  
  
Through the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis
2030 (PACC 2030), the United States and the Dominican Republic will
deepen technological cooperation, advance the clean energy transition,
and address and mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.

-   **Clean Energy Transition:**  The Department of Energy is supporting
    the Caribbean’s clean energy transition through the Energy
    Resilience and Security in the Caribbean Fund.  This $2.5 million
    fund is designed to provide the technical assistance necessary to
    implement clean energy solutions in the Caribbean in a broad range
    of sectors.
-   **Renewable Energy:**  The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)
    works with the Dominican Republic’s Superintendent of Electricity to
    support the development of battery storage regulations.  USTDA
    assesses gaps in existing regulations and will create a regulatory
    roadmap for the deployment of energy storage technologies throughout
    the power system. The United States seeks to help the DR government
    reduce the cost and environmental impact of electricity generation.
-   **Energy Reform:**  Through USAID’s $8.8 million regional Energy
    Sector Reform in the Dominican Republic, programming aims to
    increase distributed renewable energy generation, assess where
    smart-grid technologies can be deployed to provide energy more
    efficiently, and explore renewable energy generation.  As part of
    this work, USAID initiated the first in a series of energy
    cybersecurity training workshops in the Dominican Republic in
    December 2022. 
-   **Locally-Led Resilience:**  USAID, through its $2.9 million Climate
    Adaptation Activity, aims to enhance environmental sustainability
    and resilience in the Dajabón region by improving natural resource
    management and adopting climate-smart agricultural practices. 
-   **Cleaner Oceans:**  USAID’s solid waste reduction programming aims
    to decrease waste in communities and municipalities in the Dominican
    Republic, leading to cleaner oceans.  This $4.4 million activity
    supports municipalities to effectively manage, reduce, recycle and
    dispose of waste.
-   **Energy Transition Accelerator:**  At the United Nations Climate
    Change Conference in December 2023, the U.S. Department of State,
    the Bezos Earth Fund, and the Rockefeller Foundation presented the
    core framework of the Energy Transition Accelerator (ETA) and
    welcomed the Dominican Republic’s announcement it would join the ETA
    as a pilot country.  The ETA is an innovative carbon finance
    platform aimed at catalyzing private capital to support ambitious
    just energy transition strategies in developing and emerging
    economies. 

**HEALTH COLLABORATION AND FOOD SECURITY**  
  
The United States and Dominican Republic enjoy a longstanding
partnership on health and food security, and our historic investment in
the Dominican health and agricultural systems have impacted thousands of
Dominican citizens.  

-   **President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Program**: 
    The United States has invested over $270 million in the last 16
    years to support the HIV response in the Dominican Republic through
    the PEPFAR program, implemented by USAID and Centers for Disease
    Control (CDC).  The PEPFAR platform has allowed for health
    collaboration beyond HIV, including the DR’s most recent designation
    as a global health security intensive support partner. 
-   **Food Security: ** Since 2020, the U.S. Department of
    Agriculture/Foreign Agricultural Service has provided over $14
    million in funding to support capacity building and training
    programs related to food security, such as the Safe Agriculture/Food
    Export (SAFE) project and the Trade Safe program. 
-   **The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food for Progress Program: **
    The Foreign Agriculture Service has an active five-year, $13.5
    million Food for Progress Program, dubbed Trade Safe. It aims to
    strengthen the Dominican Republic’s sanitary and phytosanitary
    measures as well as strengthen the local food safety systems by
    supporting the implementation of science-and risk-based standards. 
    These standards support critical regulatory improvements to
    facilitate increased agricultural trade between both countries.
-   **Resilient Agriculture:** A $2.7 million, two-year USAID project
    launched in February 2024 will directly address the spike in food
    prices, crude oil, and commodities—including fertilizers and other
    common agricultural inputs—due to supply chain disruptions.  The
    project aims to mobilize funding from the private sector and will
    benefit 1,500 farmers, 30 percent of them women and youth.

**STRENGTHENING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW**  
  
The United States supports the Abinader administration’s efforts to
strengthen democratic institutions, combat corruption, and improve the
rule of law, as we understand these are fundamental to the Dominican
Republic’s economic transformation and social cohesion.

-   **Procurement Transparency:**  USAID’s $3.1 million Procurement
    Transparency Activity, implemented by the U.S. Department of
    Commerce’s Commercial Law Development Program, works to improve
    transparency, efficiency, and competition in the Dominican
    government procurement system by making recommendations on
    international best practices.   
-   **Responsive Justice:**  To improve citizen security, USAID is
    investing more than $9.5 million to strengthen the Dominican
    Republic’s existing justice system by—among other activities—helping
    improve criminal justice institutions’ performance; reducing crime
    and violence, root causes of conflict through people-centered
    approaches; and strengthening the government’s ability to provide
    legal services to vulnerable populations.

**EXPANDING DEFENSE AND SECURITY COOPERATION**  
  
U.S.-Dominican defense and security ties serve as a cornerstone of our
partnership.  The Department of Defense (DoD) continues to cooperate
with the Dominican Republic on many shared priorities, including
building Dominican domain awareness, countering drug trafficking and
other forms of transnational organized crime, climate resilience,
developing humanitarian assistance and disaster response capabilities,
and building institutional capacity.  Defense and security ties serve as
the cornerstone of our alliance.  
  
As the United States and the Dominican Republic work to help enable a
free and open Caribbean region, including through the Caribbean Basin
Security Initiative (CBSI), we celebrate advancements in our
cooperation:

-   **Bilateral-Multilateral Training and Exercises:**  DoD and the
    Dominican Armed Forces conduct subject-matter expert exchanges and
    key leader engagements together, in which they share best practices
    in tactics, techniques, and procedures.  The Dominican and U.S.
    militaries also participate together in exercises, including CENTAM
    Guardian, Tradewinds, *Fuerzas Comando* (Commando Forces), and in
    security conferences promoting regional cooperation on topics such
    as human rights. 
-   **Armed Foreces Modernization:**  The United States is facilitating
    the Dominican military’s acquisitions for modern platforms that will
    enhance the Dominican Armed Force’s capabilities and maintain their
    interoperability with U.S. and allied systems.  With the support of
    DoD, the Dominican Air Force established its National Southern
    Command at Barahona airport.
-   **International Military Education and Training: ** DoD promotes
    education programs to strengthen the continued professionalism and
    effectiveness of the Dominican military, enabling the military to
    support Dominican law enforcement authorities in safeguarding
    citizen security and countering illicit trafficking.
-   **Citizen Security:**  The State Department has provided
    comprehensive support to police transformation efforts in the
    Dominican Republic, including reformation of the police training
    curriculum to increase the focus on human rights; supporting human
    resource advising for career development; and providing major IT
    donations for data management, transparency and accountability.
-   **Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing: ** The
    Treasury Department has provided technical assistance to strengthen
    efforts to combat money laundering and to counter terrorism
    financing in the Dominican Republic, and the Department of State has
    helped establish the country’s first Anti-Money Laundering Task
    Force.

**ADVANCING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND LABOR RIGHTS**  
  
The United States is committed to supporting the Dominican Republic to
advance our shared values of freedom, democracy, and respect for human
rights and labor rights. 

-   **Combating Trafficking in Persons:**  With over $1 million in
    funding from the State Department, the United States continues to
    support “RD SIN TRATA,” a program that aims to reduce the risk of
    trafficking and the revictimization of survivors by building the
    capacity of the Dominican Government and civil society to prevent,
    protect and prosecute trafficking cases and increase access to
    trauma-informed and victim-centered standard operating procedures
    for specialized shelter staff.
-   **Supporting Women and Care Workers:** The USAID-funded Together We
    Care Project is working to promote better working conditions and
    social protections for care workers, address gender inequities in
    the health workforce, and formalize the domestic care economy. 
-   **Advancing LGBTQI+ Rights:**  USAID’s $2.3 million “Being LGBTQI In
    the Caribbean” activity strengthens the professional and
    institutional capacities of civil society organizations and
    individual activists dedicated to lesbian, gay, bisexual,
    transsexual, queer and intersex (LGBTQI+) equality within the
    Caribbean.

**REGIONAL LEADERSHIP**

-   **Summit of the Americas:**  The United States and the Dominican
    Republic joined other governments to achieve bold hemispheric
    commitments on health and resilience, sustainability, digital
    transformation, the clean energy transition, and democratic
    governance at the Ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles in
    2022.  The United States looks forward to supporting the Dominican
    Republic’s agenda for the Tenth Summit of the Americas that the
    Dominican Republic will host in Punta Cana in 2025.
-   **The Alliance for Development and Democracy: ** The Dominican
    Republic, together with Costa Rica and Panama, launched the ADD in
    2021 as a new multilateral forum to promote stronger democracy and
    deeper commercial and economic integration.  Ecuador joined the
    group in 2022, and the four countries have collaborated with the
    United States to strengthen supply chains and improve economic
    competitiveness.
-   **Improved Stability in Haiti:**  The United States and the
    Dominican Republic have worked together to improve stability in
    Haiti, including through garnering diplomatic support for the United
    Nations-authorized Multinational Security Support mission in Haiti,
    working collaboratively with the Caribbean Community, and supporting
    trade preferences for Haiti’s manufacturing sector.
