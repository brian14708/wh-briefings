title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Prime Minister Kishida of\_Japan"
---
 
Prime Minister Kishida Fumio’s leadership has been nothing short of
historic. Since he assumed office nearly three years ago, Prime Minister
Kishida and I have worked together to take the U.S.-Japan Alliance to
new heights, from advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region, to
standing side-by-side as steadfast, global partners. Guided by
unflinching courage and moral clarity, Prime Minister Kishida has
transformed Japan’s role in the world. He unveiled a momentous new
national security strategy; surged support to Ukraine after Russia’s
invasion; and, together with President Yoon of the Republic of Korea,
has taken historic steps to usher in a new era of U.S.-ROK-Japan
trilateral cooperation, strengthening our collective capacity to take on
common challenges. Prime Minister Kishida took these and other actions
not because they were easy – but because he believes to his core that
they were the right thing to do. Put simply, thanks to Prime Minister
Kishida’s leadership, the future of the U.S.-Japan Alliance is stronger
and brighter than ever. Prime Minister Kishida’s courageous leadership
will be remembered on both sides of the Pacific for decades to come, and
I will always be grateful to call him my friend.
