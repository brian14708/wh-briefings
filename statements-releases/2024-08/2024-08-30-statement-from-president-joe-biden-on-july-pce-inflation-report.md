title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on July PCE Inflation\_Report"
---
 
Today’s report shows we are making real progress, with inflation falling
to 2.5%—continuing at the lowest level in more than three years. Wages
are growing more than prices, giving people an extra $1,400 in income
since the pandemic. But there is more work to do.

Prices are still too high, and Vice President Harris and I are fighting
to lower costs by building 3 million new homes and expanding our
prescription drug caps to all Americans. We’re also lowering costs by
investing in record energy production. Prices at the pump are almost 50
cents lower than a year ago—the lowest Labor Day gas prices in three
years.

Congressional Republicans have a different approach. They want to give
massive tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations while raising
taxes on hardworking Americans by almost $4,000. Experts agree that
their plans would “reignite” inflation—undoing our work to lower costs
and grow the middle class. We won’t let them.
