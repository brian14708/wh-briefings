Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with Yulia Navalnaya, widow of
Alexey Navalny, following the release of 16 individuals from Russia,
including three American citizens, one American green card holder, as
well as five German citizens and seven Russian citizens who were
political prisoners, several of whom worked with Navalny in his efforts
to combat corruption and to build a free, democratic Russia. The Vice
President welcomed the release of these individuals and reaffirmed that
she will continue to stand with those fighting for freedom in Russia and
around the world. The Vice President commended Navalnaya for her courage
in continuing her husband’s work for justice and the rule of the law in
Russia.  The Vice President
