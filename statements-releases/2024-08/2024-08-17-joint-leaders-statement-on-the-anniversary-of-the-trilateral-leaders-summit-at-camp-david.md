title: "Joint Leaders\u2019 Statement on the Anniversary of the Trilateral Leaders\u2019\
  \ Summit at Camp\_David"
---
 
We, the leaders of Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and the United
States (U.S.), commemorate the tremendous progress in our trilateral
cooperation in the year since our historic summit.  The spirit of the
Trilateral Leaders’ Summit continues to inspire us, and the principles
we established at Camp David serve as a roadmap for our unparalleled
cooperation. We are working together to achieve our shared goals of
advancing security and prosperity for the region and the world.

We stand by our commitment to consult on regional challenges,
provocations, and threats affecting our collective interests and
security. We renew our commitment to enhancing security
cooperation—girded by the ironclad U.S.-Japan and U.S.-ROK
alliances—deepening the alignment of our shared economic and
technological priorities, increasing coordination on global health
initiatives, and further expanding the robust people-to-people ties
between our three countries.  Over the past year, we have demonstrated
our unwavering commitment to these shared objectives through close
consultation and coordination on priorities in the Indo-Pacific and
beyond.

We celebrate the accomplishments of our trilateral cooperation,
including the inaugural execution of the trilateral multi-domain
exercise Freedom Edge, the signing of a new Trilateral Security
Cooperation Framework, and the progress made by our trilateral working
groups focused on combatting efforts by the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea to generate revenue for its weapons of mass destruction
programs through cybercrime and other illicit means. We are resolved to
maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, remain aligned in our
shared vision, and stand ready to meet the world’s greatest challenges. 
We hold an unshakeable belief that cooperation between Japan, the
Republic of Korea, and the United States is indispensable for meeting
today’s challenges and will set the stage for a prosperous future.
