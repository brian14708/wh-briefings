Earlier today, I received an update from my negotiating team on the
ground in Doha and directed them to put forward the comprehensive
bridging proposal presented today, which offers the basis for coming to
a final agreement on a ceasefire and hostage release deal. I spoke
separately with Amir Sheikh Tamim and President Sisi to review the
significant progress made in Doha over the past two days of talks, and
they expressed the strong support of Qatar and Egypt for the U.S.
proposal as co-mediators in this process. Our teams will remain on the
ground to continue technical work over the coming days, and senior
officials will convene again in Cairo before the end of the week. They
will report to me regularly. I am sending Secretary Blinken to Israel to
reaffirm my iron-clad support for Israel’s security, continue our
intensive efforts to conclude this agreement and to underscore that with
the comprehensive ceasefire and hostage release deal now in sight, no
one in the region should take actions to undermine this process.
