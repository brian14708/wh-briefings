title: "FACT SHEET: Two Years In, the Inflation Reduction Act is Lowering Costs for\
  \ Millions of Americans, Tackling the Climate Crisis, and Creating\_Jobs"
---
 
Two years ago, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, with
Vice President Harris casting the tie-breaking vote in Congress. The
Inflation Reduction Act is a key part of the Biden-Harris
Administration’s Investing in America agenda, which has driven the
fastest and most equitable recovery on record – creating good-paying
jobs, expanding opportunity, and lowering costs in every corner of the
country.

Already, the Inflation Reduction Act is transforming American lives by
finally beating Big Pharma to negotiate lower prescription drug prices,
making the largest investment in clean energy and climate action in
history, creating hundreds of thousands good-paying jobs, lowering
health care and energy costs, and making the tax code fairer. Visit the

to see how Americans are saving money on their annual expenses because
of the Inflation Reduction Act and other Biden-Harris Administration
actions.

In the two years since the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law:

-   Just yesterday, the President and Vice President announced that, for
    the first time in history, Medicare successfully negotiated lower
    prescription drug prices, which will **save millions of seniors,
    people with disabilities, and other Medicare beneficiaries over $1.5
    billion out-of-pocket** in the first year. 
-   Millions of Americans are **saving an average of $800 per year on
    health insurance premiums** because of cost savings from the
    American Rescue Plan that the Inflation Reduction Act extended,
    helping drive the nation’s uninsured rate to historic lows.
-   4 million seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries **saved money on
    insulin because of the law’s cap at $35 for a month’s supply**. 10.3
    million Medicare enrollees received a free vaccine in 2023, saving
    them more than $400 million in out-of-pocket vaccine costs.
-   The IRS successfully piloted Direct File in 12 states, **saving
    140,000 people an estimated $5.6 million in tax preparation fees by
    enabling them to file their taxes directly** with the IRS online,
    for free. And, the IRS has **recovered over $1 billion by cracking
    down on millionaire tax cheats** since the law passed. 
-   Last year, [**3.4 million
    Americans**](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-act-saving-american-households-money-while-reducing-climate-change-and-air-pollution)
    **benefited from $8.4 billion in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits
    to lower the cost of clean energy and energy efficiency upgrades**
    in their homes – significantly outpacing projections of the
    popularity of the tax credits in just the first year they were
    available.
-   Since January 2024**,** [**more than 250,000
    Americans**](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2403)
    **have claimed the IRA’s electric vehicle tax credit,** saving these
    buyers about $1.5 billion total. Nearly all of these buyers claimed
    the incentive at the point of sale.
-   Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, companies
    have announced[**$900
    billion**](/Users/ECHutchinson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/DWHF39NC/invest.gov)
    **in clean energy and manufacturing investments** in the US,
    including over $265 billion in clean energy investments since the
    Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law. These investments are
    creating over 330,000 new jobs in the United States according to an
    outside group. 
-   **Economically distressed areas are poised to benefit the most**
    from those investments. Over 99% of high-poverty counties in the
    United States are benefitting from an Investing in America project
    funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law, or CHIPS and Science Act. According to [Treasury Department
    analysis](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2176),
    since the Inflation Reduction Act passed, 75% of private sector
    clean energy investments have flowed to counties with lower than
    median household incomes,  and clean energy investment in [energy
    communities](https://energycommunities.gov/) has doubled.  And, the
    Inflation Reduction Act is the largest investment in environmental
    justice in history.

Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to
protect the critical investments that the Inflation Reduction Act is
making in the domestic clean energy economy from unfair trade practices.
In May, President Biden
[increased](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/)
tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese imports to combat China’s artificially
low-priced exports in strategic sectors such as electric vehicles,
batteries, and solar. These actions protect American jobs, businesses,
investments, and economic growth. 

**Lowering health care costs for millions of Americans**

President Biden and Vice President Harris have made expanding access to
high-quality, affordable health care and lowering prescription drug
costs for American families a top priority. Thanks to the Inflation
Reduction Act, health care is more accessible and more affordable than
ever before.  In just the last two years:

-   The law enhanced the Affordable Care Act’s financial assistance that
    is available to consumers to purchase health insurance. Millions of
    Americans are saving, on average, about $800 a year on their health
    insurance plans, with more than 80 percent of consumers able to find
    health insurance for $10 or less a month. As a result, a
    record-breaking 21 million people signed up for ACA coverage
    in 2024. That’s 9 million more than when the President and Vice
    President took office, and more underserved communities are
    enrolling in coverage, with 1.7 million Black Americans and 3.4
    million Latinos enrolled, a 95% and 103% increase, respectively,
    since 2020.
-   The Inflation Reduction Act capped insulin costs at $35 for a
    month’s supply and making recommended adult vaccines free. Four
    million Medicare beneficiaries are now saving on their monthly
    insulin costs, and over 10 million beneficiaries received a free
    vaccine, saving more than $400 million in out-of-pocket cost. 
-   Drug companies that increase prices faster than inflation now have
    to pay a rebate to Medicare—which is translating into lower out of
    pocket costs for seniors.
-   Next year, out of pocket drug costs will be capped at $2,000 per
    year for Medicare beneficiaries, which is expected to save nearly 19
    million seniors an average of $400 per year.
-   The Inflation Reduction Act – for the first time ever – gives
    Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. Just
    this week, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new, lower
    prescription drug prices for all ten drugs selected for the first
    year of the Inflation Reduction Act’s Medicare Drug Price
    Negotiation Program. The new, lower prices, which go into effect in
    2026, will save American taxpayers $6 billion and will save seniors
    and people with disabilities $1.5 billion in out of pocket costs in
    2026 alone. These new prices cut the list cost for drugs that treat
    heart disease, blood clots, diabetes, cancer, and more by nearly 40%
    to 80%.

**Lowering energy costs with the largest climate investment in history**

The Inflation Reduction Act is tackling the climate crisis by advancing
clean power, cutting pollution from buildings, transportation, and
industry and supporting climate-smart agriculture and forestry. The law
is accelerating our progress toward President Biden and Vice President
Harris’ goal of cutting U.S. climate pollution by 50 to 52 percent below
2005 levels in 2030.

Two years after the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act, the
Biden-Harris Administration has made tremendous progress implementing
the climate and clean energy provisions of this law quickly and
effectively. Treasury guidance is now available for nearly all of the
Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax provisions. On the grant,
loan, and rebate side of the law, nearly two thirds of Inflation
Reduction Act funding has been awarded. As an example of the
Administration’s rapid progress on implementation, today the
Environmental Protection Agency announced that all $27 billion in awards
through their Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund are now obligated. $20
billion of these awards go toward a national clean energy financing
network that will support [tens of thousands of clean energy
projects](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/04/biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-20-billion-in-awards-to-expand-access-to-clean-energy-and-climate-solutions-and-lower-energy-costs-for-communities-across-the-nation/),
reducing or avoiding millions of metric tons of carbon pollution
annually over the next seven years. The other $7 billion in awards
through the Solar for All program will save over [$350 million each
year](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-7-billion-solar-all-grants-deliver-residential)
on energy bills for over 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households
through residential solar.

In the two years since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction
Act into law:

-   Clean energy projects are creating more than 330,000 jobs in nearly
    every state in the country, according to outside groups.
-   Companies have announced $265 billion in new clean energy
    investments in nearly every state in the nation. According to
    [Treasury Department
    analysis](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2176),
    many of these investments are happening in underserved
    communities—since the IRA passed, 75% of private sector clean energy
    investments made since the Inflation Reduction Act passed have
    occurred in counties with lower than median household incomes,  and
    clean energy investment in [energy
    communities](https://energycommunities.gov/) has doubled.

<!-- -->

-   Last week, Treasury and IRS released new data showing that in 2023,
    [more than 3.4 million American
    families](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2521)
    saved $8.4 billion from IRA consumer tax credits on home energy
    technologies. These tax credits can save families up to 30% off heat
    pumps, insulation, rooftop solar, and other clean energy
    technologies.
-   New York and Wisconsin have now launched home energy rebate
    programs, with more states expected to launch later this summer and
    fall. Already, [22
    states](/Users/ECHutchinson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/DWHF39NC/energy.gov/save/rebates)
    have submitted their applications to DOE to receive their full
    rebate funding. These rebate programs help low- and middle-income
    families afford cost-saving electric appliances and energy
    efficiency improvements by providing rebates up to $14,000 per
    household. In total, the [IRA rebates
    programs](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-first-state-nation-launch-historic-home-energy#:~:text=New%20York%20State%27s%20Home%20Energy%20Rebate%20Program&text=The%20first%20phase%20of%20New,is%20%2414%2C000%20per%20housing%20unit.)
    are expected to save consumers up to $1 billion annually in energy
    costs and support an estimated 50,000 U.S. jobs in residential
    construction, manufacturing, and other sectors.
-   Since January 2024, [more than 250,000
    Americans](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2403)
    have claimed the Inflation Reduction Act’s EV tax credits—either
    $7,500 off a qualified new electric vehicle, or up to $4,000 off a
    qualified used electric vehicle. In total, these taxpayers have
    saved about $1.5 billion and nearly all buyers claimed the incentive
    at the point of sale.

**  
Making the tax system fairer and making the wealthy pay their fair
share**

The Inflation Reduction Act fully pays for these investments, and
reduces the deficit over the long run, by cutting wasteful spending on
special interests and making big corporations and the wealthy pay more
of their fair share. After 55 of the biggest corporations in America
paid $0 in federal income tax on $40 billion in profits in 2020, the
Inflation Reduction Act requires billion-dollar corporations to pay at
least 15 percent in tax. It also requires corporations to pay a 1
percent excise tax on stock buybacks, encouraging businesses to invest
in their growth and productivity instead of funneling tax-preferred
profits to foreign shareholders. By making large corporations pay more
of their fair share, the IRA will raise around $300 billion over a
decade.

The Inflation Reduction Act also makes a historic investment in
modernizing the IRS, providing funding to better taxpayer experience,
reduce fraud, and upgrade critical technology infrastructure. Thanks to
these investments, the IRS has already:

-   Improved services for millions of taxpayers. This spring, the IRS
    answered 3 million more phone calls than in 2022, cut phone wait
    times to three minutes from 28 minutes, served 200,000 more
    taxpayers in person, and saved taxpayers 1.4 million hours on hold
    last filing season. It also expanded online services, enabling 94%
    of taxpayers to submit forms digitally instead of via mail if they
    so choose.
-   Successfully piloted Direct File, allowing taxpayers to easily file
    their taxes online and for free, directly with the IRS for the first
    time. Over 140,000 Americans successfully filed their taxes through
    Direct File this year, claiming over $90 million in refunds and
    saving an estimated $5.6 million in tax preparation fees. Users said
    Direct File was easy and fast to use, with 90% rating their
    experience excellent or above average. Building on this success, the
    IRS has invited all 50 states and the District of Columbia to join
    Direct File starting in 2025.
-   Collected $1 billion from 1,500 millionaire tax cheats, launched
    enforcement action against 25,000 millionaires who have not filed a
    tax return since 2017, began audits on dozens of the largest
    corporations and partnerships, and cracked down on high-end tax
    evasion like deducting personal use of corporate jets as a business
    expense. At the same time, the IRS is adhering to Treasury Secretary
    Yellen’s commitment to not increase audit rates relative to current
    levels for small businesses and Americans making less than $400,000
    a year.

Over the next decade, the Inflation Reduction Act’s investments will
enable the IRS to further crack down on wealthy and corporate tax cheats
and collect over $400 billion in additional revenue.

Going forward, the IRS is on track to implement additional improvements
to taxpayer experience; provide additional in-person services in rural
and underserved areas; redesign notices and forms to be less confusing;
and expand online and mobile-friendly tools.

**Investing in America to create jobs and expand opportunity**

When President Biden thinks about climate change, he thinks about jobs.
Two years into implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, it’s easy
to see why.

Across the nation, the Inflation Reduction Act is catalyzing a clean
energy and manufacturing boom. Since President Biden took office, the
Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda has catalyzed
nearly $900 billion in private sector investment commitments, including
roughly $400 billion in clean energy across every state in the nation.
That topline figure includes enough power generation to replace 40
Hoover Dams, the largest wind tower manufacturing facility in the world,
the largest solar investment in US history.

Broader macroeconomic indicators also illustrate how, through tax
credits and domestic content requirements within the law–we are
successfully onshoring critical supply chains and encouraging a
resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Real investment in manufacturing
structures is at an all-time high—and has been for six quarters.
Manufacturing’s contribution to GDP broke quarters for three consecutive
quarters in 2023. And Americans have filed to open a record 300,000 new
manufacturing businesses.

These investments are having real impacts on communities—particularly
those that need it most. Public dollars are flowing disproportionately
to disadvantaged and left behind communities: 99% of high-poverty
counties have received funding from the infrastructure law, CHIPS Act,
or Inflation Reduction Act, and non-metro communities have received
nearly double the per capita funding of their urban counterparts. On the
private sector side, analysis from the US Treasury tells a similar
story. Since the IRA passed, 84% of announced clean investments have
flowed to counties with college graduation rates below the national
average, and the rate of investment in [energy
communities](https://energycommunities.gov/) has more than doubled. 

**Given these successes, it is no wonder that Republicans who voted
against the bill are suddenly trying to take credit for it—and urging
their leadership not to proceed with an unpopular repeal effort.**
