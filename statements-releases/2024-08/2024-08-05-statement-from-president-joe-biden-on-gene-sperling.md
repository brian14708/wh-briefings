title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Gene\_Sperling"
---
 
When I took office, our economy was reeling, a pandemic was raging, and
hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country were at
risk of shutting their doors. Having run Recovery Act implementation for
President Obama, I knew I needed an American Rescue Plan Coordinator
with the expertise and experience to hit the ground running. I’m glad I
picked Gene Sperling.  
  
Gene joined my administration as the only person to have ever directed
the National Economic Council under two presidents, and has helped me
execute a rescue plan that has led to one of the most equitable and
resilient economic recoveries ever. His work helped nearly 40 million
working families get unprecedented child tax cut relief and over 8
million renters get emergency assistance to help keep their families
housed. Under Gene’s leadership, the American Rescue Plan has delivered
economic relief to cities and counties across the country, protected
millions of union pensions, made the largest-ever federal investment in
public safety, and kept thousands of small businesses afloat.  
  
I also looked to Gene as a trusted advisor on the economy and gave him
some of the toughest assignments, including serving as my liaison to the
Big 3 automakers and UAW as autoworkers fought for – and secured –
record contracts.  
  
Having traveled from Delaware to D.C. every day during my Senate career,
I know a thing or two about long commutes. I’m grateful to Gene’s wife
Allison, his children Nina and Miles and his godchildren Derick and
Samantha for allowing Gene to lend me his wisdom, his counsel, and his
friendship. They should know our nation is stronger and more just
because of the families that Gene has spent every day fighting for over
the past three-and-a-half years.
