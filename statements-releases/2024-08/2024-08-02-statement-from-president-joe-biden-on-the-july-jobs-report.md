title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the July Jobs\_Report"
---
 
Since Vice President Harris and I took office, our economy has created
nearly 16 million jobs, average unemployment has been lower than during
any administration in 50 years, and incomes have risen faster than
prices. Today’s report shows employment is growing more gradually at a
time when inflation has declined significantly. Business investment
remains strong thanks in part to our investing in America agenda, which
is creating good-paying jobs in communities that have been left behind.
There’s more to do, but we’re making progress growing the economy from
the middle out and the bottom up.  
   
Prices are still too high. We will keep fighting to lower costs by
taking on price gouging, capping prescription drug costs, and building
more homes. Congressional Republicans are siding with special interests
at the expense of the middle class—with more tax cuts for billionaires
and big corporations while threatening Social Security and Medicare.
While they try to take us back, we will keep fighting for the future.
