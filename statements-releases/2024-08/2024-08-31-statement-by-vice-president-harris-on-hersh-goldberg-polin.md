title: Statement by Vice President Harris on Hersh Goldberg-Polin
---
 
On October 7, Hersh Goldberg-Polin—an American citizen—was taken hostage
by Hamas terrorists. He was just 23 years old, attending a music
festival with friends. We now know he was murdered by Hamas. His body
was recovered today in the tunnels under Rafah, along with five other
hostages.

Doug and my prayers are with Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin,
Hersh’s parents, and with everyone who knew and loved Hersh. When I met
with Jon and Rachel earlier this year, I told them: You are not alone.
That remains true as they mourn this terrible loss. Americans and people
around the world will pray for Jon, Rachel, and their family and send
them love and strength. As is said in the Jewish tradition, may Hersh’s
memory be a blessing.

Hamas is an evil terrorist organization. With these murders, Hamas has
even more American blood on its hands. I strongly condemn Hamas’
continued brutality, and so must the entire world. From its massacre of
1,200 people to sexual violence, taking of hostages, and these murders,
Hamas’ depravity is evident and horrifying. The threat Hamas poses to
the people of Israel—and American citizens in Israel—must be eliminated
and Hamas cannot control Gaza. The Palestinian people too have suffered
under Hamas’ rule for nearly two decades.

As Vice President, I have no higher priority than the safety of American
citizens, wherever they are in the world. President Biden and I will
never waver in our commitment to free the Americans and all those held
hostage in Gaza.
