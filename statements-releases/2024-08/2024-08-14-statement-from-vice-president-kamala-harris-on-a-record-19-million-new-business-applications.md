title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on a Record 19 Million New Business\_\
  Applications"

Small businesses are the backbone of our communities. They strengthen
the middle class by creating jobs, advancing opportunity, and
establishing pathways for Americans to build intergenerational wealth.
That is why President Biden and I fight every day to invest in America’s
small businesses, their owners and entrepreneurs, and the workers who
power them.  
  
Today, I am proud to celebrate that a record 19 million new small
business applications have been filed since President Biden and I took
office. Building on work that I did as a United States senator, our
Administration is investing billions of dollars in community lenders,
which provide capital and financial support to small business owners and
entrepreneurs in overlooked and underserved communities, including in
rural America. These efforts are working, as we witness record small
business creation from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in
entrepreneurship.  
  
President Biden and I will continue to invest in the ambitions and
aspirations of small business owners and entrepreneurs in communities
across our nation as we ensure they have the resources and opportunity
to not only survive but thrive.
