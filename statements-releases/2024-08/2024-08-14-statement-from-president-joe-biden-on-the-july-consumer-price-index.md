title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the July Consumer Price\_Index"
---
 
Today’s report shows that we continue to make progress fighting
inflation and lowering costs for American households. Inflation has
fallen below 3% and core inflation has fallen to the lowest level since
April 2021. We have more work to do to lower costs for hardworking
Americans, but we are making real progress, with wages rising faster
than prices for 17 months in a row.

Prices are still too high. Large corporations are sitting on record
profits and not doing enough to lower prices. That’s why we are taking
on Big Pharma to lower prescription drug prices. We’re cutting red tape
to build more homes while taking on corporate landlords that unfairly
increase rent. And we’re taking on price gouging and junk fees to lower
everyday costs from groceries to air travel. Congressional Republicans
would raise prices for middle class families while cutting taxes for
billionaires and big corporations. While they try to take us back, we
will fight for the future.
