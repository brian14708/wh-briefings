title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Sean Savett on World Humanitarian\_Day"
---
 
Today, we mark World Humanitarian Day and honor the brave humanitarian
workers around the world who put themselves in harm’s way to help the
most vulnerable. From crises in Sudan, Gaza, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, and elsewhere, these humanitarian workers often operate in
the most challenging circumstances, including active conflicts, to
ensure that life-saving assistance reaches those who need it most. Their
actions support communities in their most dire moments of need, and
contribute to a safer, more secure world. Today, and every day, we
owe humanitarian workers our gratitude for their service and our
commitment to continue advocating for their critical work and their
safety in the face of the world’s most challenging circumstances. 

The United States is committed to continuing to stand alongside
humanitarian workers and dedicate critical resources to save lives and
alleviate suffering worldwide. That’s why in 2023, we provided nearly
$15 billion in humanitarian aid and, in 2024, we have stepped up to
address the unprecedented level of need around the world. As nearly 300
million people now require humanitarian assistance and
protection, we reaffirm our steadfast commitment to this
work and continue to urge international partners to join us in stepping
up their contributions to address growing humanitarian needs around the
world. Working together, we can make meaningful life-saving change in
countless lives.  

On this World Humanitarian Day, and every day, we stand in solidarity
with aid workers and honor their tireless efforts to save lives,
alleviate suffering, and preserve human dignity.
