  \ of Fentanyl Scheduling\_Actions"
---
 
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) announced that they will begin
scheduling three essential precursor chemicals used to manufacture
illicit fentanyl, thereby subjecting these chemicals to additional
regulation and control – a valuable step forward.  This marks the third
significant scheduling action by the PRC since President Biden met with
President Xi and resumed bilateral counternarcotics cooperation with the
PRC in November, 2023.  This action follows last week’s [senior official
Counternarcotics Working
Group meeting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/01/readout-of-the-u-s-prc-bilateral-counternarcotics-working-group-senior-official-meeting/) between the
United States and the PRC, where the two countries discussed key
initiatives, including ways to increase law enforcement cooperation,
disrupt the illicit financing of transnational criminal organizations,
and accelerate the scheduling of precursor chemicals.
