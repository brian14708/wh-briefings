title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on New Clean Energy\_Jobs"
---
 
When I think of combatting the climate crisis, I think of good-paying
jobs for American workers. According to a new report released this week,
in the two years since I signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law,
companies have announced more than 330,000 new clean energy jobs. Many
of these jobs are good-paying, union jobs that do not require a college
degree, including electricians, construction workers, and mechanics
working on innovative clean energy projects. Thanks to my
Administration’s policies, these new jobs are driving a manufacturing
boom and lowering costs for families by increasing access to affordable,
clean energy—including wind and solar energy.

Despite this progress, House Republicans want to take our country
backward and have voted dozens of times to repeal these transformative
policies—even though more than half of these jobs are being created in
their districts. I will continue fighting for American families by
lowering utility bills and increasing access to good-paying, union jobs.
