title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New, Lower Prices\
  \ for First Ten Drugs Selected for Medicare Price Negotiation to Lower Costs for\
  \ Millions of\_Americans"
---
 
*New prices are expected to save millions of seniors and other Medicare
beneficiaries $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs in the first year of
the program alone*

For far too long, Americans have paid more for their prescription drugs
than any developed nation. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is
delivering on its promise to lower out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors
and save money for Americans. That’s because Medicare has the power to
negotiate prescription drug prices for the first time in history
thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by
President Biden with Vice President Harris casting the tie-breaking
vote. Because Medicare is now able to negotiate lower prescription drug
prices for seniors and people with disabilities, American taxpayers are
expected to save $6 billion on prescription drug costs, and people
enrolled in Medicare are expected to save $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket
costs in 2026 alone. President Biden and Vice President Harris took on
Big Pharma and won, and now millions of seniors and others on Medicare
will soon see their drug costs go down on some of the most common and
expensive prescription drugs that treat heart disease, cancer, diabetes,
blood clots, and more.  
  
**HHS Announces Negotiated Prices for Medicare Drugs**  
  
HHS has reached agreements with all participating manufacturers on new
negotiated, lower drug prices for the first 10 drugs selected for the
Medicare drug price negotiation program. After manufacturers
have [steadily increased the list
prices](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/medicare-drug-price-negotiation-program-comparing-drug-price) of
all 10 of these drugs since they went on the market, these new prices
will cut the list price of these drugs between 38 and 79 percent.  
  
The new prices will go into effect for people with Medicare Part D
prescription drug coverage in 2026:

These ten drugs are among those with highest total spending in Medicare
Part D. If the negotiated prices had been in effect during 2023,
Medicare would have saved an estimated $6 billion. When the negotiated
prices go into effect in 2026, people enrolled in Medicare Part D are
estimated to save $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs.

Millions of Part D enrollees that depend on these treatments to treat
life-threatening conditions including diabetes, heart failure, and
cancer are also expected to see lower out-of-pocket costs for these
drugs. For example, a Medicare enrollee who takes Stelara for their
arthritis and pays $3,459 on their drug today for a 30-day supply would
pay only $1,174 in 2026. Many seniors and people with disabilities on
Medicare who take these drugs will also benefit from the Inflation
Reduction Act’s $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket spending, which will be
fully in effect in 2025, saving 19 million beneficiaries an average of
$400 per year, in addition to these savings from the negotiated drug
prices.

More drugs will be selected each year as part of Medicare’s drug price
negotiation program. Medicare will select up to 15 additional drugs
covered under Part D for negotiation in 2025, up to an additional 15
Part B and D drugs in 2026, and up to 20 drugs every year after that.

**Building on Progress Lowering Health Care Costs**

Every day, millions of Americans are saving money on health care costs
because of the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions.

-   People with Medicare are [saving an average of
    $70](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/03/15/seniors-people-with-disabilities-likely-save-over-230-million-vaccines-thanks-inflation-reduction-act-according-new-hhs-report.html) in
    out-of-pocket costs on vaccines like shingles and Tdap because
    President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act made recommended vaccines
    free for beneficiaries, including the 10.3 million enrollees who
    received a free vaccine in 2023.
-   All 3.4 million Medicare Part D enrollees who filled an insulin
    prescription in 2023 had their insulin costs capped at $35 per
    month, [saving some seniors hundreds of
    dollars](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/24/new-hhs-report-finds-major-savings-americans-who-use-insulin-thanks-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act.html) for
    a month’s supply.
-   Some seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries taking drugs covered
    under Part B for which manufacturers have hiked prices faster than
    inflation are saving up to $4,593 in lower coinsurance this quarter
    thanks to the new Medicare inflation rebates.
-   Starting this year, Part D enrollees no longer pay 5% co-insurance
    when they reach the catastrophic phase of their benefit and have
    their out-of-pocket drug costs capped at about $3,500. In just the
    first quarter of 2024, over 260,000 people benefited from this cap.
-   Millions of American are saving an average of about $800 per year on
    health insurance premiums because of savings from the American
    Rescue Plan that the Inflation Reduction Act extended, helping drive
    the nation’s uninsured rate to historic lows under the Biden-Harris
    Administration.

Check out the Biden-Harris Administration’s [Savings
Explorer](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/savings-explorer/) to see
how some of the Administration’s policies are helping Americans save
money on annual expenses – from health care to junk fees, grocery costs
and more.  
  
**Continuing to Lower Prescription Drug Costs**  
  
People with Medicare will continue to see their prescription drug costs
go down as more provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act go into effect
next year. Nearly 19 million seniors and other Part D beneficiaries
are [projected to save $400 per
year](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/07/07/hhs-announces-actions-protect-consumers-and-lower-health-care-costs.html) on
prescription drugs when the out-of-pocket cap drops to $2,000 in 2025,
and 1.9 million enrollees with the highest drug costs will save an
average of $2,500 per year. And the lower prices negotiated for the
high-spend drugs announced today will go into effect in 2026.  
  
The President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2025 builds on this success by
significantly increasing the pace of negotiation, bringing more drugs
into negotiation sooner after they launch, expanding the $2,000
out-of-pocket prescription drug cost cap beyond Medicare and into the
commercial market, and other steps to build on the Inflation Reduction
Act drug provisions. The Budget also includes proposals to curb
inflation in prescription drug prices and extends the $35 cost-sharing
cap for monthly prescriptions of insulin to the commercial market to
lower drug costs for all Americans.
