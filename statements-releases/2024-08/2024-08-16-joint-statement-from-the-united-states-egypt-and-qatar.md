Over the last 48 hours in Doha, senior officials from our governments
have engaged in intensive talks as mediators aiming to conclude the
agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees. These
talks were serious and constructive and were conducted in a positive
atmosphere. Earlier today in Doha, the United States with support from
Egypt and Qatar, presented to both parties a bridging proposal that is
consistent with the principles laid out by President Biden on May 31,
2024 and Security Council Resolution No. 2735. This proposal builds on
areas of agreement over the past week, and bridges remaining gaps in the
manner that allows for a swift implementation of the deal.   

Working teams will continue technical work over the coming days on the
details of implementation, including arrangements to implement the
agreement’s extensive humanitarian provisions, as well as specifics
relating to hostages and detainees.

Senior officials from our governments will reconvene in Cairo before the
end of next week with the aim to conclude the deal under the terms put
forward today. As the leaders of the three countries stated last week,
“There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for
further delay.  It is time to release the hostages and detainees, begin
the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.”

The path is now set for that outcome, saving lives, bringing relief to
the people of Gaza, and de-escalating regional tensions.
