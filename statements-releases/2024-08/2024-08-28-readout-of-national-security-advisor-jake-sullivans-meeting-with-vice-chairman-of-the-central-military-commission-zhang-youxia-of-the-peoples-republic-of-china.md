National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met on August 29 with General
Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in
Beijing, China. Mr. Sullivan stressed that both countries have a
responsibility to prevent competition from veering into conflict or
confrontation. The two sides reaffirmed the importance of
regular military-to-military communications as part of efforts to
maintain high-level diplomacy and open lines of communication, as
directed by President Biden and President Xi at the November 2023
Woodside Summit. Mr. Sullivan and Vice Chairman Zhang recognized the
progress in sustained, regular military-military communications over the
past ten months and planned to hold a theater commander telephone call
in the near future. Mr. Sullivan also raised the importance of
cross-Strait peace and stability, the U.S. commitment to freedom of
navigation in the South China Sea, concerns about PRC support for
Russia’s defense industrial base, the need to avoid miscalculation and
escalation in cyber space, and ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire and
hostage deal in Gaza.
