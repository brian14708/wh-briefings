title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Record Decrease in Crime in First Half\
  \ of\_2024"

When Vice President Harris and I took office, our nation had just seen
the largest increase in murders ever recorded during the previous
Administration. Immediately, we got to work to make communities safer.
Today, new data confirms that our efforts are working and violent crime
is at a 50-year low. An independent organization of police chiefs from
across our nation’s biggest cities [released
data](https://majorcitieschiefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MCCA-Violent-Crime-Report-2024-and-2023-Midyear.pdf) showing
that violent crime fell across every category in the first half of 2024.
Homicides are down 17% – building on the largest-ever decline in the
homicide rate nationally last year.  
   
This did not happen by accident. Our American Rescue Plan – opposed by
every Republican in Congress – delivered $15 billion to cities and
states to invest in public safety and violence prevention, keeping cops
on the beat while working with community leaders to interrupt and
prevent crime. I also signed the most significant gun violence
legislation in nearly 30 years which is keeping guns out of dangerous
hands by expanding background checks and helping states implement “red
flag” laws.  
   
Americans are safer today than when Vice President Harris and I took
office. We can’t stop now. That’s why I will continue to urge Congress
to fund 100,000 additional police officers and crime prevention and
community violence intervention programs, and make commonsense gun
safety reforms such as a ban on assault weapons.
