National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met on August 29 with President
Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China. The meeting was part of
ongoing efforts to maintain channels of communication and responsibly
manage the relationship between the United States and the PRC.  The two
sides discussed further implementation of the commitments President
Biden and President Xi made at the November 2023 Woodside Summit,
including on counternarcotics, military-to-military communications, and
AI safety and risk. They also discussed cross-Strait issues, Russia’s
war against Ukraine, and the South China Sea. Both sides welcomed
ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication, including
planning for a call between President Biden and President Xi in the
coming weeks.
