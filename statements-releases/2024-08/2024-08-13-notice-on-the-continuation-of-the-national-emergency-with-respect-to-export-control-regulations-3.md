title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Export\
  \ Control\_Regulations"
---
 
On August 17, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13222 pursuant
to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et
seq*.).  In that order, the President declared a national emergency with
respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States related to
the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50
U.S.C. 4601 *et seq*.).  Because the implementation of certain sanctions
authorities, including sections 11A, 11B, and 11C of such Export
Administration Act of 1979, consistent with section 1766(b) of Public
Law 115-232, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4801
note), is to be carried out under the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must
continue in effect beyond August 17, 2024.  Therefore, in accordance
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)),
I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 13222, as amended by Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    August 13, 2024.
