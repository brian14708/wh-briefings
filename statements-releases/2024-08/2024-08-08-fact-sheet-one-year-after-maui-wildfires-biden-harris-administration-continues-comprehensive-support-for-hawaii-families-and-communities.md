title: "FACT SHEET: One Year After Maui Wildfires, Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\
  \ Continues Comprehensive Support for Hawai\u2018i Families and\_Communities"
---
 
One year following the devastating wildfires on Maui, Hawaiʻi, the
Biden-Harris Administration is continuing to pursue a [coordinated and
comprehensive Federal
response](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/07/fact-sheet-six-months-after-maui-wildfires-biden-harris-administration-continues-to-support-survivors-and-impacted-communities/),
working side by side with our State and local partners, to ensure the
long-term recovery of survivors and impacted communities. In addition to
continuing to assist the people of Maui in their greatest time of need –
including nearly [$3
billion](https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/one-year-later-maui-wildfire-recovery-continues-nearly-3-billion-federal-support)
in Federal support to response, recovery, and rebuilding efforts – the
Administration is also working to build the long-term resilience of
Hawaiʻi and making significant investments to prevent another tragedy
like this from happening again. 

**To mark the one-year anniversary, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell and U.S. Fire Administrator Dr.
Lori Moore Merrell traveled to Maui this week to join Chief Federal
Response Coordinator Robert Fenton along with State, local, and
community leaders to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the
wildfires and observe ongoing recovery efforts.**

As President Biden made clear during his visit to Maui last year, the
Biden-Harris Administration will be with the people of Maui every step
of the way, no matter how long it takes, to recover and rebuild from
these unprecedented wildfires. Throughout this long-term recovery and
rebuilding effort, the Administration will continue to incorporate the
voices and knowledge of the Native Hawaiian Community in respecting and
preserving sacred lands, culture, and traditions.

Over the past year, the Administration has provided nearly $385 million
dollars in assistance to individuals and households for response and
recovery efforts, including nearly $300 million to provide safe housing
to displaced survivors with damaged or destroyed homes. Additionally,
the Administration has also provided more than $500 million to support
debris removal, infrastructure rebuilding, and other emergency
protective measures. **The President continues to urge Congress to pass
the** [**Administration’s supplemental funding
request**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/06/28/letter-regarding-critical-supplemental-funding-needs/)
**which will help Maui to rebuild, including by providing critical
funding for long-term housing.**

Working alongside State and County partners, the Biden-Harris
Administration’s priorities for ongoing and long-term coordinated
Federal response and recovery efforts include:

-   Moving residents from temporary shelters into longer term housing
    solutions and supporting home rebuilding efforts.
    -   FEMA continues to work closely with State officials to relocate
        survivors from hotel shelter into longer-term housing. **In the
        immediate aftermath of the fires, more than 4,000 displaced
        households sheltered in hotels. Today, that number is down to
        40**.

    <!-- -->

    -   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is
        also making changes to key loan programs to better support home
        rebuilding efforts and ensure that any newly reconstructed
        housing stock supports the resilience that has come to define
        the local community. Earlier this year, HUD introduced a package
        of enhancements aimed at revitalizing the Federal Housing
        Administration’s 203(k) program, which allows borrowers to
        include the cost of repair and renovation for a property within
        the mortgage being used to purchase or refinance a home. HUD is
        providing Maui residents an additional year to use its 203(h)
        loan program, which allows impacted residents to access 100
        percent financing to rebuild their homes post-disaster. HUD also
        recently announced its third extension of the foreclosure
        moratorium for Maui County, which will remain in effect through
        January 1, 2025. HUD also awarded a total of $8.2 million in
        Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) funding to the State
        of Hawai‘ito address the needs of individuals and families who
        are at risk of homelessness and have needs that are not already
        being met by other Federal disaster relief programs.

    -   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is on track to finish earthwork
        and utilities installation for the first Federal temporary group
        housing site, which will offer 169 units for wildfire survivors,
        by the end of October. FEMA will then equip and install modular
        units so that eligible survivors can begin moving into this
        longer-term housing this Fall.
-   Removing debris so that residents and business owners can begin
    rebuilding their homes and businesses, which will aid in community
    renewal. **The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has removed debris from
    nearly 98 percent of residential properties impacted by the fires.**
    In the wake of the wildfires, President Biden made additional
    disaster funding
    [available](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230816/president-joseph-r-biden-jr-increases-federal-cost-share-hawaii)
    to the State of Hawaiʻi, unlocking the Federal government’s ability
    to cover all eligible expenses for debris removal and emergency
    protective measures on the County of Maui. The President authorized
    the Federal cost share for debris removal to be increased from 75
    percent to 100 percent for 180 days within the first 270 days of the
    incident. The President also authorized the Federal cost share for
    emergency protective measures to be increased to 100 percent of the
    total eligible costs for a 90-day period that the Governor selects
    within the first 180 days of the incident.
-   Ensuring students can return to school and continue learning. At the
    direction of the President to enable Maui students to return to
    school as soon as possible following the fires, **the U.S. Army
    Corps of Engineers, in partnership with FEMA and the State of
    Hawai‘i, designed and constructed a 38-building, 30-classroom campus
    designed for up to 600 elementary school students in a record 95
    days** to replace the former King Kamehameha elementary school that
    suffered irreparable fire damage**.** Impacted students resumed
    schooling on April 1, 2024, in time for the fourth quarter of the
    academic year, which was a major step toward restoring some normalcy
    for impacted children, parents, and teachers.

-   Enhancing the resilience of Hawaiʻi’s landscapes and infrastructure
    to prevent another tragedy. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department
    of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate and U.S.
    Fire Administration – along with Hawaiʻi Governor Josh Green, M.D.,
    Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen, and Hawai‘i Department of Defense
    Adjutant General Kenneth Hara –
    [announced](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/03/08/dhs-deploys-wildfire-sensors-mitigate-and-manage-fires-hawaii-keep-communities-safe)
    the **planned deployment of 64 wildfire sensors for operational
    testing and evaluation,along with 16 mobile sensors ready to deploy
    as needed. As of August 2024, all 80 sensors have been installed**.
    This innovative technology will enable first responders to suppress
    an initial blaze before it spreads and provide communities with
    additional time to make life-saving evacuation decisions. The U.S.
    Department of the Interior also recently
    [announced](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-20-million-presidents-investing-america-agenda-bolster)
    a $20 million investment to bolster climate resilience in Hawaiʻi –
    including several communities on Maui – by restoring native
    ecosystems and plants, which has the co-benefit of enhancing food
    security while incorporating Indigenous Knowledge and practices. In
    late July, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    [announced](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-ira-crrc-awards-Hawaii-2024)
    more than $68 million to fund efforts to build a resilient future
    for Hawai‘iagainst increased heat, drought, flooding, sea level rise
    and wildfires, including through Native Hawaiian stewardship and
    regional knowledge-sharing.

These efforts complement ongoing work to further support long-term
recovery of Maui, including a Maui County-led draft long term recovery
plan, which is expected to publish later this year.

While nothing can bring back the lives and livelihoods lost to these
devastating fires, these actions underscore President Biden’s commitment
to standing alongside the people of Maui as they continue to recover,
rebuild, and heal in the years ahead.
