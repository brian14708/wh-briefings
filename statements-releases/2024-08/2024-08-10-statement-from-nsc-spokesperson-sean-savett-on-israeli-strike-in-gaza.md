title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Sean Savett on Israeli Strike in\_Gaza"
---
 
We are deeply concerned about reports of civilian casualties in Gaza
following a strike by the Israel Defense Forces on a compound that
included a school. We are in touch with our Israeli counterparts, who
have said they targeted senior Hamas officials, and we are asking for
further details. 

We know Hamas has been using schools as locations to gather and operate
out of, but we have also said repeatedly and consistently that Israel
must take measures to minimize civilian harm.

We mourn every Palestinian civilian lost in this conflict, including
children, and far too many civilians continue to be killed and wounded.
This underscores the urgency of a ceasefire and hostage deal, which we
continue to work tirelessly to achieve.
