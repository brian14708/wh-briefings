title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Inflation Reduction Act\_\
  Anniversary"
---
 
Since day one of our Administration, President Joe Biden and I have made
it a priority to strengthen the middle class by lowering costs, creating
jobs, and advancing opportunity. That is why we fought to enact our
Inflation Reduction Act, historic legislation that I was proud to cast
the tie-breaking vote on in the Senate. In the two years since President
Biden signed it into law, this landmark bill has already delivered for
American families.  
   
This transformational legislation is reducing the cost of health care
for millions of people in communities across our nation – from capping
the price of insulin at $35 a month for seniors to capping out-of-pocket
drug costs at $2,000 a year for Americans on Medicare, which is expected
to save nearly 19 million seniors an average of $400 per year.
Additionally, Medicare is now able to negotiate lower prescription
prices for millions of Americans while saving taxpayers billions by
paying rates 40% to 80% lower for expensive medications used to treat
conditions such as blood clots, heart disease, and cancer.  
   
Our Inflation Reduction Act is also the single largest climate
investment in American history. While taking on the climate crisis and
lowering utility bills for families, it is helping us to rebuild
American manufacturing and drive American innovation – creating
good-paying union jobs, furthering economic opportunity, and
contributing to the nearly $900 billion of private-sector investment
since President Biden and I took office.  
   
As we mark this two-year anniversary, President Biden and I recommit to
doing everything in our power to ensure that families throughout our
country have the freedom to thrive.
