National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will travel to the People’s
Republic of China from August 27 through August 29, for meetings with
senior PRC officials to discuss bilateral, regional, and global issues. 
These meetings are consistent with efforts to maintain this strategic
channel of communication to responsibly manage the relationship and are
a product of the November 2023 Woodside Summit between President Biden
and President Xi.   This trip follows high-level diplomatic meetings
between National Security Advisor Sullivan and Director Wang Yi in
Vienna in May 2023, Malta in September 2023, Washington in October 2023,
and Bangkok in January 2024.
