title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Price of Anti-Obesity\_Medications"
---
 
Americans pay two to three times more than people in other countries for
the exact same prescription drugs. It’s completely unacceptable. Vice
President Harris and I have taken action to lower the cost of the
medications Americans rely on by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug
prices for the first time in history ­­– negotiations which will
continue on additional drugs next year. We’ve also capped the cost of
insulin at $35 a month for those with Medicare, and required drug
companies to pay rebates back to Medicare if they raise their prices
faster than inflation. But too many people still struggle to afford
their medications.

That is why last month Senator Sanders and I called on drug
manufacturers to lower their prices on popular drugs to combat obesity,
diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The prices of these drugs can be
up to six times higher in America than in Canada, Denmark, and other
similar countries. Today, I am pleased to see one of these
manufacturers, Eli Lilly, taking steps to lower their price by offering
a direct-to-consumer version of their medication for less than half the
price they used to charge. This is a welcome first step for American
families struggling to access these drugs. But it is critical that drug
companies lower their prices across the board. 

The Vice President and I will keep fighting to make sure all Americans
can access the medications they need.
