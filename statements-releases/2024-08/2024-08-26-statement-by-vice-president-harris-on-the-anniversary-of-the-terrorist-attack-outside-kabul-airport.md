title: "Statement by Vice President Harris on the Anniversary of the Terrorist Attack\
  \ Outside Kabul\_Airport"
---
 
Three years ago today, outside of Kabul Airport, an ISIS terrorist
killed 13 American servicemembers and more than 100 innocent Afghans,
and wounded many more. Thirteen American heroes were taken from us on
that day: Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover. Marine Corps Sgt.
Johanny Rosario Pichardo. Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee. Marine Corps
Cpl. Hunter Lopez. Marine Corps Cpl. Daegan W. Page. Marine Corps Cpl.
Humberto A. Sanchez. Marine Corps Lance Cpl. David L. Espinoza. Marine
Corps Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz. Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee J.
McCollum. Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Dylan R. Merola. Marine Corps Lance
Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui. Navy Petty Officer Third Class Maxton W. Soviak.
Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss.  
   
Today and everyday, I mourn and honor them. My prayers are with their
families and loved ones.  My heart breaks for their pain and their
loss.  These 13 devoted patriots represent the best of America, putting
our beloved nation and their fellow Americans above themselves and
deploying into danger to keep their fellow citizens safe.   
   
Today, I am also thinking about all our servicemembers who served in
America’s longest war—including 2,461 who made the ultimate sacrifice
and 20,744 who were wounded. Over the course of nearly two decades, they
served selflessly and bravely to protect the American people and our
homeland. I will never forget meeting many of them on a trip to
Afghanistan as a U.S. Senator. These American servicemembers possessed
extraordinary skill, discipline, and dedication. I had then, and will
always have, immense pride in their service and in the strength,
courage, and excellence of the U.S. military, the greatest fighting
force the world has ever known.  
   
I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their
families and I will always honor their service and sacrifice.  
   
As I have said, President Biden made the courageous and right decision
to end America’s longest war. Over the past three years, our
Administration has demonstrated we can still eliminate terrorists,
including the leaders of al-Qaeda and ISIS, without troops deployed into
combat zones. I will never hesitate to take whatever action necessary to
counter terrorist threats and protect the American people and the
homeland.  
   
On this solemn day, let us come together as one nation to honor those
who made the ultimate sacrifice three years ago on behalf of the United
States and our cherished freedoms. Our grateful nation mourns and
salutes them.  
   
In their memory, let us re-dedicate ourselves to the cause they gave
their lives for: to protect and defend the greatest democracy on Earth,
the United States of America.
