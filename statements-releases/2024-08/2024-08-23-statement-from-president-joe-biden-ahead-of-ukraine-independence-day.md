title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Ahead of Ukraine Independence\_Day"
---
 
Tomorrow—as the people of Ukraine mark their Independence Day—let it be
clear: When Russia’s senseless war began, Ukraine was a free country.
Today, it is still a free country. And the war will end with Ukraine
remaining a free, sovereign, and independent country.

I spoke with President Zelenskyy today to reaffirm this message, and to
express America’s unwavering support for the people of Ukraine. For two
and a half years, they have repelled Russia’s vicious onslaught,
including retaking more than half of the territory Russian forces seized
in the initial days of the war. They have remained unbowed in the face
of Russia’s heinous war crimes and atrocities. And day after day, they
have defended the values that unite people across both of our nations
and around the world—including independence.

That is why I am proud we will announce a new package of military aid
for Ukraine today. The package includes air defense missiles to protect
Ukraine’s critical infrastructure; counter-drone equipment and
anti-armor missiles to defend against Russia’s evolving tactics on the
battlefield; and ammunition for frontline soldiers and the mobile rocket
systems that protect them. We are also imposing new sanctions today on
nearly 400 entities and individuals who are enabling Russia’s illegal
war as part of our enduring commitment to hold Russia accountable for
its aggression.

These actions build on a series of historic steps we have taken with our
Allies and partners over the last few months to support Ukraine—from
transferring F-16 fighter jets, to committing to deliver hundreds of air
defense interceptors over the next year, to quickly surging security
assistance to the frontlines following the passing of our National
Security Bill. Last month, I also brought together 20 nations who have
signed Bilateral Security Agreements with Ukraine to form the Ukraine
Compact, which will strengthen Ukraine’s ability to defend itself now
and in the future. And, together with the G7, we are
taking unprecedented action to make Russia pay for damage it’s caused by
issuing $50 billion in loans backed by the profits of frozen Russian
sovereign assets. 

Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict. The
independent people of Ukraine will prevail—and the United States, our
Allies, and our partners, will continue to stand with them every step of
the way.
