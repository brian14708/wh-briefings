title: "Statement from President\_Biden Thanking U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine\u2019\
  s Economic Recovery Penny\_Pritzker"
---
 
Over the past two and a half years, the United States has rallied the
world to stand with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom
against Russia’s vicious onslaught. Central to that effort has been
Penny Pritzker—our country’s first Special Representative for Ukraine’s
Economic Recovery.

Working with partners at home and abroad, including international
financial institutions, Special Representative Pritzker has mobilized
significant public and private investment to help Ukraine maintain its
economy as it repels Russian forces. She’s created a first-of-its-kind
model for war risk insurance that has given many companies the
confidence to continue doing business in Ukraine. She has worked to
reopen critical export markets for Ukrainian businesses. She has
strengthened Ukraine’s defense industrial base by helping facilitate
co-production ventures with U.S. companies that benefit both our
nations. And, she has helped the Ukrainian government make needed
economic reforms—so as it begins to rebuild, it rebuilds stronger.

Like so many others, I am grateful to Special Representative Pritzker
for returning to public service to share her wisdom and expertise. Her
legacy of leadership and innovation is one we will carry forward as we
continue to help Ukraine forge a more secure future—diplomatically,
militarily, and economically.
