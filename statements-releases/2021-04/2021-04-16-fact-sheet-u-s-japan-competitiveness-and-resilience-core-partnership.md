    research, development, testing, and deployment of secure networks
    and advanced ICT including 5G and next-generation mobile networks
    (“6G” or “Beyond 5G”). The United States has committed $2.5 billion
    to this effort, and Japan has committed $2 billion. 
-   Build on successful U.S.-Japan cooperation in third-countries and
    launch a Global Digital Connectivity Partnership to promote secure
    connectivity and a vibrant digital economy while building the
    cybersecurity capacity of our partners to address shared threats. 
-   Strengthen collaboration and information exchange between U.S. and
    Japanese ICT experts in global standards development.
-   Cooperate on sensitive supply chains, including semi-conductors, and
    on the promotion and protection of critical technologies.
-   Advance biotechnology for the global good by focusing on genome
    sequencing and the principles of openness, transparency,
    collaboration, and research integrity.
-   Reinforce collaboration and partnerships between research
    institutions on quantum information science and technology through
    joint research and exchange of researchers.

**COVID-19 Response, Global Health, and Health Security**

The United States and Japan have built a partnership to help the
Indo-Pacific region recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, including
through the landmark Quad Vaccine Partnership \[LINK\] with Australia
and India, taking shared action necessary to expand safe and effective
COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing, and working to strengthen and assist
countries in the Indo-Pacific with vaccination. We will also expand our
partnership beyond COVID-19, building longer-term global health security
to help prevent the next pandemic.

Together, the United States and Japan will:

-   Enhance our support to the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator,
    including the COVAX facility, and encourage others to do the same
    thereby collectively filling the financial needs to ensure equitable
    access to safe, effective, and affordable vaccines, therapeutics and
    diagnostics particularly in developing countries.
-   Coordinate closely, through the Quad Vaccine Partnership, to
    facilitate production, procurement, and delivery of safe, effective,
    and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific, including by expanding
    manufacturing capacity of COVID-19 vaccines in India.
-   In a new partnership, coordinate health security financing, regional
    surge capacity, and triggers for rapid response.
-   Establish regional pandemic response surge capacity, working with
    partners to promote manufacturing of personal protective equipment
    and medical countermeasures.
-   Work together and with others toward World Health Organization
    reform, including through the creation of swift triggers to respond
    to future biological threats, an independent oversight mechanism,
    and accountability for pandemic response.
-   Support a transparent and independent evaluation and analysis, free
    from interference and undue influence, of the origins of the
    COVID-19 outbreak, and for investigating outbreaks of unknown origin
    in the future.
-   Support the Global Health Security Agenda, as steering group
    members, to improve global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond
    to infectious disease threats.
-   Exchange data and practical knowledge, including simulation data on
    virus transmission from supercomputers such as Japan’s Fugaku and
    the United States’ Summit to develop innovative and more effective
    methods and techniques for infection prevention measures.
-   Reinforce collaboration between research institutions such as the
    National Institutes of Health and Japan Agency for Medical Research
    and Development and cooperation for resilient medical supply chains
    to improve preparedness for future crises.

**Climate Change, Clean Energy, and Green Growth and Recovery**

The United States and Japan have launched a new partnership to address
climate change and to promote green, sustainable global growth and
recovery making full use of our technologies in the clean energy and
other relevant sectors.

The two leaders are committed to taking decisive climate action by 2030,
aligned both with efforts to limit the global temperature increase to
1.5 degrees Celsius and with our 2050 greenhouse gas emissions net-zero
goals. The United States and Japan will align official international
financing with the global achievement of net-zero greenhouse gas
emissions no later than 2050 and deep emission reductions in the 2020s,
and will work to promote the flow of public and private capital toward
climate-aligned investments and away from high-carbon investments.

Together, the United States and Japan will:

-   Cooperate on Paris Agreement implementation, with a focus on
    achieving our respective 2030 targets/nationally determined
    contributions and 2050 greenhouse gas emissions net-zero goals.
-   Collaborate and support innovation, development, and deployment of
    such clean-energy technologies as renewable energy and energy
    efficiency technologies, grid modernization, energy storage
    (including batteries and long-duration storage technologies), smart
    grid, hydrogen, Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage/Carbon
    Recycling, industrial decarbonization and advanced nuclear power.
-   Promote development and use of adaptive climate- and
    environment-friendly infrastructure related to grid optimization,
    demand response, smart grids, and renewable energy and energy
    efficiency.
-   Cooperate on other areas that contribute to climate change
    mitigation, clean energy and green growth and recovery, including
    ICT technology (such as smart cities, power saving ICT
    infrastructure, and digital solutions to infrastructure management),
    carbon neutral ports as well as sustainable and climate-smart
    agriculture.
-   Support developing countries, including those in the Indo-Pacific
    region, to rapidly deploy renewable energy, drive the
    decarbonization of our their economies, and accelerate diverse,
    ambitious, and realistic transition paths in the region, toward the
    realization of net-zero emissions globally no later than 2050,
    including through the newly established Japan-U.S. Clean Energy
    Partnership (“JUCEP”) and other country-level climate and clean
    energy collaborative activities. 

**Expanding and Renewing Our Partnership**

The United States and Japan will continue to add new dimensions to our
partnership while cooperating in the fields of long-standing areas.

The United States and Japan will strengthen our people-to-people ties.
The next generation of leaders who will continue to strengthen the bonds
between the United States and Japan are participating in our extensive
international exchange programs, working together on joint projects and
research. In this spirit, we are proud to announce the resumption of the
Mansfield Fellowship program. Together, we will redouble our energies to
build the next generation of American experts on Japan through a renewed
two-year fellowship program. We are also expanding opportunities for
American students that are historically underrepresented in education
abroad – including, but not limited to, first-generation college
students, students in STEM fields, ethnic minority students, students
with disabilities, students attending minority-serving institutions, and
community college students – by offering an additional 20 Gilman
Scholarships for study abroad in Japan. Finally, like the United States,
Japan recognizes the importance of addressing the root causes of
migration from the Northern Triangle countries of Central America, and
is committed to addressing those issues together.
