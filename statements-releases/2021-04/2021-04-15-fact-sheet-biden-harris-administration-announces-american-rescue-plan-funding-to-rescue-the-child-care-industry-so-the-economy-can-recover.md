title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces American Rescue Plan\
  \ Funding to Rescue the Child Care Industry so the Economy Can\_Recover"
---
 
Today, the Biden Administration is announcing the release of $39 billion
of American Rescue Plan funds to states, territories, and tribes to
address the child care crisis caused by COVID-19. These funds will help
early childhood educators and family child care providers keep their
doors open. These providers have been on the frontlines caring for the
children of essential workers and support parents, especially mothers,
who want to get back to work. These funds are a critical step to pave
the way for a strong economic recovery and a more equitable future.

Over the past 40 years, as more women entered the labor force and
brought home larger paychecks, they have driven [91
percent](https://www.brookings.edu/essay/womens-work-boosts-middle-class-incomes-but-creates-a-family-time-squeeze-that-needs-to-be-eased/)
of the income gains experienced by middle-class families. But, since the
start of the COVID-19 public health emergency, roughly [2 million
women](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11000002) have left the
labor force, disproportionately due to caregiving needs and undoing
decades of progress improving women’s labor force participation rate.
Even as many fathers have returned to work, [mothers, especially those
without a four-year college degree, have
not](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2021/pandemic-pushes-mothers-of-young-children-out-of-the-labor-force#_ftn1)
done so at similar rates. As a result, the gender earnings gap is
predicted to increase by [5 percentage
points](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27660/w27660.pdf)
in this recession, hurting our families and economy. As women work to
regain employment, families with young children, and especially families
of color where mothers are more likely to be sole or primary
[breadwinners](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2021/03/29/497658/breadwinning-mothers-critical-familys-economic-security/),
may face financial burdens for years to come. Parents need access to
safe, quality child care to get back to work.

At the same time, early childhood and child care providers – nearly all
[small
businesses](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=624410&tid=CBP2018.CB1800CBP&hidePreview=true),
overwhelmingly owned by women and disproportionately owned by people of
color – have been hit hard by the pandemic and are struggling to
continue to provide essential services. Providers have faced decreasing
revenues due to lower enrollment while also shouldering higher expenses
– [47 percent
higher](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2020/09/03/489900/true-cost-providing-safe-child-care-coronavirus-pandemic/)
by one estimate – for personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitation,
additional staff, and other needs to operate safely. They were already
operating on extremely thin margins before the pandemic. According to
one survey, as of December, about [one in
four](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/many-child-care-centers-nationwide-still-remain-closed.html)
child care providers open at the start of the pandemic were closed,
hindering access to care, especially for [families of
color](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/news/2020/06/29/486977/child-care-disruptions-hurt-parents-color/).
These closures exacerbated access challenges that existed before the
pandemic when half of all Americans lived in a [child care
desert](https://www.childcaredeserts.org/). Child care providers who
have stayed open have gone to enormous lengths to do so: [two in
five](https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/globally-shared/downloads/PDFs/our-work/public-policy-advocacy/naeyc_policy_crisis_coronavirus_december_survey_data.pdf)
providers report taking on debt for their programs using personal credit
cards to pay for increased costs and [three in
five](https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/globally-shared/downloads/PDFs/our-work/public-policy-advocacy/naeyc_policy_crisis_coronavirus_december_survey_data.pdf)
work in programs that have reduced expenses through layoffs, furloughs,
or pay cuts. [One in
six](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES6562440001) child care jobs,
generally held by women of color, still haven’t come back – much more
than the one in twenty jobs that have been lost throughout the economy. 

**That is why President Biden prioritized addressing the child care
crisis caused by COVID-19 as part of the American Rescue Plan. Today’s
$39 billion funding release will provide a lifeline to hundreds of
thousands of childcare providers and early childhood educators, provide
a safe and healthy learning environment for more than 5 million
children, and help parents, especially mothers, get back to work.**
States, tribes, and territories can use these funds to:

-   **Help hundreds of thousands child care centers and family child
    care providers, which are mostly very small businesses, stay open or
    reopen** including by making rent or mortgage payments, helping with
    utility or insurance bills, maintaining or improving facilities, and
    paying off debt incurred during the pandemic.
-   **Support providers with funds to enable safe and healthy learning
    environments for more than 5 million of children**, including by
    purchasing masks, implementing physical distancing, improving
    ventilation, and cleaning consistently, so both centers and family
    providers can comply with CDC’s Guidance for Operating Child Care
    Programs during COVID-19. This funding complements the President’s
    efforts to prioritize early childhood educators for vaccination –
    child care workers [remain
    eligible](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/specific-groups/teachers-childcare.html)
    for vaccinations and nearly [80
    percent](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0406-teachers-staff-vaccine.html)
    of the educators who work with children from birth to
    12<sup>th</sup> grade received at least their first shot of a
    COVID-19 vaccine during the month of March. Providers can also use
    these funds to support the mental health of both children and early
    educators so that they can meet any social and emotional needs
    exacerbated by the pandemic as centers reopen and parents go back to
    work.
-   **Keep child care workers, disproportionately women of color and
    immigrants, on the payroll and rehire those who have been laid
    off.** Child care workers are essential to meeting the child care
    needs of families and providing quality are to children, but
    providers have been forced to lay off, furlough, or reduce pay of
    workers to survive – exacerbating issues faced by a workforce that
    has long faced low pay and high turnover. Providers can use these
    funds to keep workers on payroll, rehire laid off workers and
    recruit new workers, and increase the pay and benefits of child care
    workers and family child care providers.
-   **Provide families with the greatest need access to affordable
    care.** States, tribes, and territories can provide direct subsidies
    to more than 800,000 hard-pressed families earning below 85% state
    median income and families performing essential work, to help cover
    the cost of care.
-   **Start to lay the foundation for a stronger child care system, so
    families can access the high-quality care they need.** As states,
    tribes, and territories address the immediate crisis, they can also
    make a down payment on President Biden’s commitment to a stronger,
    more equitable early childhood education system. For example,
    states, tribes, and territories can set reimbursement rates at a
    level that will help children receive high-quality care and can
    increase access to care, including on the evenings and weekends when
    many essential workers need care. 

**The American Rescue Plan also included an historic increase in support
for child care through the tax code, helping millions of working
families afford needed care.** Last year, a family claiming a Child and
Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) got less than $700 on average towards
the cost of care, and many low-income working families often got
nothing. Thanks to the historic expansion of the CDCTC in the American
Recovery Plan, a median income family with two kids under age 13 will
receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they file
taxes for 2021, compared with a maximum of $1,200 previously.

-   In 2020, the CDCTC provides a tax credit typically capped at $600
    for one child, for families with at least $3,000 in eligible
    expenses, and capped at $1,200 for two children or more for families
    with at least $6,000 in child care expenses.
-   Under the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the CDCTC, *all*
    families with incomes below $125,000 will save up to half the cost
    of their eligible child care expenses, getting back up to $4,000 for
    one child and $8,000 for two or more children, when they file taxes
    for 2021. And, families making between $125,000 and $438,000 can
    receive a partial credit.
-   And for the first time, the CDCTC will be fully refundable, making
    the credit fairer by allowing low-income working families to receive
    the full value of the credit towards their eligible child care
    expenses regardless of how much they owe on their 2021 taxes.

**In the coming weeks, the administration will release:**

-   Guidance to states, tribes, and territories, while also providing
    technical assistance like webinars and peer-to-peer learning
    opportunities, to support states, tribes, and territories as they
    make historic investments in saving and rebuilding their child care
    systems, provide high-quality care to children, and get families
    back to work.
-   Frequently Asked Questions on the Child and Dependent Care Tax
    Credit to equip parents with the information they need to claim the
    credit next year.

**Help from the American Rescue Plan is coming to states, territories,
and tribes.** The $39 billion will be provided through two funds: (1)
$24 billion in child care stabilization funding for child care providers
to reopen or stay open, provide safe and healthy learning
environments**,** keep workers on payroll, and provide mental health
supports for educators and children, and (2) $15 billion in more
flexible funding for states to make child care more affordable for more
families, increase access to high-quality care for families receiving
subsidies, increase compensation for early childhood workers, and meet
other care needs in their states. A breakdown by state, tribe and
territory is below.
