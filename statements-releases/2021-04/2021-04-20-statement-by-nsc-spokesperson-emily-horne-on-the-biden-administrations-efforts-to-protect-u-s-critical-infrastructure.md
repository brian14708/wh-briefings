title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on the Biden Administration\u2019\
  s Efforts to Protect U.S. Critical\_Infrastructure"
---
 
The Biden Administration is taking steps to safeguard U.S. critical
infrastructure from persistent and sophisticated cyber threats. As a
pilot of the Administration’s broader cybersecurity initiative planned
for multiple critical infrastructure sectors, today the Department of
Energy (DOE) is announcing a 100-day plan to improve the cybersecurity
of our nation’s electric infrastructure. This is a coordinated effort
between DOE, the electricity industry, and the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Public-private partnership is
paramount to the Administration’s efforts because protecting our
Nation’s critical infrastructure is a shared responsibility of
government and the owners and operators of that infrastructure. The
100-day plan includes aggressive but achievable milestones and will
assist owners and operators as they modernize cybersecurity defenses,
including enhancing detection, mitigation, and forensic capabilities.  
  
Innovative partnerships like these are essential to addressing the
urgent cybersecurity challenge because much of our critical
infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. We deeply
appreciate the partnership of private sector leaders in the utility
sector. These efforts underscore the President’s commitment to *Building
Back Better *and tackling cyber threats from adversaries who seek to
compromise critical systems that are essential to U.S. national and
economic security.
