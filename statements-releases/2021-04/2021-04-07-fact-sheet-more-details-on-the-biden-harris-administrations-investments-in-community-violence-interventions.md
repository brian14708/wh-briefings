title: "FACT SHEET: More Details on the Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration\u2019\
  s Investments in Community Violence Interventions"
---
 
Cities across the country are experiencing a historic spike in
homicides, violence that is greatest in racially segregated,
high-poverty neighborhoods. Black men make up 6% of the population but
over 50% of gun homicide victims. Black women, Latinos, and Native
Americans are also disproportionately impacted. The loss of life has
devasting consequences for family members and cascading harms for
communities. As just one example, research shows that exposure to
firearm violence—including as a victim or witness—makes it twice as
likely an adolescent will commit a violent act within two years. 

But there is reason to be optimistic. We know that a relatively small
number of people are involved in urban gun violence, whether as
perpetrators or victims. There
are [proven](https://efsgv.org/learn/type-of-gun-violence/community-gun-violence/)
community violence intervention (CVI) strategies for reducing gun
violence through tools other than incarceration. For example, violence
interruption programs deploy trusted messengers work directly with
individuals most likely to commit gun violence, intervene in conflicts,
and connect people to social and economic services to reduce the
likelihood of gun violence as an answer.  Hospital-based violence
interventions engage people who have been shot while they are still in
the hospital, connecting them to services to decrease the likelihood
that they commit gun violence or are victimized in the future. Programs
like these have reduced homicides by as much
as [60%](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Healing-Communities-in-Crisis.pdf)
in areas where they are implemented.

To date, CVI programs have been badly underfunded, even though the
economic consequences of gun violence are staggering. One study
calculates that gun violence costs America [$280
billion](https://everytownresearch.org/report/the-economic-cost-of-gun-violence/)
annually. For fraction of that cost, we can save lives, create safe and
healthy communities, and build an economy that works for all of us.

Today, as part of a package of initial actions to reduce gun violence,
the Biden-Harris Administration announces historic investments in
community violence intervention to combat the gun violence epidemic. 

**<u>American Jobs Plan</u>:** President Biden’s American Jobs Plan,
unveiled last week, calls on Congress to invest $5 billion over eight
years to support evidence-based community violence intervention programs
that train at-risk individuals for jobs and provide other wraparound
services to prevent violence and assist victims. These strategies will
help rebuild economies in the hardest hit areas.

**<u>Medicaid Funding</u>:** The U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services is organizing a webinar and toolkit to educate states on how
they can use Medicaid to reimburse certain community violence
intervention programs, like Hospital-Based Violence Interventions

**<u>Leveraging Existing Grant Programs</u>:** Five agencies are making
changes to existing federal funding streams across 26 programs to direct
vital support to CVI programs as quickly as possible. For example:

-   The Department of Justice will give priority to applicants proposing
    CVI strategies in its Comprehensive Youth Violence Prevention and
    Reductions Programs, a $11 million competitive grant that provides
    funding for programs that prevent and reduce youth violence. The
    solicitation will post by the end of April 2021 and awards will be
    made by September 30, 2021.
-   The Department of Justice will develop guidance to clarify that
    states can use their allocations from annual Victims of Crime Act
    (VOCA) funding—including over $1 billion in FY21—for CVI efforts and
    will provide training and technical assistance on CVI to grantees.
-   The National Institutes of Health will prioritize community-based
    intervention research for its Firearm Injury and Mortality
    Prevention Research grant awards. These programs will provide $12.5
    million to improve understanding of the determinants of firearm
    injury, those most at risk (including both victims and
    perpetrators), and strategies to prevent firearm injury and
    mortality. Applications are due April 30, 2021, with awards expected
    in September 2021.
