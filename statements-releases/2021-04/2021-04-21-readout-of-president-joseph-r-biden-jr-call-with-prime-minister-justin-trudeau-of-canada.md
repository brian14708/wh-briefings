President Biden spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
regarding preparations for the April 22-23 Leaders Summit on Climate,
efforts to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, and the two Canadians – Michael
Kovrig and Michael Spavor – unjustly detained by the government of
China. The President applauded Canada’s vital contributions to
addressing climate change and both leaders reaffirmed their shared
commitment to demonstrate global leadership on the climate crisis
through the U.S.-Canada High-Level Dialogue on Climate Ambition launched
on February 23. They agreed to continue efforts to control the pandemic,
collaborate on public health responses and global health security, as
well as to support global affordable access and delivery of safe and
effective COVID-19 vaccines, including through the COVAX facility. The
President also condemned the arbitrary detention of Michael Kovrig and
Michael Spavor and reiterated the commitment of the United States to
stand strong with Canada to secure their release.
