title: "Statement by President Joe Biden on Today\u2019s Attack Outside the Capitol"
---
 
Jill and I were heartbroken to learn of the violent attack at a security
checkpoint on the U.S. Capitol grounds, which killed Officer William
Evans of the U.S. Capitol Police, and left a fellow officer fighting for
his life.  We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans’ family,
and everyone grieving his loss.  We know what a difficult time this has
been for the Capitol, everyone who works there, and those who protect
it.

I have been receiving ongoing briefings from my Homeland Security
Advisor, and will be getting further updates as the investigation
proceeds. 

I want to express the nation’s gratitude to the Capitol Police, the
National Guard Immediate Response Force, and others who quickly
responded to this attack.  As we mourn the loss of yet another
courageous Capitol Police officer, I have ordered that the White House
flags be lowered to half-staff.
