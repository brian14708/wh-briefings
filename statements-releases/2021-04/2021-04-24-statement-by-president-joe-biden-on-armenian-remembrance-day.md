title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Armenian Remembrance\_Day"
---
 
Each year on this day, we remember the lives of all those who died in
the Ottoman-era Armenian genocide and recommit ourselves to preventing
such an atrocity from ever again occurring. Beginning on April 24, 1915,
with the arrest of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in
Constantinople by Ottoman authorities, one and a half million Armenians
were deported, massacred, or marched to their deaths in a campaign of
extermination. We honor the victims of the Meds Yeghern so that the
horrors of what happened are never lost to history. And we remember so
that we remain ever-vigilant against the corrosive influence of hate in
all its forms.  
   
Of those who survived, most were forced to find new homes and new lives
around the world, including in the United States. With strength and
resilience, the Armenian people survived and rebuilt their
community. Over the decades Armenian immigrants have enriched the United
States in countless ways, but they have never forgotten the tragic
history that brought so many of their ancestors to our shores. We honor
their story. We see that pain. We affirm the history. We do this not to
cast blame but to ensure that what happened is never repeated.  
   
Today, as we mourn what was lost, let us also turn our eyes to the
future—toward the world that we wish to build for our children. A world
unstained by the daily evils of bigotry and intolerance, where human
rights are respected, and where all people are able to pursue their
lives in dignity and security. Let us renew our shared resolve to
prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world. And let
us pursue healing and reconciliation for all the people of the world.   
   
The American people honor all those Armenians who perished in the
genocide that began 106 years ago today.
