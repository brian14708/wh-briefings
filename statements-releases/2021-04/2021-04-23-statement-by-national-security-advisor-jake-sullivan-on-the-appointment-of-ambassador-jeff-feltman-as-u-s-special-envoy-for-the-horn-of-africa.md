---
 
Today, the State Department announced the appointment of Ambassador Jeff
Feltman as the U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa.  Ambassador
Feltman’s work will build on our ongoing efforts to address the urgent
crises in Ethiopia, where we continue to urge the immediate withdrawal
of Eritrean forces, the cessation of hostilities by all parties, and
unimpeded humanitarian access.  We also urge leaders of Egypt, Ethiopia,
and Sudan to come together and resolve their disputes around the Grand
Ethiopia Renaissance Dam and their shared water resources.  The United
States is ready to work with our allies and partners to promote shared
peace and prosperity across the Horn of Africa.
