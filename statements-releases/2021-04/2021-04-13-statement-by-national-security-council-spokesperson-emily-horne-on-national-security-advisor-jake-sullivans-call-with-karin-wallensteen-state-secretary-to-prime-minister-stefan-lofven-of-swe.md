National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with Karin
Wallensteen, State Secretary to Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of Sweden.
Mr. Sullivan expressed the Biden Administration’s appreciation for the
strong relationship between the United States and the Kingdom of Sweden,
and he underscored the desire to further strengthen transatlantic ties.
He thanked Ms. Wallensteen for Sweden’s leadership as
Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE. The two discussed their shared
concerns over Russia’s sudden military build-up and provocations in
occupied Crimea and on Ukraine’s borders. They discussed the critical
role the OSCE is playing in conflict resolution efforts in Donbas,
offering support for increased monitoring and reporting in response to
Russia’s destabilizing moves. They agreed to work together on addressing
the climate crisis, promoting democracy, and coordinating on shared
foreign policy priorities, including achieving a ceasefire in Yemen and
easing the human suffering there. Mr. Sullivan lauded Sweden’s actions
to protect its critical communications infrastructure and its strong
stance on China human rights abuses.
