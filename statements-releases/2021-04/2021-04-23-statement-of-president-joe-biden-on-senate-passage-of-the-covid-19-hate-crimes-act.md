title: "Statement of President Joe Biden on Senate Passage of the COVID- \u2060 19\
  \ Hate Crimes Act"
---
 
I applaud the United States Senate and the leadership of the
Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) for passing the
COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act by an overwhelming margin.  This critical
legislation will bring our nation one step closer to achieving justice
and equality for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
communities. And, I was happy to see the Senate add the bipartisan
Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act as an amendment, which will further our
national efforts to stand strongly against acts of hate and violence.  
  
For more than a year, far too many Asian Americans have woken up each
morning increasingly fearful for their safety and the safety of their
loved ones.  They have been scapegoated, harassed, and assaulted; some
have even been killed.  It has been over a year of living in fear for
their lives, as acts of anti-Asian bias and violence have accelerated
from coast to coast — an unconscionable burden our fellow Americans have
been forced to bear, even as so many Asian Americans serve their
communities and our nation tirelessly on the front lines of the
pandemic.  
  
Too often throughout our history, acts of hate and violence directed at
Asian Americans have been met with silence.  Our nation must stand
together to speak out against hate, and declare unequivocally: These
acts are wrong.  They are un-American.  And they must stop.  I am
grateful to Senator Hirono, Senator Duckworth, Congresswoman Meng, and
CAPAC’s Chair, Congresswoman Chu, for their persistent and courageous
leadership on this issue — and I look forward to swift consideration and
passage in the House of Representatives, and signing this important
legislation into law.
