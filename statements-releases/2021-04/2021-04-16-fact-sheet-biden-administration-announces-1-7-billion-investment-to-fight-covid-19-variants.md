title: "Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Announces $1.7 Billion Investment to Fight\
  \ COVID-\u206019\_Variants"
---
 
*Funding from American Rescue Plan will help CDC and Governors monitor,
track, and defeat emerging variants that are currently threatening
pockets of the country*

The original strain of COVID-19 comprises only about half of all cases
in America today. New and potentially dangerous strains of the virus
make up the other half. In order to improve the detection, monitoring,
and mitigation of these COVID-19 variants, the Biden Administration is
rapidly investing $1.7 billion from the American Rescue Plan to help
states and other jurisdictions more effectively fight these mutations.

An essential component of the response to the emerging COVID-19 variants
is increasing the country’s genomic sequencing — the process by which
COVID DNA is decoded and potentially deadly mutations in the virus are
detected. Today’s funding, allocated through the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), will help the CDC, states, and other
jurisdictions more effectively detect and track variants by scaling
genomic sequencing efforts. With the information from sequencing, the
CDC and state and local public health leaders can implement known
prevention measures to stop the spread.

In early February, U.S. laboratories were only sequencing about 8,000
COVID-19 strains per week. Since then, the rate of sequencing has
increased substantially, strengthening the country’s ability to detect
and respond to emerging and more contagious COVID-19 strains, like the
variants currently sweeping through the Midwest and parts of the East
Coast. The Biden Administration has already made a nearly $200 million
investment to help increase genomic sequencing to 29,000 samples per
week.  Thanks to today’s funding from the American Rescue Plan, states
and the CDC will expand that even further and, importantly, provide
states with more resources to expand their own efforts to increase
geographic coverage of sequencing to better detect emerging threats like
variants. This will mean that both existing and any new COVID variants
could be detected faster, before they grow prevalent.

Today’s announcement includes:

-   **$1 billion to expand genomic sequencing**:  This funding will help
    CDC, states, and other jurisdictions improve their capacity to
    identify COVID mutations and monitor circulation of variants.
    Specifically, it will allow CDC and jurisdictional health
    departments to conduct, expand, and improve activities to sequence
    genomes and identify mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Much of this work is
    done through CDC partnerships with the laboratory community and
    through state laboratories, and the funding will support the
    collection of COVID specimens, the sequencing of COVID viruses, and
    the sharing of the resultant data. A state-by-state breakdown of the
    initial $240 million in jurisdictional funding support is below.

<!-- -->

-   **$400 million to support innovation initiatives including the
    launch of new innovative Centers of Excellence in Genomic
    Epidemiology**:  The funding will establish six Centers of
    Excellence in Genomic Epidemiology. These centers of excellence will
    operate as partnerships between state health departments and
    academic institutions, and today’s funding will fuel cutting-edge
    research into genomic epidemiology. For example, the partnerships
    could focus on developing new genomic surveillance tools to better
    track pathogens of public health interest with the objective of
    developing surveillance methods to be used more widely in the public
    health system.  Areas of focus will likely include bioinformatic
    workflows and the critical integration of genomic and epidemiologic
    data.

<!-- -->

-   **$300 million to build and support a National Bioinformatics
    Infrastructure**: One of the challenges of building out the nation’s
    sequencing capacity is having the data system necessary to quickly
    and effectively access information and turn it into concrete actions
    to prevent the spread of viruses. Experts use bioinformatics and
    complex computing to connect the dots between how pathogens spread
    and mutate to help solve outbreaks. This investment will support
    bioinformatics throughout the U.S. public health system, creating a
    unified system for sharing and analyzing sequence data in a way that
    protects privacy but allows more informed decisionmaking. This
    funding also will support training to increase sequencing in
    clinical settings and expand CDC’s Bioinformatics Fellowship
    program.

**<u>STATE FUNDING BREAKDOWN</u>**

The first tranche of funding, outlined below, will be distributed in
early May. A second tranche of funding will be invested over the next
several years.
