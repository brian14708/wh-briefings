title: "FACT SHEET: The American Families Plan Will Support Children, Teachers, and\
  \ Working Families in Rural\_America"
---
 
President Biden knows a strong middle-class is the backbone of America
and that rural and tribal communities are essential to the economic
growth of our country. Rural communities require targeted investments
that meet the needs of their children and families, along with workforce
development for those providing childcare and education. The American
Families Plan represents a generation-defining investment in rural
America, and a commitment to grow the middle-class and expand the
benefits of economic growth to all Americans. All told, by extending and
building upon the provisions of the American Rescue Plan, the American
Families Plan would cut the [rural poverty
rate](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2021/presidential-policy/american-family-plan-poverty-impact) by
more than 21 percent and the rural child poverty rate by 50 percent,
relative to the projected poverty rate for 2022.  
  
**<u>UNIVERSAL PRE-SCHOOL FOR 3- AND 4-YEAR OLDS</u>**  
  
Low population density, physical isolation, and broad spatial
distribution make access to preschool more challenging for low-income
families in rural areas. President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Provide free universal pre-school to all 3- and 4-year-olds,
    benefitting 5 million children. **This historic investment in
    America’s future will first prioritize high-need areas and enable
    communities and families to choose the settings that work best for
    them, whether that’s a preschool classroom in a public school, a
    center, or a Head Start program. The President’s plan will invest in
    tuition-free community college and teacher scholarships to support
    those who wish to earn a bachelor’s degree or other credential that
    supports their work as an educator or their work to become an early
    childhood educator. And educators will receive job-embedded
    coaching, professional development, and wages that reflect the
    importance of their work. All employees in participating Pre-K
    programs and Head Start will earn at least $15 per hour, and those
    with comparable qualifications will receive compensation and
    benefits similar to elementary school teachers.

**<u>FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND OTHER POSTSECONDARY INVESTMENTS</u>**  
  
There are approximately [250 rural community
colleges](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) across the U.S., with an even
greater number of community colleges that serve a primarily rural
student population. Colleges and universities are important anchor
institutions in rural communities, providing jobs to residents,
attracting businesses, and boosting local economies.  
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Provide two years of free community college **so that first-time
    students and workers wanting to reskill can enroll in a community
    college without paying tuition and fees.
-   **Increase the maximum Pell Grant award by approximately $1,400 to
    provide additional assistance to low-income students **and also
    allow DREAMers to access the grant.
-   **Provide grants to increase college retention and
    completion, **allowing states, territories, and Tribes to support
    the adoption and expansion of evidence-based practices and promising
    solutions that help students complete their degrees.
-   **Increase funding to support Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs),
    and institutions such as Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), Asian
    American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions
    (AANAPISIs), and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and the
    students they serve. **This will provide two years of subsidized
    tuition, as well as funding to support institutional development and
    the strengthening of the health care workforce, which will benefit
    rural areas where the need for physicians, nurses, and other
    providers continues to limit access to care.

**<u>Education and Preparation for Teachers</u>**  
  
More than [9 million
students](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED604580.pdf)—nearly one in
five students—attend a rural school in the U.S. But these schools face
challenges in hiring and retaining teachers, particularly in special
education and specialized instruction.  
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Address teacher shortages, improve teacher preparation, and
    strengthen pipelines for teachers of color. **President Biden is
    calling on Congress to double scholarships for future teachers from
    $4,000 to $8,000 per year while earning their degree and expand it
    to early childhood educators. The President’s plan would also invest
    $3.2 billion to cultivate and recruit teachers from the communities
    that schools serve, provide year-long, paid residency programs, and
    invest in teacher preparation at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs.
-   **Support the development of special education teachers**. There has
    been a [17 percent 
    decline](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/shortage-of-special-educators-adds-to-classroom-pressures/2018/12) in
    the number of special educators over the last decade. Additionally,
    while only about half of the students receiving special education
    services are white, [approximately 82 percent of special education
    teachers are
    white](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/the-push-to-get-more-teachers-of-color-in-special-education-classrooms/2019/09).
    The American Families Plan will invest $900 million in personnel
    preparation funds under the Individuals with Disabilities Education
    Act (IDEA), funding pathways to additional certifications and
    strengthening existing teacher preparation programs for special
    educators.
-   **Help current teachers earn in-demand credentials.** President
    Biden is calling on Congress to create a new fund to provide
    educators with opportunities to obtain additional certifications in
    high-demand areas like special education, bilingual education, and
    certifications that improve teacher performance. This fund will
    support over 100,000 educators, with priority for public school
    teachers with at least two years of experience at schools with a
    significant number of low-income students or significant teacher
    shortages.
-   **Invest in educator leadership. **President Biden is calling on
    Congress to invest $2 billion in programs that leverage teachers as
    leaders to multiply their impact within their school, such as
    high-quality mentoring programs that leverage current teachers as
    mentors for new teachers, which improve student outcomes and
    increase teacher retention rates while keeping great teachers in the
    classroom.

**<u>Child Care</u>**  
  
Lack of access to affordable, high-quality child care is making it hard
for parents to work and provide for their families. Many rural families
have to go without care, and without sufficient demand, it can be
challenging for centers to afford to operate. [Over
half](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2018/12/06/461643/americas-child-care-deserts-2018/) of
rural families live in a child care desert, meaning there are few or no
child care options. In particular, rural families
disproportionately [lack
access](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/opre/report/early-care-and-education-rural-communities) to
child care centers serving infants and toddlers.    
  
The American Families Plan builds on investments in President Biden’s
American Jobs Plan and will further expand access to high-quality child
care in rural areas.  
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Make child care more affordable.** Families will pay only a
    portion of their income on child care based on a sliding scale. For
    the most-hard pressed working families, child care costs for their
    young children would be fully covered and families earning up to 1.5
    times their state median income will spend no more than 7% of their
    income on child care for young children.
-   **Ensure this child care is high quality.** The American Families
    plan will ensure child care providers, including centers and
    home-based providers, receive funding to provide the true cost of
    quality early childhood education—including a developmentally
    appropriate curriculum, small class sizes, and culturally and
    linguistically responsive environments that are inclusive of
    children with disabilities.
-   **Invest in the care workforce across rural America.** Early
    childhood educators are [among the most
    underpaid](https://cscce.berkeley.edu/workforce-index-2020/the-early-educator-workforce/early-educator-pay-economic-insecurity-across-the-states/) workers
    in the country and [nearly
    half](https://cscce.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/ReportFINAL.pdf) rely
    on public income support programs. The typical child care worker
    earned
    $[12.24](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/childcare-workers.htm) per
    hour in 2020—while receiving few, if any, benefits, leading to high
    turnover and lower quality of care.  The American Families Plan will
    ensure a $15 minimum wage for early childhood educators. Those with
    comparable qualifications to elementary school teachers will receive
    comparable compensation and benefits. And, the American Families
    Plan will ensure educators receive job-embedded coaching and
    professional development, along with additional training
    opportunities.

**<u>Paid Leave</u>**  
  
Paid family and medical leave supports workers and families and is a
critical investment in the strength and equity of our economy. However,
many rural workers lack access to paid family and medical leave
programs, particularly low-wage workers. According to one
nation-wide [survey](https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/paid-leave/voters-views-on-paid-family-medical-leave-survey-findings-august-2018.pdf),
over fifty percent of non-metro (including rural) workers said they
would very likely face hardship if they had to take a few months of
unpaid time off work, compared to 40 percent of metro area workers.
Furthermore, many small rural businesses struggle to compete for and
retain talent compared to urban areas. These businesses often cannot
afford to provide [workplace
supports](http://paidleavemn.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WGPP-Rural-Brief-1.19-Pages-1.pdf) like
paid family and medical leave. [Rural
areas](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/10/older-population-in-rural-america.html) are
also more likely to have older populations, increasing the need for both
medical and caregiving leave.
One [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.22038/full) found
that California’s paid leave program accounted for an 11-percent
relative decline in elderly nursing home usage, saving costs for both
the state and families.  
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Create a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave
    program**. The program will ensure workers receive partial wage
    replacement to take time to bond with a new child, care for a
    seriously ill loved one, deal with a loved one’s military
    deployment, find safety from sexual assault, stalking, or domestic
    violence, heal from their own serious illness, or take time to deal
    with the death of a loved one. It will guarantee twelve weeks of
    paid parental, family, and personal illness/safe leave by year 10 of
    the program, and also ensure workers get three days of bereavement
    leave per year starting in year one. The program will provide
    workers up to $4,000 a month, with a minimum of two-thirds of
    average weekly wages replaced, rising to 80 percent for the lowest
    wage workers. We estimate this program will cost $225 billion over a
    decade.

**<u>Nutrition</u>**  
  
With higher child poverty rates and longer distances to grocery stores,
accessing nutritious food can be challenging for families in rural
areas. [Eighty-six
percent](https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2020-06/Map%20the%20Meal%20Gap%202020%20Combined%20Modules.pdf) of
counties with high child food insecurity are rural, and children in
rural areas are [25 percent more
likely](https://www.ashaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Childhood-Obesity-Prevention-Strategies-for-Rural-Communities.pdf) to
be obese than those in urban areas. To foster positive long-term health
outcomes through nutrition security, President Biden’s American Families
Plan will:

-   **Expand summer EBT to all eligible children nationwide. **The
    Summer EBT Demonstrations help low-income families with children
    eligible for free- and reduced-price meals during the school year
    purchase food during the summer. The American Families Plan builds
    on the American Rescue Plan’s support for Summer Pandemic-EBT by
    making the successful program permanent and available to all 29
    million children receiving free- and reduced-price meals. Research
    shows that this program decreases food insecurity among children and
    leads to positive changes in nutritional outcomes.
-   **Expand school meal programs. **Currently, just 70 percent of
    eligible schools have adopted Community Eligibility Provision (CEP),
    which allows high-poverty schools to provide meals free of charge to
    all of their students—breaking down barriers for students who may be
    eligible for school meals but may not apply for them due to stigma
    or not fully understanding the application process. The President’s
    plan will allow more schools in high poverty districts to offer
    meals free of charge to all of their students by reimbursing a
    higher percentage of meals at the free reimbursement rate through
    CEP. Additionally, the plan will target elementary schools by
    lowering the threshold for CEP eligibility for elementary schools.
    The plan will also expand direct certification to automatically
    enroll more students for school meals based on Medicaid and
    Supplemental Security Income data. This will especially help rural
    schools, which often have limited administrative capacity for food
    purchasing and accounting.
-   **Launch a healthy foods incentive demonstration** to further
    improve the nutrition standards of school meals and support the
    development of healthy lifestyles throughout the school environment.

**<u>Tax Cuts for America’s Families and Workers</u>**  
  
While the American Rescue Plan provided meaningful relief to hundreds of
millions of Americans, that was just a first step. Now is the time to
build back better, to help families and workers who for too long have
felt the squeeze of stagnating wages and an ever-increasing
cost-of-living.  Direct assistance to families in the form of tax
credits paid on a regular basis lifts children and families out of
poverty, makes it easier for families to make ends meet, and boosts the
academic and economic performance of children over time. President
Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Extend expanded ACA premiums tax credits in the American Rescue
    Plan.** Health care should be a right, not a privilege, and
    Americans facing illness should never have to worry about how they
    are going to pay for their treatment. No one should face a choice
    between buying life-saving medications or putting food on the table.
    President Biden has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act and
    lower prescription drug costs for everyone by letting Medicare
    negotiate prices, reducing health insurance premiums and deductibles
    for those who buy coverage on their own, creating a public option
    and the option for people to enroll in Medicare at age 60, and
    closing the Medicaid coverage gap to help millions of Americans gain
    health insurance. The American Families Plan will build on the
    American Rescue Plan and continue our work to make health care more
    affordable.  The biggest improvement in health care affordability
    since the Affordable Care Act, the American Rescue Plan provided two
    years of lower health insurance premiums for those who buy coverage
    on their own. With those changes, more than [three in
    four](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265321/ASPE%20ACA%20Low%20Premium%20Plans%20Issue%20Brief%20II.pdf) uninsured
    people living in rural areas are now eligible for low-cost health
    care, and more than [four in
    five](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265361/low-premium-plans-ib-part-iii.pdf) current
    HealthCare.gov enrollees in rural counties are eligible for low-cost
    health care. The American Families Plan will make a $200 billion
    investment to make those premium reductions permanent. As a
    result, [nine
    million](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/12/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-reduces-health-care-costs-expands-access-insurance-coverage.html) people
    will save hundreds of dollars per year on their premiums, and [four
    million](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-if-american-rescue-plans-enhanced-marketplace-subsidies-were-made-permanent-estimates-2022) uninsured
    people will gain coverage.  The Families Plan will also invest in
    maternal health and support the families of veterans receiving
    health care services.
-   **Extend the Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases in the American Rescue
    Plan through 2025 and make the CTC permanently fully refundable**.
    Rural child poverty rates are higher than the national average,
    and [more than 200 rural
    counties](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-518.pdf) qualify as
    “persistent-poverty counties,” meaning they have experienced poverty
    rates of 20 percent or higher for at least 30 years.  The President
    is calling for extending the Child Tax Credit expansion first
    enacted in the American Rescue Plan, which increases the Child Tax
    Credit from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child for 6-year-olds and
    above and $3,600 per child for children under 6. It also makes
    17-year-olds eligible for the first time and makes the credit fully
    refundable, meaning that the nearly half of low-income rural
    families that historically did not qualify for the full credit
    because they earned too little, can now receive the same credit as
    middle-income families. If extended, this would be the single
    largest contributor to this plan’s historic impact of lifting a
    projected 620,000 children in non-metro areas out of poverty in 2022
    and [cutting rural child
    poverty](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2021/presidential-policy/american-family-plan-poverty-impact) in
    half.
-   **Permanently increase tax credits to support families with child
    care needs. **To help even more families, President Biden is calling
    on Congress to make permanent the temporary expansion of the Child
    and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) enacted in the American Rescue
    Plan. Families will get back as a tax credit as much as half of
    their spending on child care for children under age 13, so that they
    can receive a total of up to $4,000 for one child or $8,000 for two
    or more children. Making the American Rescue Plan expansion of CDCTC
    permanent will also ensure the credit will continue to be fully
    refundable, making it more equitable by allowing low-income working
    families to receive the full value of the credit towards their
    eligible child care expenses regardless of how much they owe in
    taxes.
-   **Make the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion for childless
    workers permanent**. President Biden believes our tax code should
    reward work and not wealth. And that means rewarding people who work
    hard every day at modest wages to provide their communities with
    essential services. Before this year, the federal tax code taxed
    low-wage childless workers into poverty or deeper into poverty — the
    only group of workers treated this way. The American Rescue Plan
    addressed this problem by roughly tripling the EITC for childless
    workers, benefitting [17
    million](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/american-rescue-plan-act-includes-critical-expansions-of-child-tax-credit-and) low-wage
    workers, many of whom are essential workers including cashiers,
    cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation workers, and childcare
    providers. For example, a childless worker who works 30 hours per
    week at $9 per hour earns income that, after taxes, leaves them
    below the federal poverty line. By increasing her credit to more
    than $1,100, EITC expansion helps pull such workers out of poverty.
    The President is calling on Congress to make this expansion
    permanent. All told, the expansion will directly benefit more
    than [one in five rural
    workers](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/rescue-plans-expansions-of-earned-income-tax-credit-child-tax-credit-will) without
    children.
