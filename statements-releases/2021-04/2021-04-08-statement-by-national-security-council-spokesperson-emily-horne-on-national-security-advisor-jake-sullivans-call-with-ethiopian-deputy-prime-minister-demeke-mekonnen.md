National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone on April 7 with
Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen.  Mr. Sullivan expressed
the Biden Administration’s grave concern about the continued
humanitarian and human rights crisis in the Tigray region.  Mr. Sullivan
and Deputy Prime Minister Mekonnen discussed critical steps to address
the crisis, including expanded humanitarian access, cessation of
hostilities, departure of foreign troops, and independent investigations
into atrocities and human rights violations.  They also discussed the
importance of continued dialogue among regional leaders, with the
support of the African Union, to peacefully resolve current disputes
related to the al-Fashaga border and the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam.
Mr. Sullivan stressed that the United States is ready to help Ethiopia
address the crisis, building on our longstanding bilateral partnership
and friendship.
