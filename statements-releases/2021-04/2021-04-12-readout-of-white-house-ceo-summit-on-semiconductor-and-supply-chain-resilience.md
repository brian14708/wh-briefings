title: "Readout of White\_House CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain\_Resilience"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. briefly joined National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Brian
Deese, and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo during a virtual event
with CEOs and senior leaders from industries affected by the
semiconductor shortage — including representatives from American
semiconductor producers, tech companies, automotive manufacturers, and
other companies that use semiconductors. 

The semiconductor shortage, which is impacting American workers and
families right now, is a top and immediate priority for the President
and his senior most advisors on economic and national security. The
White House heard directly from industry leaders on the impact of the
chip shortage and discussed short and long-term approaches to address
it. Participants emphasized the importance of improving transparency in
the semiconductor supply chain to help mitigate current shortages and
improving demand forecasting across the supply chain to help mitigate
future challenges. They also discussed the importance of encouraging
additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the United States to
make sure we never again face shortages. Finally, they discussed how the
President’s infrastructure investments in the American Jobs Plan
strengthen America’s competitiveness and national security by building
the infrastructure of tomorrow and strengthening supply chain resilience
— ensuring that the United States remains a global leader in critical
technologies and the transition to a clean energy future.
