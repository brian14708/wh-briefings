title: "Statement by\_Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on the Emergency Presidential Determination\
  \ on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year\_2021"
---
 
The President’s directive today has been the subject of some confusion. 
Last week, he sent to Congress his budget for the fiscal year starting
in October 2021, which honors his commitment.  For the past few weeks,
he has been consulting with his advisors to determine what number of
refugees could realistically be admitted to the United States between
now and October 1.  Given the decimated refugee admissions program we
inherited, and burdens on the Office of Refugee Resettlement, his
initial goal of 62,500 seems unlikely.   
  
While finalizing that determination, the President was urged to take
immediate action to reverse the Trump policy that banned refugees from
many key regions, to enable flights from those regions to begin within
days; today’s order did that.  With that done, we expect the President
to set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal
year by May 15.
