*Task Force Briefed on Drought in the West, Forms Interagency Working
Group to Provide Relief, Announces more than $700 Million in New
Conservation Funding to Invest in Climate Resilience and Carbon Removal*

Today, ahead of the Leaders Summit on Climate, National Climate Advisor
Gina McCarthy convened the third National Climate Task Force. Cabinet
members and White House leaders discussed pathways that will
significantly reduce greenhouse gases while growing the economy,
creating good-paying, union jobs, and cutting pollution on a
sector-by-sector basis, consistent with direction from President Biden
to develop a 2030 greenhouse gas target as part fulfilling his promise
to re-enter the Paris Agreement.  
  
Another key focus of the virtual meeting was to discuss the severe
drought that is gripping the western United States. The Task Force was
briefed by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and NOAA scientist Dr. Roger
Pulwalty on the severity of the drought. In areas like the Klamath Basin
in southern Oregon and northern California, lake levels today are lower
than occurred during the Dust Bowl. As has been shown in previous years,
severe drought conditions can set the stage for worsening wildfire
seasons, which in 2020 alone caused $16.6 billion in damages.  The
early, severe drought situation is just the latest manifestation of the
pervasive and pernicious impacts that climate change is having on
American communities.  
  
In response, **National Climate Advisor McCarthy, as Chair of the
National Climate Task Force, requested that the Secretary of Agriculture
Tom Vilsack and the Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland form an
Interagency Working Group to address the needs of drought impacted
communities. The Working Group also will explore opportunities to
improve our nation’s resilience to droughts and other severe climate
impacts that are upending Americans’ lives and economic livelihoods.**  
  
The National Climate Task Force also discussed how investing in
conservation can fight against climate change by enabling forests, range
lands, and farm lands to remove and sequester additional volumes of
carbon from the atmosphere – while strengthening the resilience of these
lands to drought, wildfire, and other climate impacts.

In line with this theme, several cabinet secretaries announced important
conservation initiatives that will help fight against climate change by
increasing carbon stocks in conserved lands while strengthening the
lands’ abilities to withstand drought and other adverse climate impacts.
In particular: 

1.  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that **USDA will open
    enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)** with higher
    payment rates, new incentives, and a more targeted focus on the
    program’s role in climate change mitigation – devoting $300 million
    or more annually to the effort.

-   CRP is one of the world’s largest voluntary conservation programs
    with a long track record of preserving topsoil, sequestering carbon,
    and reducing nitrogen runoff, as well providing healthy habitat for
    wildlife. 
-   CRP is a powerful tool when it comes to climate mitigation, and
    acres currently enrolled in the program mitigate more than 12
    million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). If USDA
    reaches its goal of enrolling an additional 4 million acres into the
    program, it will mitigate an additional 3 million metric tons of CO2
    equivalent and prevent 90 million pounds of nitrogen and 33 million
    tons of sediment from running into our waterways each year.

USDA also announced investments in partnerships to increase
climate-smart agriculture, including $330 million in 85 Regional
Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) projects and $25 million for
On-Farm Conservation Innovation Trials. Secretary Vilsack chose to make
the announcement at White House National Climate Task Force meeting to
demonstrate USDA’s commitment to putting American agriculture and
forestry at the center of climate-smart solutions to address climate
change.

2\. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced that **$78 million in
grants have been approved by the Migratory Bird Conservation
Commission**, which will provide the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
its partners the ability to help conserve or restore nearly 500,000
acres of wetland and associated upland habitats for waterfowl,
shorebirds and other birds across North America – including Canada and
Mexico. The grants, made through the North American Wetlands
Conservation Act (NAWCA), will be matched by more than $120 million in
partner funds.  Partners in NAWCA projects include private
landowners, states, local governments, conservation organizations,
sportsmen’s groups, Tribes, land trusts and corporations.

3\. Separately, the Commerce Department’s National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation,
and additional governmental and private partners announced that they
will provide $34 million for nature-based approaches through the
National Coastal Resilience Fund. These projects will advance
restoration or enhancement of natural features, such as coastal
wetlands, dunes, and coral reefs, to protect coastal communities and
infrastructure from flooding, while also improving habitat for fish and
wildlife.

As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 executive order on tackling
the climate, the Task Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor
and includes Cabinet-level leaders from 21 federal agencies and senior
White House officials to mobilize the Biden-Harris Administration’s
implementation of a whole-of-government approach.

officials:*
