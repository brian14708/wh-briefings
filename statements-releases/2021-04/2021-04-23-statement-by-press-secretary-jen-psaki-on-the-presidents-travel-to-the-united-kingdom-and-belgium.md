President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to the United Kingdom and
Belgium in June 2021. This will be the first overseas travel by
President Biden. This trip will highlight his commitment to restoring
our alliances, revitalizing the Transatlantic relationship, and working
in close cooperation with our allies and multilateral partners to
address global challenges and better secure America’s interests.  
  
President Biden will attend the G7 Summit in Cornwall, U.K., which is
happening from June 11-13, where he will reinforce our commitment to
multilateralism, work to advance key U.S. policy priorities on public
health, economic recovery, and climate change, and demonstrate
solidarity and shared values among major democracies.  He will also hold
bilateral meetings with fellow G7 leaders, including British Prime
Minister Boris Johnson.  
  
From the United Kingdom the President will travel to Brussels, Belgium,
where he will participate in the NATO Summit on June 14. President Biden
will affirm the United States’ commitment to NATO, Transatlantic
security, and collective defense. NATO leaders will discuss how to
orient the Alliance to future threats and ensure effective burden
sharing. The President will also hold bilateral meetings with fellow
NATO leaders.  
  
While in Brussels President Biden will participate in a U.S.–EU Summit,
which will underscore our commitment to a strong Transatlantic
partnership based on shared interests and values. The leaders will
discuss a common agenda to ensure global health security, stimulate
global economic recovery, tackle climate change, enhance digital and
trade cooperation, strengthen democracy, and address mutual foreign
policy concerns.  
  
We look forward to having further details to share about this trip soon,
including potential additional elements.
