We welcome the bipartisan introduction of the Endless Frontier Act – one
more encouraging sign of the bipartisan support for investing in
America’s competitiveness. The President shares the co-sponsors’
commitment to making a bold investment in American innovation—including
large increases in funding at the National Science Foundation to support
both R&D and commercialization, and new funding to support regional
economic development so what is discovered in America can be made in
America. And, the President welcomes the bill’s focus on strengthening
American supply chains – an issue he has taken action on and championed.
We look forward to working with Congress to further shape this
legislation to renew America’s global leadership in science and
technology and to make sure we develop and manufacture the technologies
of the future.
