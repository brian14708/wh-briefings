President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Vladimir Putin
of Russia. They discussed a number of regional and global issues,
including the intent of the United States and Russia to pursue a
strategic stability dialogue on a range of arms control and emerging
security issues, building on the extension of the New START Treaty.
President Biden also made clear that the United States will act firmly
in defense of its national interests in response to Russia’s actions,
such as cyber intrusions and election interference. President Biden
emphasized the United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s
sovereignty and territorial integrity. The President voiced our concerns
over the sudden Russian military build-up in occupied Crimea and on
Ukraine’s borders, and called on Russia to de-escalate
tensions. President Biden reaffirmed his goal of building a stable and
predictable relationship with Russia consistent with U.S. interests, and
proposed a summit meeting in a third country in the coming months to
discuss the full range of issues facing the United States and Russia.
