title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Electric Battery Dispute\_Settlement"
---
 
This settlement agreement is a win for American workers and the American
auto industry. A key part of my plan to Build Back Better is to have the
electric vehicles and batteries of the future built here in America, all
across America, by American workers. We need a strong, diversified and
resilient U.S.-based electric vehicle battery supply chain, so we can
supply the growing global demand for these vehicles and components –
creating good-paying jobs here at home, and laying the groundwork for
the jobs of tomorrow. Today’s settlement is a positive step in that
direction, which will bring some welcome relief to workers in Georgia
and new opportunity for workers across the country. I want to thank
Ambassador Katherine Tai for her tireless work to resolve this dispute
and facilitate a settlement that is good for America’s future in the
electric vehicle industry, and good for job creation. My American Jobs
Plan will help build on this momentum, creating millions of new jobs,
supporting a stronger American auto industry and making sure that we win
the electric vehicle markets of the future.
