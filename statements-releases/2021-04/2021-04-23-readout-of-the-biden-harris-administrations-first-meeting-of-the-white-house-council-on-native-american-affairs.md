Today, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and Domestic Policy Advisor
Susan Rice convened the first meeting of the White House Council on
Native American Affairs in the Biden-Harris Administration. The Council
will coordinate with Tribal Nations as it advances work on key issues
such as climate change, Tribal homelands and treaties; economic
development, energy and infrastructure; health; education; public safety
and justice; and international Indigenous issues.

Ten Cabinet Secretaries and other top government officials participated
in discussions focused on strengthening the Nation-to-Nation
relationship, improving tribal consultation, and formalizing the working
committees of the Council.

In addition, the White House today announced that it will hold a White
House Tribal Leaders Summit in late 2021. The purpose of the Summit is
to provide an opportunity for the leaders from the 574 federally
recognized Tribal Nations to have an opportunity to interact directly
with the President and representatives from the highest levels of the
Administration.

The White House Council on Native American Affairs was established by
Executive Order in 2013. The Council languished in the last
Administration. President Biden reinstated the Council in less than 100
days in office.
