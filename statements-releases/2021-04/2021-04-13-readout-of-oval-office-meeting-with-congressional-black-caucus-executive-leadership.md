title: Readout of Oval Office Meeting with Congressional Black Caucus Executive Leadership
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hosted the
executive leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) in the Oval
Office to discuss topics of critical importance, including economic
empowerment, voting rights, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act,
and how the American Jobs Plan will advance racial equity and redress
historic inequities.

The President and the Vice President shared their vision in the American
Jobs Plan to make a generational investment in racial justice by
expanding job opportunities for people of color; investing in climate
justice to mitigate the disproportionate impacts of pollution on Black
and brown Americans; eliminating lead pipes to safeguard clean drinking
water; building more equitable transportation; delivering affordable
housing and mitigating exclusionary zoning policies; and investing in
our care economy to ensure caregivers, who are predominantly women of
color, receive the benefits and protections they deserve.

The President, the Vice President, and CBC members also discussed the
ongoing events in Minneapolis.

The President highlighted his commitment to diversity throughout the
appointments and nominations process, including judicial candidates.

This meeting underscores the long-term partnership between President
Biden, Vice President Harris, and the CBC on crucial issues, and the
Administrationâ€™s continued attention to their legislative goals and
priorities.
