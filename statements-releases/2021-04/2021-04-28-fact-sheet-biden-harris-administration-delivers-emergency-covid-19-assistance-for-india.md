Reflecting the United States’ solidarity with India as it battles a new
wave of COVID-19 cases, the United States is delivering supplies worth
more than $100 million in the coming days to provide urgent relief to
our partners in India.  In addition, U.S. state governments, private
companies, non-government organizations, and thousands of Americans from
across the country have mobilized to deliver vital oxygen, related
equipment, and essential supplies for Indian hospitals to support
frontline health care workers and the people of India most affected
during the current outbreak.  U.S. Government assistance flights will
start arriving in India on Thursday, April 29 and will continue into
next week.

Just as India sent assistance to the United States when our hospitals
were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to
help India in its time of need.  
  
**Immediate U.S. Emergency COVID-19 Assistance**  
  
The United States is providing: 

-   Oxygen Support:  An initial delivery of 1,100 cylinders will remain
    in India and can be repeatedly refilled at local supply centers,
    with more planeloads to come.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention has also locally procured oxygen cylinders and will
    deliver them to support hospital systems in coordination with the
    Government of India.
-   Oxygen Concentrators: 1700 oxygen concentrators to obtain oxygen
    from ambient air, these mobile units provide options for flexible
    patient treatment.
-   Oxygen Generation Units (PSA Systems): Multiple large-scale units to
    support up to 20 patients each, and additional mobile units will
    provide an ability to target specific shortages. A team of U.S.
    experts will support these units, working hand-in-hand on the ground
    with Indian medical personnel. 
-   Personal Protective Equipment: 15 million N95 masks to protect both
    patients and Indian health care personnel. 
-   Vaccine-Manufacturing Supplies:  The U.S. has re-directed its own
    order of Astra Zeneca manufacturing supplies to India.  This will
    allow India to make over 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine.
-   Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs):  1 million rapid diagnostic tests –
    the same type used by the White House — to provide reliable results
    in less than 15 minutes to help identify and prevent community
    spread.     
-   Therapeutics:  The first tranche of a planned 20,000 treatment
    courses of the antiviral drug remdesivir to help treat hospitalized
    patients.  
-   Public Health Assistance: U.S. CDC experts will work hand-in- hand
    with India’s experts in the following areas: laboratory,
    surveillance and epidemiology, bioinformatics for genomic sequencing
    and modeling, infection prevention and control, vaccine rollout, and
    risk communication.

**U.S. Support for India from the Outset of the Pandemic **  
  
The United States and India have closely worked together to respond to
the COVID-19 pandemic.  U.S. COVID-19 assistance has reached more than
9.7 million Indians across more than 20 states and union territories,
providing life-saving treatments, disseminating public health messages
to local communities; strengthening case-finding and surveillance; and
mobilizing innovative financing mechanisms to bolster emergency
preparedness: 

-   Partnered with more than 1,000 Indian healthcare facilities to
    strengthen preparedness, including training of over 14,000 people on
    infection prevention and control.
-   Helped keep more than 213,000 frontline workers safe — including
    risk mitigation training for doctors, nurses, midwives, community
    volunteers, sanitation workers, and others who are actively
    responding to COVID-19 in India.
-   Launched joint public messaging with UNICEF on COVID prevention that
    has reached more than 84 million people.
-   Provided 200 state-of-the-art ventilators to 29 healthcare
    facilities in 15 states to care for critically-ill COVID-19
    patients.

**U.S.-India Health Partnership: Seven Decades Strong**

-   For seventy years, U.S. public health experts from across the
    government, including USAID, HHS, CDC, FDA, and NIH, have worked in
    partnership with Indian officials to improve the health of India’s
    most vulnerable communities and the well-being of its people. 
-   Over the last 20 years, U.S. foreign assistance to India has
    exceeded $2.8 billion, including more than $1.4 billion for health
    care. 
-   The United States, India, and other partners have worked together to
    reduce new HIV infections by 37 percent between 2010 and 2019.
-   Since 1998, the United States and India have worked together to
    combat tuberculosis (TB) through improved patient-centered
    diagnosis, treatment and prevention, helping treat 15 million people
    with the disease.
-   In the last five years, the United States has helped 40 million
    pregnant women receive vital health information and services.
-   The United States, in partnership with the Government of India and
    World Health Organization, has supported initiatives at the
    District, State and National level to build frontline disease
    detection capacity.
-   The United States and India are working together to advance global
    health security and fight outbreaks before they become pandemics.
