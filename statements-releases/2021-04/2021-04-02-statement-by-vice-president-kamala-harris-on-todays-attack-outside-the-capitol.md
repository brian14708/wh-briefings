  \ Capitol"

Today, in an inexplicable act of violence, a brave U.S. Capitol Police
Officer was killed in the line of duty, while another officer fights for
his life. Officer William Evans made the ultimate sacrifice protecting
the Capitol and those who work there on behalf of the American people.
Officer Evans, his family, and all those who knew him are in our hearts
and prayers. We mourn with them during this difficult time.  
   
Doug and I are grateful for the Capitol Police, the National Guard
Immediate Response Force, and everyone else who responded swiftly to
today’s attack. And we continue to be proud of the courageous men and
women who defend the Capitol, especially during a challenging period
when they have faced two violent and deadly attacks.
