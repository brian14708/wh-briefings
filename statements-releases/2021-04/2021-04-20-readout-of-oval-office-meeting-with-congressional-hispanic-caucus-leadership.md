Today, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hosted the

the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, the impact of the American Jobs Plan
on Latino communities, immigration reform and a humanitarian response at
the border, extending the eviction moratorium, and preventing extremist
groups from joining the U.S. armed forces.

The President and Vice President shared their vision in the American
Jobs Plan to invest in shared CHC infrastructure priorities, including
affordable housing and job creation.

The President also highlighted his commitment to Latino representation

This meeting underscores the long-term partnership between President

priorities.
