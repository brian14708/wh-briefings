title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Tragedy in\_Israel"

The United States stands with the people of Israel, and with Jewish
communities the world over, in mourning the terrible tragedy at Mount
Meron. I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu today to offer my profound
condolences on behalf of the American people to our friends in Israel.
The loss of life among worshipers practicing their faith is
heartbreaking. I have instructed my team to offer our assistance to the
government and people of Israel as they respond to the disaster and care
for the wounded.  We are also working to confirm reports that American
citizens may have lost their lives or been wounded during the religious
observance of Lag B’Omer. Our Embassy and Department of State will
provide all necessary support to any U.S. citizens and their family
members affected by this sad event. The people of the United States and
Israel are bound together by our families, our faiths, and our
histories, and we will stand with our friends. Our prayers are with
those who were injured and all those who lost loved ones. May their
memories be a blessing.
