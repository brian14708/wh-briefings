title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Service of Ambassador\
  \ Jacobson, Coordinator for the Southwest\_Border"
---
 
Ambassador Roberta Jacobson’s leadership in serving as the Special
Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Southwest Border at
the National Security Council has been an invaluable contribution to the
Biden-Harris Administration and to the United States.  Ambassador
Jacobson dedicated her career to working tirelessly to advance U.S.
interests in the Western Hemisphere, including as the United States
Ambassador to Mexico, and President Biden knew there was no person
better to usher in a more safe, secure, and just approach to our
Southern Border.  Consistent with her commitment at the outset to serve
in the Administration’s first 100 days, Ambassador Jacobson will retire
from her role as Coordinator at the end of this month.  She will do so
having shaped our relationship with Mexico as an equal partner, having
launched our renewed efforts with the Northern Triangle nations of El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and having underscored this
Administration’s commitment to reenergizing the U.S. immigration
system.   President Biden has asked Vice President Kamala Harris to lead
the Administration’s work on our efforts with Mexico and the Northern
Triangle, a testament to the importance this administration places on
improving conditions in the region.  The Vice President is overseeing a
whole-of-government approach supported by outstanding public servants
across the interagency including Secretary of Homeland Security
Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier
Becerra, who were tasked by the President at the beginning of the
administration to rebuild our immigration system.
