**Building on Past U.S. Leadership, including Efforts by States, Cities,
Tribes, and Territories, the New Target Aims at 50-52 Percent Reduction
in U.S. Greenhouse Gas Pollution from 2005 Levels in 2030**

Today, President Biden will announce a new target for the United States
to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide
net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030 – building on progress to-date and
by positioning American workers and industry to tackle the climate
crisis.     
  
The announcement – made during the Leaders Summit on Climate that
President Biden is holding to challenge the world on increased ambition
in combatting climate change – is part of the President’s focus on
building back better in a way that will create millions of good-paying,
union jobs, ensure economic competitiveness, advance environmental
justice, and improve the health and security of communities across
America.  
  
On Day One, President Biden fulfilled his promise to rejoin the Paris
Agreement and set a course for the United States to tackle the climate
crisis at home and abroad, reaching net zero emissions economy-wide by
no later than 2050.  As part of re-entering the Paris Agreement, he also
launched a whole-of-government process, organized through his National
Climate Task Force, to establish this new 2030 emissions target – known
as the “nationally determined contribution” or “NDC,” a formal
submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC).  Today’s announcement is the product of this government-wide
assessment of how to make the most of the opportunity combatting climate
change presents.   
  
**<u>PUSHING PROGRESS, CREATING JOBS, AND ACHIEVING JUSTICE</u>**  
  
The United States is not waiting, the costs of delay are too great, and
our nation is resolved to act now.  Climate change poses an existential
threat, but responding to this threat offers an opportunity to support
good-paying, union jobs, strengthen America’s working communities,
protect public health, and advance environmental justice. Creating jobs
and tackling climate change go hand in hand – empowering the U.S. to
build more resilient infrastructure, expand access to clean air and
drinking water, spur American technological innovations, and create
good-paying, union jobs along the way.  
  
To develop the goal, the Administration analyzed how every sector of the
economy can spur innovation, unleash new opportunities, drive
competitiveness, and cut pollution. The target builds on leadership from
mayors, county executives, governors, tribal leaders, businesses, faith
groups, cultural institutions, health care organizations, investors, and
communities who have worked together tirelessly to ensure sustained
progress in reducing pollution in the United States.  
  
Building on and benefiting from that foundation, America’s 2030 target
picks up the pace of emissions reductions in the United States, compared
to historical levels, while supporting President Biden’s existing goals
to create a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and net zero
emissions economy by no later than 2050. There are multiple paths to
reach these goals, and the U.S. federal, state, local, and tribal
governments have many tools available to work with civil society and the
private sector to mobilize investment to meet these goals while
supporting a strong economy.   
  
**<u>SUPPORTING AMERICAN WORKERS</u>**  
  
This target prioritizes American workers. Meeting the 2030 emissions
target will create millions of good-paying, middle class, union jobs –
line workers who will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines for a
clean, modern, resilient grid; workers capping abandoned wells and
reclaiming mines and stopping methane leaks; autoworkers building
modern, efficient, electric vehicles and the charging infrastructure to
support them; engineers and construction workers expanding carbon
capture and green hydrogen to forge cleaner steel and cement; and
farmers using cutting-edge tools to make American soil the next frontier
of carbon innovation.  
  
The health of our communities, well-being of our workers, and
competitiveness of our economy requires this quick and bold action to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We must:

-   **Invest in infrastructure and innovation.** America must lead the
    critical industries that produce and deploy the clean technologies
    that we can harness today – and the ones that we will improve and
    invent tomorrow.
-   **Fuel an economic recovery that creates jobs.** We have the
    opportunity to fuel an equitable recovery, expand supply chains and
    bolster manufacturing, create millions of good-paying, union jobs,
    and build a more sustainable, resilient future.
-   **Breathe clean air and drink clean water and advance environmental
    justice.** We can improve the health and well-being of our families
    and communities – especially those places too often left out and
    left behind.
-   **Make it in America.** We can bolster our domestic supply chains
    and position the U.S. to ship American-made, clean energy products —
    like EV batteries – around the world.

**<u>MEETING THE MOMENT</u>**  
  
The target is consistent with the President’s goal of achieving net-zero
greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050 and of limiting global
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as the science demands.  To develop the
target, the Administration:

-   **Used a whole-of-government approach:** The NDC was developed by
    the National Climate Task Force using a whole-of-government
    approach, relying on a detailed bottom-up analysis that reviewed
    technology availability, current costs, and future cost reductions,
    as well as the role of enabling infrastructure.  Standards,
    incentives, programs, and support for innovation were all weighed in
    the analysis.  The National Climate Task Force is developing this
    into a national climate strategy to be issued later this year.
-   **Consulted important and diverse stakeholders:** From unions that
    collectively bargain for millions of Americans who have built our
    country and work to keep it running to groups representing tens of
    millions of advocates and young Americans, the Administration
    listened to Americans across the country. This also included groups
    representing thousands of scientists; hundreds of governmental
    leaders like governors, mayors, and tribal leaders; hundreds of
    businesses; hundreds of schools and institutions of higher
    education; as well as with many specialized researchers focused on
    questions of pollution reduction.
-   **Explored multiple pathways across the economy**: The target is
    grounded in analysis that explored multiple pathways for each
    economic sector of the economy that produces CO<sub>2</sub> and
    non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases: electricity, transportation,
    buildings, industry, and lands. 

Each policy considered for reducing emissions is also an opportunity to
support good jobs and improve equity:

-   The United States has set a goal to reach **100 percent carbon
    pollution-free electricity** **by 2035**, which can be achieved
    through multiple cost-effective pathways each resulting in
    meaningful emissions reductions in this decade. That means
    good-paying jobs deploying carbon pollution-free electricity
    generating resources, transmission, and energy storage and
    leveraging the carbon pollution-free energy potential of power
    plants retrofitted with carbon capture and existing nuclear, while
    ensuring those facilities meet robust and rigorous standards for
    worker, public, environmental safety and environmental justice.
-   The United States can create good-paying jobs and **cut emissions
    and** **energy costs for families by supporting efficiency upgrades
    and electrification in buildings** through support for job-creating
    retrofit programs and sustainable affordable housing, wider use of
    heat pumps and induction stoves, and adoption of modern energy codes
    for new buildings. The United States will also invest in new
    technologies to reduce emissions associated with construction,
    including for high-performance electrified buildings.
-   The United States can **reduce carbon pollution from the
    transportation sector** by reducing tailpipe emissions and boosting
    the efficiency of cars and trucks; providing funding for charging
    infrastructure; and spurring research, development, demonstration,
    and deployment efforts that drive forward very low carbon
    new-generation renewable fuels for applications like aviation, and
    other cutting-edge transportation technologies across modes.
    Investment in a wider array of transportation infrastructure,
    including transit, rail, and biking improvements, will make more
    choices available to travelers.
-   The United States can **reduce emissions from forests and**
    **agriculture** **and enhance carbon sinks** through a range of
    programs and measures including nature-based solutions for
    ecosystems ranging from our forests and agricultural soils to our
    rivers and coasts. Ocean-based solutions can also contribute towards
    reducing U.S. emissions.
-   The United States can **address carbon pollution from industrial
    processes** by supporting carbon capture as well as new sources of
    hydrogen—produced from renewable energy, nuclear energy, or waste—to
    power industrial facilities.  The government can use its procurement
    power to support early markets for these very low- and zero-carbon
    industrial goods.
-   The United States will also reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gases,
    including methane, hydrofluorocarbons and other potent short-lived
    climate pollutants. Reducing these pollutants delivers fast climate
    benefits.
-   In addition, the United States will **invest in** **innovation** to
    improve and broaden the set of solutions as a critical complement to
    deploying the affordable, reliable, and resilient clean technologies
    and infrastructure available today.

America must act— and not just the federal government, but cities and
states, small and big business, working communities.  Together, we can
seize the opportunity to drive prosperity, create jobs, and build the
clean energy economy of tomorrow.
