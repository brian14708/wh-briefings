National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan led U.S. participation in a
virtual meeting of the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group on April
13.  This meeting was held as part of ongoing bilateral consultations on
security issues of vital importance to the two countries.  During the
meeting, officials consulted in detail on opportunities to promote
stability and security in the face of shared regional threats and
challenges.  Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed the Biden-Harris administration’s
unwavering commitment to Israel’s security and to ensuring that Iran
will never obtain a nuclear weapon.  The officials expressed their
shared interest in maintaining a close and open dialogue in the months
ahead.  Mr. Sullivan warmly invited his Israeli counterpart, Meir
Ben-Shabbat, to visit Washington before the end of this month for
follow-up consultations.
