title: "Readout of Oval Office Meeting with Bipartisan, Bicameral Members of\_Congress"
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden hosted Members of Congress and Transportation
Secretary Pete Buttigieg in the Oval Office to discuss the need for the
historic investments laid out in the American Jobs Plan. A bipartisan,
bicameral group of Members of Congress—all former governors and
mayors—participated in the meeting. These Members have a unique
understanding of the impact of and need for federal investment in
rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure from their time as state and
local executives.

The President and Secretary Buttigieg shared their vision in the
American Jobs Plan to create millions of good jobs, rebuild our
country’s infrastructure, and position the United States to out-compete
China. The Members of Congress engaged in a productive exchange of
ideas, including components of the plan and how to pay for them.
President Biden asked for their feedback and follow-up on proposals
discussed in the meeting, while underscoring that inaction is not an
option.

This is the latest in a series of meetings led by the Biden-Harris
Administration to engage Members of Congress and key stakeholders on the
American Jobs Plan.
