title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Congressman Alcee\_Hastings"
---
 
I had the privilege of getting to know Alcee Hastings during the years
when he served in the House of Representatives and I served in the
United States Senate and later as Vice President. I greatly admired him
for his singular sense of humor, and for always speaking the truth
bluntly and without reservation. A trailblazing lawyer who grew up in
the Jim Crow South, Alcee was outspoken because he was passionate about
helping our nation live up to its full promise for all Americans. It was
a passion he forged as a pioneering civil rights lawyer in the 1960s,
fighting tirelessly to desegregate hotels, restaurants, and public
spaces in south Florida â€” a trailblazing spirit to advocate for what is
right that guided him throughout his life.

Across his long career of public service, Alcee always stood up to fight
for equality, and always showed up for the working people he
represented. And even in his final battle with cancer, he simply never
gave up.

Jill and I are saddened to learn of his passing. May God bless Alcee
Hastings and his family.
