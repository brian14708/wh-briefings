*Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, and General
Services Administration Announce New Actions to Accelerate Deployment of
Electric Vehicles and Chargers*  
 

Today, the White House announced new progress on the Administration’s
goal to accelerate and deploy electric vehicles and charging stations,
create good-paying, union jobs, and enable a clean transportation
future. This includes actions by federal agencies:

-   The Department of Transportation announced guidance on how grants
    can be used to deploy charging infrastructure and newly designated
    alternative fuel corridors;
-   The Department of Energy announced new funding and partnerships for
    charger-related research and development; and
-   The General Services Administration announced progress on the goal
    to transition the federal fleet to zero-emission vehicles.

In March, the United States passed the milestone of 100,000 public
chargers (as recorded by the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuel
Data Center) and these new actions will accelerate deployment to make
driving an electric vehicle convenient in every part of the country.

To discuss today’s announcements, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy
and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg visited new, fast-charging
facility near Union Station in Washington, DC. The charging stations
were installed by an American-based company EVGo and enable EV users to
recharge rapidly when away from home.

Most electric vehicle drivers will charge at home and work. One of the
perks of driving an electric vehicle is never needing to go to the gas
station. But public charging infrastructure will provide a key role for
people without off-street parking and for longer trips. A robust,
convenient, and affordable network of public chargers will increase
confidence for drivers that they will always have a charging option when
they need it.

President Biden’s American Jobs Plan includes a transformational $15
billion investment to fund this vision and build a national network of
500,000 charging stations. Through a combination of grant and incentive
programs for state and local governments and the private sector, it will
support a transformational acceleration in deployment of a mix of
chargers in apartment buildings, in public parking, throughout
communities, and as a robust fast charging along our nation’s roadways.

Charger installation and maintenance creates good-paying, union jobs
right here in America that cannot be outsourced, and the American Jobs
Plan also includes incentives to bring more charging equipment
manufacturing to the United States. Every element of the plan will
promote strong labor, training, and installation standards. The Biden
Administration is committed to promoting high quality jobs, fair wages,
and safe working conditions through its investments. This means holding
both public and private recipients of federal funding accountable to
create and support good middle-class jobs. Industry, unions, state, and
local governments, higher education institutions like community
colleges, and nonprofits will need to work together to prepare workers
for the job opportunities these investments will create.

**<u>Supporting a Nationwide Charging Network</u>**

-   Today, the Department of
    Transportation [announced](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors/) the **5th
    round of “Alternative Fuel Corridors” designations**. This program,
    created by the FAST Act in 2015, recognizes highway segments that
    have infrastructure plans to allow travel on alternative fuels,
    including electricity. The first four rounds of designations
    included portions of 119 Interstates and 100 US highways and state
    roads. Round 5 includes nominations from 25 states for 51
    interstates and 50 US highways and state roads.
-   The cumulative designations (Rounds 1-5) for all fuel types
    (electric, hydrogen, propane, natural gas) include 134 Interstates
    and 125 US highways/State roads, covering almost 166,000 miles of
    the NHS in 49 States plus DC. Of that total, the FHWA has designated
    EV corridors on approximately 59,000 miles of the NHS in 48 States
    plus DC. South Dakota and Mississippi are the only two states
    without an EV corridor designation.

-   The DOT also
    [issued](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors/resources/ev_funding_report_2021.pdf)
    a **new report** clarifying how its programs can be used for EV
    charging infrastructure. Many existing programs have this as an
    eligible use and this guidance can expand how many funded entities
    take advantage of that. This could increase the use for EV charging
    infrastructure of $41.9 billion in federal grant funding in 15
    specific programs.

**Technology and Business Model Innovation**

-   The Department of Energy announced [**new research funding
    opportunities**](https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/) on three EV
    charging related topics:
    -   **$10 million** to research, develop, and demonstrate innovative
        technologies and designs to significantly reduce the cost of
        electric vehicle supply equipment for DC Fast Charging that will
        be needed in large number to support high volumes of EVs.
    -   **$20 million** to accelerate the adoption of
        commercially-available plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and
        supporting infrastructure through community-based public-private
        partnerships that demonstrate PEV technologies (for cars, buses,
        school buses, trucks) and infrastructure in various innovative
        applications and share resulting data, lessons learned and best
        practices with a broader audience. Projects that demonstrate the
        ability to accelerate clean energy jobs or provide new electric
        transportation solutions to under-served communities are of
        interest.

    <!-- -->

    -   **$4 million** to encourage strong partnerships and new programs
        to increase workplace charging regionally or nationally which
        will help increase the feasibility of PEV ownership for
        consumers in underserved communities (e.g., demographics that
        currently have minimal access to home charging).
-   DOE and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) also announced
    a **national EV charging technical blueprint** including fast
    charging and grid interaction. This blueprint will assess needs in
    terms of connectivity, communication, protocols from utility down to
    vehicle, to support electrification of the full vehicle fleet.
-   DOE announced **that Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is partnering
    with global and domestic Automakers** to analyze anonymous vehicle
    charging data that describe market-level trends of operation and
    charging behavior for a large sample of U.S. consumer EVs. To guide
    this work, DOE, INL, and Automakers formed a working group to
    provide feedback on INL analysis and modeling efforts.

**<u>Progress on Federal Leadership</u>**

-   The Council on Environmental Quality and the General Services
    Administration are announcing early progress in response to the
    Executive Order directing the federal government to transition to a
    zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) fleet. Since inauguration day, the
    administration has acquired more ZEVs than in the whole previous
    fiscal year. Additionally, we are on track to triple the number of
    total ZEVs added to the fleet this year compared to last. Installing
    EV charging infrastructure at federal facilities is a key component
    of the transition to a zero-emission fleet.

These actions are a set of initial steps on the path the President’s
goal of a national network of 500,000 chargers to support convenient and
affordable travel by drivers of zero emission vehicles across the whole
country.
