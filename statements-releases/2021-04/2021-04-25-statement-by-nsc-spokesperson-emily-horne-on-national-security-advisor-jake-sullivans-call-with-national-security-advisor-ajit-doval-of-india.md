  \ Sullivan\u2019s Call with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval of\_India"
---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, expressing deep sympathy for the
people of India following the recent spike in COVID-19 cases. Mr.
Sullivan affirmed America’s solidarity with India, the two countries
with the greatest number of COVID-19 cases in the world. Building on the
seven-decade health partnership between the United States and
India —including battles against smallpox, polio, and HIV — they
resolved that India and the United States will continue to fight the
global COVID-19 pandemic together. Just as India sent assistance to the
United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the
United States is determined to help India in its time of need.

To this end, the United States is working around the clock to deploy
available resources and supplies. The United States has identified
sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian
manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made
available for India. To help treat COVID-19 patients and protect
front-line health workers in India, the United States has identified
supplies of therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators, and
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that will immediately be made
available for India. The United States also is pursuing options to
provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis. The
U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is funding a substantial
expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, the vaccine manufacturer
in India, enabling BioE to ramp up to produce at least 1 billion doses
of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022. Additionally, the United States
is deploying an expert team of public health advisors from the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) and USAID to work in close collaboration with
the U.S. Embassy, India’s health ministries, and India’s Epidemic
Intelligence Service staff. USAID will also quickly work with CDC to
support and fast-track the mobilization of emergency resources available
to India through the Global Fund.

The two National Security Advisors agreed that the U.S. and India would
stay in close touch in coming days.
