title: Statement of Vice President Harris on the Passing of Congressman Alcee Hastings
---
 
Congressman Alcee Hastings welcomed me to the Congressional Black Caucus
when I was still new to the Senate. He exuded the kind of warmth and
good humor that not only put me at ease, but encouraged me to speak my
mind. Since then, I’ve had the privilege of working with the Congressman
on a number of issues, and learning from his collaborative and candid
style of leadership.  
   
Born in the Jim Crow South, Congressman Hastings understood our
obligation to speak truth better than most. He began his career as a
civil rights lawyer in the 1960s, channeling his passion for justice
into the work of desegregating the public spaces of south Florida. As we
mourn his death, I am comforted that his commitment to public service
will serve as an example for generations to come.  
   
I am deeply saddened by his passing. Doug and I are thinking of the
Congressman’s family today.
