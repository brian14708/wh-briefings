title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Mass Shooting in Indianapolis,\_\
  Indiana"

Vice President Harris and I have been briefed by our homeland security
team on the mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, Indiana,
where a lone gunman murdered eight people and wounded several more in
the dark of night.   
   
Today’s briefing is just the latest in a string of tragedies, following
closely after gunmen firing bullets in broad day light at spas in and
around Atlanta, Georgia, a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, a home in
Rock Hill, South Carolina, and so many other shootings.   
   
While we await critical details about the shooting, its motivation, and
other key information, once again, I have the solemn duty of ordering
the flag lowered at half-staff at the White House, public buildings and
grounds, and military posts and embassies, just two weeks after I gave
the last such order.  
   
It’s a mass shooting just a week after we met, in the Rose Garden, with
families who lost children and dear friends as bullets pierced their
bodies and souls in schools, a night club, in a car at a gas station,
and a town meeting at a grocery store. And it came just the night before
14<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the shooting at Virginia Tech, in which a
gunman murdered 32 people.  
   
Last night and into the morning in Indianapolis, yet again families had
to wait to hear word about the fate of their loved ones. What a cruel
wait and fate that has become too normal and happens every day somewhere
in our nation.  
   
Gun violence is an epidemic in America. But we should not accept it. We
must act.  
   
Last week, I called on the Justice Department to better protect
Americans from gun violence.  I also urged Congress to hear the call of
the American people – including the vast majority of gun owners – to
enact commonsense gun violence prevention legislation, like universal
background checks and a ban of weapons of war and high-capacity
magazines.  
   
Too many Americans are dying every single day from gun violence. It
stains our character and pierces the very soul of our nation.  
   
We can, and must, do more to act and to save lives.  
   
God bless the eight fellow Americans we lost in Indianapolis and their
loved ones, and we pray for the wounded for their recovery.
