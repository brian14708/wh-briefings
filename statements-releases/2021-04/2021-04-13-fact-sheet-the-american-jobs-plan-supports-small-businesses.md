title: "FACT SHEET: The American Jobs Plan Supports Small\_Businesses"
---
 
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, many small businesses struggled to
grow and compete globally as a result of the U.S.’ aging infrastructure,
constrained workforce, and tax code that benefits large, multi-national
corporations. Prior to the pandemic, more than half of small business
owners said infrastructure investments are crucial to the success of
their business, 7 in 10 felt it was important for Congress to fund
broadband projects, and nearly two-thirds considered local roads and
bridges average, poor, or very poor quality.  
  
The American Jobs Plan will reduce small business shipping delays by
upgrading our nation’s transportation infrastructure; help “mom-and-pop”
shops reach new customers by providing universal broadband; and enable
Main Street win the 21<sup>st</sup> century by training American workers
for the jobs of the future.  
  
And, President Biden’s plan provides direct support to small businesses,
including by increasing access to federal contracts and investing more
than $110 billion in financing and technical assistance programs that
will benefit small businesses, including small manufacturers.

-   **Increase federal contracting opportunities for small
    businesses. **From fixing highways and rebuilding bridges to
    upgrading Veterans Affairs medical centers and rehabilitating other
    federal buildings, the President’s plan will mobilize small
    contractors to meet the great challenges of our time.
-   **Launch a historic effort to empower small business creation and
    expansion in underserved communities. **The American Jobs Plan will
    create a national network of small business incubators and
    innovation hubs to ensure all Americans have a fair shot at starting
    and growing their own business.
-   **Encourage small businesses – especially underserved small
    businesses – to fully engage in the innovation economy. **President
    Biden is calling on Congress to invest $5 billion in federal
    programs that empower small firms to participate in federal research
    and development initiatives that have the potential for
    commercialization.
-   **Help minority-owned manufacturing businesses access capital.** The
    American Jobs Plan will create a new grant program through the
    Minority Business Development Agency that will help small, Brown-
    and Black-owned manufacturers access private capital.
-   **Create a new financing facility for small
    manufacturers. **President Biden is calling on Congress to seed a
    new financing program to co-invest with private capital in the
    industrial base.
-   **Increase access to billions of dollars of lending and investment
    capital. **The American Jobs Plan will enable small businesses to
    drive the recovery by investing $15 billion in the Small Business
    Administration’s 7(a) loan program and $5 billion in the Small
    Business Investment Company program.
-   **Strengthen manufacturing supply chains and innovation
    ecosystems. **President Biden is also calling on Congress to bolster
    the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Manufacturing USA;
    create a new office to monitor industrial capacity and support the
    production of critical goods; and establish regional hubs to fuel
    technology development and create new businesses around the country.

Alongside his American Jobs Plan, President Biden is releasing a Made in
America Tax Plan that will help level the playing field between small
businesses and large, multinational corporations. President Biden’s plan
will reward investment at home and fundamentally shift how countries
around the world tax corporations so that big corporations can’t escape
or eliminate the taxes they owe by offshoring jobs and profits from the
United States and pay a lower tax rate than small businesses.
