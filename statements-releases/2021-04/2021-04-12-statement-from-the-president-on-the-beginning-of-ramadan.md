Jill and I send our warmest greetings and best wishes to Muslim
communities in the United States and around the world.  Ramadan Kareem.

As many of our fellow Americans begin fasting tomorrow, we are reminded
of how difficult this year has been.  In this pandemic, friends and
loved ones cannot yet gather together in celebration and congregation,
and far too many families will sit down for iftar with loved ones
missing.

Yet, our Muslim communities begin the month of revelation with renewed
hope. Many will focus on increasing their consciousness of the presence
of God in their lives, reaffirming their commitment to the service of
others that their faith compels, and expressing gratitude for the
blessings they enjoy—health, well-being, and life itself.

Muslim Americans have enriched our country since our founding.  They are
as diverse and vibrant as the America they have helped build. Today,
Muslims are leading in our efforts to fight COVID-19, playing a
pioneering role in vaccine development and serving as frontline health
care workers.  They are creating jobs as entrepreneurs and business
owners, risking their lives as first responders, teaching in our
schools, serving as dedicated public servants across the nation, and
playing a leading role in our ongoing struggle for racial equity and
social justice.  

But still, Muslim Americans continue to be targeted by bullying,
bigotry, and hate crimes.  This prejudice and these attacks are wrong. 
They are unacceptable.  And they must stop.  No one in America should
ever live in fear of expressing his or her faith.  And my administration
will work tirelessly to protect the rights and safety of all people.

On my first day as President, I was proud to end the shameful Muslim
travel ban, and I will continue to stand up for human rights everywhere,
including for Uyghurs in China, Rohingya in Burma, and Muslim
communities all over the world.

As we remember those who we have lost since last Ramadan, we are hopeful
for brighter days ahead.  The Holy Qur’an reminds us that “God is the
light of the heavens and earth,” who leads us out of darkness to the
light.  Although our White House festivities will be held virtually this
Ramadan, Jill and I look forward to resuming the traditional White House
Eid celebration in person next year, inshallah.  We wish your families
an inspiring and rewarding month.
