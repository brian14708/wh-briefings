title: "Statement by Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology\
  \ Anne Neuberger on SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange\_Incidents"
---
 
The Biden Administration convened two Unified Coordination Groups (UCGs)
to drive a whole of government response to the SolarWinds and Microsoft
Exchange incidents. Due to the vastly increased patching and reduction
in victims, we are standing down the current UCG surge efforts and will
be handling further responses through standard incident management
procedures. 

The innovations from the Exchange UCG and the lessons learned from these
responses will be used to improve future unified, whole of Government
responses to significant cyber incidents, including:

-   Integrating private sector partners at the executive and tactical
    levels. The active private sector involvement resulted in an
    expedited Microsoft one-click tool to simplify and accelerate
    victims’ patching and clean-up efforts, and direct sharing of
    relevant information. This type of partnership sets precedent for
    future engagements on significant cyber incidents.
-   CISA created and utilized a methodology to track trends in patching
    and exposed Exchange servers that enabled the UCG to quantify the
    scope of the incident.
-   Through industry relationships and leveraging legal authorities, the
    FBI and DOJ quickly identified the scale of the incidents – in the
    SolarWinds UCG, for example, scoping from a worst case of 16,800 to
    fewer than 100 targeted exploited nongovernment entities. This
    enabled focused victim engagement and improved understanding of what
    the perpetrators targeted from the larger set of exposed entities.
-   NSA and CISA released cybersecurity advisories that detailed
    adversary techniques and provided mitigation for system owners. NSA
    also provided guidance to other U.S. military and intelligence
    organizations, as well as contractors in the defense industrial
    base. 

The Biden Administration is undertaking a whole-of-government effort –
working closely with Congress, the private sector, and allies and
partners around the world – to build back better in new and innovative
ways, to modernize our cyber defenses and enhance the nation’s ability
to quickly and effectively respond to significant cybersecurity
incidents. While this will not be the last major incident, the
SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange UCGs highlight the priority and focus
the Administration places on cybersecurity, and at improving incident
response for both the U.S. government and the private sector.
