  \ Organizing and\_Empowerment"

Today, President Biden will sign an Executive Order establishing the
White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment. The Task
Force will be dedicated to mobilizing the federal government’s policies,
programs, and practices to empower workers to organize and successfully
bargain with their employers. Chaired by Vice-President Kamala Harris
and Vice-Chaired by Secretary Marty Walsh, the Task Force will include
more than twenty cabinet members and heads of other federal agencies who
will take a whole-of-government approach to empower workers.  
  
***Background***  
  
President Biden and Vice-President Harris have long championed workers’
rights. As the President has said: America was built by the middle
class, and unions built the middle class. Throughout our country’s
history, unions have been the driving forces for advancements in
workers’ rights and improved living standards for union and non-union
workers. They have fought for higher wages, greater job security, safety
and health laws, essential benefits like health insurance and retirement
plans, and protections from discrimination and sexual harassment for
millions of workers across the country. [Sixteen
million](https://www.epi.org/publication/how-todays-unions-help-working-people-giving-workers-the-power-to-improve-their-jobs-and-unrig-the-economy/) workers
in the United States are union members or in a job that provides them
union representation. More than [six in
ten](https://www.epi.org/publication/how-todays-unions-help-working-people-giving-workers-the-power-to-improve-their-jobs-and-unrig-the-economy/) of
those workers are women and/or people of color. [Union workers earn
roughly 13% more than non-union
workers](https://www.epi.org/publication/how-todays-unions-help-working-people-giving-workers-the-power-to-improve-their-jobs-and-unrig-the-economy/) on
a similar job site. They also experience drastically lower rates of
labor standards violations, like employers wage theft or workplace
safety and health hazards.  
  
Despite the importance of unions to our economy and democracy, and
nearly [60 million
workers](https://iwer.mit.edu/2018/08/30/who-wants-to-join-a-union-a-growing-number-of-americans/) today
saying they would join a union if given the chance, American workers
have faced increasing barriers to organizing and bargaining collectively
with their employers. Economic change in the United States and globally,
technological developments, and the failure to modernize federal
organizing and labor-management relations laws so they respond
appropriately to the reality found in American workplaces have made
worker organizing exceedingly difficult. The result has been a steady
decline in union membership in the United States over past decades. In
2020, union members made up
just [10.8%](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm) of the
U.S. workforce, down from more than 30% in the 1950s.  
  
***The President’s and Vice-President’s Commitment***  
  
The President and Vice President believe that the decline of union
membership is contributing to serious societal and economic problems in
our country. Widespread and deep economic inequality, stagnant real
wages, and the shrinking of America’s middle class are all associated
with the [declining percentage of workers represented by
unions](https://www.epi.org/publication/ib342-unions-inequality-faltering-middle-class/).
In addition, lower union membership rates have exacerbated the [pay gap
for women and workers of
color](https://www.epi.org/blog/unions-help-narrow-the-gender-wage-gap/).
The decline of union density has also weakened our democracy. Unions
ensure workers’ voices are heard in their workplaces, communities, and
government.  
  
The Administration has already taken a number of steps to empower
workers to organize. It has [endorsed the Protecting the Rights to
Organize (PRO)
Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/09/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-house-taking-up-the-pro-act/) and
other labor law reform bills, issued Executive Orders restoring
collective bargaining in the federal sector, and rescued the hard-earned
pensions for millions of Americans through the American Rescue Plan.
There is still much more the federal government can do to empower
workers. The Task Force is the next step in these efforts.  
  
***Putting the Policy of the U.S. Government into Action: Task Force on
Worker Organizing and Empowerment***  
  
Since 1935, when the National Labor Relations Act was enacted, the
policy of the federal government has been to *<u>encourage</u>* worker
organizing and collective bargaining, not to merely allow or tolerate
them. In the 86 years since the Act was passed, the federal government
has never fully implemented this policy. While some administrations have
taken selected actions to strengthen workers’ rights, no previous
administration has taken a comprehensive approach to determining how the
executive branch can advance worker organizing and collective
bargaining.  
  
That is why, today, the President is establishing the White House Task
Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment (“Task Force”). The mission
of the Task Force will be to mobilize the federal government’s policies,
programs, and practices to empower workers to organize and successfully
bargain with their employers. This mission includes looking for ways to
increase worker power in areas of the country with restrictive labor
laws, for marginalized workers including women and people of color, and
for workers in industries that are difficult to organize and lack labor
protections.  
  
The President’s Executive Order directs the Task Force to make a set of
recommendations within 180 days addressing two key issues. First, how
can *existing* policies, programs, and practices be used to promote
worker organizing and collective bargaining in the federal government?
And second, where are *new *policies needed to achieve the Task Force’s
mission and what are the associated regulatory and statutory changes
needed?  
  
Vice President Kamala Harris will serve as the Task Force’s Chair and
Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh will serve as the Vice-Chair. The Task
Force will be comprised of more than twenty cabinet members and heads of
other federal agencies that have powerful levers to help the Task Force
carry out its mission. The Task Force will engage with a diverse set of
leaders in the labor movement, academia, advocacy groups, and beyond to
seek ideas for potential federal action and feedback on initiatives
under consideration.  
  
The Task Force will be a historic effort to put the federal government’s
policy of encouraging worker organizing and collective bargaining into
action. The Task Force will endeavor to achieve the following four
goals:

1.  **Lead by example **by ensuring that the federal government is a
    model employer with respect to encouraging worker organizing and
    collective bargaining among its workforce.
2.  **Facilitate worker organizing across the country** by taking an
    all-of-government approach to mobilize the federal government’s
    policies, programs, and practices to provide workers the opportunity
    to organize and bargain collectively.
3.  **Increase worker power in underserved communities **by examining
    and seeking to address the particular challenges to worker
    organizing in jurisdictions with restrictive labor laws; the added
    challenges that marginalized workers in many communities encounter,
    including women and people of color; and the heightened barriers to
    organizing workers in certain industries.
4.  **Increase union membership **across the United States to grow a
    more inclusive middle class and provide workers the opportunity to
    come together for the purpose of mutual advancement, the dignity of
    worker and workers, respect, and the fair compensation they deserve.
