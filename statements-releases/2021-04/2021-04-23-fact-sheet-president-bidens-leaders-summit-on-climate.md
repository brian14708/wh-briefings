title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Leaders Summit on\_Climate"
---
 
On Day One, President Biden fulfilled his commitment to rejoin the Paris
Agreement. Days later, he took executive actions to ensure we tackle the
climate crisis at home and abroad – all while creating jobs and
strengthening our economy. This week, he held a historic summit with 40
world leaders to show that America is back.

Over the course of two days and eight sessions, President Biden convened
heads of state and government, as well as leaders and representatives
from international organizations, businesses, subnational governments,
and indigenous communities to rally the world in tackling the climate
crisis, demonstrate the economic opportunities of the future, and affirm
the need for unprecedented global cooperation and ambition to meet the
moment.

On the first day of the summit, President Biden upped the ante. He
announced the United States will target reducing emissions by 50-52
percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. He underscored America’s
commitment to leading a clean energy revolution and creating
good-paying, union jobs – noting that the countries that take decisive
action now will reap the economic benefits of the future.

In the United States, the Biden-Harris Administration has mobilized a
whole-of-government approach to unleash economic opportunities, create
good jobs, and advance environmental justice. From the national to the
local level and across all agencies, the federal government is not only
working to help those hit hardest by climate impacts, but also creating
a more resilient, equitable, and prosperous future.

While the Biden-Harris Administration has committed itself to addressing
the climate crisis, countries across the globe must also step up. Given
that more than 85 percent of emissions come from beyond U.S. borders,
domestic action must go hand in hand with international leadership. All
countries – and particularly the major economies – must do more to bend
the curve on global emissions so as to keep a 1.5 degree C limit on
global average temperature rise within reach. President Biden’s Leaders
Summit helped ensure the international community is working together to
tackle the climate crisis and support the most vulnerable. Together with
the new United States 2030 target along with those announced in the
run-up to and at the summit, more than half of the world’s economy is
now committed to the pace of action we need to limit warming to 1.5
degree C. And this coalition is growing.

President Biden convened the U.S.-led Major Economies Forum (MEF) on
Energy and Climate, a group the United States first convened during the
George W. Bush Administration. Together, the 17 MEF economies are
responsible for approximately 80 percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions and global GDP. At the Summit, alongside the United States,
the other MEF participants committed to take the necessary steps to set
the world up for success in this decisive decade. The heads of state and
leaders of the MEF participants were also joined by the leaders of
countries that are especially vulnerable to climate impacts, as well as
countries charting innovative pathways to a net-zero economy. Business
leaders, innovators, local officials, and indigenous and youth
representatives participated in the summit, sharing their insights and
planned contributions to help tackle the climate crisis.

For our part, the United States is leading the way with a range of bold
new commitments across the federal government that demonstrate its
leadership, create jobs, rally the rest of the world to step up,
mobilize finance, spur transformational innovations, conserve nature,
build resilience, strengthen adaptation and drive economic growth for
communities. U.S. commitments include:

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Enhancing climate ambition
and enabling the transformations required to reach net-zero emissions by
2050.</span>** President Biden is galvanizing efforts by the world’s
major economies to reduce emissions during this critical period. From
reducing short-lived climate pollutants and supporting the most
vulnerable to investing in nature-based solutions, these
transformational changes are critical to keep a 1.5 degree C limit on
global average temperature rise within reach. Just as importantly, they
will create new, good-paying jobs today to drive tomorrow’s economy.  
  
**The Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government approach** is
ensuring that climate considerations are incorporated across U.S.
engagements both at home and abroad. Some of the initiatives that were
announced today include:

-   ***Launching a Global Climate Ambition Initiative***. The U.S.
    government will support developing countries in establishing
    net-zero strategies, implementing their nationally determined
    contributions and national adaptation strategies, and reporting on
    their progress under the Paris Agreement. The Department of State
    and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), working
    with other agencies, will coordinate U.S. government efforts to
    support countries around the world to enhance and meet their climate
    goals in ways that further their national development priorities. We
    will engage strategically with governments, the private sector,
    civil society, and communities to support transformational policies
    and programs, build human and institutional capacity, and create
    momentum toward a zero-emissions, climate-resilient future.
-   ***Setting ambitious benchmarks for climate investments at DFC****.*
    The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is
    committing to achieve a net zero investment portfolio by 2040, the
    earliest target of any G7 or G20 development finance institution
    (DFI), and to make at least one-third of all its new investments
    have a climate nexus beginning in FY 2023. DFC will make climate
    issues central to its development strategy for the first time and
    bring all of its tools to bear to ensure a just transition that
    supports sustainable economic growth in developing countries.
    Working with the Rockefeller Foundation, DFC will support
    distributed renewable energy and other innovative climate
    investments to benefit millions worldwide. It has released a rolling
    call for proposals for climate investment funds, is bringing onboard
    its first Chief Climate Officer, and has established a $50 million
    climate technical assistance facility. These pioneering goals are
    unique among its peer institutions, and DFC will collaborate with
    other DFIs and encourage them to raise their own ambitions.
-   ***Committing to climate investments at MCC.*** The Millennium
    Challenge Corporation (MCC) will expand and deepen work to address
    climate change challenges across its investment portfolio and
    business operations—investing in climate-smart development and
    sustainable infrastructure. Over the next five years, MCC commits
    that more than 50 percent of its program funding will go to
    climate-related investments. MCC will promote low-carbon economic
    development, help countries transition away from fossil fuels, and
    maintain a coal-free policy across its portfolio of grants.
-   ***Launching a Greening Government Initiative*.** The Greening
    Government Initiative launch marks the first international convening
    on greening national plans for sustainable government operations.
    Co-chaired by Canada and the United States, GGI countries seek to
    lead by example in developing and implementing climate action plans
    that increase the resilience of and mitigate emissions from national
    government operations and real property. Through coordinating our
    national priorities and collaborating on common goals, we hope to
    foster and inspire a global “race to the top” of government efforts
    toward achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. The United
    States and Canada will lead this initiative through cooperation in
    the management of national government procurement and real property,
    helping both nations achieve their individual goals of a net-zero
    emissions economy, 100 percent clean electricity usage, and a
    zero-emissions vehicle fleet.

**<u>Mobilizing financing to drive the net-zero transition and adapt to
climate change</u>.** Finance plays a vital role in accelerating the
transition to a clean energy economy and building a climate-resilient
future. Current financial flows are inadequate for addressing the scale
of the climate crisis. Through President Biden’s international climate
finance plan, the U.S. government will make strategic use of
multilateral and bilateral channels and institutions to assist
developing countries in implementing ambitious emissions reduction
measures, protect critical ecosystems, build resilience against the
impacts of climate change, and promote the flow of capital toward
climate-aligned investments and away from high-carbon investments. To
more effectively mobilize public and private finance to address the
climate crisis, the United States announced it is:

-   ***Scaling up international financing to address climate needs.***
    The United States intends to double by 2024 our annual public
    climate finance to developing countries relative to the average
    level during the second half of the Obama-Biden Administration (FY
    2013-2016). As part of this goal, the United States intends to
    triple its adaptation finance by 2024. The Biden Administration will
    work closely with Congress to meet these goals.
-   ***Issuing the first U.S. International Climate Finance Plan.*** The
    United States is publishing its first-ever U.S. international
    climate finance plan, which lays out how federal agencies and
    departments responsible for international climate finance will work
    together to deliver that finance more efficiently and with greater
    impact.
-   ***Launching an international dialogue on decreasing fiscal climate
    risk through national budgets.*** Earlier this month, the United
    States announced a more than $14 billion increase in the President’s
    Budget over FY 2021 enacted levels across the entire government to
    tackle the climate crisis, the largest in history. The United States
    is launching an international dialogue on aligning the budget with
    climate risks and opportunities. The dialogue will build both on
    U.S. leadership in climate budgeting and assessing climate risk and
    on the pioneering work already being done in multilateral fora. The
    United States will engage with participating countries through
    bilateral and multilateral channels to collaborate on cost-effective
    strategies across participating countries to increase climate
    investments while creating good-paying jobs. The dialogue will also
    explore how to improve climate risk analysis in national operations
    that could help countries optimize and expand investments in
    adaptation and reduce national exposure to the impacts of climate
    change.

**<u>Transforming energy systems</u>.** The potential of solar energy,
wind power, and electricity storage technologies has improved
dramatically over the past few years. But we need to go further and
faster. To support accelerated action, new commitments include:

-   ***Establishing a Net-**Zero*** ***Producers Forum***. In support of
    efforts to achieve net-zero emissions by midcentury, the United
    States, together with the energy ministries from Canada, Norway,
    Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, representing 40 percent of global oil and
    gas production, established a cooperative forum that will create
    pragmatic net-zero strategies, including methane abatement,
    advancing the circular carbon economy approach, development and
    deployment of clean-energy and carbon capture and storage
    technologies, diversification from reliance on hydrocarbon revenues,
    and other measures in line with each country’s national
    circumstances.
-   ***Establishing a U.S.-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030
    Partnership***. The United States is working with allies and
    partners around the world to set ambitious 2030 targets for climate
    action and clean energy innovation and deployment. The U.S.-India
    Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership will elevate
    ambitious climate action as a core theme of U.S.-India collaboration
    and support the achievement of India’s ambitious targets, including
    reaching 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. The Partnership will
    aim to mobilize finance and speed clean energy deployment;
    demonstrate and scale innovative clean technologies needed to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions across sectors including industry,
    transportation, power, and buildings; and build capacity to measure,
    manage, and adapt to the risks of climate-related impacts.
-   ***Supporting ambitious renewable energy goals and pathways in Latin
    America and the Caribbean***. The Department of State announced
    scaled-up technical assistance to countries participating in the
    Renewable Energy for Latin America and the Caribbean (RELAC)
    initiative, a regional effort led by Colombia, Chile, and Costa Rica
    to increase renewable energy capacity to at least 70 percent
    by 2030. Expanded U.S. support through the Low Emission Development
    Strategies Global Partnership and the U.S. National Renewable Energy
    Laboratory will center on peer learning and training on policies
    and technical measures for achieving high levels of renewable energy
    grid integration. U.S. support to enable current RELAC countries and
    motivate additional countries to join RELAC will be delivered in
    cooperation with the InterAmerican Development Bank, the Latin
    American Energy Organization (OLADE), and the Global Power System
    Transformation Consortium.
-   ***Supporting clean energy mineral supply chains.*** The Energy
    Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI) is a multinational effort
    founded by Australia, Botswana, Canada, Peru, and the United States
    to help build sustainable supply chains and promote sound sector
    governance for the minerals vital to technologies powering the
    energy transition, such as solar panels, electric vehicles, and
    battery storage. The United States has committed more than $10.5
    million in bilateral technical assistance in support of ERGI
    principles in more than ten countries around the world. The
    Initiative’s focus is now expanding to include greening mining
    operations, as well as re-use and recycling of key minerals and
    metals. The United States will also join the Intergovernmental Forum
    on Mining in support of international cooperation on the minerals
    and metals that make the renewable energy transition possible.

**<u>Revitalizing the transport sector</u>.** The transformation of the
transport sector offers some of the biggest opportunities for deep
emissions cuts, new jobs, and healthier cities. To jump-start this
revolution, the United States is committing to:                         
                                                             

-   ***Sparking*** ***the zero-emission transportation revolution – at
    home and abroad.*** The Department of Transportation (DOT) is taking
    a comprehensive approach to addressing the climate crisis and
    expanding ways for all modes of transportation to transition to zero
    emissions. This includes funding for lower-emission buses, expanding
    access to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, using our public
    rights of way in climate-supportive ways, and working with partners
    around the world bilaterally, regionally, and in multilateral fora
    to help catalyze the transition to zero-emitting transportation as
    swiftly as possible.
-   ***Joining the Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council***. The
    United States will join a coalition of governments representing more
    than half of new vehicle sales globally that is dedicated to
    accelerating the global transition to zero emission vehicles.
-   ***Reducing emissions from international shipping.*** The
    international shipping sector contributes approximately three
    percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the sector’s
    emissions are only projected to increase. In support of the global
    effort to keep within reach a 1.5 degree C limit on global average
    temperature increase, and in support of global efforts to achieve
    net-zero GHG emissions no later than 2050, the United States is
    committing to work with countries in the International Maritime
    Organization (IMO) to adopt a goal of achieving zero emissions from
    international shipping by 2050 and to adopt ambitious measures that
    will place the sector on a pathway to achieve this goal.
-   ***Reducing*** ***emissions from international aviation.*** The
    United States is committed to working with other countries on a
    vision toward reducing the aviation sector’s emissions in a manner
    consistent with the goal of net-zero emissions for our economy by
    2050, as well as on robust standards that integrate climate
    protection and safety. The United States intends to advance the
    development and deployment of high integrity sustainable aviation
    fuels and other clean technologies that meet rigorous international
    standards, building on existing partnerships, such as through
    ASCENT– the Aviation Sustainability Center – and pursue policies to
    increase the supply and demand of sustainable aviation fuels. In the
    International Civil Aviation Organization, we will engage in
    processes to advance a new long-term aspirational goal in line with
    our vision for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation
    sector, and continue to participate in the Carbon Offsetting and
    Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

**<u>Building workforces for the future and ensuring U.S.
competitiveness</u>.** Climate action is an opportunity to spur job
creation while enabling all communities and workers to benefit from the
clean energy economy. To create opportunities for American-made
solutions to tackle the climate crisis abroad, the United States is
announcing new commitments to:

-   ***Launching a Global Partnership for Climate-Smart
    Infrastructure.*** The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)
    will launch the Global Partnership to connect U.S. industry to major
    energy and transportation infrastructure investments in emerging
    markets. This initiative will support the rebuilding of the U.S.
    middle class through the export of U.S.-manufactured goods and

    infrastructure development for our partners and allies globally. The
    Global Climate-Smart Infrastructure Partnership will leverage
    USTDA’s project preparation and partnership-building tools to
    support the use of U.S. technologies and services in overseas
    climate-smart infrastructure projects.
-   ***Creating the EXIM Chairman’s Council on Climate*.** The U.S.
    Export-Import Bank (EXIM) will create a Chairman’s Council on
    Climate, a sub-committee of EXIM’s Advisory Committee dedicated to
    advising EXIM on how to better support U.S. exporters in clean
    energy, foster the transition to a low-carbon economy, and create
    clean U.S. jobs at home. Membership will be comprised of a wide
    range of representatives which could include, for example, members
    of U.S. industry, the financial sector, trade associations, labor,
    academia, think tanks, and civil society organizations. EXIM will
    open applications to the public in summer 2021.
-   ***Supporting workers and communities in the shift to a global clean
    energy future.*** As the United States moves towards a clean energy
    economy, it is committed to helping energy workers and communities
    address the challenges and equitably capitalize on the opportunities
    associated with this transition. The U.S. Secretary of Energy
    convened the energy ministers of Canada, India, and the European
    Commission, along with representatives from the labor and advocacy
    communities, to begin a discussion on global efforts to address this
    critical issue. To continue the dialogue, the Department of Energy
    announced that it is joining Canada, the European Union, and Chile
    to launch the Empowering People initiative at the Clean Energy
    Ministerial this June.

**<u>Promoting innovation to bring clean technologies to scale</u>.**
Innovation will spur the technology and transformations necessary to
reduce emissions and adapt to climate change at scale, while also
creating enormous new economic opportunities to build the industries of
the future. To build the future we want, the United States announced:

-   ***Clean energy innovation and manufacturing.*** The United States

    partner countries to benefit from advanced nuclear technologies and
    meet their clean energy goals under the highest standards of nuclear
    security, safety, and nonproliferation.

**<u>Providing urgent support for vulnerable countries to adapt and
build resilience to the climate crisis</u>.** The climate crisis is
already posing challenges to communities at home and around the world.
Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change each year when
agriculture fields are flooded, wildfires destroy neighborhoods, and
storms knock out power. Communities of color and low-income communities
around the country are particularly vulnerable to climate change.
Abroad, many vulnerable countries already are facing catastrophic
climate impacts. They must build their resilience to the climate crisis
now. To strengthen our capacity to help people, reduce future risks and
improve resilience, the United States is announcing it is:

-   ***Supporting environmental*** ***justice and climate
    resilience****.* EPA will fund $1 million in grants/cooperative
    agreements through the Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC)
    to work with underserved and vulnerable communities, including
    indigenous communities, in Canada, Mexico, and the United States to
    prepare them for climate-related impacts. This initiative will
    provide funding directly to community-based organizations to help
    them develop community-driven solutions to the challenges of climate
    change. These projects could involve vulnerable communities
    converting workers to clean jobs, addressing extreme weather
    impacts, transitioning to clean energy and/or transportation, or
    utilizing traditional ecological knowledge. Following a competitive
    process, the most innovative and impactful projects will be approved
    by consensus by the environment ministers of the three
    countries. The United States currently chairs the CEC Council.
-   ***Partnering with islands to lead on climate and energy
    resilience***. The United States is committed to partnering with
    small islands in their efforts to combat the climate crisis in ways
    that reflect their unique cultures and development challenges by
    building resilience in the face of a changing climate. Working
    together, the Department of State, the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Department of Energy (DOE),
    and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will
    launch a new partnership to advance the inclusion of locally
    generated climate information, knowledge, data and decision support
    tools in ongoing and emerging sustainability and resilience
    endeavors in island regions. The Department of State will support a
    unique island-led partnership, the **Local2030 Island Network**,
    which links U.S. island jurisdictions with those around the world in
    developing common solutions in a shared cultural context. NOAA will
    work with this network and other partners to enhance the capacity of
    island nations to integrate climate data and information, and it
    will apply effective coastal and marine resource management
    strategies to support sustainable development. DOE will launch the
    **Energy Transitions Initiative – Global**, which will focus on
    transforming the energy systems of and increasing resilience for
    islands and remote communities, starting in the Caribbean and
    Asia-Pacific and growing to include other vulnerable communities.
    USAID, through the **Pacific Climate Ready** project and the
    **Caribbean Energy and Resilience** initiatives, will support small
    island developing states to strengthen their systems and capacities
    to become more climate resilient in ways that are country-driven,
    coordinated, inclusive, and equitable.
-   ***Reducing black carbon by investing in clean cookstoves*.**
    Household energy emissions have a significant impact on the climate,
    environment, human health, gender, and livelihoods. In addition, the
    reduction of short-lived climate pollutants, such as methane and
    black carbon, can in the short term contribute significantly to
    keeping a 1.5 degree C limit on global average temperature rise
    within reach. Given the urgent need for tangible, ambitious, and
    global action, the U.S. government is announcing that it is resuming
    and strengthening its commitment to the United Nations Foundation’s
    Clean Cooking Alliance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) will work with the Clean Cooking Alliance, other governments,
    and partners to reduce emissions from home cooking and heating that
    contribute to climate change and also directly affect the health and
    livelihoods of almost 40 percent of the world’s population.
-   ***Mitigating black carbon health impacts in Indigenous Arctic
    communities****.* EPA, working through our partners in the Arctic
    Council, is pleased to announce the Black Carbon Health in
    Indigenous Arctic Communities project to be implemented by the Aleut
    International Association. Indigenous Arctic communities need tools
    to understand their exposure to black carbon emissions, to help them
    identify significant local sources, and to share best practices for
    preventing and mitigating the health impacts of air pollution and
    climate. The project will help these communities measure, analyze,
    and addresses black carbon exposure and strengthen their capacity to
    develop and promote black carbon mitigation strategies.

**<u>Implementing nature-based solutions</u>.** Nature is a critical
part of reaching net-zero emissions and enhancing community resilience.
The world’s ocean and forests are critical carbon sinks and a source of
life and livelihoods. Recognizing nature’s vital role, the United States
is announcing new resources and support for:

-   ***Investing in tropical forests to drive towards a net-zero
    world.*** Halting deforestation globally, and restoring forests and
    other ecosystems, is critical to reaching a net-zero emissions world
    by 2050. The United States is joining together with other
    governments and private sector companies today to announce the
    Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition.
    The LEAF Coalition expects to mobilize at least $1 billion this year
    to incentivize tropical and subtropical countries in reducing
    emissions from forests by paying for verified emissions reductions
    that meet a high environmental and social standard. This is a
    crucial component to raising global climate ambition and to halting
    and reversing deforestation by 2030.
-   ***Funding nature-based approaches to coastal community and
    ecosystem resilience.*** The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA), the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation,
    and additional governmental and private partners will provide $34
    million for nature-based approaches through the National Coastal
    Resilience Fund. These projects will advance restoration or
    enhancement of natural features, such as coastal wetlands, dunes,
    and coral reefs, to protect coastal communities and infrastructure
    from flooding, while also improving habitat for fish and wildlife.
    NOAA and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation commit to
    advancing the science and practice of implementing nature-based
    approaches to coastal resilience with international communities of
    practice by participating in exchanges and dialogues to share the
    lessons and innovations learned from these projects. The U.S. Fish
    and Wildlife Service and its partners will also provide $78 million
    in grants to help conserve or restore nearly 500,000 acres of
    wetlands in Canada, Mexico, and the United States through the
    Migratory Bird Conservation Commission.
-   ***Promoting resilience in the Southern Ocean*.** The United States
    is supporting the three marine protected area proposals in the
    Southern Ocean before the Commission for the Conservation of
    Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). These unique areas are
    vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and they must be
    protected. The United States is calling on all CCAMLR members to
    adopt these marine protected areas at this year’s meeting.

**<u>Promoting safety and security at home and abroad</u>.** Climate
change has been identified by the Department of Defense (DoD) as a
critical national security threat and threat multiplier. As a result,
DoD has undertaken assessments of the impacts that the climate crisis
has on American military instillations. Today the United States is
announcing:

-   ***Conducting climate exposure assessments on all U.S.
    installations****.* The DoD is announcing a plan to complete climate
    exposure assessments on all major U.S. installations within 12
    months and all major installations outside the continental U.S.
    within 24 months using the Defense Climate Assessment Tool (DCAT).
    The DCAT helps identify the climate hazards to which DoD
    installations are most exposed, which is the first step in
    addressing the potential physical harm, security impacts, and
    degradation in readiness resulting from global climate change.
-   ***Supporting*** ***assessments in partner countries around the
    world.*** The DoD is also announcing its commitment to share the
    DCAT with a number of attending allied partners and militaries.

**<u>Supporting action at every level</u>.** Fully addressing the
climate crisis requires an all-of-society response. President Biden is
committed to working with sub-national actors, business, civil society,
indigenous communities, and youth to facilitate collective ambitious
action that yields lasting results.

-   ***Advancing subnational and non-state engagement abroad****.* The
    United States will step up engagement with subnational governments
    and non-state actors around the world to accelerate climate action.
    It will also partner with U.S. cities, states, territories, and
    Tribes in the context of its diplomatic outreach globally,
    supporting their engagement at UN Climate Change summits and working
    with other countries to elevate similar efforts.
-   ***Catalyzing subnational action and participation in COP26***. The
    United States endorses Race To Zero, a global campaign for net-zero
    targets from businesses, cities, and regions, and will work to seek
    additional U.S participants. The United States also announced an
    intent to commission analysis of the emission reduction potential
    from subnational leadership worldwide and to work with national and
    subnational partners globally to achieve this potential.

Today’s announcements are additional steps in the Biden-Harris
Administration’s work to advance an unprecedented whole-of-government
response to climate change while creating good-paying, union jobs and
advancing environmental justice. On his first day in office, President
Biden fulfilled his promise to rejoin the Paris Agreement, and one week
later he signed an [Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at
Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/).
As part of this Order, the President charged federal agencies to take a
comprehensive approach to addressing the climate crisis. From reducing
emissions to advancing a just transition, the Biden-Harris
Administration is committed to working hand in hand with international
leaders, civil society, businesses, and communities and getting
countries around the world to step up and meet this global challenge.
