title: Statement of President Joe Biden on the Passing of Michael Collins
---
 
Michael Collins lived a life of service to our country. From his time in
the Air Force, to his career with NASA, to his service at the State
Department, to his leadership of the Smithsonian National Air and Space
Museum; Michael Collins both wrote and helped tell the story of our
nation’s remarkable accomplishments in space.

Many remember him as the astronaut who was by himself, orbiting the Moon
as Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong walked on the lunar surface. He may
not have received equal glory, but he was an equal partner, reminding
our nation about the importance of collaboration in service of great
goals. From his vantage point high above the Earth, he reminded us of
the fragility of our own planet, and called on us to care for it like
the treasure it is.

Although, in his life of accomplishment, he earned many titles and
achieved the rank of general, he demanded that everyone call him,
simply, Mike.

Our prayers are with General Collins’ family.  Godspeed, Mike.
