This notification is provided consistent with Section 1264(b) of the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018, as
amended (50 U.S.C. § 1549).<sup>1</sup> It provides notice of a change
in the legal and policy frameworks since the last annual “Report on the
Legal and Policy Frameworks Guiding the United States’ Use of Military
Force and Related National Security Operations,” which President Trump
submitted to the appropriate congressional committees on October 16,
2020.<sup>2</sup>

On January 20, 2021, as clarified on February 19, 2021, the President
established new interim guidance concerning the United States’ use of
military force and related national security operations. The
justification for the issuance of the interim guidance is to ensure the
President has full visibility on proposed significant actions in these
areas while the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
coordinates interagency reviews of the extant authorizations and
delegations of Presidential authority with respect to these matters.

<sup>1</sup> Section 1264, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2018, Pub L. No. 115-91 (2017), as amended by Section 1261,
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, Pub. L. No.
116-92 (2019).
