title: "FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Issues an Executive Order\
  \ to Raise the Minimum Wage to $15 for Federal Contractors"
---
 
Today, President Biden is issuing an executive order requiring federal
contractors to pay a $15 minimum wage to hundreds of thousands of
workers who are working on federal contracts. These workers are critical
to the functioning of the federal government: from cleaning
professionals and maintenance workers who ensure federal employees have
safe and clean places to work, to nursing assistants who care for the
nation’s veterans, to cafeteria and other food service workers who
ensure military members have healthy and nutritious food to eat, to
laborers who build and repair federal infrastructure.  
  
This executive order will:

-   **Increase the hourly minimum wage for federal contractors to $15.**
    Starting January 30, 2022 all agencies will need to incorporate a
    $15 minimum wage in new contract solicitations, and by March 30,
    2022, all agencies will need to implement the minimum wage into new
    contracts.  Agencies must also implement the higher wage into
    existing contracts when the parties exercise their option to extend
    such contracts, which often occurs annually.
-   **Continue to index the minimum wage to an inflation measure** so
    that every year after 2022 it will be automatically adjusted to
    reflect changes in the cost of living.
-   **Eliminate the tipped minimum wage for federal contractors by
    2024**. Federal statute allows employers of tipped workers to pay a
    sub-minimum wage as long as their tips bring their wage up to the
    level of the minimum wage. The Obama-Biden executive order raised
    the wages for tipped workers, but didn’t completely phaseout the
    subminimum wage for these workers. This executive order finishes
    that work and ensures tipped employees working on federal contracts
    will earn the same minimum wage as other employees on federal
    contracts.
-   **Ensure a $15 minimum wage for federal contract workers with
    disabilities.** To ensure equity, [similar

    the Obama-Biden minimum wage executive order for federal
    contractors, this executive order extends the required $15 minimum
    wage to federal contract workers with disabilities.
-   **Restore minimum wage protections to outfitters and guides
    operating on federal** **lands** by revoking President Trump’s
    executive order 13838 “Exemption From Executive Order 13658 for
    Recreational Services on Federal Lands.”

This order will build on the Obama-Biden Executive Order 13658, issued
in February 2014, requiring federal contractors to pay employees working
on with federal contracts $10.10 per hour, subsequently indexed to
inflation. The minimum wage for workers performing work on covered
federal contracts is currently $10.95 per hour and tipped minimum wage
is $7.65 per hour.  

This executive order will promote economy and efficiency in federal
contracting, providing value for taxpayers by enhancing worker
[productivity](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nataliaemanuel/files/emanuel_jmp.pdf)
and generating higher-quality work by boosting workers’ health, morale,
and effort. It will reduce
[turnover](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/685449),
allowing employers to retain top talent and lower the costs associated
with recruitment and training. It will reduce
 [absenteeism](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0b73b6f0), a change that
has been linked to higher
[productivity](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/666537?casa_token=fUO9yXdH3JkAAAAA:2zo36QMx-DSfspgXhpt-ab-CAs20GMEWZsXedeTZ3ANCXGTJJ_bvbJhtH3L66kohVGYyIGkvasg),
not just by the employees who are more present, but by their
[co-workers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13561-016-0138-y),
too. And, it will reduce [supervisory
costs](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/19628/). [One recent
study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nataliaemanuel/files/emanuel_jmp.pdf)
focusing on warehouse workers and customer service representatives at an
online retailer found that raising hourly wages by $1 yields a return of
approximately $1.50 through increased productivity and reduced costs. As
a result of raising the minimum wage, the federal government’s work will
be done better and faster. 

At the same time, the executive order ensures that hundreds of thousands
of workers no longer have to work full time and still live in poverty.
It will improve the economic security of families and make progress
toward reversing decades of income inequality. Extensive, high-quality
research shows that higher minimum wages have the intended effect of
raising wages without significantly reducing
[employment](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905) outcomes.
Higher minimum wages [increase earnings
growth](https://kevinrinz.github.io/minwage.pdf) for workers at the
bottom of the income distribution, and those gains persist for years. A
higher minimum wage, and an elimination of the tipped minimum wage, will
benefit many women and people of color who likely have children and are
the [breadwinners in their
households](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2021/02/23/496219/raising-minimum-wage-key-supporting-breadwinning-mothers-drive-economy/).
It will help improve the economic security of their
[families](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20170085) and
narrow racial and gender disparities in income. In addition to directly
lifting the wages of hundreds of thousands of contract workers, the
executive order will have impacts beyond federal contracting, as
[competitors](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3793677)
in the same labor markets as federal contractors may increase wages,
too, as they seek to compete for workers. Employers may seek to raise
wages for workers earning above $15 as they try to
[recruit](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/121/4/1347/1855227?searchresult=1)
and [retain](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160232)
talent. And,
[research](http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2020/06/30/jhr.58.1.0518-9524R2.abstract)
shows that when the minimum wage is increased, the workers who benefit
spend more, a dynamic that can help boost local economies.

The U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division and the Federal
Acquisition and Regulatory Council will engage in rulemaking to
implement and enforce this Executive Order.
