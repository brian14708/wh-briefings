  Forces'

***Joining Forces to Focus on Military Family Employment and
Entrepreneurship; Military Child Education; and Military Family Health
and Well-Being***

*Washington, DC –* Today*,* First Lady Jill Biden, joined virtually by
U.S. military families, advocates and stakeholders from around the
world, set forth the priorities of *Joining Forces*, a White House
initiative to support military and veteran families, caregivers, and
survivors.   The First Lady has spent the last months hearing directly
from spouses and children of service members and veterans, caregivers,
survivors, military members, advocates, federal agencies, non-profit
organizations, and corporate leaders, as well as visiting military
installations across the country.  Informed by these listening sessions,
the work and priorities of *Joining Forces* will center on the needs of
military families in the following areas:  Employment and
Entrepreneurship; Military Child Education; and Health and Well-Being.

Speaking to the military families in virtual attendance, Dr. Biden
linked their strength and wellness to military readiness and national
security: “Military and veteran families, caregivers and survivors may
not wear a uniform, but you serve and sacrifice for us all. So much of a
ship’s power is unseen beneath the waves: the engines, the anchor, the
rudders that give it direction and purpose. You are the rudder that
steers our military, and supporting your physical, social and emotional
health is a national security imperative.”

Standing up the next phase of *Joining Forces* began even before
Inauguration Day with the appointment of its Executive Director, Rory
Brosius, during the White House Transition in January.  Brosius, a
Special Assistant to the President and the spouse of a Marine Corps
veteran, served as Deputy Director of *Joining Forces* during the
Obama-Biden Administration. “It was important to the First Lady that the
substantive work of *Joining Forces* begin within the first 100 days of
the Administration.   She understands that the families of our service
members and veterans, caregivers, and survivors deserve the White
House’s attention and focus now and in the long-term,” said Brosius. 

Military families face the same challenges as any other working
families, but they have the added stressors of multiple deployments,
frequent moves with little control over their geographic location,
caregiving, family separation, and more.  The global pandemic has
exacerbated many of these challenges, and created others.  Currently,
there is significant focus from federal agencies and a robust non-profit
and corporate ecosystem dedicated to serving the needs of active duty
military members and veterans. The mission of *Joining Forces* is to
support those who also serve:  military and veteran families,
caregivers, and survivors.    

A military mother and grandmother, Dr. Biden added: “We have an
all-volunteer force—and it continues only because generations of
Americans see the honor, dignity, and patriotism of military service. 
How can we hope to keep our military strong if we don’t give our
families, survivors, and caregivers what they need to thrive? That’s
what *Joining Forces* is about.” 

Guided by the life experiences and the perspectives voiced during
in-person and virtual listening sessions with military families and
stakeholders, the work and priorities of *Joining Forces* will center on
the needs of military families in the areas of: Employment and
Entrepreneurship; Military Child Education; and Health and Well-Being.

-   **<u>Employment and Entrepreneurship</u>:**  The Department of
    Defense’s 2019 Active Duty Spouses Survey indicates, even
    pre-pandemic, a military spouse unemployment rate of approximately
    22%.  Frequent moves and transfers, state licensing requirements,
    child care (costs, long waitlists for on-base providers, and lack of
    access to off-base providers), caregiving, and deployments, all
    contribute to the unique challenges military spouses face to
    building sustainable and long-term careers. *Joining Forces* will
    work with government at all levels and the non-profit and private
    sectors to mitigate these challenges and drive economic
    opportunities. We will work with employers to create more flexible,
    transferable, and remote job opportunities for military spouses, as
    well as increasing resources for those interested in entrepreneurial
    endeavors. We will also ensure that military families are included
    in the administration’s overall policies aimed at improving economic
    security for all families.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Military Child Education</u>**:  There are more than 2 million
    children in classrooms in the United States whose parents are
    active-duty military service members, National Guard or reservists,
    or military veterans.  Military life can be unpredictable: these
    children often experience multiple moves, extended separation from
    family members, and increased fear for their parents’ safety during
    deployments.  We must understand and account for the lifelong impact
    of service on military-connected children and ensure that children
    in veteran families, caregiving families, and surviving families
    will also be included in the initiative’s work.  We also recognize
    that military children with disabilities, including those enrolled
    in DOD’s Exceptional Family Member Program, face additional
    challenges with changes of duty station.  *Joining Forces* will
    advance programming to support military-connected children in their
    classrooms, and help ease the burdens created by the highly mobile
    military lifestyle. 

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Health and Well-Being</u>:** Supporting the overall physical,
    social, and emotional health of military families is a national
    security imperative.  While our country lauds the strength and
    resilience of military families, it is critical to acknowledge that
    they too shoulder the weight of the past 20 years of sustained
    warfare. Members of military families and caregivers may experience
    mental health challenges like depression, anxiety, and substance
    abuse.  Caregiving for a wounded, ill, or injured family member can
    have an outsized impact on a caregiver’s health, financial
    stability, and economic security. Additionally, some military
    families report a lack of consistent access to enough food to live
    an active, healthy lifestyle.  The global pandemic over the past
    year has intensified these stressors. We will also work closely with
    service providers in the civilian community to ensure they have the
    knowledge and tools to effectively support military and veteran
    families, caregivers, and survivors.

Going forward, *Joining Forces* will convene and collaborate with
federal agency partners, non-profit organizations, corporate
stakeholders, and service providers to develop comprehensive,
meaningful, and long-term solutions to address the holistic well-being
of military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.  We will
work to understand where gaps in support exist, while also improving
access to available resources.  Additionally, *Joining Forces* will call
on all Americans to support and harness the special skills, strengths,
and experiences of military families.

**History of *Joining Forces*:**

Ten years ago, in April of 2011, Dr. Biden and former First Lady
Michelle Obama launched *Joining Forces* as an effort to motivate and
harness support across the public and private sectors to support service
members, veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors.  Over the
course of [five
years,](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/11/11/fact-sheet-five-years-joining-forces-call-action-americans-support)
working together with partners in government, the business community,
and non-profit organizations, the initiative highlighted the challenges
faced by the military and veteran communities and drove progress in
hiring veterans and military spouses, making classrooms more welcoming
for military- connected children, and raising awareness of the mental
health needs of the military and veteran community.  After the
Obama-Biden Administration ended, Dr. Biden continued her work to
support the military family community at the Biden Foundation,
specifically focusing on military child education, military spouse
employment, and mental health and well-being.
