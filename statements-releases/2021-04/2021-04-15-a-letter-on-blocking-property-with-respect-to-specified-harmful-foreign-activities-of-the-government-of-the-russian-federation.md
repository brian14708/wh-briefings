  \ of the Government of the Russian\_Federation"
---
 
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive
Order declaring a national emergency with respect to the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States posed by specified harmful foreign
activities of the Government of the Russian Federation.  

I have determined that specified harmful foreign activities
of the Government of the Russian Federation — in particular, efforts to
undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and
democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and
partners; to engage in and facilitate malicious cyber-enabled activities
against the United States and its allies and partners; to foster and use
transnational corruption to influence foreign governments; to pursue
extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists; to
undermine security in countries and regions important to United States
national security; and to violate well-established principles
of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of
states — constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  

I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

  
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
April 15, 2021.
