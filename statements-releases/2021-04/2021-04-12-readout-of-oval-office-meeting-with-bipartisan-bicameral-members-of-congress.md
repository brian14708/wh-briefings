title: "Readout of Oval Office Meeting with Bipartisan, Bicameral Members of\_Congress"
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hosted a
bipartisan, bicameral group of Members of Congress in the Oval Office to
discuss the critical need to invest in modern and resilient
infrastructure nationwide.  
   
The President and Vice President shared their vision in the American
Jobs Plan to create millions of good jobs, rebuild our country’s
infrastructure, and position the United States to out-compete China. The
President and Members of Congress had a good exchange of ideas, and the
President asked for their feedback and follow-up on proposals discussed
in the meeting, while underscoring that inaction is not an option.    
   
Meeting attendees represented Congressional committees of jurisdiction
including the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, the
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the Senate Agriculture,
Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, the House Appropriations
Committee, and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   
   
The President met last month with a bipartisan group of members from the
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and leaders of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and intends to continue to
engage with Members of Congress and key stakeholders throughout the
month.
