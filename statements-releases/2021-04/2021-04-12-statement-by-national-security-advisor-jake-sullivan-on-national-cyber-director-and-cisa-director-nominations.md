title: Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on National Cyber Director
  and CISA Director Nominations
---
 
Today, President Biden took another important step forward in
strengthening our nation’s cyber capability. He announced his intent to
nominate Chris Inglis as National Cyber Director and Jen Easterly as the
Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency. If confirmed,
Chris and Jen will add deep expertise, experience and leadership to our
world-class cyber team, which includes the first-ever Deputy National
Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger, as
well as strong, crisis-tested professionals from the FBI to ODNI to the
Department of Homeland Security to U.S. Cyber Command and the National
Security Agency. I’m proud of what we are building across the U.S.
government when it comes to cyber. We are determined to protect
America’s networks and to meet the growing challenge posed by our
adversaries in cyberspace – and this is the team to do it.
