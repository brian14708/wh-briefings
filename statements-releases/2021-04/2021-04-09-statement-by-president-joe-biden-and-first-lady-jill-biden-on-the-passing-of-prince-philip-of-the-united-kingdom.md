  \ of Prince Philip of the United\_Kingdom"

On behalf of all the people of the United States, we send our deepest
condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the entire Royal Family,
and all the people of the United Kingdom on the death of His Royal
Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. Over the course of his
99-year life, he saw our world change dramatically and repeatedly. From
his service during World War II, to his 73 years alongside the Queen,
and his entire life in the public eye — Prince Philip gladly dedicated
himself to the people of the UK, the Commonwealth, and to his family.
The impact of his decades of devoted public service is evident in the
worthy causes he lifted up as patron, in the environmental efforts he
championed, in the members of the Armed Forces that he supported, in the
young people he inspired, and so much more. His legacy will live on not
only through his family, but in all the charitable endeavors he shaped.

Jill and I are keeping the Queen and Prince Philip’s children,
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren in our hearts during this time.
