title: "FACT SHEET: The American Families Plan Advances Equity and Racial\_Justice"
---
 
On his first day in office, President Biden signed an Executive Order
directing the whole of the federal government to advance equity and
racial justice. Today, the President announced a historic new set of
investments to deliver on his vision of a more equitable America through
the American Families Plan. The American Families Plan will help restore
the promise of America for communities who have been left behind and
locked out of opportunity—investing in teachers and students, empowering
workers and their families, and reimagining a tax code that rewards work
over wealth. By extending and building upon the provisions of the
American Rescue Plan, the American Families Plan would lift [more than
10 million
people](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2021/presidential-policy/american-family-plan-poverty-impact) out
of poverty in 2022. This means a 29 percent reduction in Black poverty,
a 31 percent reduction in Latino poverty, and a 15 percent reduction in
Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander poverty, relative
to the projected poverty rate for 2022. Among children, it would reduce
poverty by more than 47 percent.  
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will deliver a fairer and more
equitable America by:

-   Closing opportunity gaps for low-income children and children of
    color by providing universal access to preschool, and making
    quality, affordable child care more accessible across the nation.
-   Investing in educational opportunity for underserved communities by
    providing two years of free community college for Americans,
    including DREAMers; making Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and
    institutions such as Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), Asian
    American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions
    (AANAPISIs), and other Minority-serving Institutions (MSIs) more
    affordable; increasing the value of Pell Grants to help more
    low-income students attend college; and ensuring more students are
    supported through completion.
-   Empowering teachers by investing in the training and support they
    need and ensuring more teachers of color can reach the classroom.
-   Creating a right to paid family and medical leave to ensure working
    parents and caregivers, including workers of color and low-wage
    workers, can equitably access the time off they need to support
    their families.
-   Closing gaps in our social safety net to ensure that kids have the
    nutritious food they need to be healthy and succeed in school.
-   Extending the American Rescue Plan’s historic expansions of the
    Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Child and
    Dependent Care Tax Credit to provide income support and cut poverty
    among families and workers.

Together, these investments will give millions of children across the
country a fair shot at the American dream.

**<u>UNIVERSAL PRE-SCHOOL FOR ALL 3- AND 4-YEAR-OLDS</u>**  
  
Preschool is critical to ensuring that children start kindergarten with
the skills and supports that set them up for success in school. In
fact, [research
shows](https://www.future-ed.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Gormley_et_al-2017-Journal_of_Policy_Analysis_and_Management.pdf) that
kids who attend universal Pre-K are more likely to take honors classes
and less likely to repeat a grade, and [another
study](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19735/w19735.pdf) finds
low-income children who attend universal programs do better in [math and
reading](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19735/w19735.pdf) as
late as eighth grade. Unfortunately, most children, and especially
children of color and low-income children, [do not have access
to](https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/edtrustmain/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/05162154/Young-Learners-Missed-Opportunities.pdf) the
full range of high-quality pre-school programs available to their peers.
In addition, children with disabilities benefit
from [inclusive,](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/earlylearning/joint-statement-full-text.pdf) accessible
pre-school programs with their peers, [and all children
benefit](https://tcf.org/content/report/together-from-the-start/?agreed=1) when
we create socio-economically diverse Pre-K classrooms where all students
thrive.   
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Close opportunity gaps by providing universal pre-school to all 3-
    and 4-year-olds. **President Biden is calling for a national
    partnership with states to offer free, high-quality, accessible, and
    inclusive preschool to all 3-and 4-year-olds—benefitting 5 million
    children. This historic investment in America’s future will first
    prioritize high-need areas and enable communities and families to
    choose the setting that works best for them, whether that’s a
    preschool classroom in a public school, a center, or a Head Start
    program. The President’s plan will also ensure that all
    publicly-funded preschool is high-quality with low
    student-to-teacher ratios, a high-quality and developmentally
    appropriate curriculum, and supportive classroom environments that
    are inclusive for all students. The President’s plan will leverage
    investments in tuition-free community college and teacher
    scholarships to support those who wish to earn a bachelor’s degree
    or other credential that supports their work as an educator or their
    work to become an early childhood educator. And, educators will
    receive job-embedded coaching, professional development, and wages
    that reflect the importance of their work. All employees in
    participating Pre-K programs and Head Start will earn at least $15
    per hour, and those with comparable qualifications will receive
    compensation commensurate with that of kindergarten teachers. These
    investments will give American children a head start and pave the
    way for the best-educated generation in U.S. history

**FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND OTHER POSTSECONDARY INVESTMENTS**  
  
For much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, graduating from high school was
a gateway to a stable job and a living wage. But over the last 40 years,
we have seen the most growth in jobs requiring [higher levels of job
preparation](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2016/10/06/the-state-of-american-jobs/),
including education and training. Today, [70 percent of
jobs](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm) are held by
people with more than a high school degree. American workers, and
especially workers of color, need support to build their skills,
increase their earnings, remain competitive, and share in the benefits
of the new economy. President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Offer two years of free community college to all Americans,
    including DREAMers.** Community colleges provide educational
    opportunities for students who are often underserved by four-year
    universities, including first-generation students, students of
    color, low-income students, and adult learners. President Biden’s
    proposal creates a federal-state, -territory, and -tribal
    partnership that allows first-time college students and workers
    wanting to reskill to enroll in a community college to earn a degree
    or credential for free. Students can use the benefit for up to three
    years and, if circumstances warrant, up to four years, recognizing
    that many students’ lives and other responsibilities can make
    full-time enrollment difficult. If all states, territories, and
    tribes participate, about 5.5 million students would pay $0 in
    tuition and fees.
-   **Provide up to approximately $1,400 in additional assistance to
    low-income students by increasing the Pell Grant award. **Nearly 60
    percent of Black, almost half of Latino, half of American Indian or
    Alaska Native, and more than one-third of Native Hawaiian or Pacific
    Islander students depend on [Pell
    Grants](https://ticas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Pell-Grants-Help-Keep-College-Affordable-for-Millions-of-Americans-logo.pdf) to
    help pay for college. But the grant has not kept up with the rising
    cost of postsecondary education; over the last 50 years, the maximum
    Pell Grant value
    has [plummeted](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/pell-grants-a-key-tool-for-expanding-college-access-and-economic) from
    nearly 80 percent of the cost of a four-year college degree to just
    30 percent — leading millions of low-income students to take out
    debt to finance their education. The American Families Plan would
    increase the maximum Pell Grant award by approximately $1,400 and
    allow DREAMers to access the funding.
-   **Increase college retention and completion rates**. Just 40 percent
    and 54 percent of first-time Black and Latino students at four-year
    colleges and universities, respectively, go on to [earn their
    degree](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/raceindicators/indicator_red.asp#info),
    compared to 64 percent of white students. And overall, [just 40
    percent](https://www.brookings.edu/research/community-college-completion-rates-structural-and-motivational-barriers/#:~:text=and%20minority%20students.-,Fewer%20than%2040%20percent%20of%20community%20college%20students%20earn%20a,post%2Dsecondary%20certificate%20or%20degree.) of
    community college students, who are disproportionately low-income
    and people of color, graduate within 6 years. The President is
    proposing a $62 billion formula grant program that will provide
    funding to states, territories, and Tribes to support retention and
    completion activities at colleges and universities that serve high
    numbers of low-income students, including wraparound services
    ranging from child care and mental health services to faculty and
    peer mentoring; emergency basic needs grants; practices that recruit
    and retain faculty; transfer agreements between colleges; and
    evidence-based remediation programs.
-   **Provide two years of subsidized tuition and expand programs in
    high-demand fields at HBCUs, TCUs, and
    MSIs. **[Research](https://www.acenet.edu/Documents/MSIs-as-Engines-of-Upward-Mobility.pdf) has
    found that HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs are vital to helping
    underrepresented students move to the top of the income ladder. But
    despite their record of success, these institutions have
    significantly fewer resources than other top colleges and
    universities, undermining their ability to grow and support more
    students. The President is calling for $39 billion to provide
    tuition subsidies to low- and middle-income students attending
    HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs. The President is also calling for $5 billion
    to expand existing institutional aid grants to HBCUs, TCUs, and
    MSIs, which can be used by these institutions to strengthen their
    academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities, including by
    creating or expanding educational programs in high-demand fields
    (e.g., STEM, computer sciences, nursing, and allied health), with an
    additional $2 billion funding directed towards building a pipeline
    of skilled health care workers with graduate degrees. These proposed
    investments, combined with the $45 billion proposed in the American
    Jobs Plan targeted to these institutions, will enable America’s
    HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to help advance underrepresented students and
    make the U.S. more competitive on the global stage.

**<u>EDUCATION AND PREPARATION FOR TEACHERS</u>**  
  
Few people have a bigger impact on a child’s life than a great teacher.
Unfortunately, the U.S. faces a large and growing teacher shortage.
Before the pandemic, schools across the nation needed [an estimated
additional 100,000 certified
teachers](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/product-files/A_Coming_Crisis_in_Teaching_REPORT.pdf),
resulting in key positions going unfilled, granting of emergency
certifications, or teachers teaching out of their certification area.
Shortages of certified teachers disproportionately impact schools with
higher percentages of students of color, [which  have a higher
proportion of teachers that are uncertified and
higher](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/understanding-teacher-shortages-interactive?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlZbktfGP8AIVg-DICh10CQyXEAAYAiAAEgJgV_D_BwE) shares
of inexperienced teachers, exacerbating educational disparities.
President Biden is calling for investments to improve the impact of new
teachers entering the profession, increase retention rates, and increase
the number of teachers of color, all of which will improve student
outcomes.  
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Address teacher shortages, improve teacher preparation, and
    strengthen pipelines for underrepresented teachers, including
    teachers of color. **Our country faces a serious teacher shortage
    problem, which disproportionately impacts students of color. The
    percentage of teachers in their first or second year of teaching in
    schools with the highest percentage of students of color is 7
    percentage points higher than schools with the lowest percentage of
    students of color ([17 percent vs. 10
    percent](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/understanding-teacher-shortages-interactive?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlZbktfGP8AIVg-DICh10CQyXEAAYAiAAEgJgV_D_BwE)).
    The percentage of teachers who are uncertified is more than three
    times as large ([4.8 percent  vs. 1.3
    percent](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/understanding-teacher-shortages-interactive?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlZbktfGP8AIVg-DICh10CQyXEAAYAiAAEgJgV_D_BwE)). At
    the same time, [while teachers of color can have a particularly
    strong impact on students of
    color](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/product-files/Diversifying_Teaching_Profession_REPORT_0.pdf),
    around [one in five
    teachers](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm) are people of color,
    compared to [more than half of
    K-12](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cge.asp) public
    school students. These disparities help drive gaps in student
    outcomes. Strengthening the teacher pipeline and improving teacher
    preparation, supporting teachers so they stay in the classroom, and
    investing in the recruitment and preparation of underrepresented
    teachers will help narrow persistent educational disparities.
      President Biden is calling on Congress to invest in America’s
    teachers, including by doubling scholarships for future teachers
    from $4,000 to $8,000 per year, which would help underrepresented
    teachers, including teachers of color, access high-quality teacher
    preparation programs that best prepare them for the work ahead. The
    plan also will invest $2.8 billion in Grow Your Own programs and
    year-long, paid teacher residency programs, which have a greater
    impact on student outcomes, teacher retention, and are more likely
    to enroll underrepresented teacher candidates, including candidates
    of color; and invest $400 million in teacher preparation programs at
    HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs.
-   **Support the development of special education teachers.** There has
    been a [17 percent
     decline](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/shortage-of-special-educators-adds-to-classroom-pressures/2018/12) in
    the number of special educators over the last decade. Additionally,
    while only about half of the students receiving special education
    services are white, [approximately 82 percent of special education
    teachers are
    white](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/the-push-to-get-more-teachers-of-color-in-special-education-classrooms/2019/09).
    The American Families Plan will invest $900 million in personnel
    preparation funds under the Individuals with Disabilities Education
    Act (IDEA), funding pathways to additional certifications, and
    strengthening existing teacher preparation programs for special
    educators.
-   **Help current teachers earn in-demand credentials. **Many teachers
    are eager to answer the call to get certified in areas their schools
    need, like bilingual education, but are deterred due to the high
    cost of getting an additional certification. President Biden is
    calling on Congress to create a new fund to provide more than
    100,000 educators with the opportunity to obtain additional
    certifications in high-demand areas like special education,
    bilingual education, and certifications that improve teacher
    performance. This will particularly benefit students with
    disabilities and English learners.
-   **Invest in educator leadership. **Millions of teachers – and the
    students they educate – would stand to benefit from greater
    mentorship and leadership opportunities. President Biden is calling
    on Congress to invest $2 billion to support programs that leverage
    teachers as leaders, such as high-quality mentorship programs for
    new teachers and underrepresented teachers, including teachers of
    color.

**<u>CHILD CARE</u>**  
  
High-quality early care and education helps ensure that children can
take full advantage of education and training opportunities later in
life, especially for children from low-income families, who
face [learning
disparities](https://rhyclearinghouse.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/docs/18755-Disparities_in_Early_Learning_and_Development%5Bfull%5D.pdf) before
they even can go to preschool. [One
study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22993) by Nobel Laureate James
Heckman found that every dollar invested in a high-quality,
comprehensive birth to five program for the most economically
disadvantaged children resulted in $7.30 in benefits as children grew up
healthier, were more likely to graduate high school and college, and
earned more as adults. But we have grave disparities when it comes to
child care in our country. [One analysis finds that more than
half](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2018/12/06/461643/americas-child-care-deserts-2018/) of [Latino](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2018/12/06/461643/americas-child-care-deserts-2018/) and
Native American families live in child care deserts. Difficulty finding
high-quality, affordable child care [leads some
parents](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life/),
especially mothers, to drop out of the labor force entirely, some to
reduce their work hours, and others to turn down a promotion – leading
to [lifetime
consequences](https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/A-Lifetimes-Worth-of-Benefits-_FD.pdf) in
terms of earnings, savings, and retirement. Lack of affordable child
care can be especially challenging for the families of the nearly [7 in
10](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/05/10/469739/breadwinning-mothers-continue-u-s-norm/) Black
women who are their families’ primary or sole breadwinners.  
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Ensure low- and middle-income families can access affordable child
    care for children under the age of five. **Under the President’s
    plan, families will pay only a portion of their income based on a
    sliding scale. For the most hard-pressed working families, child
    care costs for their young children would be fully covered and
    families earning 1.5 times their state median income will spend no
    more than 7 percent of their income on child care for their young
    children. The plan will also provide families with a range of
    inclusive and accessible options to choose from for their child,
    from child care centers to family child care providers to Early Head
    Start programs.
-   **Invest in high-quality care. **The last time the U.S. prioritized
    major, long-term investments in child care was when President
    Roosevelt signed the Lanham Act to provide free, high-quality child
    care in an effort to support women going to work during World
    War II. Not only did it enable women to work, but [children who
    participated](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/689478?af=R&mobileUi=0&) experienced
    long-lasting economic benefits, proving most beneficial for the most
    disadvantaged children.  Under the President’s plan, child care
    providers will receive funding to support the true cost of quality
    early childhood education–including a developmentally appropriate
    curriculum, small class sizes, and culturally and linguistically
    responsive environments that are accessible and inclusive of
    children with disabilities. These investments support positive
    interactions between educators and children that promote children’s
    social-emotional and cognitive development.
-   **Invest in the care workforce, including the women of color who
    make up a substantial percentage of the field**. More investment is
    needed to support early childhood providers and educators, more
    than [nine in
    ten](https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ChildCareWorkersFS.pdf) of
    whom are women and more than [four and
    ten](https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ChildCareWorkersFS.pdf) of
    whom are women of color. They are [among the most
    underpaid](https://cscce.berkeley.edu/workforce-index-2020/the-early-educator-workforce/early-educator-pay-economic-insecurity-across-the-states/) workers
    in the country. The typical child care worker earned [$12.24 per
    hour in
    2020](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/childcare-workers.htm),
    and [one report
    found](https://cscce.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/ReportFINAL.pdf) nearly
    half rely on public income support programs. The American Families
    Plan includes a $15 minimum wage for early childhood educators and
    ensures that those with similar qualifications as kindergarten
    teachers receive comparable compensation and benefits.

When fully implemented, the President’s plan will provide 3 million
children from low- and middle-income families with high quality care,
saving the average family $14,800 a year on child care expenses.  
  
**<u>PAID LEAVE</u>**  
  
Paid family and medical leave supports workers and families and is a
critical investment in the strength and equity of our economy. Paid
leave has been found to [reduce racial
disparities](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13668803.2019.1704398) in
wage loss between workers of color and white workers, improve child
health and well-being, support employers by improving employee retention
and reducing turnover costs, and increase women’s labor force
participation. However, currently, [95
percent](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2020/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-march-2020.pdf) of
the lowest wage workers, mostly women and workers of color, lack access
to any paid family leave. Sixty-two percent of [Black adults and 73
percent of Latino
adults](https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/paid-leave/paid-family-and-medical-leave-racial-justice-issue-and-opportunity.pdf) are
either ineligible for or cannot afford to take unpaid leave, compared to
60 percent of white adults. Additionally, [Black and Latina
mothers](https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p70-128.pdf) are more
likely than white women to report being let go by an employer or
quitting their jobs after giving birth in order to have some leave.   
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Create a national comprehensive** **paid family and medical leave
    program. **Paid family and medical leave can help [reduce racial
    disparities](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13668803.2019.1704398) in
    wage loss between workers of color and white workers. People with
    disabilities may also have [less access to paid
    leave](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/disability/news/2020/10/27/492351/disability-community-needs-paid-family-medical-leave/) due
    to higher rates of [part time and low
    wage](https://thearc.org/wp-content/uploads/forchapters/Paid-Leave-Report.pdf) employment.
    The program will ensure workers receive partial wage replacement to
    take time to bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill loved
    one, deal with a loved one’s military deployment, find safety from
    sexual assault, stalking, or domestic violence, heal from their own
    serious illness, or take time to deal with the death of a loved one.
    It will guarantee twelve weeks of paid parental, family, and
    personal illness/safe leave by year 10 of the program, and also
    ensure workers get three days of bereavement leave per year starting
    in year one. The program will provide workers up to $4,000 a month,
    with a minimum of two-thirds of average weekly wages replaced,
    rising to 80 percent for the lowest wage workers. The plan has an
    inclusive definition of family, ensuring workers can care for and be
    cared by a loved one who is not related by blood, which will greatly
    impact [LGBTQ
    individuals](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbtq-rights/news/2021/02/16/495680/making-case-chosen-family-paid-family-medical-leave-policies/) and [people
    with
    disabilities](https://thearc.org/wp-content/uploads/forchapters/Paid-Leave-Report.pdf).
    We estimate this program will cost $225 billion over a decade.

**<u>NUTRITION</u>**  
  
The pandemic has added urgency to the moral travesty of nutrition
insecurity among children, which disproportionately affects low-income
families and children of color. No one should have to worry about
whether they can provide nutritious food for themselves or their
children. A poor diet jeopardizes a child’s ability to learn and succeed
in school. Nutrition insecurity can also have long-lasting negative
impact on overall health and put children at higher risk for diseases
such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.  
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Expand summer EBT to all eligible children nationwide. **The
    Summer EBT Demonstrations help low-income families with children
    eligible for free- and reduced-price meals during the school year
    purchase food during the summer. The American Families Plan builds
    on the American Rescue Plan’s support for Summer Pandemic-EBT by
    making the successful program permanent and available to all 29
    million children receiving free- and reduced-price meals. Research
    shows that this program decreases food insecurity among children and
    led to positive changes in nutritional outcomes.
-   **Expand school meal programs. **Currently, just 70 percent of
    eligible schools have adopted Community Eligibility Provision (CEP),
    which allows high-poverty schools to provide meals free of charge to
    all of their students—breaking down barriers for students who may be
    eligible for school meals but may not apply for them due to stigma
    or not fully understanding the application process. The President’s
    plan will allow more schools in high poverty districts to offer
    meals free of charge to all of their students by reimbursing a
    higher percentage of meals at the free reimbursement rate through
    CEP. Additionally, the plan will target elementary schools by
    reimbursing an even higher percentage of meals at the free
    reimbursement through CEP and lowering the threshold for CEP
    eligibility for elementary schools. The plan will also expand direct
    certification to automatically enroll more students for school meals
    based on Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income data.
-   **Facilitate re-entry for formerly incarcerated individuals through
    SNAP eligibility.** Individuals convicted of a drug-related felony
    are currently ineligible to receive SNAP benefits unless a state has
    taken the option to eliminate or modify this restriction. Denying
    these individuals—many of whom are parents of young children—SNAP
    benefits jeopardizes nutrition security and poses a barrier to
    re-entry into the community in a population that already faces
    significant hurdles to obtaining employment and stability. SNAP is a
    critical safety net for many individuals as they search for
    employment to support themselves and their families. This
    restriction disproportionately impacts African Americans, who are
    convicted of drug offenses at much higher rates than white
    Americans. 

**<u>TAX CUTS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AND WORKERS</u>**  
  
While the American Rescue Plan provided meaningful relief for hundreds
of millions of Americans, that is just a first step. Now is the time to
build back better, to help families and workers who for too long have
felt the squeeze of stagnating wages and an ever-increasing
cost-of-living.  Direct assistance to families in the form of tax
credits paid on a regular basis lifts children and families out of
poverty, makes it easier for families to make ends meet, and boosts the
academic and economic performance of children over time.  
  
President Biden’s American Families Plan will:

-   **Extend expanded ACA premiums tax credits in the American Rescue
    Plan.** Health care should be a right, not a privilege, and
    Americans facing illness should never have to worry about how they
    are going to pay for their treatment. No one should face a choice
    between buying life-saving medications or putting food on the
    table.  President Biden has a plan to build on the Affordable Care
    Act and lower prescription drug costs for everyone by letting
    Medicare negotiate prices, reducing health insurance premiums and
    deductibles for those who buy coverage on their own, creating a
    public option and the option for people to enroll in Medicare at age
    60, and closing the Medicaid coverage gap to help millions of
    Americans gain health insurance. The American Families Plan will
    build on the American Rescue Plan and continue our work to make
    health care more affordable.  The biggest improvement in health care
    affordability since the Affordable Care Act, the American Rescue
    Plan provided two years of lower health insurance premiums for those
    who buy coverage on their own. With these changes, about [three in
    four](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265321/ASPE%20ACA%20Low%20Premium%20Plans%20Issue%20Brief%20II.pdf) uninsured
    Black adults and nearly [four in
    five](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265321/ASPE%20ACA%20Low%20Premium%20Plans%20Issue%20Brief%20II.pdf) uninsured
    Hispanic or Latino adults are now eligible for low-cost health care.
    The American Families Plan will make those premium reductions
    permanent, a $200 billion investment.  As a result, [nine
    million](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/12/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-reduces-health-care-costs-expands-access-insurance-coverage.html) people
    will save hundreds of dollars per year on their premiums, and [four
    million](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-if-american-rescue-plans-enhanced-marketplace-subsidies-were-made-permanent-estimates-2022) uninsured
    people will gain coverage.  The Families Plan will also invest in
    maternal health and support the families of veterans receiving
    health care services.
-   **Extend the Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases in the American Rescue
    Plan through 2025 and make the CTC permanently fully refundable**.
    The President is calling for the Child Tax Credit expansion, first
    enacted in the American Rescue Plan, to be extended.  This
    legislation expands the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 per child to
    $3,000 per child six-years old and above, and $3,600 per child for
    children under six. It also makes 17-year-olds eligible for the
    first time and makes the credit fully refundable on a permanent
    basis, so that low-income families—the families that need the credit
    the most—can benefit from the full tax credit. The expanded Child
    Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan will benefit nearly 66
    million children, and is the single largest contributor to the
    plan’s [historic
    reductions](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/600f2123fdfa730101a4426a/1611604260458/Poverty-Reduction-Analysis-American-Family-Act-CPSP-2020.pdf) in
    child poverty, including by 52 percent for Black children, 45
    percent for Latino children, 37 percent for Asian American, Native
    Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander children, and 61 percent for Native
    American children.
-   **Permanently increase tax credits to support families with child
    care needs. **To help even more low- and middle-income families,
    President Biden is calling on Congress to make permanent the
    temporary Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) expansion
    enacted in the American Rescue Plan. Families will get back as a tax
    credit as much as half of their spending on child care for children
    under age 13, so that they can receive a total of up to $4,000 for
    one child or $8,000 for two or more children. The CDCTC will be
    fully refundable, making the credit more equitable by allowing
    low-income working families to receive the full value of the credit
    towards their eligible child care expenses regardless of how much
    they owe in taxes. This is a dramatic expansion of support to low-
    and middle-income families. In 2019, a family claiming a CDCTC for
    the previous year [got less than
    $600](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-statistical-tables-by-size-of-adjusted-gross-income) on
    average towards the cost of care, and many low-income families got
    nothing.
-   **Make the Earned Income Tax Credit expansion for childless workers
    permanent**. President Biden believes our tax code should reward
    work and not wealth. And that means rewarding workers who work hard
    every day at modest wages to provide their communities with
    essential services. Before this year, the federal tax code taxed
    low-wage childless workers into poverty or deeper into poverty — the
    only group of workers it treated this way. The American Rescue Plan
    addressed this problem by roughly tripling the EITC for childless
    workers, benefitting 17 million low-wage workers, many of whom are
    essential workers including cashiers, cooks, delivery drivers, food
    preparation workers, and childcare providers. For example, a
    childless worker who works 30 hours per week at $9 per hour earns
    income that, after taxes, leaves them below the federal poverty
    line. By increasing her EITC to more than $1,100, this EITC
    expansion helps pull such workers out of poverty. The President is
    calling on Congress to make this expansion permanent. Extending
    these changes will give a critical [boost in
    earnings](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/american-rescue-plan-act-includes-critical-expansions-of-child-tax-credit-and) of
    an estimated 2.8 billion Black, 2.8 million Latino, and 678,000
    Asian American workers.
