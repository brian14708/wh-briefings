---
 
WASHINGTON – President Biden is announcing his intent to nominate 3
additional individuals to District Court vacancies, all of whom are
immensely qualified and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.
These candidates also speak to the President’s strong belief that the
federal judiciary should reflect the proud diversity of the nation, both
in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.  
  
This is the second judicial nominations announcement made by the
President, and these nominations will bring the full number of judicial
nominees made during this administration to 14.  
  
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move at a historically fast pace
with respect to judicial nominations. Last month’s announcement of his
intent to nominate 11 individuals was faster than any President in
modern history, and today’s announcement continues that trend.
