  \ of the United\_Kingdom"

His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, led a long,
remarkable life—the hallmarks of which were loyalty and service. From
his decorated service in the Royal Navy during World War II to his long
marriage and partnership with Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, he
dedicated himself fully to his family, his country, and the
Commonwealth. Whether he was promoting environmentalism or the wellbeing
of military families, he brought a profound sense of purpose to all he
did.  
   
Doug and I send our condolences to the Royal Family and the people of
the United Kingdom.
