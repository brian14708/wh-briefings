Today, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hosted the
leadership of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) in
the Oval Office to discuss critical issues of shared importance,
including combating anti-Asian hate, the American Jobs Plan, immigration
and education policies.  
   
The President highlighted his recent Statement of Administration Policy
that condemns in the strongest possible terms the increasing acts of
anti-Asian bias, harassment and violence, and conveyed his ongoing
support of the legislation introduced by Senator Mazie Hirono and
Congresswoman Grace Meng, which moved forward in the Senate yesterday
with bipartisan support.  
   
The President and Vice President shared their vision in the American
Jobs Plan to invest in shared CAPAC infrastructure priorities, including
care economy infrastructure and digital infrastructure.  
   
The President expressed his commitment to diversity throughout the
Administration, including the recent appointment of Erika L.
Moritsugu as Deputy Assistant to the President and Asian American and
Pacific Islander (AAPI) Senior Liaison, where she will be a vital voice
to advance the President and the Administration’s priorities.   
   
This meeting underscores the long-term partnership between President
Biden, Vice President Harris, and CAPAC on crucial issues, and the
Administration’s continued attention to their legislative goals and
priorities.
