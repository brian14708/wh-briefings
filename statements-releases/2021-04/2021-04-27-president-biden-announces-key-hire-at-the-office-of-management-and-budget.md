WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced Celeste Drake as his
choice to serve as the Nation’s first Director of Made in America at the
Office of Management and Budget.  
  
**Celeste Drake, Made in America Director, Office of Management and
Budget **  
  
As the Nation’s first Made in America Director, Celeste Drake will shape
and implement Federal procurement and financial management policy to
help carry out the President’s vision of a future made in all of America
by all of America’s workers — including minority entrepreneurs and small
businesses in every region in our country. Drake joins the
administration from the Directors Guild of America, where she served as
the Executive in Charge of Government Affairs, advocating for the
economic and creative interests of the labor union’s more than 18,000
members. Prior to joining the DGA, Drake served as the Trade and
Globalization Policy Specialist for the AFL-CIO, where she played an
instrumental role in shaping U.S. trade policy to promote inclusive
growth for working American families and the manufacturing sector. Drake
has led efforts to reform the labor rules in the NAFTA/USMCA, to
convince the U.S. government to address labor rights violations in
Bangladesh, Thailand, Fiji, and Georgia, and to reform the process by
which Congress oversees and approves trade agreements to protect
American jobs. Drake began her policy career on Capitol Hill as
Legislative Director for Congresswoman Linda Sánchez (D-CA) and a
Legislative Counsel for Congressman Lloyd Doggett (D-TX). A former high
school economics and history teacher, Drake has a JD, an MPP, and a BA
from the University of California, Los Angeles.
