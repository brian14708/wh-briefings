  \ Termination of Emergency With Respect to the International Criminal\_Court"

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Consistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b), I hereby report that I have
issued an Executive Order that terminates the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13928 of June 11, 2020, and revokes that
Executive Order.  
  
The President issued Executive Order 13928 to block property of certain
persons associated with the International Criminal Court.  In Executive
Order 13928, the President authorized the imposition of sanctions
against certain persons associated with the International Criminal Court
(ICC).  
  
I have determined that, although the United States continues to object
to the ICC’s assertions of jurisdiction over personnel of such
non-States Parties as the United States and its allies absent their
consent or referral by the United Nations Security Council and will
vigorously protect current and former United States personnel from any
attempts to exercise such jurisdiction, the threat and imposition of
financial sanctions against the Court, its personnel, and those who
assist it are not an effective or appropriate strategy for addressing
the United States’ concerns with the ICC.  For this reason I have
determined that it is necessary to terminate the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13928 and that there is no further need for
the blocking of assets and other sanctions measures imposed by Executive
Order 13928.  Accordingly, I revoke Executive Order 13928.  
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

Sincerely,

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
