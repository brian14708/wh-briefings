title: 'FACT SHEET: The American Jobs Plan Empowers and Protects Workers'
---
 
As America works to recover from the devastating challenges of a deadly
pandemic, an economic crisis, and a reckoning on race that reveals deep
disparities, we need to summon a new wave of worker power to create an
economy that works for everyone. We owe it not only to those who have
put in a lifetime of work, but to the next generation of workers who
have only known an America of rising inequality and shrinking
opportunity. This is especially important for workers of color and for
women, who have endured discrimination and systematic exclusion from
economic opportunities for generations. All of us deserve to enjoy
America’s promise in full — and our nation’s leaders have a
responsibility to overcome racial, gender, and other inequalities to
make it happen. To that end, the President is calling on Congress to
create new, good-quality union jobs for American workers by leveraging
their grit and ingenuity to address the climate crisis and build a
sustainable infrastructure. Increased unionization can also impact our
economic growth overall by improving productivity. President Biden’s
plan will:

**EMPOWER WORKERS**

-   **Pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. **The
    President is calling on Congress to pass the PRO Act, which would
    dramatically enhance the power of workers to organize and
    collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working
    conditions. The President believes firmly that unions built the
    middle class, and empowering workers so they can organize unions and
    bargain with their employers is imperative for restoring a
    middle-class way of life for millions of Americans.  
     
-   **Provide a federal guarantee for public sector employees to bargain
    for better pay and benefits and the working conditions they
    deserve. **In many states across the country, public sector workers
    do not have the right to bargain collectively, and these rights are
    under attack in several more. The President’s plan will guarantee
    union and bargaining rights for public service workers.  
     
-   **Empower historically excluded workers. **The President’s plan
    ensures that Americans who have endured systemic discrimination and
    exclusion for generations finally have a fair shot at obtaining good
    paying jobs and being part of a union. This includes ensuring
    domestic workers receive the legal benefits and protections they
    deserve and tackling pay inequities based on gender.  
     

**CREATE GOOD JOBS**

**The President’s plan will create good jobs in clean energy, physical
infrastructure, care infrastructure, manufacturing, and research and
development. **It demands that employers benefitting from the
investments in the American Jobs Act follow strong labor standards and
remain neutral when their employees seek to organize a union and bargain
collectively. His plan will also ban employers receiving funding from
requiring their employees to agree to mandatory individual arbitration.
His plan will create:

-   **Good construction jobs**. The President is asking Congress to tie
    federal investments in clean energy and infrastructure to prevailing
    wages, and include project labor agreements, Community Workforce,
    local hire, and registered apprenticeships and other labor or
    labor-management training programs so that federal investments
    support good jobs and pathways to the middle class for workers who
    have too often been left behind.   
     
-   **Good transportation jobs. **President Biden is calling on Congress
    to invest $85 billion to modernize existing transit and to help
    agencies expand their systems to meet rider demand**. **These
    investments will maintain existing transit labor protections,
    including the preservation of rights and benefits of employees under
    existing collective bargaining agreements and continuation of
    collective bargaining rights.  
     
-   **Good caregiving jobs. **Caregivers – who are disproportionally
    women of color – have been underpaid and undervalued for far too
    long. Wages for essential home care workers are approximately $12
    per hour, putting them among the lowest paid workers in our economy.
    In fact, one in six workers in this sector live in poverty.
    President Biden is calling on Congress to put $400 billion toward
    expanding access to quality, affordable home- or community-based
    care for aging relatives and people with disabilities. Biden’s
    investments in the caregiving workforce will offer caregiving
    workers a long-overdue raise, stronger benefits, and an opportunity
    to organize or join a union and collectively bargain. The home- and
    community-based services expansion under Medicaid will build state
    infrastructure to improve the quality of services and to support
    workers. This will improve wages and quality of life for home health
    workers and yield significant economic benefits for low-income
    communities and communities of color.  
     
-   **Good manufacturing jobs. **While manufacturing jobs have been a
    ladder to middle-class life, we have let our industrial heartland be
    hollowed out, with quality jobs moving abroad or to regions with
    lower wages and fewer protections for workers. The President’s plan
    calls for a revitalization of domestic manufacturing, creating
    hundreds of thousands of good-quality jobs. This includes
    investments in American-made electric vehicles and batteries
    manufactured by workers with good jobs. In addition, to ensure that
    American taxpayers’ dollars benefit working families and their
    communities, and not multinational corporations or foreign
    governments, the plan will require that goods and materials are made
    in America and shipped on U.S.-flag, U.S.-crewed vessels.  
     

**CONNECT WORKERS WITH GOOD JOBS NOW AND FOR THE FUTURE**

-   **Pair job creation efforts with next generation training
    programs.** President Biden is calling on Congress to invest in
    evidence-based approaches to supporting workers. This includes
    wraparound services, income supports, counseling, and case
    management, paired with high-quality training and effective
    partnerships between educational institutions, unions, and
    employers. Specifically, he is calling for a $40 billion investment
    in a new Dislocated Workers Program and sector-based training. This
    funding will ensure comprehensive services for workers who have lost
    jobs through no fault of their own to gain new skills and to get
    career assistance they need to secure in-demand jobs. Sector-based
    training programs will be focused on growing, high-demand sectors
    such as clean energy, manufacturing, and caregiving, helping workers
    of all kinds to find good-quality jobs in an ever-changing economy.
-   **Build the capacity of the existing workforce development
    system. **President Biden is calling on Congress to invest a
    combined $38 billion in American workforce development
    infrastructure and worker protection. This includes registered
    apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships, creating one to two million
    new registered apprenticeships slots, and strengthening the pipeline
    for more women and people of color to access these opportunities
    through successful pre-apprenticeship programs. This will ensure
    these historically excluded groups have greater access to new
    infrastructure jobs.
-   **Ensure federal agencies have the resources to protect
    workers. **President Biden is calling on Congress to provide the
    federal government with the tools it needs to ensure employers are
    providing workers with good jobs – including jobs with fair and
    equal pay, safe and healthy workplaces, and workplaces free from
    racial, gender, and other forms of discrimination and harassment.
    The President’s plan includes funding to strengthen the capacity of
    our labor enforcement agencies to protect against discrimination,
    protect wages and benefits, enforce health and safety safeguards,
    strengthen health care and pensions plans, and promote union
    organizing and collective bargaining. In addition to a $10 billion
    investment in enforcement, the President is calling for increased
    penalties when employers violate workplace safety and health rules.
