title: "Statement from Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber & Emerging Technologies\
  \ Anne Neuberger on New Microsoft Exchange\_Patches"
---
 
Cybersecurity is a top priority for the Biden Administration and we’re
committed to sharing actionable and timely information to help the
American public operate safely online.

Microsoft released a set of Exchange patches today that are critical. We
urge all owners and operators of Microsoft Exchange Servers to apply
these latest patches immediately. The U.S. Government will lead by
example – we are requiring all agencies to immediately patch their
Exchange servers, as well. Should these vulnerabilities evolve into a
major incident, we will manage the incident in partnership with the
private sector, building on the [Unified Coordination
Group](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/17/statements-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-deputy-national-security-advisor-for-cyber-anne-neuberger-on-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities-ucg/)
processes established and exercised in the recent Microsoft Exchange
incident.

The U.S. government discovered and notified Microsoft on these
vulnerabilities. The U.S. Government carefully weighs the national
security, public, and commercial interests in deciding to disclose a
vulnerability. Moreover, we recognize when vulnerabilities may pose such
a systemic risk that they require expedited disclosure. This disclosure
is an example of the responsible and transparent approach the U.S.
government uses when handling vulnerabilities. This is consistent with
our expectations for how responsible governments and companies can work
together to promote cybersecurity.
