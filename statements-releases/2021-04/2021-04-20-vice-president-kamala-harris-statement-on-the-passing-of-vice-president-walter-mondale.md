title: "Vice President Kamala\_Harris Statement on the Passing of Vice President Walter\_\
  Mondale"
---
 
Vice President Walter Mondale led an extraordinary life of service. He
defended our nation as a member of the United States Army during the
Korean War, and he protected our Constitution as Minnesota’s Attorney
General. As United States Senator, he fought for equal justice—working
tirelessly to ban discrimination in housing and to build the Great
Society.  
  
Under President Jimmy Carter, Vice President Mondale transformed the
Office of the Vice President. He brought the President and the Vice
President closer together, re-defining the relationship as a true
partnership. Vice President Mondale worked side by side with President
Carter as the two endeavored to end the arms race, promote human rights,
and establish peace.   
  
When he won the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 1984, Vice
President Mondale made a bold and historic choice. He selected
Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate—the first woman to
be nominated as Vice President on a major party ticket in American
history. With that nomination, Vice President Mondale opened “a new door
to the future,” to borrow his words.  
  
Vice President Mondale was so generous with his wit and wisdom over the
years. I was able to speak with him just a few days ago and thank him
for his service and his steadfastness. I will miss him dearly, and my
heart is with his family today. I hope they find comfort in knowing that
he is with his beloved wife, Joan, and daughter, Eleanor, now—and that
his legacy will live on in all of us.  
  
Each time I open my desk drawer and see his signature there, alongside
the signatures of 11 other Vice Presidents, I will be reminded of and
grateful for Vice President Mondale’s life of service.
