  \ on Johnson & Johnson Vaccine"

As FDA and CDC announced earlier today, out of an abundance of caution,
they have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson
vaccine as they review data involving six reported U.S. cases of a rare
and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the Johnson
& Johnson vaccine. The FDA and CDC will be providing details at their
briefing later this morning.

This announcement will not have a significant impact on our vaccination
plan: Johnson & Johnson vaccine makes up less than 5 percent of the
recorded shots in arms in the United States to date. Based on actions
taken by the President earlier this year, the United States has secured
enough Pfizer and Moderna doses for 300 million Americans. Over the last
few weeks, we have made available more than 25 million doses of Pfizer
and Moderna each week, and in fact this week we will make available 28
million doses of these vaccines. This is more than enough supply to
continue the current pace of vaccinations of 3 million shots per day,
and meet the President’s goal of 200 million shots by his
100<sup>th</sup> day in office—and continue on to reach every adult who
wants to be vaccinated. We are working now with our state and federal
partners to get anyone scheduled for a J&J vaccine quickly rescheduled
for a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.
