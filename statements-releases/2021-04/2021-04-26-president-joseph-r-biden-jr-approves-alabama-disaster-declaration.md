Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Alabama and ordered federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by a severe storm, straight-line winds, and tornadoes from
March 25 to March 26, 2021.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Bibb, Calhoun, Clay, Hale, Jefferson,
Perry, Randolph, and Shelby.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Robert J. Fenton, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the
Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of
Homeland Security, named Allan Jarvis as the Federal Coordinating
Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.  

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

counties can begin applying for assistance by registering online at
