Today, Vice President Kamala Harris hosted Guatemalan President
Alejandro Giammattei for a virtual bilateral meeting to discuss working
together to address immediate relief needs of the Guatemalan people and
deepening cooperation on migration.  They agreed on the importance of
prosperity, good governance, and anti-corruption measures to protect all
members of society and to build a foundation of hope for a better
future.  In light of the dire situation and acute suffering faced by
millions of people in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, Vice
President Harris announced an additional $310 million in U.S. government
support for humanitarian relief and to address food insecurity.   
  
The two leaders committed to strengthen bilateral efforts to manage
migration in an orderly and humane manner in accordance with national
and international laws.  The Government of Guatemala will increase the
number of border security personnel and strengthen and enhance
safeguards at its northern and southern borders.  Together, the United
States and Guatemala will deepen bilateral law-enforcement cooperation
to combat migrant smugglers, human traffickers, and narcotics
traffickers including through the reconstitution of a Mobile Tactical
Interdiction Unit focused on dismantling transnational criminal
activities in Guatemala, by providing U.S. law enforcement personnel to
train and advise Guatemalan border security and law enforcement, and by
identifying and seizing the illicit assets of those criminal
organizations.   
  
Additionally, the two governments agreed on the need to establish
orderly and legal channels for migrants.  They agreed to open Migrant
Resource Centers in Guatemala to provide services for people seeking
lawful pathways of migration as well as those in need of protection,
asylum referrals, and refugee resettlement.  These centers will also
provide reintegration support for migrants returned from the United
States and other countries.  
  
Finally, the two governments agreed on the importance of creating
economic opportunities in the region that will benefit both countries. 
Vice President Harris underscored the importance of good governance and
addressing corruption to create the conditions on the ground in
Guatemala to attract investment and to create better opportunities for
all its people.
