As the President has repeatedly made clear, we are committed to pursuing
diplomacy until the moment an invasion begins. Secretary Blinken and
Foreign Minister Lavrov are scheduled to meet later this week in Europe,
provided Russia does not proceed with military action. President Biden
accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that
engagement, again, if an invasion hasn’t happened.  We are always ready
for diplomacy.  We are also ready to impose swift and severe
consequences should Russia instead choose war.  And currently, Russia
appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on
Ukraine very soon.
