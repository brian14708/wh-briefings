title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Dick\_Blum"
---
 
Jill and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Dick Blum, a
successful businessman, humanitarian, and proud son of California who
dedicated much of his public life to fighting poverty around the globe.

For 16 years, I had the honor of serving on the Senate Judiciary
Committee alongside Dick’s wife — and one of America’s true trailblazers
— Senator Dianne Feinstein. During that time, Jill and I came to know
Dick as a friend. He was first and foremost dedicated to his family. He
turned his lifelong fascination with Mt. Everest into the American
Himalayan Foundation, which he created to help construct schools and
hospitals in the Tibetan community. And here at home, Dick bled Berkeley
blue — he was fiercely loyal to his alma mater, the University of
California, where he established the Blum Center for Developing
Economies to seek innovative solutions to the challenges of global
poverty.

Above and beyond his many professional and philanthropic
accomplishments, Dick was a man of personal decency and generosity — a
champion of human rights, driven by genuine care and compassion to make
a difference in the world. From his home state to halfway around the
globe, his legacy will live on in the families and communities his
goodness touched.

Jill and I will miss our friend. Our prayers are with Senator Feinstein,
their family, and all those who knew and loved Dick Blum.
