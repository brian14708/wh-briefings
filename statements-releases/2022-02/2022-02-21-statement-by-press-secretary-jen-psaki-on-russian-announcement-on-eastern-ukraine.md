We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to
respond immediately. President Biden will soon issue an Executive Order
that will prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons
to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine. This E.O.
will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined
to operate in those areas of Ukraine. The Departments of State and
Treasury will have additional details shortly. We will also soon
announce additional measures related to today’s blatant violation of
Russia’s international commitments.

To be clear: these measures are separate from and would be in addition
to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in
coordination with Allies and partners should Russia further invade
Ukraine.

We are continuing to closely consult with Allies and partners, including
Ukraine, on next steps and on Russia’s ongoing escalation along the
border with Ukraine.
