President Biden hosted Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin and Ranking
Member Chuck Grassley in the Oval Office this afternoon to hear their
perspectives and advice about the historic nomination to the Supreme
Court he will make later this month.  
  
The President reiterated his commitment to being advised by senators
from each party during this process before seeking bipartisan support
for his nominee. He also expressed his appreciation to Senator Durbin
and Senator Grassley for their insights and recommendations about how to
move forward.  
  
In the coming days and weeks, President Biden will continue to seek
input from lawmakers and experts as he considers a range of highly
qualified candidates. The President has accumulated a strong track
record of selecting extraordinarily qualified and groundbreaking
nominees, and he looks forward to consulting with his colleagues further
as he takes on one of the most significant responsibilities of any
president.
