title: "Readout of the President and Vice President\u2019s Meeting with Senate Judiciary\
  \ Committee\_Democrats"

This afternoon, as part of their continued engagement with lawmakers in
both parties about the Supreme Court nomination process, the President
and Vice President hosted the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee in the Oval Office.

As two former members of the committee, the President and Vice President
emphasized that there are a wealth of extraordinarily qualified
potential nominees under consideration who are dedicated to the
Constitution and the rule of law, with top-rate legal intellects, and
the strongest credentials, records, and character any person could
possess. And that based on these qualities, any of the candidates being
reviewed would be deserving of bipartisan support.

The President reiterated that, having chaired the Judiciary Committee
and been involved with many confirmations, he has a unique appreciation
for the significance of decisions about Supreme Court nominations, and
that he welcomes the perspectives of Democrats and Republicans, as well
as diverse legal experts and scholars, as he decides on a nominee later
this month.
