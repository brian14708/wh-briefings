title: "Fact Sheet: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Delivering Results 100 Days\
  \ into Infrastructure Implementation"
---
 
Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 100 days
ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has made major progress
implementing the largest long-term investment in America’s
infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century.

The historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild crumbling road
and bridges, replace lead pipes, help provide high-speed internet to
every family in America, and produce concrete results that change
people’s lives for the better. By reaching all communities all across
the country – including rural communities and historically underserved
populations – these investments will position the United States to win
the 21st century.

Upon signing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, President Biden signed
an Executive Order establishing an Infrastructure Implementation Task
Force that has now met nine times to ensure that the Administration is
delivering results to the American people.  
The Administration has demonstrated early and often how we will work as
one team with one mission: to build a better America while creating
good-paying job opportunities for American workers, ensuring products
are Made in America and strengthening supply chains, advancing racial
equity, and strengthening the nation’s resilience to climate change.

Since the bill signing, implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law has been the focus of more than 60 presidential and cabinet visits
to communities across America. The President, Vice President, and
Cabinet have traveled the country to showcase how the Administration is
building a better America and how the law benefits communities in every
corner of the country.  
**  
Resources for States, Territories, Tribes, & Local Governments  
**  
In January, the White House released the [**first edition of its
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law guidebook**](https://www.build.gov/) to
help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments unlock the
benefits from the historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure.
The guidebook is a central repository on the law and contains the most
comprehensive information to date on the more than 375 programs included
in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Along with its accompanying
information online, states, territories, Tribes and local governments
now have information on funding opportunities, who to contact, and how
to get ready to rebuild. Future phases of the guidebook will update
dates, key timelines for program implementation, best practices, case
studies, and links to key resources developed by the White House and
partners. In recent weeks, the Administration has launched an
**“Infrastructure School”** webinar series to go more in depth into each
of the guidebook’s 12 chapters and allow communities the opportunity to
ask questions to the agency experts, overseeing implementation of key
programs.

Given that over 90 percent of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding
will be implemented by non-federal partners, the White House has
requested
[Governors](https://www.ibtta.org/sites/default/files/documents/Advocacy/GA053-Mitch%20Landrieu%20Letter%20to%20Governors%202022-0104.pdf) and
local leaders take a series of preparatory actions, including appointing
infrastructure coordinators to manage the flow of funds to their states.
The Administration has also released a [fact
sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BIL-Factsheet-Local-Competitive-Funding.pdf)
on some of the largest sources of competitive funding, particularly for
local governments. Senior Advisor and Infrastructure Implementation
Coordinator Mitch Landrieu has shared these resources during meetings
with the National Governors Association, U.S. Conference of Mayors,
National League of Cities, National Association of Counties, and
hundreds of tribes through Tribal Consultations. 

While many funding streams in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
specifically set aside funds for underserved communities, the White
House Infrastructure Implementation Team has also been engaging states,
local governments, Tribal governments, territories, federal agencies,
philanthropy, and others to leverage all available resources to quickly
deliver the necessary technical assistance and capacity to underserved
communities.

**Good Stewards of Taxpayer Dollars**  
As outlined in the President’s executive order, agencies must prioritize
“investing public dollars efficiently and equitably, working to avoid
waste, and focusing on measurable outcomes for the American people.” To
support effective agency implementation, transparency, and appropriate
oversight, key Biden-Harris Administration officials have met with the
Inspectors General for agencies with major Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
funding and leaders of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Going
forward, the Administration will work with agency IGs and GAO to share
data and effective practices so that program planning, design,
execution, and financial management, as well as data, tracking, and
reporting, support transparency and help ensure taxpayer dollars are
spent well.

**Delivering On Time, On Task, On Budget**  
Nearly $100 billion has been announced to states, territories, Tribes
and local governments from formula and competitive programs for roads
and highways, bridges, ports, airports, and water systems. Another
nearly $50 billion in RFIs and notices of funding availability have been
released. The Administration has also unveiled new offices and action
plans that will ensure these investments are implemented wisely and
well.
