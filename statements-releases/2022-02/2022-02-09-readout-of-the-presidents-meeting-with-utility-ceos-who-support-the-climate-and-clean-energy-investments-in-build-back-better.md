title: "Readout of the President\u2019s Meeting With Utility CEOs Who Support the\
  \ Climate and Clean Energy Investments in Build Back\_Better"
---
 
This afternoon, the President hosted 10 electric utility executives at
the White House for a discussion about his Build Back Better (BBB)
agenda to modernize America’s energy system and meet the moment on
climate.  These electric utilities – that collectively employ more than
a hundred thousand Americans in communities across the country and
provide power to more than 50 million homes and businesses every day –
offered their overwhelming support for the climate and clean energy
investments in BBB.

The President thanked these leaders for their support and had a detailed
conversation with them about their shared conviction that Build Back
Better would support good jobs, lower energy bills for American
families, make our electric grid more reliable in the face of extreme
weather, enhance U.S. competitiveness, boost economic growth, and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

The CEOs in attendance spoke about how Build Back Better would make our
country more globally competitive by investing in energy innovation,
make our electric grid more reliable by investing in transmission, and
support the growing number of electric vehicles Americans are buying.
They also expressed that, while they may not agree with every aspect of
the President’s agenda, they firmly support investments in climate and
clean energy.

The climate and clean energy provisions in Build Back Better are a
comprehensive set of investments to get America on track to reach the
President’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, and he appreciates
the partnership of these top electric utility CEOs in that effort.
