title: Readout of White House Discussions with Conservation Leaders on $1.5 billion
  Investment and Implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
---
 
Today, Senior Advisor and White House Infrastructure Implementation
Coordinator Mitch Landrieu and other senior administration officials,
including Sarah Greenberger the Associate Deputy Secretary at the
Department of Interior, discussed how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
will build a better America by investing in the conservation of and
access to our public lands.  Landrieu outlined the President’s
commitment as part of the America the Beautiful Initiative to building
partnerships with states, conservation groups, hunters, anglers, Tribes
and others to conserve America’s lands and waters for future
generations.

President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes billions for
ecosystem restoration and resilience of America’s lands, invasive
species detection and prevention,  and native vegetation restoration
efforts, on top of nearly $16 billion for cleaning up legacy pollution. 
On Friday, the Department of the Interior announced distribution of a
record [$1.5
billion](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-over-15-billion-support-state-wildlife-conservation-and)
in Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration (WSFR) Program allocations to
state wildlife agencies throughout the nation. The WSFR was reauthorized
as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  Landrieu noted that these
grants will make significant progress in our work to protect our
cherished natural treasures, and together with other Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law investments, will make significant progress in our
work on collaborative conservation.  

**From today’s conversation:** “The tremendous amount of ongoing, new,
or improved collaboration between the federal government, states, local
leaders, tribes, nonprofits, and everyone here today will make it
possible to build back better. Conservation is something we can all
agree on, and as the President has said repeatedly, there’s so much
common ground for those who seek to find it.” – *Mitch Landrieu, Senior
Advisor and White House Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator*
