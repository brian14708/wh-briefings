Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with Foreign Minister Dmytro
Kuleba of Ukraine to reaffirm the United States’ commitment to Ukraine’s
sovereignty and territorial integrity. President Biden updated Foreign
Minister Kuleba on the United States’ response to Russia’s decision to
recognize the purported “independence” of the so-called DNR and LNR
regions of Ukraine, including the Executive Order issued last night and
new sanctions announced today. He also affirmed that the United States
would continue providing security assistance and macroeconomic support
to Ukraine. President Biden reiterated the readiness of the United
States, in close cooperation with our Allies and partners, to respond
swiftly and decisively to any further Russian aggression against
Ukraine.
