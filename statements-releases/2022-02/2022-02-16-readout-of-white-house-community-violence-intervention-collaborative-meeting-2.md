Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House
Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez convened the third
national meeting of The White House Community Violence Intervention
Collaborative (CVIC), a cohort of 16 jurisdictions committed to using
American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to scale and
strengthen their CVI infrastructure. Investing in evidence-based
community violence interventions (CVI) to reduce gun violence is a key
pillar of President Biden’s comprehensive strategy to prevent and
respond to gun crime. Mayors, law enforcement leaders, CVI experts, and
representatives from more than a dozen philanthropic institutions
participated in today’s meeting, along with the four lead training and
technical assistance (TTA) providers—Cities United, Community Based
Public Safety Collective, Health Alliance for Violence Intervention
(HAVI), and the National Institute of Criminal Justice Reform—and
Hyphen, which anchors the initiative.

Announced in June 2021, the Collaborative is an 18-month initiative to
enhance partnerships and coordination in each jurisdiction and to
facilitate peer-to-peer learning around effective community-based public
safety strategies. National experts and federal agencies are providing
training and technical assistance (TTA) to help communities assess their
existing public safety ecosystem, identify gaps, and build the capacity
to expand programming that saves lives and provides needed services to
communities impacted by gun violence.  
  
To date, CVIC jurisdictions have committed more than $300 million of
American Rescue Plan funds to invest in public safety and CVI
strategies. Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and Intergovernmental
Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez called upon CVIC participants –
including mayors, law enforcement, community violence intervention
leaders, and philanthropic supporters – to expediently deploy these
dollars so community violence intervention programs and CVIC communities
can expand their capacity ahead of the summer months, when gun crime
historically increases.
