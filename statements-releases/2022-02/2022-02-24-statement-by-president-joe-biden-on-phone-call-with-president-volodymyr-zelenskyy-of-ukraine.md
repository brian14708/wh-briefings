  \ of\_Ukraine"

President Zelenskyy reached out to me tonight and we just finished
speaking. I condemned this unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian
military forces. I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally
international condemnation, including tonight at the United Nations
Security Council. He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to
speak out clearly against President Putin’s flagrant aggression, and to
stand with the people of Ukraine. Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the
Leaders of the G7, and the United States and our Allies and partners
will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia. We will continue to provide
support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.
