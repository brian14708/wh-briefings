title: "FACT SHEET: Executive Order to Preserve Certain Afghanistan Central Bank Assets\
  \ for the People of\_Afghanistan"

As part of our ongoing work to address the humanitarian and economic
crisis in Afghanistan, President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.)
to help enable certain U.S.-based assets belonging to Afghanistan’s
central bank, Da Afghanistan Bank (“DAB”), to be used to benefit the
Afghan people. The E.O. will block property of DAB held in the United
States by U.S. financial institutions and require U.S. financial
institutions to transfer this property into a consolidated account held
at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Administration will seek to
facilitate access to $3.5 billion of those assets for the benefit of the
Afghan people and for Afghanistan’s future pending a judicial decision.

Many U.S. victims of terrorism, including relatives of victims who died
in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, have brought claims against
the Taliban and are pursuing DAB assets in federal court. Because some
of these plaintiffs currently have writs of execution against the DAB
assets, the court will need to issue a further decision regarding the
scope of those writs. Even if funds are transferred for the benefit of
the Afghan people, more than $3.5 billion in DAB assets would remain in
the United States and are subject to ongoing litigation by U.S. victims
of terrorism. Plaintiffs will have a full opportunity to have their
claims heard in court.

This is one step forward in the United States’ effort to authorize the
transfer of a significant portion of the funds to meet the needs of the
Afghan people. The E.O. is designed to provide a path for the funds to
reach the people of Afghanistan, while keeping them out of the hands of
the Taliban and malicious actors. The United States has sanctions in
place against the Taliban and the Haqqani network, including for
activities that threaten the safety of Americans such as holding our
citizens hostage.

While this E.O. will help preserve a substantial portion of
Afghanistan’s reserves to benefit the Afghan people, we understand there
are no easy solutions for Afghanistan’s economic challenges, which have
been exacerbated by the Taliban’s forced takeover of the country:

-   Even prior to the events of last August, Afghanistan’s economy was
    on the brink. Afghanistan faced poverty rates above 50 percent.
    International donor grants financed about 75 percent of public
    expenditures and 50 percent of the government’s budget. A two-year
    long drought had reduced many crops to 40 percent of their usual
    yields, and Afghanistan had one of the least developed financial
    systems in the world—with just 10-20% of adults holding bank
    accounts. Rampant corruption crippled sectors that should have been
    profitable.

-   The Taliban’s forced takeover made the already frail economic
    situation worse. The IMF estimates that Afghanistan faces an
    economic contraction of 30%, and many of the senior officials and
    technical experts needed to provide sound economic management have
    fled the country as a result of the Taliban’s actions.

<!-- -->

-   These problems reflect longstanding, structural issues that predated
    the events of August 2021 and have worsened due to uncertainty and
    perceived risk surrounding the Taliban’s capacity to run the
    economy. This includes its ability to implement anti-money
    laundering measures and measures to counter the financing of
    terrorism.

Against this challenging backdrop, the United States will continue to
work tirelessly with the international community to ensure that
humanitarian assistance and other support flows to the people of
Afghanistan. Over the past several months, we have acted urgently to
support the Afghan people:

-   The United States remains the single largest donor of humanitarian
    aid in Afghanistan. Just last month, the United States announced a
    new contribution of more than $308 million in humanitarian
    assistance for the people of Afghanistan and we have provided more
    than $516 million since mid-August. The humanitarian assistance
    flows through independent humanitarian organizations and helps
    provide lifesaving protection and shelter, essential health care,
    winterization assistance, emergency food aid, water, sanitation, and
    hygiene services in response to the growing humanitarian needs
    exacerbated by COVID-19 and healthcare shortages, drought,
    malnutrition, and the winter season.

-   The United States recently provided the people of Afghanistan with
    one million additional COVID-19 vaccine doses through COVAX,
    bringing our total donation to 4.3 million doses.
-   In December 2021, the United Nations Security Council adopted a
    resolution championed by the United States to establish a carveout
    for humanitarian assistance and activities that support basic human
    needs in the UN 1988 sanctions regime to ensure that urgently needed
    aid can reach the Afghan people. The United States is also
    collaborating closely with the United Nations on mechanisms to
    ensure UN agencies and NGOs have the liquidity needed to support
    critical humanitarian assistance programs.

-   Starting in September 2021, the Department of the Treasury has
    provided broad authorizations that facilitate the continued
    provision of aid and support to the Afghan people by NGOs,
    international organizations, and the U.S. government. In December,
    the World Food Program, with USAID support, reached 8 million people
    across Afghanistan with food assistance. This was facilitated by
    licenses that the U.S. Treasury Department has issued.
-   The United States worked closely with the United Nations on the
    World Bank’s “transfer out” of $280 million in funds from the
    Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) to UN Organizations. We
    are proud to be the largest funder of UN operations in Afghanistan
    and the leading donor to the ARTF.

The United States is committed to supporting the Afghan people and we
continue to consider all options available to us to achieve that goal.
