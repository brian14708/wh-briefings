title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Signs Executive Order to Boost Quality of Federal\
  \ Construction\_Projects"
---
 
*Biden-Harris Administration will make federal procurement more
economical and efficient by improving coordination and minimizing
disruptions on large federal construction projects*

Tomorrow, the President will sign an Executive Order to improve
timeliness, lower costs and increase quality in federal construction
projects. Federal construction projects span the country – from the
maintenance of nuclear sites to base construction to waterways and flood
projects. By requiring the use of project labor agreements (PLAs) on
federal construction projects above $35 million, the Order will help
alleviate the management and coordination challenges that can stymie
progress on major construction projects. This helps projects get
completed on time and helps the government get the best value for
taxpayers’ dollars.

Based on FY2021 figures, this Order could affect $262 billion in federal
government construction contracting and improve job quality for the
[nearly 200,000
workers](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-11-24/pdf/2021-25317.pdf)
on federal construction contracts. Additionally, the President’s
Executive Order directs the departments of Defense and Labor, along with
the Office of Management Budget, to lead a training strategy for the
nearly 40,000-person strong contracting workforce on the implementation
of this Order’s policy. 

This Executive Order is just one of many steps the Biden-Harris
Administration is taking that will improve the efficiency of federal
procurement. Since taking office, the President fulfilled his
commitments to strengthen Buy American rules, and secured a reliable
supply of experienced, quality workers for federal service contracts. As
of January 30<sup>th</sup>, federal contractors in new or extended
contracts must pay a $15/hour minimum wage, as the President directed in
Executive Order 14026.

This new Executive Order, while only applicable to federal procurement,
advances the Administration’s commitment to rebuild the nation’s
infrastructure, on-time and at reasonable cost. The Order will only
apply to provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that are direct
federal procurement, which excludes construction projects financed
through grant dollars to non-federal entities. The Executive Order will
benefit taxpayers, contractors, and workers by:

-   **Alleviating the coordination challenges on large, complex
    projects.** Multi-million-dollar projects can present real
    management challenges to the primary contractor on the project,
    which has to work with multiple businesses and multiple types of
    skilled labor to complete a project. PLAs can help coordinate
    diverse contractors and sub-contractors and their employees working
    on a project and prevent disputes between subcontractors.
    Additionally, workers will have more confidence in the management of
    the project and a greater commitment to completing the project if
    they have a voice at the table. This helps projects get completed on
    time by minimizing work disruptions. On-time projects save the
    government, and taxpayers, money.  
-   **Raising quality standards for contractors bidding on federal
    projects.** PLAs help raise the standards of all bidders on federal
    contracts. Contractors who offer lower wages or do not train their
    workers will need to raise their standards to compete with other
    high-wage, high-quality companies. Businesses with well-trained
    workers will be more likely to bid for and win federal contracts.
    Well-trained, high quality workers are more productive, completing
    projects well and on time.  
-   **Reducing uncertainty in the contracting process.** PLAs
    standardize the work rules, compensation costs, and dispute
    settlement processes on construction projects. This standardization
    helps create more certainty for the government and, therefore,
    taxpayers, about the costs and completion rate for projects.  
-   **Increasing training for the federal contracting workforce.** The
    Executive Order directs the Departments of Defense and Labor, along
    with the Office of Management and Budget, to lead a training
    strategy for the contracting workforce on Project Labor Agreements
    and the implementation of this Order. This training will create a
    more uniform and accessible experience for contractors interacting
    with departments and agencies across the federal government.
