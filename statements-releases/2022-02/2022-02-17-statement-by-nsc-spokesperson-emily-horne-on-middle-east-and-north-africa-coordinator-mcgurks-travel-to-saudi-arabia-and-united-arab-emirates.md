  \ Coordinator McGurk\u2019s Travel to Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates"
---
 
Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk traveled
this week to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to ensure the
United States is doing everything possible to support the territorial
defense of both countries against Iranian-enabled missile and UAV
attacks. Mr. McGurk reaffirmed the Presidentâ€™s commitment to supporting
the defense of U.S. partners, reviewed ongoing efforts with our
diplomatic and military teams in both capitals, and discussed the need
to combine pressure on the Houthis in Yemen with a concerted UN-led
effort to end the war there. In Saudi Arabia, State Department Special
Envoy for Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein joined Mr. McGurk to discuss a
collaborative approach to managing potential market pressures stemming
from a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.
