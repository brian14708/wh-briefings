South Lawn

Q    Mr. President, how high is the threat of a Russian invasion right
now?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s very high.  
   
Q    Why?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s very — because they have not — they have not moved
any of their troops out.  They’ve moved more troops in, number one. 
Number two, we have reason to believe that they are engaged in a
false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in.  Every indication we
have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine — number
one.   
   
Number two, I’ve been waiting for a response from Putin for my letter
that — my response to him.  It’s come to that Moscow embassy.  They’re
faxing it here.  Not faxing it, they’re sending it here.  I have not
read it yet.  I cannot comment on it.  
   
Q    Have you been briefed on it in any way?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No- —  
   
Q    Do you think he’s going to go through with this, sir?  Is your
sense that this is going to happen now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Not —  
   
Q    When?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I — my sense is this will happen within the next several
days.   
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    How many days are we talking?  
   
Q    Is there any diplomatic path still available, Mr. President?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, there is.  There’s a clear diplomatic path.  That’s
why I asked Senator — Senator — (laughs) — Secretary Blinken to go to
the United Nations and make his statement today.  He’ll lay out what
that path is.  I’ve laid out a path to Putin as well on, I think,
Sunday.  And so, there is a path.  There is a way through this, but by
diplomacy.  
   
Q    Will you speak to Putin again?   
   
Q    Are you going to call Putin?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not calling Putin.  I have no plans to call Putin
right now.  Thank you.
