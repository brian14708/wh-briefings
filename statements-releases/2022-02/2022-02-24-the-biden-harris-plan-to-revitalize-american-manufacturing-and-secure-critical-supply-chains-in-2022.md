*Release of Historic Industrial Base Reports by Seven Federal Agencies
Caps Off a Year of Action Fortifying America’s Supply Chains*

One year ago, President Biden signed [Executive Order
14017](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/)
directing an all-of-government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in
– and strengthening the resilience of – the United States’ critical
supply chains. Within six months of taking office, the Administration
completed a comprehensive review of the supply chains for four critical
products, identified solutions to secure those supply chains against a
wide range of risks and vulnerabilities, and established a
first-of-its-kind Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force (SCDTF)  to
address the challenges arising from a pandemic-affected economic
recovery.  
  
These actions are contributing to a historic recovery in American
manufacturing and industrial strength. During President Biden’s first
year in office, the economy added 367,000 manufacturing jobs – the most
in nearly 30 years – manufacturing as a share of U.S. Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) returned to pre-pandemic levels, and companies have
announced major new investments in American manufacturing. American
ports also moved a record amount of cargo, and inflation-adjusted retail
inventories – excluding autos – surged 5 percent in 2021 compared to the
previous year, ensuring retailers’ shelves were fully stocked for a
record-breaking holiday season. The progress made rebuilding American
supply chains contributed to the fastest job growth in history, the
fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years, and a faster recovery than
every other country in the G7.     
  
Today, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden’s executive order,
seven cabinet agencies published reports identifying key weaknesses in
some of the nation’s most crucial supply chains, and devising multi-year
strategies to address those weaknesses. The [White House also published
a capstone
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Capstone-Report-Biden.pdf)
that provides an overview of the key actions the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken over the past year to reduce the vulnerability
of U.S. supply chains across a range of key sectors. And in the coming
months, a number of federal departments and agencies, including the
Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor (DOL), will host
regional summits that will bring together stakeholders to discuss
opportunities to align regional economic development strategies with the
national supply chain strategy.

Building on the conclusions outlined in these reports, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing additional, concrete actions it will take
this year to build long-term resilience across critical supply chains
and formally institutionalize supply chain resilience throughout the
Federal government. Central to this effort is implementing the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which is our nation’s most
significant investment ever in modernizing the transportation systems on
which our supply chains depend. Looking forward, with the historic
investments included in the landmark America Creating Opportunities for
Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength
(COMPETES) Act, the United States Innovation and Competition Act
(USICA), and President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda, these actions
will strengthen our supply chains, grow domestic manufacturing, enhance
our domestic workforce with a focus on good, union jobs, and help us
outcompete China and the rest of the world. Specifically, the
Biden-Harris Administration will:  
  
**Put the U.S. Economy on a Path Towards Long-Term Resilience Across
Critical Supply Chains:  
**Since his first day in office, President Biden has focused on an
industrial strategy to address near-term disruptions linked to the
global pandemic, revitalize our manufacturing base, strengthen critical
supply chains, and position U.S. workers and businesses to compete and
lead globally in the 21st century. To date, the SCDTF’s
whole-of-government actions have contributed to a more than 70 percent
decline in long-dwelling containers cluttering the docks at our two
largest ports. Over $600 million in American Rescue Plan (ARP) resources
have already been announced to strengthen the port workforce and improve
facility efficiency at ports nationwide, from California and Florida to
Massachusetts and Louisiana. These actions have also produced new supply
chain partnerships between the automobile and semiconductor industries.
And, they have helped secure $1 billion in ARP funding to expand meat
processing capacity to promote competition and reduce prices for
consumers. Because of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to
domestic industrial revitalization, American companies are also betting
on the United States again. In just the last year, companies have
announced nearly $200 billion in investments for semiconductor, electric
vehicle, and battery manufacturing in the United States. But there is
more work to do to build long-term resilience. In addition to working
with Congress to enact the historic, bipartisan COMPETES/USICA
legislation and the President’s Build Back Better Agenda, the
Biden-Harris Administration will:

-   **Propose a new domestic manufacturing initiative through the
    Export-Import Bank to strengthen U.S. manufacturing exports.** Too
    many American manufacturers – especially small- and medium-sized
    ones– struggle to obtain the financing they need to expand their
    operations and compete for global sales. As the official export
    credit agency of the United States, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM) is
    well positioned to address this issue, supporting jobs in America
    along the way. This Spring, EXIM’s board will vote on a new domestic
    initiative, including providing financing priority to
    environmentally beneficial, small business, and transformational
    export area transactions, including semiconductors, biotech and
    biomedical products, renewable energy, and energy storage. This
    initiative will help America win the future by revitalizing American
    manufacturing, improving the resiliency of our supply chains, and
    leveling the playing field for American companies competing in
    overseas markets.  
-   **Expand access to capital for small manufacturers.** Even before
    the COVID-19 pandemic, too many small businesses struggled to access
    the capital needed to grow and compete. Through new and existing
    programs at the Department of the Treasury and the Small Business
    Administration (SBA), the Biden-Harris Administration will unlock
    tens of billions of dollars for small manufacturers. Specifically,
    $10 billion in ARP funds deployed by the Treasury Department under
    the new and improved State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI)
    will be leveraged into more than $70 billion in additional lending
    and investment for small businesses, including small manufacturers.
    Nearly a quarter of funding from the last round of SSBCI supported
    manufacturing companies.  To ensure small manufacturers can access
    this program, the Treasury Department will convene state, local,
    territorial, and Tribal governments this Spring to share ideas and
    highlight best practices, building to a roundtable of elected
    officials and other stakeholders later this year to highlight
    accomplishments. SBA will also promote and prioritize licenses for
    Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) committed to providing
    capital to domestic small business manufacturers. SBIC fund managers
    have financed over $14 billion in manufacturing-related businesses
    over the last decade, representing 24 percent of total dollars
    invested through the program during that period.  
-   **Advance the technological leadership of both small and large
    manufacturers.** U.S. technological leadership remains critical to
    building greater long-term resilience and global competitiveness,
    including innovations in manufacturing. The Administration will host
    a series of roundtables with the 16 Manufacturing USA institutes
    focused on scaling innovative technologies, promoting sector-based
    regional workforce initiatives, partnering with unions, and
    supporting small- and medium-sized suppliers, to develop specific
    proposals for how the institutes can strengthen our supply chains.
    SBA will also host the inaugural America’s Seed Fund Start-up Expo
    to support Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awardees
    seeking to access resources and assistance they need to help them
    commercialize and manufacture innovative technologies addressing
    critical supply chain challenges. Additionally, SBA will establish a
    committee of industry leaders to advise on transformative inventions
    and innovations from U.S.-based startups and established small
    businesses, as well as vulnerabilities in commercializing and
    financing domestic innovation.  
-   **Leverage the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to move critical goods
    from ships to shelves faster and more affordably.** Outdated
    infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic have strained the capacity
    of the entire goods movement supply chain, resulting in
    unprecedented snarls in global freight and logistics supply chains.
    Recognizing the importance of port investments for U.S.
    competitiveness, President Biden’s BIL is the single largest Federal
    investment in our ports in U.S. history. The Department of
    Transportation (DOT) is announcing the opening of the $450 million
    Port Infrastructure Development Grant program, the first and only
    Federal grant program wholly dedicated to investments in port
    infrastructure. In the coming weeks, DOT will also release notices
    of funding opportunity for the BIL’s INFRA, MEGA, CRISI, and grade
    crossing grant programs, which will fund a diverse set of
    transportation infrastructure projects of regional and national
    significance, including those that support the movement of freight
    and improve supply chain resilience. And, DOT will develop and issue
    revised State Freight Plan Guidance that incorporates updated
    requirements from BIL and requires consideration of cargo flows, the
    impacts of e-commerce, and supply chain resilience in directing BIL
    funding.  
-   **Invest in sustainable domestic production and processing of
    critical minerals**. From rare earths in our electric motors and
    generators to the carbon fiber used for airplanes, the United States
    must ensure we are not dependent on foreign or single sources for
    critical minerals. To that end, this week the Biden-Harris
    Administration [announced
    plans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/22/fact-sheet-securing-a-made-in-america-supply-chain-for-critical-minerals/)
    that will expand domestic rare earth processing; strengthen the
    National Defense Stockpile; [update mining
    regulations](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-launches-interagency-working-group-mining-reform)
    to ensure sustainable and responsible practices; and issue
    recommendations for [comprehensive
    reform](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/biden-harris-administration-fundamental-principles-for-domestic-mining-reform.pdf)
    of outdated mining laws. Through the BIL, the Department of Energy
    (DOE) will also demonstrate the feasibility of a full-scale
    integrated rare earth element extraction and separation facility and
    refinery from mine waste. Today, as part of the Mining Innovations
    for Negative Emissions Resources (MINER) Program, DOE is also
    releasing a $44 million funding opportunity to provide
    commercial-ready technologies that give the United States a net-zero
    or net negative emissions pathway toward increased domestic supplies
    of copper, nickel, lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, and other
    critical elements required for a clean energy transition.  These and
    other efforts to secure a reliable, sustainable, and diverse supply
    of critical minerals and materials will help the United States meet
    its climate goals while creating good paying jobs and boosting U.S.
    competitiveness.  
-   **Leverage the American Rescue Plan to jumpstart a more competitive,
    innovative, and resilient meat and poultry supply chain.** Over the
    last few decades, the meat and poultry processing sector has become
    dominated by a handful of large companies that control most of the
    business and most of the opportunities—raising prices and decreasing
    options for American families, while also squeezing out small
    businesses and entrepreneurs.  To increase competition and create
    more options for producers and consumers, the Department of
    Agriculture (USDA) is taking the next steps outlined in its
    [comprehensive action
    plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/03/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-action-plan-for-a-fairer-more-competitive-and-more-resilient-meat-and-poultry-supply-chain/)
    to create a more diverse and resilient supply chain, supporting
    farmers, ranchers, and workers alike. This action plan includes
    dedicating $1 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to expand
    independent processing capacity. At a press conference this morning,
    USDA will announce the opening of applications for the first tranche
    of grants for new processing capacity and detail a partnership with
    DOL’s Goods Jobs Initiative to support the food processing
    workforce.  In the weeks ahead, USDA will also announce $10 million
    in technical assistance funding to establish an initial network,
    with additional efforts to follow, for a total of $25 million for
    technical assistance. Through that partnership, the agencies will
    improve workers’ access to information about their rights, engage
    with employers to improve job quality and workforce pathways,
    support workforce development such as Registered Apprenticeships,
    and provide technical assistance on grants, contracts, and other
    investments intended to improve job quality.   

**<u>Institutionalize Supply Chain Resilience Throughout the Federal
Government:</u>**  
Supply chain resilience must become a lasting focus for businesses and
governments alike. In addition to the SCDTF, which has broken down silos
and coordinated collaboration between agencies to respond to supply
chain disruptions, the Administration has begun to formally
institutionalize supply chain resilience throughout the Federal
government. Earlier this month, DOE announced an internal realignment to
effectively deploy more than $60 billion in BIL funding for clean energy
infrastructure and deployment. The Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) announced a new dedicated public health industrial base
expansion and supply chain management office. And, as highlighted above,
DOT will now work with states to include supply chain resilience in
their State Freight Plans, so that state-led infrastructure planning and
investments bolster the resilience of the entire goods movement chain –
across ports, trucking, rail, and warehousing. To build on this
progress, the Administration is announcing new actions to
institutionalize supply chain resilience throughout the Federal
government. Specifically, the Biden-Harris Administration will:

-   **Bolster the American manufacturing of critical goods through new
    reforms under the Buy American Act.** President Biden believes that
    when the U.S. government spends Federal dollars, it should buy
    American-made products. During his first week in office he issued
    Executive Order 14005 to close loopholes and raise standards in the
    Buy American rules that govern Federal contracts. The White House
    Office of Management and Budget will soon issue a new Buy American
    rule that will create a new category of critical products that will
    be eligible for enhanced price preferences. By allowing the Federal
    government to pay an additional premium for critical domestic-made
    products and components essential to the Administration’s supply
    chain resiliency strategy, the new rule will create a steady source
    of demand that will help catalyze domestic production and bolster
    thin supply chains. Once implemented, American manufacturers will
    have an easier time securing the government contracts they need to
    expand their operations and create good-paying jobs.  
-   **Fully establish a Defense Production Act Investment Program to
    build and expand the health resources industrial base.** The United
    States remains critically dependent on imports for a range of key
    pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients—the
    primary ingredients of generic drugs. During the pandemic, HHS
    established a Defense Production Act (DPA) office to ensure supply
    chain scarcity and shortages did not impede national efforts to
    combat COVID-19. Now, HHS will fully establish a DPA Title III
    Program to provide loans, grants, and other financing to build and
    expand the health resources industrial base. This program will
    ensure timely availability of essential domestic industrial
    resources; establish the necessary authorities and mechanisms to
    leverage the proposed Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response
    Office for management of the Public Health Industrial Base; support
    extended long-term contracts, on-hand inventory, and vendor-managed
    inventory; and ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity.  
-   **Bolster clean energy manufacturing through implementation of the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.** As part of the first ever Energy
    Sector Industrial Base strategy*, America’s Strategy to Secure the
    Supply Chain for a Robust Clean Energy Transition*, DOE is executing
    dozens of lines of work to accelerate domestic clean energy
    manufacturing. These include creating a new Manufacturing and Energy
    Supply Chains Office to strengthen and secure the energy supply
    chains needed to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure and
    support the clean energy transition. Amongst many other activities,
    DOE is establishing four Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs and supporting
    the electric-vehicle battery materials supply chain. And today, as
    part of the Mining Innovations for Negative Emissions Resource
    Recovery (MINER) Program, DOE is releasing a $44 million funding
    opportunity to provide commercial-ready technologies that give the
    United States a net-zero or net negative emissions pathway toward
    increased domestic supplies of copper, nickel, lithium, cobalt, rare
    earth elements, and other critical elements required for a clean
    energy transition.  
-   **Restore U.S. global leadership on supply chains.**  President
    Biden is committed to working with U.S. trading partners to address
    the immediate supply chain challenges from this unprecedented
    economic recovery and building long-term supply chain resilience for
    the future. Later this year, the Biden-Harris Administration will
    host a Ministerial-level Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience to
    address near-term bottlenecks and tackle long-term challenges,
    building on the Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience that
    President Biden held in October with the European Union and over a
    dozen like-minded countries. The Biden-Harris Administration will
    also partner with North American trading partners to prepare for
    future crises and mitigate resulting supply chain disruptions.
    Through the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue, the United
    States and Mexico will establish a joint list of critical sectors
    involved in cross-border supply chains and create procedures to
    maintain continuity of supply chains in the event of times of
    crisis. The Competitiveness Committee of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
    Agreement will also work to define essential industries and
    effective approaches for supply chains, including through
    information-sharing activities, providing advice and
    recommendations, identifying priority projects and policies, and
    designating a contact point for these efforts. And, as agreed to at
    the North American Leaders Summit in November, the United States,
    Mexico, and Canada will hold a trilateral supply chain coordination
    meeting by Summer 2022 to explore trilateral opportunities on supply
    chains based on results from the bilateral supply chain working
    groups.

There is still more to be done. To build on these investments and spur
more private-sector investment in the United States, the President is
committed to passing comprehensive competitiveness legislation like the
COMPETES/USICA bills put forward in the House and the Senate to
strengthen our supply chains, grow domestic manufacturing, and help us
outcompete China and the rest of the world. This legislation, combined
with the critical investments included in the Build Back Better Act,
will help to deliver on the President’s mission to expand the productive
capacity of our economy and lower costs for families.
