Today, the White House hosted a historic convening of Black Cabinet
members as part of Black History Month celebrations. The convening
included a discussion moderated by Senior Advisor to the President
Cedric Richmond.  During the discussion, officials noted their
commitment to the President’s whole-of-government approach to advancing
racial equity and support for underserved communities through the
federal government and spoke to the individual experiences each brings
to the departments they lead. The conversation also highlighted the
significance of Black leadership in key policy areas including military
service, housing, environment, foreign affairs, and the economy.

Participants included Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Michael Regan, United States Mission to the United Nations
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Council of Economic Advisors Chair
Cecilia Rouse and Office of Management and Budget Acting Director
Shalanda Young.

On January 31, President Biden issued a
[proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/01/31/a-proclamation-on-national-black-history-month-2022/)
calling on the nation to celebrate the contributions of Black Americans,
honor the legacies and achievements of generations past, reckon with
centuries of injustice and confront those injustices that still fester
today. In the proclamation, the President also reaffirmed his commitment
to advancing equity, racial justice, and opportunity for Black
Americans, which began by building a Federal Government that looks like
America.
