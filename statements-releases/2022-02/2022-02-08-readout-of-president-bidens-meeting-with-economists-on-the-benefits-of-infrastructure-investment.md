  \ of Infrastructure\_Investment"
---
 
The President and members of his economic team today met with Dr. Edward
Glaeser and Dr. Janet Currie to discuss the economics of infrastructure
investment.  The historic investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law are a key component of the President’s plan to build on the historic
economic recovery and boost the capacity of the economy in order to
promote growth, expand economic opportunity, and reduce costs for
families. Dr. Glaeser, who is the Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor of
Economics and Chair of the Department of Economics at Harvard
University, briefed the President on the economic benefits of
investments in infrastructure and the importance of project selection
and efficient implementation of infrastructure investment. Dr. Currie,
the Henry Putman Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton
University, briefed the President on the effect of lead exposure on a
range of outcomes for children. Both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
and the President’s Build Back Better plan include historic investments
to reduce lead exposure. In the months ahead, the President will
continue to meet with experts and leaders in a range of fields, as he
continues to execute on an economic strategy that delivers for the
American people.
