*On National Energy Assistance Day, White House Coordinates Outreach and
Encourages Families to Enroll in Assistance Programs*

The White House is joining states, localities, advocacy groups, and
utilities in encouraging American families to apply for programs that
can help hard-pressed families address home energy costs. These
resources include the record funding for the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provided by the Biden-Harris Administration
this year and funds to reduce home energy costs in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. In addition to outreach efforts across the
Administration, the White House also announced information encouraging
states to use all available American Rescue Plan resources for energy
assistance and funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to reduce
home energy costs.

-   **Funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Are Building on the
    American Rescue Plan’s Investment That More Than Doubled LIHEAP
    Funding:** The Biden-Harris Administration has delivered nearly $8
    billion in LIHEAP funding nationally, more than doubling typical
    annual appropriations—thanks to an additional $4.5 billion provided
    by President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. Earlier this month, the
    White House announced state-by-state breakdown of this funding (see
    below for total awards to date by state/territory). Last week, the
    Administration also [distributed the first $100 million
    installment](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2022/president-bidens-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-directs-100-million-lower-heating)
    of a five-year, $500 million investment in LIHEAP provided by
    President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These funds
    represent the largest investment in a single year since the program
    was established in 1981. These resources are already allowing states
    across the country to provide more home energy relief to low income
    Americans than ever before.

<!-- -->

-   **The American Rescue Plan Provided Additional Historic Resources
    for Utility Relief Including the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA)
    Program and State & Local Fiscal Recovery Fund:** The American
    Rescue Plan provided other critical resources that states and
    localities can use to address home energy costs. ERA programs, which
    received an additional $21.5 billion in funding from the American
    Rescue Plan, can provide help with past-due utility bills or ongoing
    assistance with energy costs to help distressed renters avoid
    shut-offs and keep current on expenses. State & Local Fiscal
    Recovery Funds can also be deployed to help deliver energy relief to
    families.

<!-- -->

-   **The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Made Historic Investments to
    Reduce Home Energy Costs:** The President’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law invested a historic $3.5 billion in the
    Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program, reducing
    energy costs for hundreds of thousands of low-income households by
    increasing the energy efficiency of their homes.

The Administration is announcing the following:

-   **<u>Outreach in Support of National Energy Assistance Day:</u>**
    Today, the Department of Health and Human Services released a [radio
    announcement in
    English](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/podcast/liheap-celebrates-national-energy-assistance-day-2022-audio-news-release)
    and
    [Spanish](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/podcast/liheap-celebrates-national-energy-assistance-day-2022-spanish)
    and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XebYS0OEm0) to
    encourage families to apply for LIHEAP. The radio announcement will
    air over 2,000 times and reach an estimated 36 million listeners.
    Yesterday, the Department also released a [Dear Colleague
    Letter](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-dcl-2022-06-national-energy-assistance-day-fy2022)
    to LIHEAP Administrators encouraging their participation in National
    Energy Assistance Day. Other agencies across the Administration are
    also celebrating National Energy Awareness Day by disseminating
    information about assistance programs, including LIHEAP and ERA. The
    White House also coordinated outreach to state and local elected
    officials as well as other stakeholders.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Information on Using the Pandemic Emergency Assistance Fund for
    Utility Assistance:</u>** The American Rescue Plan created a $1
    billion fund for states, territories and tribes that is available to
    provide cash or targeted assistance to needy families. Today, the
    Department of Health and Human Services [released a
    brief](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ofa/peaf_energy_security_brief_1_27_2022_508.pdf)
    on how to use these funds to respond to winter utility needs.

<!-- -->

-   **<span style="text-decoration: underline">Significant Support
    Distributed Through American Rescue Plan Housing Programs:</span>**
    As of the end of 2021, well over $25 billion of funds have been
    obligated to assist households across the country through the ERA
    program, which provides both rental and utility assistance to
    households in need. Treasury continues to promote best practices
    such as avoiding shut-offs for eligible households and allowing
    self-attestation to document substantial increases in home heating
    or other utility costs to support eligibility. Treasury is also
    working with states and Tribes to distribute $9.8 billion in funding
    for the Homeowners Assistance Fund, with a majority of approved
    plans including utility assistance to homeowners in need.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Best Practices on Coordination with Utility Providers:</u>**
    Yesterday, the Department of Health and Human Services and the
    Treasury Department hosted a webinar with over 700 utility
    assistance program administrators and utility providers from across
    the country to discuss how programs including LIHEAP and ERA can
    coordinate with utility providers to increase the efficiency and
    reach of their programs. Panelists from across the country shared
    their perspectives on effective coordination between utility
    assistance administrators and utility providers and highlighted a
    range of best practices.

Today’s announcements build on the Administration’s previous actions to
ensure these historic resources are distributed swiftly and equitably:

-   **<u>Encouraged States to Plan Early:</u>** In November, the White
    House [called on states, localities, and tribes to plan
    early](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/18/fact-sheet-biden-administration-deploys-american-rescue-plan-funds-to-protect-americans-from-rising-home-heating-costs-calls-on-utility-companies-to-prevent-shut-offs-this-winter/)
    to distribute American Rescue Plan funds to address home energy
    costs this winter.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Secured Commitments from Utilities to Avoid Shut-offs and
    Expedite Aid:</u>** The White House has [called on utility
    companies](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/18/fact-sheet-biden-administration-deploys-american-rescue-plan-funds-to-protect-americans-from-rising-home-heating-costs-calls-on-utility-companies-to-prevent-shut-offs-this-winter/)
    to prevent devastating utility shut-offs and help expedite the
    delivery of unprecedented federal aid. [In January, the White House
    announced](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/07/biden-administration-announces-state-by-state-funding-to-address-home-energy-costs/)
    that it has already welcomed commitments from fourteen major utility
    companies across the country, including **Atlantic City Electric,
    Baltimore Gas and Electric, ComEd, Delmarva Power, DTE Energy,
    Eversource, Green Mountain Power, National Grid, NorthWestern
    Energy, Pacific Gas & Electric, PECO, Pepco, Portland General
    Electric** and **Vermont Gas**, as well as the delivered fuel trade
    association **NEFI**.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Called for Coordination of LIHEAP and Emergency Rental
    Assistance Relief to Families:</u>** To maximize the impact of home
    energy assistance, the White House called for states, localities,
    and tribes to coordinate across programs including LIHEAP and ERA.
    The Department of Health and Human Services and the Treasury
    Department have issued guidance and co-hosted webinars on LIHEAP and
    ERA best practices that attracted 500 administrators – collectively
    representing 47 states, the District of Columbia, and 72 Tribal
    governments. More than 50 percent of these administrators now report
    they are coordinating across these programs.

Households in need of help with their energy bills can identify
resources in their area at [EnergyHelp.us](http://energyhelp.us) or call
the National Energy Assistance Referral hotline at 1-866-674-6327.
