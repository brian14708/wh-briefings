title: "Statement by President\_Biden Four Years After the Parkland\_Shooting"
---
 
On February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2018, a gunman stole the lives of 14
students and 3 educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in
Parkland, Florida. It was the deadliest high school shooting in a nation
with far too many of them, and it left another community — and our
country — shattered by grief.

On this difficult day, we mourn with the Parkland families whose lives
were upended in an instant; who had to bury a piece of their soul deep
in the earth. We pray too for those still grappling with wounds both
visible and invisible. And, as we remember those lost in Parkland, we
also stand with Americans in every corner of our country who have lost
loved ones to gun violence or had their lives forever altered by a
shooting, in tragedies that made headlines and in ones that did not.

Out of the heartbreak of Parkland a new generation of Americans all
across the country marched for our lives and towards a better, safer
America for us all. Together, this extraordinary movement is making sure
that the voices of victims and survivors and responsible gun owners are
louder than the voices of gun manufacturers and the National Rifle
Association.

My Administration stands with those working to end this epidemic of gun
violence. I have put forward a comprehensive plan to reduce gun crime
that includes curbing the proliferation of “ghost” guns, cracking down
on gun dealers who willfully violate the law, issuing model extreme risk
protection order legislation for states, and promoting safe firearm
storage, among other efforts. The Department of Justice is also helping
more cities adopt smart law enforcement models like the one I recently
saw in New York City, in which federal, state, and local law enforcement
work together to share intelligence and remove shooters from our
streets.

I’ve asked Congress to pass a budget that provides an additional half
billion dollars for proven strategies we know reduce violent crime —
accountable community policing and community violence interventions. I
have also requested increased funding for the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals. And Congress
must do much more — beginning with requiring background checks on all
gun sales, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and
eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers.

We can never bring back those we’ve lost. But we can come together to
fulfill the first responsibility of our government and our democracy: to
keep each other safe. For Parkland, for all those we’ve lost, and for
all those left behind, it is time to uphold that solemn obligation.
