title: A Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency with
  Respect to the Situation in and in Relation to Burma
---
 
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in and
in relation to Burma declared in Executive Order 14014 of February 10,
2021, is to continue in effect beyond February 10, 2022.

The situation in and in relation to Burma, and in particular the
February 1, 2021 coup, in which the military overthrew the
democratically elected civilian government of Burma and unjustly
arrested and detained government leaders, politicians, human rights
defenders, journalists, and religious leaders, thereby rejecting the
will of the people of Burma as expressed in elections held in November
2020 and undermining the country’s democratic transition and rule of
law, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore,
I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 14014 with respect to Burma.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

February 7, 2022.
