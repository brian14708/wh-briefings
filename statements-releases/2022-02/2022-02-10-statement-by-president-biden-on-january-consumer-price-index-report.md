My two top economic priorities have been to create a growing economy
with more good-paying jobs, and to lower the prices Americans have faced
from the global problem of inflation related to the pandemic. We have
seen historic success on the first priority, with the greatest year of
job growth in history, Americans finding better jobs, better wages, and
better benefits, along with the fastest economic growth in decades. On
higher prices, we have been using every tool at our disposal, and while
today is a reminder that Americans’ budgets are being stretched in ways
that create real stress at the kitchen table, there are also signs that
we will make it through this challenge.

While today’s report is elevated, forecasters continue to project
inflation easing substantially by the end of 2022. And fortunately we
saw positive real wage growth last month, and moderation in auto prices,
which have made up about a quarter of headline inflation over the last
year. We separately saw good news with new unemployment claims
continuing to decline. That’s a sign of the real progress we’ve made in
getting Americans back to work over the last year.

My administration will continue to be all hands on deck to win this
fight. We will continue to rebuild our infrastructure and manufacturing,
so we can make more in America and strengthen our supply chains here at
home. We will continue to fight to lower costs in areas that have held
back families and working people for decades, from prescription drugs to
child care and elder care to their energy costs. And we will continue to
promote more competition to make our markets more competitive and give
consumers more choices.
