  Russia"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Vladimir Putin
of Russia about Russia’s escalating military buildup on the borders of
Ukraine. President Biden was clear that, if Russia undertakes a further
invasion of Ukraine, the United States together with our Allies and
partners will respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs on
Russia. President Biden reiterated that a further Russian invasion of
Ukraine would produce widespread human suffering and diminish Russia’s
standing. President Biden was clear with President Putin that while the
United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy, in full
coordination with our Allies and partners, we are equally prepared for
other scenarios.
