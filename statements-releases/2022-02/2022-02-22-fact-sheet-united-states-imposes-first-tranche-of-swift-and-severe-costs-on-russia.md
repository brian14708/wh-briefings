  \ on\_Russia"

Yesterday, Russian President Vladimir Putin of Russia recognized two
regions of Ukraine as independent states and today claimed that
recognition to include all of the Donbas region. The Russian Parliament
also authorized the deployment of additional Russian forces into this
Ukrainian territory. 

As President Biden and our Allies and partners have made clear, we will
impose significant costs on Russia for Russia’s actions. Today, the
Administration is implementing the first tranche of sanctions that go
far beyond 2014, in coordination with allies and partners in the
European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia. And as
President Biden promised, we worked with Germany to ensure the Nord
Stream 2 pipeline will not move forward.

The President has directed the following measures:

-   **Full blocking sanctions on two significant Russian financial
    institutions.** The Secretary of the Treasury will impose full
    blocking sanctions on two large state-owned Russian financial
    institutions that provide key services crucial to financing the
    Kremlin and the Russian military: Vnesheconombank and Promsvyazbank
    and their subsidiaries. Collectively, these institutions hold more
    than $80 billion in assets and finance the Russian defense sector
    and economic development. These measures will freeze their assets in
    the United States, prohibit U.S. individuals and businesses from
    doing any transactions with them, shut them out of the global
    financial system, and foreclose access to the U.S. dollar.

-   **Expanded sovereign debt prohibitions restricting U.S. individuals
    and firms from participation in secondary markets for new debt
    issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National
    Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Finance
    of the Russian Federation.**  These prohibitions will cut off the
    Russian government from a key avenue by which it raises capital to
    fund its priorities and will increase future financing costs. It
    denies Russia access to key U.S. markets and investors.
-   **Full blocking sanctions on five Russian elites and their family
    members: Aleksandr Bortnikov (and his son, Denis), Sergei Kiriyenko
    (and his son, Vladimir), and Promsvyazbank CEO Petr Fradkov.** These
    individuals and their relatives directly benefit from their
    connections with the Kremlin. Other Russian elites and their family
    members are on notice that additional actions could be taken against
    them.
-   **Today,** **the Secretary of the Treasury will determine that any
    institution in the financial services sector of the Russian
    Federation economy is a target for further sanctions.** Over 80% of
    Russia’s daily foreign exchange transactions globally are in U.S.
    dollars and roughly half of Russia’s international trade is
    conducted in dollars. With this action,no Russian financial
    institution is safe from our measures, including the largest banks. 

These actions come in addition to steps being taken by our Allies and
partners and represent our first response to Russia’s actions. As
President Biden made clear, Russia will pay an even steeper price if it
continues its aggression.
