title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Richard\_Blum"

Dick Blum believed we could build a world that respected the rights and
essential dignity of all people. As a businessman, a Regent of the
University of California, a philanthropist, and an advocate for human
rights, Dick dedicated his life to furthering that vision. Our nation
and our world are better for his work.  
   
Over the years, I always appreciated Dick’s compassion and boundless
energy.  
   
Today, the Second Gentleman and I are holding Senator Feinstein and her
family in our hearts and prayers.
