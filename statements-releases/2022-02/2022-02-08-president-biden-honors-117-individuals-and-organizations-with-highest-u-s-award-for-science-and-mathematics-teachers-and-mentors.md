title: President Biden Honors 117 Individuals and Organizations with Highest U.S.
  Award for Science and Mathematics Teachers and Mentors
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden named 117 teachers, mentors, and mentoring
organizations as recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in
Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST) and Presidential Awards for
Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM).
These awards honor the dedication, hard work, and important role that
America’s teachers and mentors play in supporting learners who will be
future STEM professionals, including climate scientists, mathematicians,
innovators, space explorers, and engineers. 

“I am deeply appreciative of the inspiration that America’s teachers and
mentors provide every day to support the next generation of STEM
professionals,” **President Biden said.** “The dedication these
individuals and organizations have demonstrated to prepare students for
careers in STEM fields, during what has been a difficult time for
teachers, students, and families, plays a huge role in American
innovation and competitiveness.  The work that teachers and mentors do
ensures that our Nation’s children are able to unlock — for themselves
and all of us – a world of possibilities.”

The benefits of a quality STEM education fail to reach every learner in
this country often due to racial, gender, economic, and geographic
disparities. STEM teachers and mentors serve as powerful catalysts for
developing the vast potential of our Nation’s learners. PAEMST honors
STEM teachers for the commitment they bring to the classroom and for
their efforts to meet the learning needs of all their students. PAESMEM
recognizes mentors for their efforts to inspire and encourage
individuals from underserved and underrepresented communities in STEM
and their efforts to ensure that all Americans can fully participate in
science, mathematics and technology regardless of gender, race,
resources or geography.

**Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching
(PAEMST)**

Established in 1983, PAEMST is the highest award kindergarten through
12th grade mathematics and science (including computer science) teachers
can receive from the U.S. government. Each year, the award criteria
alternates years between kindergarten through sixth grade and seventh
through 12th grade teachers. This year, kindergarten through sixth grade
teachers will receive Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics
and Science Teaching (PAEMST).

Award recipients over the years represent schools and organizations from
all 50 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Department of Defense
Education Activity (DODEA) schools, and the U.S. territories (American
Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S.
Virgin Islands).

Nominees complete a rigorous application process that allows them to
demonstrate deep content knowledge and their ability to adapt to a broad
range of learners and teaching environments.

A panel of distinguished mathematicians, scientists and educators at the
state and national levels assess the applications before recommending
nominees to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
(OSTP). Teachers are selected based on their distinction in the
classroom and dedication to improving STEM education.

**Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and
Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM)**

PAESMEM recognizes the critical roles mentors play outside the
traditional classroom in the academic and professional development of
the future STEM workforce.

Colleagues, administrators, and students nominate individuals and
organizations for exemplary mentoring sustained over a minimum of five
years. Since 1995, PAESMEM has honored the hard work and dedication
mentors exhibit in broadening participation in STEM pathways.

Mentors support learners from the kindergarten through collegiate
levels, as well as those who recently have started their careers in
STEM. They share their expertise and guidance with learners, sometimes
through formal mentoring programs. Learners are often from
underrepresented and underserved communities in STEM.

The National Science Foundation (NSF), which manages PAEMST and PAESMEM
on behalf of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
(OSTP), provides each recipient $10,000.  Award recipients also receive
a certificate signed by the President. For more information, please
