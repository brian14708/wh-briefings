  \ of the Bipartisan Infrastructure\_Law"

Last week, White House Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch
Landrieu and other White House officials hosted two virtual roundtables
with Native American Tribal and Alaskan Native leaders to discuss how
the Administration will deliver for tribal communities and build a
better America by implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. 
Landrieu also joined Secretary Deb Haaland in a series of Tribal
Consultations at the Department of the Interior to receive input and
recommendations from Tribal leaders on the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law.   

White House officials outlined the President’s commitment to ensuring
that federal infrastructure funding reaches Tribal communities to expand
broadband, including with [new

this week, invest in clean drinking water and water infrastructure,
repair roads and bridges with a focus on climate change mitigation,
resilience, and equity, deliver the largest investment in tackling
legacy pollution in American history.

Tribal leaders shared a number of ideas about how investments of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law can provide a transformational change for
their communities.  Participants emphasized the importance of continued
meaningful consultation and dialogue to help meet the needs of their
communities along with Tribal Nations to be eligible for competitive
funding from the law.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild Tribal roads, bridges and
rails, expand access to clean drinking water for Native communities,
ensure every Native American has access to high-speed internet, tackle
the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and invest in Tribal
communities that have too often been left behind by investing more than
$13 billion directly in Tribal communities across the country. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also makes Tribal communities eligible for
billions more in much-needed investments.

-   Chief Gary Batton (Choctaw Nation, OK)
-   President Kevin Killer (Oglala Sioux Tribe, SD)
-   President Shannon Holsey (Stock Bridge Munsee Band of Mohican
    Indians, WI)
