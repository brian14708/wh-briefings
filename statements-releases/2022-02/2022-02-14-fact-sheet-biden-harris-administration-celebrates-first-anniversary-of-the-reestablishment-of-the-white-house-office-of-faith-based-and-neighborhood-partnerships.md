title: "FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Celebrates First Anniversary\
  \ of the Reestablishment of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood\
  \ Partnerships"
---
 
*Partnerships have helped heal, unite, and rebuild, with expanded
collaborations expected in the year ahead *

A [year ago
today](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-reestablishes-the-white-house-office-of-faith-based-and-neighborhood-partnerships/),
President Biden signed an executive order reestablishing the White House
Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and urged the Office
to “work with leaders of different faiths and backgrounds who are the
frontlines of their communities in crisis and who can help us heal,
unite, and rebuild.” In keeping with its proud bipartisan tradition, the
Office’s mission is to promote partnerships to serve people in need by
working with interested religious and secular leaders and
organizations.  
  
To advance this mission, the White House Office has worked closely with
agency Centers for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships at the
Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS),
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Agriculture (USDA), Veterans
Affairs (VA), and Education (ED); the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID); and the Small Business Administration
(SBA); as well as staff at AmeriCorps, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and the Departments of Treasury (UST) and Commerce (DOC).
In turn, this team has partnered with faith and community leaders across
the nation and around the world.

Our country has made great progress thanks to neighborhood partnerships
and compassionate leaders of all faiths and beliefs, whether it was
hosting vaccination clinics, preventing evictions, helping to ensure
that children get back to school and workers get jobs, or countless
other acts of service. The Biden-Harris Administration is also working
tirelessly to advance policies promoting religious equity, diversity,
inclusion, and accessibility and protecting the fundamental right to
practice faith without fear, especially in light of the troubling rise
of antisemitic, xenophobic, and bigoted attacks against people of
faith—targeting synagogues, predominantly Black churches, and Muslim and
Sikh communities, among other communities. In addition, the
Administration has prioritized the cultivation of a spirit of welcome
for people of all religious, political, and ideological stripes; a
commitment to treating everyone with equal respect and dignity; and the
hard but essential work of building bridges across differences in
background and beliefs.  
  
Administration achievements that advance these partnerships and policies
include:
