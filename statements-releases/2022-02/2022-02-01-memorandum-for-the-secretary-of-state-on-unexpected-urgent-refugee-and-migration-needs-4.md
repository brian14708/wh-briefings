By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 2(c)(1) of the
Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 (22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1))
(MRAA), I hereby determine, pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the MRAA,
that it is important to the national interest to furnish assistance
under the MRAA in an amount not to exceed $1.2 billion from the United
States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund for the purpose
of meeting unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs to support
Operation Allies Welcome and related efforts by the Department of State,
including additional relocations of individuals at risk as a result of
the situation in Afghanistan and related expenses.  Such assistance may
be provided on a bilateral or multilateral basis as appropriate,
including through contributions to international organizations and
through funding to other nongovernmental organizations, governments, and
United States Government agencies.  
  
You are authorized and directed to submit this determination to the
Congress, along with the accompanying Justification, and to publish this
