title: "Background Press Call by a Senior Administration Official on the President\u2019\
  s Call with Russian President Vladimir Putin"

Via Teleconference

12:53 P.M. EST

MODERATOR:  Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.  Today’s call will
be on background, attributed to a “senior administration official.”  And
contents will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call.   
   
Today’s speaker will be \[senior administration official\], who will
have some comments at the top and then take a few questions.  
   
Over to you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  And thanks, everybody, for
taking the time.   
   
So, the call between the two presidents was professional and
substantive.  It lasted a bit over an hour.  There was no fundamental
change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks, but
we believe that we have put ideas on the table that would be in our and
our allies’ interest to pursue, that would enhance European security,
and that would also address some of Russia’s stated concerns, just as we
have been clear that we are committed to upholding Ukraine’s
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the rights of states to choose
their own security arrangements.   
   
But it remains unclear whether Russia is interested in pursuing its
goals diplomatically as opposed to through the use of force.   
   
We remain committed to keeping the prospect of de-escalation through
diplomacy alive.  But we are also clear-eyed about the prospects of
that, given the readily apparent steps Russia is taking on the ground in
plain sight, right before our eyes.  Stakes — the stakes of this are too
high not to give Russia every chance to avoid an action that we believe
would be catastrophic.   
   
So, as always, we continue along two paths: diplomacy, including
maintaining close alignment with our partners and allies, as evidenced
by the President’s repeated bilateral engagements, including with
President Zelenskyy, his call yesterday with key allies, and today’s
call with President Putin, as well as other senior officials’ calls with
their counterparts in all of these same categories.   
   
Meanwhile, we are intensifying our efforts to deter Russia and to impose
costs should it decide to go ahead with military action anyway.   
   
You will have seen the announcement yesterday of an additional 3,000
U.S. forces headed to Poland.  Our deliveries of security assistance to
Ukraine have continued in recent days, and our discussions with the EU,
UK, Canadian, and other partners and Allies to ensure that we are
prepared to immediately impose severe financial sanctions and export
controls are also reaching a culmination point.   
   
We are continuing to reduce our diplomatic presence in Kyiv, as you’ve
seen, and the President was very direct with President Putin about our
concern for the safety and security of Americans still in Ukraine.   
   
Whatever Russia decides, our assessment is that their efforts to improve
their strategic position are already failing and that this will only be
exacerbated should they decide to take military action.   
   
The transatlantic relationship is more closely aligned than it has been
in quite some time.  NATO is stronger and more purposeful.  Russia is
already finding itself increasingly isolated from the wider world and
more dependent on China, having together revealed a fundamentally
different worldview at odds with the principled, affirmative,
international law-abiding worldview and values that we stand for.   
   
And Russia is finding itself on defense in the information space, given
our own transparency about its intention.   
   
Over time, if Russia invades, this list will also include a severe
economic cost that I’ve already described and irrevocable reputational
damage caused by taking innocent lives for a bloody war choice.   
   
The two presidents agreed that our teams will stay engaged in the days
ahead.  Russia may decide to proceed with military action anyway. 
Indeed, that is a distinct possibility.   
   
If it does, the damage to Ukraine, to European security, and, yes, to
Russia will be profound.  That is an outcome President Biden believes we
should continue to work hard to avert.  
   
Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Operator, we’re ready for questions now.  
   
Q    Thank you so much for doing the call.  Could you talk a little bit
about, you know, anything that President Biden brought to the table
today in terms of proposals, as far as an off-ramp that he thinks can
get us to de-escalation?  And then, could you also talk a little bit
about if you had any signs that an operation was more imminent than
thought before?  Thank you.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Trevor.  So, look, our view is
that we have brought serious, substantive ideas to the diplomatic table
for a period of weeks now.  Many of those ideas are in the public domain
already.  We have offered those directly to the Russians in diplomatic
discussions.  We have developed them in close consultation with our
partners and Allies.  And President Biden continued to take that
approach in the call with President Putin.  
   
We have also been very clear that our strong preference is not to
negotiate in public because we don’t believe that that is the best way
to find a path to de-escalation, which is our main priority for these
diplomatic conversations.   
   
So, I am not going to get into very many of the details of this portion
of the conversation, but I would say the President continued down the
path that we have been on for quite some time, which is a mode of
problem solving and finding solutions that are in our interest, the
interest of our partners and Allies, and that can address at least some
of the concerns that Russia has raised.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you for doing this, \[senior administration official\]. 
Two questions.  You said that an attack was a “distinct possibility.” 
The tone of the briefing yesterday was that the attack was imminent and
the decision had been taken.  Can you elaborate on that?  
   
And then, in terms of continuing to provide Ukraine with military
equipment, would that continue after a military attack by Russia, and
might the nature of that support change?  I’m thinking of things like
anti-aircraft weapons and so on.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, I guess I’d say two things: I would
direct you to comments that my colleague, Jake Sullivan, made on this
notion of whether President Putin has made a decision.  You know, I
think the honest answer to that question is we don’t have full
visibility into President Putin’s decision making.  You’d have to direct
that question to the Kremlin or to President Putin himself.   
   
But, you know, we are not basing our assessment of this on what the
Russians say publicly.  We are basing this assessment on what we are
seeing on the ground with our own eyes, which is a continued Russian
build-up on the border with Ukraine and no meaningful evidence of
de-escalation or, really, of any interest in de-escalation.  So, our
sense is that the trends that we’ve been seeing and talking about for
many weeks now are continuing.  And, you know, beyond that, I don’t
think we have any real insights to offer.  
   
As to our plans going forward, I think President Biden and other
officials have been clear that should Russia continue down the path to
escalation, the United States will continue to increase our support to
Ukraine to enable it to defend itself.  And, you know, that approach has
not changed.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks.  So, I’m wondering if you can talk a little bit about
whether or not the alleged false-flag plans were discussed in the call,
and what — if so, if you can characterize Putin’s response at all.  
   
And also, there were reports of a sort of close encounter between
Russian and American submarines today, and I’m wondering if they
discussed that as well.  Thanks.    
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, on your first point, I mean, I
think, as a general matter, you can conclude that the issues that we
raised concerns about publicly are raised privately between the two
presidents.  They have conversations that are quite direct, I would say,
on both sides.  And so, if there’s an issue that we have been bringing
to your attention through briefings and in other fora, you can conclude
that the presidents have widely discussed that as well.  
   
But beyond that, I don’t want to get into the specifics of what we
raised, and certainly not — I certainly don’t go — we don’t go down the
road of characterizing President Putin’s response.  That’s just not
something we tend to do with the other sides of these conversations in
these readouts.  
   
On this close encounter, I would really direct you to the Pentagon for
that.  You know, I don’t have any information to provide about that on
this call.  
   
MODERATOR:  All right, thanks, everyone.  We have to wrap now.  With the
conclusion of the call, the embargo is lifted.   
   
A friendly reminder, we’re on background, attributed to a “senior
administration official.”  Thanks all.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.
