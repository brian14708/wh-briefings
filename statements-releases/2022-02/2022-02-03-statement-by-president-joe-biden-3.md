Last night at my direction, U.S. military forces in the northwest Syria
successfully undertook a counterterrorism operation to protect the
American people and our Allies, and make the world a safer place. Thanks
to the skill and bravery of our Armed Forces, we have taken off the
battlefield Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi—the leader of ISIS. All
Americans have returned safely from the operation. I will deliver
remarks to the American people later this morning. May God protect our
troops.
