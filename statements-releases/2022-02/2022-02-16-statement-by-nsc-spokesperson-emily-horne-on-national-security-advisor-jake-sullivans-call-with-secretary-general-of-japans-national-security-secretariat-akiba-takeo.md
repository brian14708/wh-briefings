National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with Akiba

postured to attack Ukraine at any time. The two discussed ongoing
diplomatic efforts by the international community and Sullivan
reiterated President Biden’s statement that the door remains open to
diplomacy. Sullivan thanked Secretary General Akiba for Japan’s recent
decision to divert some Liquefied Natural Gas supplies to Europe, and he
underscored the importance of a strong international response to any
further Russian aggression against Ukraine. Secretary General Akiba
emphasized that Japan is committed to closely coordinating with the
United States and the G-7 in response to further Russian aggression
against Ukraine.
