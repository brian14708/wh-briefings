 Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Munich, Germany to attend
the February 18-20 Munich Security Conference.  Building on the
Biden-Harris Administration’s intensive engagement with European allies
and partners, the Vice President’s engagements in Munich will
demonstrate our ironclad commitment to our NATO Allies, reaffirm our
shared interest in upholding the principles that have underpinned
European peace and security since World War II, and underscore our
commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
