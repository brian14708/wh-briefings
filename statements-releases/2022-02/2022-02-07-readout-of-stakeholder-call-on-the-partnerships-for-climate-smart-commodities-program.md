title: "Readout of Stakeholder Call on the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities\_\
  Program"

Today, White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and Department
of Agriculture Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation
Robert Bonnie led a call with farmers, ranchers, foresters, and climate
advocates to discuss the Department of Agriculture’s new Partnerships
for Climate-Smart Commodities program, which will invest $1 billion.

On the call, Advisor McCarthy tied the program back to President Biden’s
January 2021 Executive Order on “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad,” in which the President emphasized that our farmers, ranchers,
and foresters can help lead the fight against climate change by
advancing practices that reduce greenhouse gases and collect and store
carbon in soils, trees, and vegetation.  

Under Secretary Bonnie emphasized how the new Partnerships for
Climate-Smart Commodities program builds on a year of USDA efforts to
realize that vision. Through this $1 billion investment, USDA will fund
pilots and demonstration projects that encourage farmers and foresters
to deploy climate-smart production; implement innovative approaches to
measure and verify greenhouse gas benefits; and then connect those
climate-smart commodities to markets that value them. 

Advisor McCarthy noted that this initiative will amass more information
than has ever before been available regarding the climate benefits that
the U.S.’s agricultural and forestry sectors can generate. She predicted
that the program could be a “game changer” for the U.S., and for the
many nations around the world with significant agricultural and forestry
sectors. Both Under Secretary Bonnie and Advisor McCarthy also
emphasized that the program will focus on equity and the
Administration’s Justice40 commitment that substantial program benefits
flow to smaller and underserved producers.
