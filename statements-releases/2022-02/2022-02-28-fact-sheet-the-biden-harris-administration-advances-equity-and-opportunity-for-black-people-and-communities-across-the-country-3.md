title: "FACT SHEET:  The Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Black People and Communities Across the Country"
---
 
From the first day in office and every day since, the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken an historic approach to advancing racial
equity, including directing every agency across the whole of the federal
government to address the lasting impacts of systemic racism on Black
communities. For generations, entrenched disparities in our society and
economy, at times facilitated by the federal government, have made it
harder for Black Americans to have a fair shot at the American dream.
Centuries of injustice and decades of disinvestment in Black communities
not only undermine the American promise of equal opportunity, but also
keep our entire nation from reaching its potential.

After just one year in office, the Administration has delivered real and
lasting change and continues to work each day to deliver equitable
outcomes and opportunity for Black Americans.

**Economic Opportunity for Black Families and Communities.** By signing
into law the historic American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and implementing robust regulatory reform, President
Biden has helped create new economic opportunities for Black Americans
and made long overdue investments in Black communities. These
transformative policies and programs include:

-   **Providing Immediate Relief to Black People and Families through
    the American Rescue Plan.** The
    [ARP](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=5f43ffef0d&e=cf669202c8)
    provided cash relief directly to low- and middle-income Americans
    last year, and cut Black child poverty by
    [33.3](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/61ea09926280d03df62aa31d/1642727841927/Monthly-poverty-December-2021-CPSP.pdf)%,
    lifting more than 1 million Black children out of poverty in
    December 2021 alone. The President’s plans call for extending this
    critical tax cut, which expired in December.  In addition, the ARP
    increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits
    by 15% through September 2021. Beginning on October 1, 2021, USDA’s
    Thrifty Food Plan update increased SNAP benefits by $36.30 per
    person per month.

<!-- -->

-   **Reversing Decades of Disinvestment Through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law.** For years, politicians have talked about
    investing in our national infrastructure, but up until now they have
    failed to follow through. The lack of investment has fallen most
    heavily on Black and other communities of color. The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law will replace lead pipes, increase access to
    good-paying jobs, expand affordable high-speed internet, reliable
    public transit, clean drinking water, reconnect Black neighborhoods
    divided by legacy highway infrastructure and other resources to
    finally give Black communities a fair shot at the American Dream.

<!-- -->

-   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law permanently authorizes the
    Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) for the first time since
    its inception and elevates the agency head to the position of Under
    Secretary, granting the agency expanded power to support Black and
    other minority-owned businesses. The President’s plans would
    supercharge MBDA by funding it at $1.6 billion through 2029.
    -   EPA announced that it will allocate [$2.9
        billion](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=f840c7c7b9&e=cf669202c8)
        in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to states, Tribes, and
        territories for lead service line replacement in 2022. The 2022
        allocation is the first of five years of nearly $15 billion in
        dedicated EPA funding for lead service lines that states will
        receive through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. EPA will
        encourage states to use these funds to advance proactive lead
        line replacement programs with a particular focus on
        disadvantaged communities. Moving forward, EPA will prioritize
        communities with the highest lead levels and those with
        environmental justice concerns.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers the largest
        investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by
        cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned
        mine land, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. More than one
        in four Black Americans live within 3 miles of a [Superfund
        site](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=406ac95a00&e=cf669202c8)–
        a higher percentage than for Americans overall. No community
        deserves to have contamination near where they live, work, play,
        pray, and go to school.

<!-- -->

-   **Leveraging Federal Procurement to Narrow the Racial Wealth Gap for
    Black Entrepreneurs and Families.** Recognizing that the federal
    government spends more than $650 billion each year on purchasing
    goods and services, President Biden has directed agencies to use
    federal purchasing power to grow federal contracting with
    underserved small businesses. He has set a goal of increasing the
    share of federal contracting dollars to small disadvantaged
    businesses by 50% by 2025— projected to translate to an additional
    $100 billion to minority-owned businesses, and helping more
    Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams. In December 2021,
    The Administration further
    [announced](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=3914654cd1&e=cf669202c8)
    reforms to the federal procurement process to help meet the
    President’s ambitious target and deliver new opportunities for Black
    owned and other small disadvantaged businesses.

<!-- -->

-   **Extending a Lifeline to Struggling Small Businesses.** The
    American Rescue Plan provided emergency grants, lending, and
    investment to hard-hit small businesses – including Black businesses
    – so they can rehire and retain workers and purchase the health and
    sanitation equipment they need to keep workers safe. This includes
    the new $10 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative, which
    will provide growth capital to early stage companies and main street
    small businesses in economically disadvantaged areas, including
    minority-owned businesses.

<!-- -->

-   **Ensuring Black Homeowners Get Full Value for their Homes.** In
    June 2021, President Biden directed the launch of a
    first-of-its-kind interagency effort to address inequity in home
    appraisals and conduct rulemaking to aggressively combat housing
    discrimination. The effort, led by the Department of Housing and
    Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia Fudge and Domestic Policy
    Advisor Susan Rice, is developing a set of policy actions and
    recommendations for President Biden to redress racial bias in home
    appraisals that will soon be released.

<!-- -->

-   **Protecting Black Americans’ Access to Housing by Combating Housing
    Discrimination.** Following President Biden’s Presidential
    Memorandum directing his Administration to address racial
    discrimination in the housing market, HUD published an interim final
    rule in the Federal Register entitled “Restoring Affirmatively
    Furthering Fair Housing Definitions and Certifications” that
    requires HUD funding recipients to complete an assessment of fair
    housing issues, identify fair housing priorities and goals, and then
    commit to meaningful actions to meet those goals and remedy
    identified issues.

<!-- -->

-   **Helping Black Americans Stay in their Homes.** President Biden’s
    American Rescue Plan has helped millions of Americans, including
    Black Americans, stay in their homes by providing emergency rental
    assistance. Of the $25 billion in rental assistance that was spent
    in 2021, Black Americans represented more than 40% of aid
    recipients. In addition, the ARP is helping struggling homeowners
    catch up with their mortgage payments and utility costs through the
    Homeowner Assistance Fund. And, it provided additional funding for
    families and individuals who are recovering from or at risk of
    homelessness.

<!-- -->

-   **Assisting Black Land Owners in Resolving Title Issues.** An
    estimated 60% of Black-owned land in the South is heirs’
    property—property that passes through inheritance without a will and
    that, as a result, has historically rendered owners ineligible for
    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including lending.
    In July 2021, the USDA rolled out the Heirs’ Property Relending
    Program, which primarily aids underserved communities, including
    Black Americans. The new program provides funds to assist heirs in
    resolving ownership and succession issues on farmland with multiple
    owners.

<!-- -->

-   **Dismantling Barriers to Accessing USDA Programs and Services.**
    The ARP provides funding for USDA to establish one or more equity
    commissions to address historical discrimination and disparities in
    the agricultural sector. In February 2022, USDA announced the
    membership of its 15-member Equity Commission Advisory Committee and
    Equity Commission Subcommittee on Agriculture. The Equity Commission
    Advisory Committee will advise the Secretary of Agriculture by
    identifying USDA programs, policies, systems, structures, and
    practices that contribute to barriers to inclusion or access,
    systemic discrimination, or exacerbate or perpetuate racial,
    economic, health and social disparities.

<!-- -->

-   **Reducing Barriers for Black Communities Facing Natural
    Disasters.** In
    [September](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=acd8fa07ee&e=cf669202c8)
    2021, FEMA implemented policy changes to reduce barriers that
    contributed to disparities experienced by Black Americans through
    programs that provide individual assistance to disaster survivors.
    These included changes to FEMA policies to make it easier for people
    living on heirs’ property – which is estimated to be the majority of
    Black-owned land in the South – to apply for disaster aid.

<!-- -->

-   **Ensuring that Federal Grants Don’t Support Discriminatory
    Activities.** In June 2021, the Department of Transportation (DOT)
    [issued an
    Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=b916425fbf&e=cf669202c8)
    requiring its offices to review the potential discriminatory impact
    of grantees’ proposed activities before awarding federal funds.
    Under the Order, the agency won’t award federal financial assistance
    unless and until the agency determines that the activities will not
    be discriminatory in intent or effect. Similarly, in September 2021,
    the Department of Justice (DOJ) began a review of its grantmaking
    programs, to ensure that federal funds are not distributed to
    agencies that engage in racial discrimination in violation of Title
    VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

<!-- -->

-   **Improving the Customer Experience and Service Delivery.** In
    December, President Biden signed the Transforming Federal Customer
    Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government
    [Executive
    Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=6c2917d192&e=cf669202c8)
    – a commitment from federal agencies to remove red tape on critical
    government services like claiming retirement benefits or filing
    taxes and streamline and increase access to these services for all
    Americans.

<!-- -->

-   **Reducing Child Care Cost for Black Families.** The American Rescue
    Plan secured a $39 billion lifeline to help child care providers
    stay open and compensate early childhood educators,
    disproportionately Black Americans, as they provide safe and healthy
    environments for children and help parents work. Black families are
    nearly two times more likely than white parents to have to quit,
    turn down, or make a major change in their job due to child care
    disruptions. The pandemic exacerbated child care disruptions, and by
    March 2021, had already led to 9% of child care providers closing.
    The ARP also included an expansion of the Child and Dependent Care
    Tax Credit; a median income family with two kids under age 13 will
    receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they
    file taxes for 2021, compared with a maximum of $1,200 previously.
-   **Advancing Equitable Employment Outcomes and Boosting Wages for
    Black Federal Workers.** In June, President Biden signed an
    Executive Order on Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and
    Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce. This Executive Order
    launched a whole-of-government initiative to cultivate a federal
    workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation and that
    advances equitable employment opportunities for workers from
    underserved communities. Further, in 2021 the President signed a
    series of executive actions leading to a $15 minimum wage for
    employees of federal contractors and federal employees. These
    actions will ensure that all federal workers, including Black
    federal workers, have fair access to federal employment
    opportunities, and will also represent a step towards addressing
    longstanding wage disparities.

**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity in K-12 Schools and an
Education Beyond High School.** As we continue to recover from the
COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden has delivered the support necessary
to enable every school to [safely
reopen](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=85fcff5ad8&e=cf669202c8)
for full-time, in-person instruction; accelerate academic achievement;
address the mental health needs of students; and build school
communities where all students feel they belong. At the same time,
President Biden has worked to ensure equitable access to high-quality
education for Black students. These policies and programs include:

-   **Historic Investments to Safely Reopen Schools and Address the
    Needs of Students.** The ARP provided $130 billion to help
    elementary and secondary schools safely reopen and address the
    academic, social and emotional and mental health needs of all
    students, with funding set-aside to address the needs of students
    disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including Black
    students. The Administration’s efforts to encourage all schools to
    adopt the CDC’s recommendations on masking, vaccinations, and other
    COVID-19 protocols, have been particularly critical to the safe
    reopening of schools in Black communities hit hard by COVID-19. In
    addition to funding the implementation of COVID-19 protocols, these
    funds are being used to hire counselors and social workers, provide
    tutors, establish and expand summer and after-school programming,
    and provide a wide range of supports that address the needs of Black
    students. It also provided funds to every Head Start grantee, which
    disproportionately serve Black children and families, so that
    grantees could safely open safely for in-person services and support
    children and families through the pandemic.

<!-- -->

-   **Protecting Students from Funding Cuts.** The ARP’s Elementary and
    Secondary School Emergency Relief program includes a first of its
    kind maintenance of equity requirement to ensure that high-poverty
    school districts and schools are protected in the event of future
    funding cuts. The Department of Education has provided resources and
    technical assistance to states and school districts as they
    implement this new requirement, which will ensure that school
    districts and schools serving a large share of students from
    low-income backgrounds will not experience disproportionate cuts,
    and that school districts with the highest poverty levels do not
    experience any decrease in state per-pupil funding below their
    pre-pandemic level.

<!-- -->

-   **Historic Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities
    (HBCUs).** The Biden-Harris Administration has delivered an historic
    $5.8 billion cumulative investment in and support for HBCUs,
    including:

<!-- -->

-   The ARP and other pandemic relief programs have provided
    approximately $3.7 billion to HBCUs since President Biden took
    office.
    -   Additionally, in April, the Department of Education provided
        approximately $1.6 billion in debt relief to 45 HBCUs, including
        13 public institutions and 32 private institutions.

    <!-- -->

    -   In July and August, the Department of Education awarded more
        than $500 million in grant funding to HBCUs for academic
        capacity-building and fiscal stability.

    <!-- -->

    -   President Biden signed an [Executive
        Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=9bb56d7abd&e=cf669202c8)
        establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational
        Equity, Opportunity, and Excellence through HBCUs, which will
        create a government-wide approach to support the needs of HBCUs
        and the communities they serve and eliminate systemic barriers
        impeding HBCU participation in Federal programs, and in February
        2022, appointed Dietra Trent, former Virginia Deputy Secretary
        of Education, as the Initiative’s Executive Director.

    <!-- -->

    -   During HBCU week, President Biden named Tony Allen, President of
        Delaware State University, as Chair of the President’s Board of
        Advisors on HBCUs. The President has also named Glenda Glover,
        President of Tennessee State University as Vice Chair of the
        Board. The Board, established by the Carter Administration, is
        meant to advance the goals of the HBCU Initiative.

**Improving Health Outcomes for Black Communities.** Facing a once-in a
century pandemic that highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing racial
disparities in our health care system, President Biden took swift action
to promote better health access and outcomes for Black families. The ARP
lowered health care costs for millions of lower- and middle-income Black
families and invested billions to promote equitable vaccine distribution
and provide critical supplies to stop the spread of COVID-19. These
policies and programs include:

-   **Lowering Health Care Costs.** Millions of lower- and middle-income
    Black families enrolled in health insurance marketplaces saw their
    premiums lowered or eliminated as a result of the ARP and will
    continue to benefit through the end of 2022. [Thanks to the
    ARP](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/08307d793263d5069fdd6504385e22f8/black-americans-coverages-access-ib.pdf),
    76% of uninsured Black Americans could find a plan for less than $50
    a month, and 66% could find a plan for free a month in 2021 with
    those subsidies. In addition, millions of uninsured Americans gained
    coverage during the Administration’s 2021 Special Enrollment Period
    (SEP). Of those newly signing up for HealthCare.gov coverage who
    attested to race or ethnicity,
    [15%](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2021-sep-final-enrollment-report.pdf)
    were Black Americans, up over 60% from 2019.

<!-- -->

-   **Improving Black Maternal Health.** The Administration is also
    committed to improving maternal health outcomes, including
    addressing the unacceptably high rates of maternal mortality and
    morbidity that disproportionately impact Black mothers and families.
    The President’s FY 22 budget request includes more than $200 million
    to bolster Maternal Mortality Review Committees, implement implicit
    bias training for health care providers, and create State pregnancy
    medical home programs, among other actions. It also includes $6
    billion for the critical Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
    Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program to help vulnerable
    families put healthy food on the table and address racial
    disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.
    -   The President’s plans includes a historic $3 billion investment
        in maternal health focused on growing and diversifying the
        perinatal workforce, improving data collection and maternal
        health risk monitoring, addressing the social factors that
        contribute to poor maternal health outcomes, addressing
        substance use disorders that impact maternal health, promoting
        increased maternal health research, improving postpartum
        coverage, and better coordinating care. This includes sparking
        innovation by allowing states to establish maternal health homes
        to better coordinate health care for individuals before, during,
        and following birth.

    <!-- -->

    -   It would also require all states to provide continuous Medicaid
        coverage for 12 months postpartum, eliminating potentially
        deadly gaps in health insurance at a critical time for
        individuals. Currently, states are only required to provide
        coverage for 60 days postpartum, despite research showing that
        many deaths and complications occur more than 60 days following
        delivery.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Administration has already approved a number of Medicaid
        demonstrations to expand postpartum coverage, including in
        Illinois, Virginia, and New Jersey; these states will provide
        full Medicaid benefits for 12 months postpartum (other states
        have expanded to six months postpartum coverage or expanded
        coverage to 10 months for those with substance use disorders).
        The ARP gives states an easier pathway to extend coverage for
        pregnant women from 60 days to 12 months postpartum; the
        Administration is working to encourage all states to take up
        this option so women can get the care they need to stay healthy.

    <!-- -->

    -   In April 2021, President Biden issued the first ever
        [Presidential Proclamation on Black Maternal Health
        Week](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=3c9546a4cd&e=cf669202c8),
        calling on all Americans to recognize the importance of
        addressing the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity.

    <!-- -->

    -   Further, in December 2021, Vice President Harris
        [issued](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=42a57fd1ee&e=cf669202c8)
        a nationwide call to action to both public and private sectors
        to improve health outcomes for Black mothers and their children.
        As part of this call to action, the Centers for Medicare &
        Medicaid Services issued new guidance to help states provide 12
        months (up from 60 days currently) of continuous postpartum
        coverage through their Medicaid programs. If every state adopted
        an extension — as required in the President’s plans —then the
        number of Americans getting coverage for a full year postpartum
        would roughly double, extending coverage for an estimated
        720,000 people in a given year. HHS also announced plans to
        create a new “Birthing Friendly” hospital designation, which
        would be the first-ever hospital quality designation by HHS
        specifically focused on maternity care.

<!-- -->

-   **Building the Pipeline of Black Health Care Providers.** The
    Administration has made a historic $1.5 billion investment to help
    grow and diversify the nation’s health care workforce, and bolster
    equitable health care in the communities that need it most during
    the COVID-19 pandemic and in the years to come. This funding is
    supporting the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and
    Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs. These
    programs address workforce shortages and health disparities by
    providing scholarship and loan repayment funding for health care
    students and professionals, in exchange for a service commitment in
    hard-hit and high-risk communities.  With funding from the American
    Rescue Plan, the investment supports over 22,700 providers—the
    largest field strength in history for these programs and a record
    number of skilled doctors, dentists, nurses, and behavioral health
    providers committed to working in underserved communities during a
    moment when we need them the most. Only about 5 percent of
    physicians in the United States identify as Black despite the fact
    that Black Americans account for 12 percent of the nation’s total
    population; over 13 percent of physicians serving through the
    National Health Service Corps identify as Black.

<!-- -->

-   **Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response.** Nationwide, Black
    people have died from COVID-19 at 1.4 times the rate of White
    people. The ARP provided $160 billion for the vaccines, tests,
    personal protective equipment, and public health workforce needed to
    address the spread of COVID-19, an investment that is helping to
    drive down racial disparities in prevention and care. Due to the ARP
    and the President’s other investments in equitable access to the
    COVID-19 vaccine, multiple studies show that the gap in COVID
    vaccination rates in Black Americans compared to Whites and Latinos
    has closed. Data as of February 2022 show that 84% of Black adults,
    87% of Latinos and 85% of White adults have received at least one
    shot, compared to 56%, 57%, and 65%, respectively, in May 2021.
    Additionally:
    -   FEMA surged resources to vaccinate all eligible Americans,
        including by standing up 500 vaccine sites in underserved
        communities. These emergency measures have helped deliver
        community-based and culturally competent care. In fact, over 50%
        of vaccines administered at the federally-run community
        vaccination centers went to Black Americans and other people of
        color, and more than 75% of people vaccinated at Community
        Health Centers are people of color.

    <!-- -->

    -   In January 2021, President Biden signed an [Executive
        Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=03fb5b89f7&e=cf669202c8)
        on Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery,
        creating a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to provide specific
        recommendations to the President for mitigating the health
        inequities caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and
        for preventing such inequities in the future. The Task force
        transmitted its final report to the White House Office of the
        COVID-19 Response in November 2021, including recommendations
        related to interpersonal stress linked to racism, addressing the
        behavioral health consequences of the pandemic in communities of
        color, and vaccine, testing, and therapeutics access and
        confidence. By the end of 2021, the Administration had begun
        action on over 80 percent of the Task Force recommendations, and
        remains committed to engaging these recommendations within the
        historic initiatives and programs built to promote and sustain
        equity across the federal government. Federal agencies are now
        developing implementation proposals related to the policies and
        priorities recommended by the Task Force, which will be
        submitted no later than March 10.

**Taking Strong Action to Reform Our Criminal Justice System.** From
investing in community violence interventions, to reforming law
enforcement, to reducing mass incarceration practices, to supporting
reentry, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken concrete actions to
reform the criminal justice system and address racial disparities. These
policies and programs include:

-   **Reforming Law Enforcement Practices.** In September 2021, the
    Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a ban on use of chokeholds and
    carotid restraints except where deadly force is necessary, and new
    restrictions on no-knock warrants—implementing reforms for federal
    law enforcement administratively that the President had called on
    Congress to enact nationwide through the George Floyd Justice in
    Police Act. The Department also implemented a new policy requiring
    federal agents to wear body cameras when executing search warrants
    and pre-planned arrests. These changes make real the policy reform
    the country must undertake to prevent tragic killings like those of
    George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the future. The directives apply
    to all agencies overseen by the Department including the FBI, Drug
    Enforcement Agency, and U.S. Marshal’s Service. In September, the
    Department of Homeland Security announced the formation of the Law
    Enforcement Coordination Council (LECC)—the Department’s first
    unified law enforcement coordination body, chaired by the
    Secretary—to comprehensively review and revise its policies and
    training on use of force, compliance with civil rights and privacy
    interests, and other matters. In July 2021, the Department of the
    Interior created a task force to study and recommend reforms for its
    law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Park Police.

-   **Ensuring Constitutional Policing.** The Department of Justice
    (DOJ) rescinded guidance issued in the previous Administration that
    curtailed the use of consent decrees, including within
    investigations into patterns or practices of discrimination and
    misconduct by police departments. Pattern and practice
    investigations and consent decrees are critical tools to promote
    constitutional policing in jurisdictions where reform is warranted.
    DOJ has opened four such investigations in Minneapolis, Louisville,
    Phoenix, and Mount Vernon, New York.

<!-- -->

-   **Improving Prosecutorial Guidance to Prevent Unduly Harsh
    Sentencing.** The DOJ withdrew guidance issued in the previous
    Administration that required prosecutors to always charge the
    harshest sentences, replacing it with guidance that restored
    discretion to make decisions about charging, plea agreements, and
    advocacy at sentencing based on an individualized assessment of
    relevant facts.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Legislation to End Racial Disparities in Cocaine
    Sentencing.** The President endorsed the EQUAL Act, which would
    eliminate the racially discriminatory crack-powder cocaine
    sentencing disparity and make the change fully retroactive.

<!-- -->

-   **Support for Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs.** The
    President ordered DOJ not to renew contracts for privately-operated
    criminal detention facilities, covering the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)
    and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). When completed, this will result
    in up to 14,000 people in BOP custody and 10,000 people in USMS
    custody being moved out of private prisons. To date, the
    administration has closed a total of 7 contracts, resulting in more
    than 4,000 people moved out of private prisons.

<!-- -->

-   **Support for Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Programs.**
    Black boys and young men ages 15-34 make up 2% of the population but
    are 37% of homicide victims, and homicide is the leading cause of
    death for Black men under the age of 45. Until this Administration,
    however, CVI programs like violence interrupters and hospital-based
    programs, which are demonstrated to reduce violence by up to 60%,
    have been badly underfunded. Under President Biden, the Treasury
    Department and Education Department issued guidance stating that CVI
    programs are eligible uses of American Rescue Plan funds—both the
    $350 billion in aid to state, Tribal, and local governments and the
    $122 billion to school districts. The Administration pivoted 26
    existing grant programs across five agencies to support CVI. And
    President Biden continues to seek $5 billion in dedicated funding
    for CVI programs. These historic funds would help curtail the
    epidemic of gun violence that hits Black communities hardest.

<!-- -->

-   **Support for Reentry of Returning Citizens.** In February 2021,
    President Biden expanded access to Paycheck Protection Program loans
    by removing restrictions for entrepreneurs with certain past
    criminal records, bringing long overdue help to small businesses
    previously unable to access these funds. In June 2021, the
    Department of Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly
    incarcerated adults and young people in 28 communities transition
    out of the criminal justice system and connect with quality jobs.
    The President issued an Executive Order directing the Office of
    Personnel Management to evaluate the existence of any barriers that
    formerly incarcerated individuals face in accessing federal
    employment, and to evaluate how to expand federal employment
    opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals. OPM provided
    its findings and a summary of actions to expand employment for this
    population to the President in October. Further, in September 2021
    the Labor and Treasury Departments released new resources to help
    employers leverage tax credits and other federal programs to
    incentivize the hiring of formerly incarcerated persons. HUD
    clarified that returning citizens are eligible for the 70,000
    emergency housing vouchers created by the ARP. Further, President
    Biden’s plans include an additional $1.6 billion of workforce
    development and job training funding to invest in re-entry
    employment efforts.

<!-- -->

-   **Addressing Domestic Violent Extremism.** President Biden directed
    the U.S. government to assess the threat of domestic violent
    extremism in the United States. In January, Secretary of the
    Department of Defense (DOD) Lloyd J. Austin III ordered a DOD-wide
    stand down to discuss the problem of extremism in the ranks, and in
    April he established a countering extremism working group, directing
    DOD officials to review and update the definition of extremism
    contained in [DOD Instruction
    1325.06](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=ed5a029c91&e=cf669202c8),
    and calling on the services to update transition instructions to
    prevent those leaving the military from being recruited by extremist
    groups. In March 2021, the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence released the unclassified executive summary of the
    comprehensive assessment acknowledging that enduring domestic
    violent extremism motivations stem from biases against minority
    populations. In April 2021, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
    Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ordered an internal review to root out
    white supremacy and extremism within DHS.

**Using Executive Authority to Protect Voting Rights, Democracy, and
Access to Justice.** These policies and programs include:

-   **Signing Executive Order Promoting Access to Voter Registration and
    Voting.** On the 2021 anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Biden
    signed an [Executive
    Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=1d4d1ebc06&e=cf669202c8)
    to leverage the resources of the federal government to provide
    information about the election process and increased access to voter
    registration opportunities. Agencies across the federal government
    have [announced
    steps](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=87561df6a0&e=cf669202c8)
    they are taking to respond to the President’s call for an
    all-of-government action to enhance the ability of all eligible
    Americans to participate in our democracy, including the Centers for
    Medicare & Medicaid Services’ [recent
    commitment](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=280f4a922c&e=cf669202c8)
    to make it easier for consumers using HealthCare.gov to connect to
    voter registration services.

<!-- -->

-   **Ensuring Compliance with Voting Rights Laws.** The Department of
    Justice has taken a variety of steps to help protect the right to
    vote, including doubling the number of voting rights attorneys,
    taking steps to ensure compliance with voting rights statutes,
    launching a task force to combat the increase of threats against
    election officials and election workers, and issuing guidance on (1)
    the civil and criminal statutes that apply to post-election
    audits, (2) methods of voting, including early voting and voting by
    mail, and (3) the vote-dilution protections that apply to all
    jurisdictions under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as they
    engage in redistricting.

<!-- -->

-   To expand the promise of equal justice under law, the President
    issued a Presidential Memorandum in May 2021 that
    [asked](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=32f2f54d32&e=cf669202c8)
    the Attorney General to consider expanding the Department of
    Justice’s access to justice work. In October 2021, the Attorney
    General announced the reestablishment of the Office for Access to
    Justice as a standalone component within the Justice Department
    dedicated to improving the federal government’s understanding of and
    capacity to address the most urgent legal needs of communities
    across America. The President’s May 2021 Memorandum also
    reinvigorated the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable to
    prioritize and expand access to legal services and federal programs,
    including in the areas of criminal indigent defense, civil legal
    aid, and pro bono services. In September 2021, the Roundtable
    released its Access to Justice in the Age of COVID-19 report
    highlighting the urgent need to prioritize and expand access to
    legal services and federal programs as a result of the Covid-19
    crisis.

**Appointing and Confirming Black Judges.** President Biden is committed
to ensuring that the judiciary is filled with highly qualified
individuals who bring both personal and professional diversity to the
bench. Since January 2021, President Biden has nominated a total of 84
individuals for federal judgeships, 25 of whom are African American, and
13 individuals for local judgeships in Washington, D.C., 5 of whom are
African American. In February, he announced his intention to nominate
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. Of the 48 individuals who have been confirmed to positions on
federal courts, 14 are African American.

**Restoring Fairness and Humanity to Our Immigration System.** 
President Biden is committed to reforming our immigration system,
promoting racial equity in our immigration policies, and providing legal
protections for noncitizens, including Black noncitizens who call this
country home.

-   **Extending and Redesignating Haiti and Somalia for Temporary
    Protected Status (TPS).**  The Administration extended legal
    protections to Haitian and Somalian nationals who have lived in our
    country for years.  TPS is a form of immigration relief available to
    noncitizens in the United States who cannot return home due to
    dangerous conditions in their home countries; it enables those
    individuals to live with their families and work in our communities
    without fear of removal.

<!-- -->

-   **Restarting the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program
    (HFRP).** The Obama-Biden Administration created the HRFP in 2014,
    allowing U.S. citizens and green card holders to apply for parole on
    behalf of family members in Haiti who have approved immigrant visa
    petitions.  The prior Administration announced the termination of
    this program in 2019.  The Biden-Harris Administration restored HFRP
    and remains committed to helping Haitian-American families reunify
    in our country.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Immigration Reform Legislation.**  President Biden
    remains committed to passing legislation to finally reform our
    broken immigration system.  These reforms would promote racial
    equity by providing a pathway to citizenship to millions of
    undocumented individuals, including Black noncitizens. 

 The President is not done. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to
advance equity and racial justice, including for Black Americans, as we
build back better. These policies and programs include:

-   **President Biden’s Proposed Plan Will Promote Investment and
    Economic Opportunity in Black Communities**. President Biden’s plans
    will reverse decades of disinvestment and wealth extraction in Black
    communities, other communities of color and rural communities, and
    drive good jobs and opportunity to every corner of the country,
    making long needed, once-in-a-generation investments in underserved
    communities: The President intends to make universal preschool a
    reality, cut child care costs and increase access to high-quality
    child care, reduce housing costs and increase the supply of
    affordable housing, lower health care costs, improve maternal
    health, expand coverage to millions of low-income Americans by
    closing the Medicaid coverage gap, and extend the ARP’s historic
    child tax credit expansion. The Presidents’ plans also include a $3
    billion investment focused on improving maternal health in this
    country.

<!-- -->

-   **Sustained Investment in HBCUs.** President Biden’s plans seek
    sustained investments in HBCUs and their students. These include $10
    billion to HBCUs, Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and
    minority-serving institutions (MSIs). Of that total, $2 billion is
    dedicated specifically for HBCUs—a five-fold increase from the
    amounts HBCUs typically receive annually through existing funding
    streams to address a wide range of needs, including student
    financial aid, infrastructure upgrades, and campus services. HBCUs
    can compete for another $4 billion of these funds to support
    research and development programs.
    -   Additionally, President Biden’s FY22 budget request for the
        Department of Education includes a total of $807 million in
        discretionary funding to HBCUs, an increase of $72 million over
        last year’s funding level, which will substantially increase key
        HBCU funding streams to support research, infrastructure, and
        student support services, amongst other programming.

<!-- -->

-   **Unwavering Support for the Fundamental and Sacred Right to Vote.**
    President Biden has firmly and repeatedly called for Congress to
    enact the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom
    to Vote Act, which would together set national standards that make
    it easier to vote, and deliver new tools to prevent voting
    discrimination. The President urged the Senate to change the rules,
    including getting rid of the filibuster, to pass these critical
    pieces of legislation. And the President will continue to use every
    tool at his disposal to protect the right to vote in free, fair, and
    secure elections.

**Transforming Public Education with Historic Funding Increases.** Black
students are less likely to have access to high-quality preschool,
resulting in disparate outcomes before students even enter kindergarten.
They are more likely to attend rundown and unsafe schools. They are
taught by less experienced teachers. And they have lower college
completion rates and higher student loan debt burdens than their white
peers. The President has outlined a [far-reaching
agenda](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=a758d3c8cb&e=cf669202c8)
that will transform public education, advancing equity for Black
students and prepare all students to succeed.

-   The President’s plans would provide universal, high-quality
    preschool for all three- and four-year-olds; invest in school
    infrastructure so all students learn in safe and healthy school
    buildings with the technology and labs they need to prepare for the
    jobs of the future; and strengthen and diversity the teacher
    pipeline.

<!-- -->

-   The President’s FY22 budget proposal includes a $20 billion increase
    in Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I funding,
    which would more than double funds available under the flagship
    program for students in high-poverty schools, while providing
    meaningful incentives for states to address inequitable school
    funding systems and close gaps in access to rigorous coursework,
    like advanced math and science courses. Over 80% of Black students
    attend a Title I-eligible school, and there is a $23 billion annual
    funding gap between majority white and majority non-white school
    districts.

<!-- -->

-   Through the President’s plans and his FY22 budget, the President has
    requested a $950 increase to the maximum Pell Grant for students
    enrolled in public and private non-profit colleges, benefitting [75%
    of HBCU
    students](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=248e202884&e=cf669202c8)
    who receive them.

**Addressing Police Misconduct.** The President strongly supported the
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. He is disappointed that
legislation has not yet reached his desk, and continues to urge Congress
to act, while also examining ways to advance meaningful police reform
through executive action.
