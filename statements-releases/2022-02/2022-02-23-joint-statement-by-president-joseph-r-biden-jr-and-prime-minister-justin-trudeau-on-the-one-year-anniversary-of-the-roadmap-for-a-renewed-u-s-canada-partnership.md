title: Joint Statement by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Prime Minister Justin
  Trudeau on the One-Year Anniversary of the Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership
---
 
One year ago, the United States and Canada reaffirmed the special nature
of our relationship, and our commitment to working closely together in
the interests of the collective security and prosperity of our citizens
based on the principles of democracy, diversity, and equity. The Roadmap
for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership guides our work, and lays out an
ambitious framework to build a greener, more prosperous future; grow our
economies and strengthen the middle class; combat the global COVID-19
pandemic; create safer, more equitable communities; and stand together
in the face of threats to democracy.  Defending democracy is at the
heart of our commitment to stand with Ukraine in the face of Russia’s
unprovoked invasion.  We have made progress over the past year and laid
the foundation to deepen our cooperation on climate change, on
supporting the global pandemic response efforts, on enhancing
cooperation on the Arctic, and on building the economies of the future,
including through work to strengthen bilateral supply chains and
cooperation on critical minerals. Much work remains to be done.  Our
countries are both stronger when we work together towards our shared
objectives.  We look forward to building on the enduring partnership
between our two great nations in the years ahead.
