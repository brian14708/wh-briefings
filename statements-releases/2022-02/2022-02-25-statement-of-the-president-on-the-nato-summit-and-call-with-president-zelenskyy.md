title: Statement of the President on the NATO Summit and Call with President Zelenskyy
---
 
Today I met with fellow leaders from our NATO Allies to discuss our
shared commitment to collective defense and Transatlantic security. As
President Putin threatens the very foundations of international peace
and security, NATO is once again demonstrating that it stands for
freedom and democracy.

As I said yesterday, the United States will defend every inch of NATO
territory. Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. I have ordered the
deployment of additional forces to augment our capabilities in Europe to
support our NATO Allies. And I strongly welcome the decision to activate
NATO’s defensive plans and elements of the NATO Response Force to
strengthen our collective posture, as well as the commitments by our
Allies to deploy additional land and air forces to the eastern flank and
maritime forces from the High North to the Mediterranean.

We were joined today by our close partners Sweden, Finland, and the
European Union. President Putin has failed in his goal of dividing the
West. NATO is as united and resolute as it’s ever been, and NATO will
maintain its Open Door to those European states who share our values and
who one day may seek to join our Alliance. As we navigate this crisis,
we pledged to work even more closely together in our defense of freedom
and the democratic values that imbue our Alliance with purpose and
power.

Immediately after the NATO Summit, I spoke with President Zelenskyy of
Ukraine. I commended the brave actions of the Ukrainian people who were
fighting to defend their country. I also conveyed ongoing economic,
humanitarian, and security support being provided by the United States
as well as our continued efforts to rally other countries to provide
similar assistance.
