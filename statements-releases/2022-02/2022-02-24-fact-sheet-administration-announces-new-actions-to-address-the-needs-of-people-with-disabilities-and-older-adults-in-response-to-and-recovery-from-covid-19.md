title: "FACT SHEET:  Administration Announces New Actions to Address the Needs of\
  \ People with Disabilities and Older Adults in Response to and Recovery from\_COVID-\u2060\
  19"
---
 
The Administration recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had
tremendous impacts on disabled individuals and has resulted in new
members of the disability community.

Over the past year, the Administration has collaborated and consulted
with the disability community andtaken several key actions to address
the unique needs of individuals with disabilities. Among other actions,
the U.S. government released key civil rights guidance to protect
disabled individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic or any public health
emergency; prioritized Long COVID services, supports, and research in
the context of disability; established a call line dedicated to ensuring
individuals with disabilities can equitably utilize the Administration’s
at-home test distribution program; ensured disabled individuals and
other high-risk individuals have access to at-home testing; and invested
American Rescue Plan (ARP) resources to build COVID-19 vaccine
confidence and access among people with disabilities.

Moving forward, the Administration will take several key steps to
further our work to ensure that disabled individuals, regardless of
where they live or the level of community transmission of the virus,
have equitable access to COVID-19 testing, masks, and other critical
mitigation strategies. The Administration remains committed to
implementing these policies and developing additional policies in close
collaboration with the disability community – keeping equity and
accessibility at the center of our COVID-19 response and beyond. The
Administration will:

-   ****Equip schools with guidance and support to keep vulnerable
    students safe and learning in-person.**** The Department of
    Education (ED) will work with school administrators and educators on
    strategies they can use to continue providing safe, in-person
    instruction for all students in their classes. ED will engage the
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure that its
    guidance is fully aligned with the latest public health guidance and
    that schools have clear recommendations and strategies to help
    protect the safety of and access to rigorous learning that all
    children deserve. ED will also provide resources for parents who
    would like additional support in understanding how to navigate their
    child’s in-person learning experience through local regional parent
    training and information centers. Parents may find their local
    center [here](https://www.parentcenterhub.org/find-your-center/) and
    reach out for direct assistance and referrals to other
    organizations, as well as to gain skills to effectively participate
    in the education and development of their children. States and
    school districts should use the unprecedented resources provided
    through the ARP to implement these recommendations and ensure access
    to a high-quality education for all students, including students
    with disabilities. Children learn best in-person, and are better
    able to engage with rigorous instruction and access services and
    supports tailored to their needs when they are learning alongside
    their peers. The President has been clear since Day One that we need
    students back to school for full-time, in-person learning, and
    thanks to the unprecedented resources provided through the ARP,
    schools have what they need to safely remain open, keep students and
    staff safe, and address the impact of the pandemic on student
    learning and mental health. Some students may need additional
    protections to ensure they can remain safe in the classroom –
    including students who are immunocompromised, with complex medical
    conditions, or with other disabilities that may put them at higher
    risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. For nearly two years,
    educators across the country have provided services and supports to
    children with disabilities in ways never anticipated prior to the
    COVID-19 pandemic, and the Administration is committed to ensuring
    that children with disabilities continue to receive the services and
    supports they need so they can reach their highest potential.

-   **Expand the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    Administration for Community Living’s Disability Information and
    Access Line to support people with disabilities who face difficulty
    using or cannot use a self-test.** The [Disability Information and
    Access Line](https://acl.gov/DIAL) (DIAL), available at
    1-888-677-1199, is launching a new initiative to support disabled
    individuals who need assistance using at-home tests distributed by
    the Administration or support in finding alternatives to at-home
    testing. For individuals who can use an at-home test, DIAL operators
    are available to assist with ordering free tests; understanding
    instructions for test administration and test results; or providing
    alternative instructions for those unable to access, read, or
    understand the manufacturer’s version. For those who cannot use an
    at-home test, DIAL operators can assist individuals with ordering
    tests to collect a specimen that can be mailed back for results. For
    individuals who cannot use either an at-home test or an alternative
    “swab and send” test, DIAL operators can assist callers with
    locating their state or local health department and/or aging and
    disability resources for additional assistance with other testing
    options that may be available in their community, including
    identifying potential in-home testing options or assistance with
    transportation or companion support to visit a community-based
    testing site.

-   **<u>Launch new COVID-19 testing guidance in American Sign Language
    and review all existing COVID-19 guidance to confirm accessibility
    for all disabled individuals.</u>** CDC recently released “How to
    Interpret Positive Self-Test Results”
    [guidance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN9abSiscac) in American
    Sign Language (ASL), a first step towards ensuring that deaf or hard
    of hearing individuals can access key information about how to
    protect themselves and their communities. CDC is also collaborating
    with the CDC Foundation, Georgia Tech’s Center for Inclusive Design
    and Innovation, and their partners across HHS to pursue key
    improvements for all COVID-19 guidance available on CDC’s website
    that cannot be accessed elsewhere: information in Braille, ASL
    translation, simplified text, and other alternative formats.

-   **<u>Execute a new effort to develop at-home COVID-19 tests that are
    accessible to all.</u>** The National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s
    RADx program has launched a new effort to seek both short- and
    long-term solutions to improve at-home test accessibility. RADx will
    consult and work with national organizations who represent
    communities in need of accessible tests, and test manufacturers to
    inform the modification or development of more accessible at-home
    tests, including device design, packaging, and modes of instruction,
    and challenges. Though at-home COVID-19 tests were only invented
    last year, the Administration’s investment in this technology has
    rapidly scaled up manufacturing to the millions per day. This effort
    strives to ensure that all individuals have an option for at-home
    testing that can be used and interpreted without assistance, and
    will set the course towards accessible testing in the weeks and
    months to come.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Incentivize all at-home test manufacturers to prioritize
    accessibility of at-home tests.</u>** The Administration has
    published a formal Request for Information (RFI) to ensure the
    preservation and expansion of current domestic manufacturing
    capacities for at-home rapid tests and point-of-care tests. The RFI
    specifically asks manufacturers to prioritize the accessibility of
    at-home tests for people who are blind or visually-impaired;
    individuals with physical, cognitive, or other disabilities; and
    individuals who need non-English language or literacy support. The
    Administration will use the information gathered in March 2022 to
    inform near-term investments – towards ensuring that accessible
    at-home tests are available for federal purchase.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Request accessible instructions from manufacturers who have
    received a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use
    Authorization (EUA).</u>** The FDA has reached out to all test
    developers that have received an EUA to request that they provide
    instructions that are accessible and compliant with the Americans
    with Disabilities Act, including alternative text for all images as
    well as html versions. FDA will use all authority available to
    receive these accessible instructions as quickly as possible, while
    working with RADx to identify other wraparound services that can be
    provided immediately to make existing at-home tests more accessible.

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Distribute masks to disabled individuals through
    community-based organizations and jurisdictions.</u>** HHS will
    support health centers and aging and disability networks as they
    collaborate on efforts to distribute N95 masks to individuals with
    disabilities who cannot leave their homes. As the President
    announced in January 2022, the Administration is making 400 million
    N95 masks from the Strategic National Stockpile available to all
    individuals in the United States for free. HHS is sending tens of
    millions of free, high-quality masks to community health centers and
    rural health clinics – organizations that play a critical role in
    serving communities across the country, including individuals with
    disabilities.  

<!-- -->

-   **<u>Call on states to directly distribute high-quality masks
    through community-based organizations serving individuals with
    disabilities</u>.** Over the past year, the Administration has also
    sent millions of high-quality masks to states and territories across
    the country. We encourage all jurisdictions to work in partnership
    with community-based organizations to expand access for the
    hardest-hit and highest-risk individuals – including people with
    disabilities who may be unable to leave their homes.
