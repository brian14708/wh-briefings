We are working closely with our Canadian counterparts to end the
blockade of key bridges and crossings between the United States and
Canada and to restore vital commerce between our two nations.  Following
the President’s video teleconference with Prime Minister Trudeau on
Friday, I spoke with Canadian National Security and Intelligence Advisor
Jody Thomas again last night to express appreciation for the decisive
law enforcement efforts that are underway along the border to advance
toward full resolution of the blockades.  We discussed the widespread
damaging impacts the obstructions have already had on the lives and
livelihoods of people in both our nations and the imperative of taking
swift, strong action and deterring future blockades.

This morning, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and
Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg also spoke with their
Canadian counterparts.  The updates they received indicate that most
protestors have been cleared from the Ambassador bridge, barriers are
being removed, and the corridor is being secured.  Canadian authorities
are taking proactive steps to ensure no further unlawful disruption of
the flow of people and goods occurs.  Individuals trespassing on
property located on the road to the bridge will be cited for trespassing
and their vehicles will be towed.   Canadian authorities intend to
reopen the Ambassador Bridge today after completing necessary safety
checks.  We stand ready to support our Canadian partners wherever useful
in order to ensure the restoration of the normal free flow of commerce.
  

Senior White House staff are also remaining in close contact with
Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Northern Border Governors and Members of
Congress.
