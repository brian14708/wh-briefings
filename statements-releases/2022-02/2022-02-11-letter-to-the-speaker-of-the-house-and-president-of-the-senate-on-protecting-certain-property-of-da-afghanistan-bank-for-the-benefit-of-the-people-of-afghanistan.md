title: "Letter to the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate on Protecting\
  \ Certain Property of Da Afghanistan Bank for the Benefit of the People of\_Afghanistan"

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq*.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et
seq*.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby report
that I have issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency
with respect to the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan —
including the urgent needs of the people of Afghanistan for food
security, livelihoods support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene,
shelter and settlement assistance, and COVID-19-related assistance,
among other basic human needs — and the potential for a deepening
economic collapse in Afghanistan.  In addition, I find that the
preservation of certain property of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held in
the United States by United States financial institutions is of the
utmost importance to addressing this national emergency and the welfare
of the people of Afghanistan.  
  
In order to address this national emergency, the Executive Order blocks
all property and interests in property of DAB that are held in the
United States by any United States financial institution, including the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and compels the transfer of the
blocked property into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York.  
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

                               Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
