title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden to Highlight Clean Energy Manufacturing and Deployment\
  \ Investments that Cut Consumer Costs, Strengthen U.S. Energy Sector, and Create\
  \ Good-Paying\_Jobs"
---
 
President Biden campaigned on a bold vision of tackling the climate
crisis with the urgency that science demands by seizing the opportunity
to build a strong domestic energy sector that can manufacture and deploy
clean energy for the benefit of all Americans—with lower costs for
families, good-paying jobs for workers, and healthier air and cleaner
water for communities.

Since Day One, he has delivered. After rejoining the Paris Agreement,
restoring scientific integrity, and reinvigorating U.S. leadership on
the world stage, President Biden **mobilized every federal agency to
achieve groundbreaking goals:** reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50-52%
below 2005 levels in 2030, reaching 100% carbon pollution-free
electricity by 2035, and delivering 40% of the benefits from federal
investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities.
The President formed the first-ever National Climate Task Force,
bringing together Cabinet leaders to drive decisive action toward those
goals.

Alongside historic executive actions, President Biden also **made
climate action and environmental justice a centerpiece of his Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law**—which includes the largest federal investments ever
in upgrading the power grid, improving public transit and investing in
zero-emission transit and school buses, installing a nationwide EV
charging network, cleaning up legacy pollution, delivering clean water
and replacing lead pipes, demonstrating innovative climate technologies,
and increasing climate resilience to safeguard against extreme weather,
which last year caused more than $145 billion in damages from the
biggest 20 disasters alone.

**<u>CALLING ON CONGRESS TO DELIVER</u>**

President Biden knows that we need to move even faster to combat climate
change—and that to meet the moment and fully seize the economic
opportunity in front of us, Congress must act. **In his first State of
the Union address, the President will call on Congress to deliver on a
legislative agenda for clean energy and climate action** that has
overwhelming support from the American people—Republicans, Democrats,
and Independents.

Specifically, the President will lift up the benefits we can secure for
American consumers, companies, and communities by enacting critical
investments and tax credits for domestic clean energy manufacturing and
deployment. He will also highlight how the investments and tax credits
would cut energy costs for American families an average of $500 per
year.

As part of the President’s unwavering support for climate solutions,
these investments will reduce emissions, lower costs for families,
create good-paying jobs for workers, and advance environmental justice.

**<u>BOLD ACTIONS TWO MONTHS INTO 2022</u>**

As the President works with Congress to deliver on this legislative
agenda, he will continue taking decisive and bold action—building on the
surge of momentum he has spearheaded to tackle the climate crisis.
