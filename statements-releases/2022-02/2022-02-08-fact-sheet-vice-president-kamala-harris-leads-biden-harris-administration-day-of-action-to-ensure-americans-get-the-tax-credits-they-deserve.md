*Vice President Harris and Secretary Yellen Headline Day of Action Event
Alongside White House ARP Coordinator Gene Sperling, Mayors and Major
Non-Profits to Encourage Americans to Sign Up for the Expanded Child Tax
Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit*

Hundreds of non-profit organizations, state and local governments,
members of Congress, and agencies across the federal government are
joining Vice President Kamala Harris, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen,
White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator and Senior Advisor to the
President Gene Sperling, and others for the Biden-Harris
Administration’s Day of Action to encourage Americans to file their
taxes to receive the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and the Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) this tax season. The Day of Action commitments announced
today – part of an ongoing, all-out push to make sure every eligible
American receives the tax relief that they are eligible for under
current law – could reach tens of millions of Americans. 

**<u>The American Rescue Plan Made Significant Changes to Two Critical
Tax Relief Programs.</u>**

-   **Expanded the Child Tax Credit** from $2,000 per child to $3,600
    for children under 6 and $3,000 for children between 6 and 17.
-   **Nearly Tripled the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without
    dependent children** – from ~$540 to up to $1,500 for 17 million
    workers without dependent children and made previously ineligible
    younger workers (19-24) who are not half-time or full-time students,
    and older workers (65+) newly eligible for the expanded Earned
    Income Tax Credit.

**<u>February 8<sup>th</sup> is a Day of Action to Ensure All Eligible
Americans Sign Up for These American Rescue Plan Tax Cuts.</u>**

-   **Families must file a tax return in 2022 to receive the second half
    of the Child Tax Credit.** While the families of 61 million children
    received advance monthly payments between July and December 2021,
    families need to file a tax return to receive the second half.
-   **By filing a tax return, families that did not receive the advance
    payments in 2021 can still get the full Child Tax Credit, as well as
    the up to $1,400-per-person Economic Impact Payment that they might
    have missed.** Some taxpayers with qualifying children – like those
    who welcomed a new baby in 2021 or those who haven’t filed taxes in
    recent years and did not use the non-filer portal – can get their
    full Child Tax Credit by filing their tax returns. Eligible families
    that did not receive the up to $1,400 per person Economic Impact
    Payment included in the American Rescue Plan can claim those
    payments by filing a tax return this year.
-   **Many families who are eligible for the Child Tax Credit are also
    eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit and can get thousands of
    dollars in additional tax relief by filing their tax return this
    year.** In addition, the American Rescue Plan nearly tripled the
    EITC for workers without dependent children to $1,500 and made
    millions more Americans eligible.

**<u>New Government Website – ChildTaxCredit.Gov – Directs Americans to
Tax-Filing Assistance.</u>**

The Day of Action coincides with the recent re-launch of the new and
improved
[ChildTaxCredit.gov](/Users/MEPolachek1/Work%20Folders/Documents/childtaxcredit.gov).
The revamped website has several new features to help taxpayers file
their taxes and access the remainder of the expanded Child Tax Credit,
the full amount of the Child Tax Credit, and/or the Earned Income Tax
Credit as tax filing season begins.

**To help Americans navigate tax filing season, the website features a
new tool that directs taxpayers to free assisted filing options that
suit them based on answers to a handful of simple questions.** These
options include both virtual and in-person support in multiple
languages. Many of the organizations who have answered the
Administration’s call to action are leveraging the new
ChildTaxCredit.gov for assistance.

**<u>Congressional Champions Join the Day of Action.</u>**

U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Cory
Booker (D-N.J.), and Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and U.S.
Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) will
headline a press call on the Day of Action encouraging all Americans to
file their taxes to access the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax
Credit.

**<u>Hundreds of Non-Profits and Community-Based Organizations Are
Taking Action to Reach Families Across the Country.</u>**

Hundreds of non-profits, community-based organizations, religious
organizations, veterans’ organizations, youth organizations, disability
organizations, seniors’ organizations, health and medical organizations,
foster care organizations, and more made commitments to take a wide
range of actions, today and throughout the tax filing seasons.

    Federations of North America, Catholic Charities USA, and more have

    Organizations including but not limited to the National Urban
    League, the Hispanic Federation, Think of Us, the Shah Family
    Foundation and FindYourFunds, the Community Child Care Council (4Cs)

    will reach staff at the more than 3,000 Public Housing Authorities
    (PHAs), the nearly 2,000 PHA-based service providers, 2,000 tribal
    housing partners, nearly 400 Continuums of Care, and the roughly
    16,000 housing counselors, as well as nearly 14,000 Multifamily
    property managers and resident service providers. HUD will also
    partner with VITA centers across the country and continue our
    ongoing collaboration with AmeriCorps to mobilize more than 200
    HUD-VISTA Volunteers to assist HUD families’ tax filing. Building on

    is also a member of the Colorado Economic Mobility Partnership, a
    joint effort between Colorado Governor Jared Polis’ administration,
    the Colorado State Service Commission, Serve Colorado, Colorado
    Department of Public Health and Environment and AmeriCorps. The
    partnership kicked off on January 14, 2022, which was declared by
    Governor Polis as AmeriCorps Economic Mobility Day and marked the
    initial deployment of two AmeriCorps NCCC teams focused on VITA
    service activities. AmeriCorps NCCC is a fulltime service program
    that supports young adults to serve on a team and make a positive
    impact in communities across the country while gaining valuable
    leadership skills. AmeriCorps NCCC has six additional projects
    identified to deploy its volunteers on tax preparation efforts,
    including the additional CTC follow-up work. All of the projects
    will include VITA tax prep for low-income individuals and will
    include a focus on CTC and Earned Income Tax Credit, as well as
    other rebates available for low-income individuals.
-   **The United States Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition
    Services** will inform and engage FNS stakeholders through email,
    traditional mailed and digital lifting up and reinforcing CTC
    outreach opportunities and supporting materials available by
    Treasury. FNS expects to reach more than 100,000 program operators,
    community organizations, and interested individuals directly through
    our collective platforms, with an even broader reach as FNS
    encourages the resharing of information.
-   **The Department of Education** will share information on the Child
    Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit to grantees and
    organizations that primarily serve disadvantaged students. The
    Department will ask that these grantees and organizations share

funders networks. **The Annie E. Casey Foundation, the AARP Foundation,
Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, The Gates Foundation, The David and
Lucile Packard Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, Charles and Lynn
Schusterman Family Philanthropies, and others have contributed** more
than $37 million in new investments into communities to support CTC and
EITC. Investments area include:

***Testing New Models for Effective Outreach.***

-   **EITC Funders Network**, in partnership with Community Foundation
    Opportunity Network **(**CFON) and CFLeads, is managing the
    **Community Outreach and Opportunity Fund (CO-OP Fund)**. The fund
    partners with 24 community foundations across the country to work
    with their local partners testing a range of innovative outreach and
    engagement strategies. The purpose of the CO-OP Fund is to engage
    community foundations and their strongly connected local community
    partners to ensure that as many families as possible receive the
    full Child Tax Credit (CTC) and Earned Income tax Credit (EITC)
    benefits they have earned, as quickly and easily as possible.

***Commitments to Focus on Newly Eligible EITC Populations (Older and
younger Workers). ***

***Specific Funding for Puerto Rico’s CTC and EITC Eligible
Populations.***

**<u>About the Child Tax Credit: Tax Cuts for Families with
Children.</u>**

-   **Largest-ever Child Tax Credit:** The American Rescue Plan
    dramatically expanded the Child Tax Credit – providing by far the
    largest credit ever. For families with children under 17, the
    American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 per
    child to $3,000 per child for children over the age of six and from
    $2,000 to $3,600 for children under the age of six. It also raised
    the age limit from 16 to 17, providing families of older children up
    to an additional $3,000 in Child Tax Credit.
-   **First-ever monthly tax payments to the families of 61 million
    children:** In July, just four months after President Biden signed
    the American Rescue Plan, Treasury began distributing advance
    monthly Child Tax Credit payments to the overwhelming majority of
    families with children. Advance payments went out each month from
    July to December 2021 – providing most families with the first half
    of their Child Tax Credit.
-   **Payments were delivered on the same day – the 15<sup>th</sup> – of
    each month from July to December**: Close to 90% of families
    enrolled in advance payments received their Child Tax Credit
    payments with direct deposit – on the 15th of every month (or
    earlier if the 15<sup>th</sup> fell on a weekend or a holiday),
    listed under “CHILDCTC”.
-   **Helping middle class families cover the costs of raising their
    children and dramatically reducing child poverty:** The Child Tax
    Credit is helping middle income families cover the costs of raising
    their children, from paying for
    [childcare](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/10/nearly-a-third-of-parents-spent-child-tax-credit-on-school-expenses.html)
    to making their mortgage and car payments, to
    [helping](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/09/24/the-new-child-tax-credit-does-more-than-just-cut-poverty/)
    build a college fund. The Child Tax Credit is also a critical tool
    to cut child poverty. Treasury estimates that the families of over
    26 million lower-income children will receive the full credit for
    2021 who would have previously gotten a partial credit or no credit
    because they had too little in income. Monthly Child Tax Credit
    payments had an immediate impact –
    [reducing](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29285/w29285.pdf)
    food insufficiency among lower-income families by 25 percent.
    Experts estimate that expanded Child Tax Credit and other critical
    policies in the American Rescue Plan will have brought child poverty
    to its lowest levels on record.
-   **729,000 children in non-filing families received advance payments
    automatically:** The Biden-Harris administration automatically
    enrolled the families of 729,000 children – whose parents or
    guardians had signed up for a previous Economic Impact Payment.
-   **First-ever simplified filing tools Child Tax Credit**: The
    Biden-Harris Administration launched the first-ever non-filer tools
    for the Child Tax Credit in 2021, including a portal that was mobile
    friendly and available in Spanish.

**<u>About the Earned Income Tax Credit: Over 17 Million Americans to
Benefit from Expansion of EITC for Workers Without Dependent
Children.</u>**

The American Rescue Plan expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit to
include more people, more families, and more money by nearly tripling
the credit for workers without dependent children and including younger
(19-24) and older workers (65+) who were previously excluded.

-   **Nearly tripled EITC to $1500 for workers without dependent
    children – benefitting 17 million Americans:** The American Rescue
    Plan nearly tripled the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without
    dependent children from about $540 to $1,500. The Center on Budget
    and Policy Priorities
    [estimates](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/american-rescue-plan-act-includes-critical-expansions-of-child-tax-credit-and)
    that this expansion has the potential to benefit *<u>over 17 million
    Americans</u>.*
-   **First increase to EITC for workers without dependent children
    since 1993:** While the Earned Income Tax Credit provides thousands
    of dollars of critical relief to families with children, workers
    without dependent children, including younger workers, and workers
    with adult children, have not seen a meaningful increase in their
    Earned Income Tax Credit since 1993.
-   **Younger and older workers *<u>are</u>* eligible:** Before the
    American Rescue Plan, people under 25 or 65 and over were ineligible
    for the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent
    children. The American Rescue Plan changed that. Younger workers
    (19-24) who are not half-time or full-time students, and older
    workers (65+) are newly eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit
    for workers without dependent children. In addition – the American
    Rescue Plan increased the cap at which someone’s income made them
    ineligible for a benefit – from about $16,000 to over $21,000 for a
    single filer and from about $21,000 to more than $27,000 for a
    married couple.
