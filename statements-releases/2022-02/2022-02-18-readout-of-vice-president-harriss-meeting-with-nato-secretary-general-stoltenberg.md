Vice President Kamala Harris met today with NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg in Munich, Germany, and underscored our enduring commitment
to the Transatlantic Alliance.

They emphasized their shared support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and
territorial integrity. They also discussed the continued readiness of
the U.S. and NATO to engage in dialogue with Russia, as well as efforts
to strengthen NATO’s deterrence and collective defense in response to
potential further Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Vice President
reiterated that the U.S. commitment to Article 5 and the security of its
NATO Allies is ironclad.
