  \ 19"
---
 
Today, our nation marks another tragic milestone — 900,000 American
lives have been lost to COVID-19. They were beloved mothers and fathers,
grandparents, children, brothers and sisters, neighbors, and
friends. Each soul is irreplaceable. We pray for the loved ones they
have left behind, and together we keep every family enduring this pain
in our hearts.  
   
After nearly two years, I know that the emotional, physical, and
psychological weight of this pandemic has been incredibly difficult to
bear. I know what it’s like to stare at an empty chair around the
kitchen table. But I also know that we carry an incredible capacity
within ourselves — not only to come through our grief stronger, but to
come together to protect one another.  
   
We now have more tools than ever before to save lives and fight this
virus — with vaccines remaining our most important tool. Vaccines and
boosters have proven incredibly effective, and offer the highest level
of protection. Two hundred and fifty million Americans have stepped up
to protect themselves, their families, and their communities by getting
at least one shot — and we have saved more than one million American
lives as a result.  
   
We can save even more lives — and spare countless families from the
deepest pain imaginable — if everybody does their part. I urge all
Americans: get vaccinated, get your kids vaccinated, and get your
booster shot if you are eligible. It’s free, easy, and effective — and
it can save your life, and the lives of those you love.
