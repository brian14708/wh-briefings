title: "FACT SHEET:  President Biden to Lay Out Bold Commitments on Rebuilding America\u2019\
  s Crumbling Infrastructure Over the Next year"
---
 
The historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild crumbling road
and bridges, replace lead pipes, help make available reliable,
affordable high-speed internet to every family in America, and produce
concrete results that change people’s lives for the better. It will also
support American manufacturing jobs by making sure taxpayer dollars are
spent purchasing American made goods. Rebuilding our infrastructure and
supply chains here at home, and making more here in America, means we
can create more good jobs, move what we make more efficiently, and
ultimately lower prices for the American people. By reaching all
communities all across the country – including rural communities and
historically underserved populations – these once-in-a-generation
investments will position the United States to win the 21st century.  
  
In the first 106 days since President Biden signed the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the White House Infrastructure Implementation Team
has [hit the ground
running](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/23/fact-sheet-biden-%e2%81%a0harris-administration-delivering-results-100-days-into-infrastructure-implementation/) to
deliver concrete results for the American people. Nearly $100 billion of
dedicated funding has been announced and is headed to states,
territories, Tribes and local governments, with another nearly $50
billion of notices of funding opportunity released. To date, over 4000
projects have been announced, from airport improvements to port upgrades
to superfund cleanup sites. Over 90 percent of Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law funding will be spent by non-federal partners, meaning the
Biden-Harris administration will be partnering with states, territories,
Tribes, local governments and others to deliver the crucial
infrastructure projects and the good-paying jobs created by these
investments.  
  
**In his first State of the Union Address, President Biden will
highlight how our historic federal investments in infrastructure will
create a visible impact in the lives of American families this year by
committing to start repair on 65,000 miles of roads and 1,500
bridges.** The President will also commit to rapid progress across every
facet of the law.  
  
**TRANSPORTATION**

-   **Roads & Bridges:** As a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law, the Department of Transportation announced $52.5 billion for
    highways and more than $5.3 billion for bridges for fiscal
    year 2022. Over the next year, states, territories, Tribes and local
    governments will start to improve 65,000 miles of roads and 1,500
    bridges with federal funding, representing at 44% and 50% increase
    respectively from average annual improvement levels over the past
    six years.

<!-- -->

-   **Airports:** In December, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
    at USDOT announced $3 billion for 3,075 airports across the country
    that can use investments to upgrade critical infrastructure. Over
    the next year, FAA will be able to invest in over 600 airport
    infrastructure projects, including preserving 400 pavement projects
    on taxiways and runways.

<!-- -->

-   **Transit: **The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes the largest
    Federal investment in public transit in history**. **Over the next
    year, communities will be investing in an estimated 15,000 new
    buses, ferries and subway cars, improving commutes for working
    Americans, families, and students across the country and reducing
    greenhouse emissions.

<!-- -->

-   **Rail:** The Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak are
    transforming the nation’s transportation system. In the next year,
    Amtrak is investing Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding in 75 new,
    Made-in-America locomotives, at least 73 Made-in-America Intercity
    Trainsets, and major improvements to facilities in the Northeast
    Corridor.

<!-- -->

-   **Ports, Waterways, and Flood Mitigation: **With $14 billion in
    funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other
    appropriations, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will advance over
    500 projects across 52 states and territories to strengthen supply
    chains, improve waterways, and reduce flooding. Additional projects
    will be funded by the Port Infrastructure Development Program.

**HIGH-SPEED INTERNET**

-   **Broadband Access & Deployment: **In the next year, the Department
    of Commerce will issue final guidance and notices of funding
    opportunity for the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program
    and the Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program, which together
    will distribute more than $43 billion in broadband funding. The
    Department of Agriculture will issue a new funding opportunity
    notice for the ReConnect program which will provide nearly $2
    billion in funding for rural broadband deployment.

<!-- -->

-   **Broadband Affordability: **Over the next year, the Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC) will build on the more than 10
    million lower-income households already receiving subsidized
    internet service through the Affordable Connectivity Program. The
    FCC will also adopt rules requiring broadband providers to display
    easy-to-understand labels to allow consumers to more effectively
    comparison shop for broadband services.  
     

**CLIMATE, CLEAN ENERGY, AND ENVIRONMENT**

-   **Clean Water: **The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced
    $7.4 billion for Fiscal Year 2022 in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    funding will be available to states to upgrade America’s aging water
    infrastructure, sewerage systems, lead pipes and service lines, and
    more through their State Revolving Fund programs. By this time next
    year, using Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding alone, EPA will
    have worked with state and local governments to fund more than 400
    new water projects from replacing lead service lines to improving
    drinking water systems.

<!-- -->

-   **Abandoned Mine Lands: **The Department of the Interior (DOI)
    announced nearly $725 million in Fiscal Year 2022 funding for 22
    states and the Navajo Nation to create good-paying union jobs and
    catalyze economic opportunity by reclaiming abandoned mine lands.
    Over the next year, DOI expects states, Tribes, and other partners
    to reclaim over 15,000 acres of abandoned mine lands, as well as
    launch new reclamation efforts that will ultimately address tens of
    thousands of additional acres across the country using Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law funds. This investment delivers on President
    Biden’s historic commitment to investing in the revitalization of
    the energy communities that have powered our country for
    generations.

<!-- -->

-   **Orphan Wells: **The first $1.15 billion in funding is now
    available to 26 states to create good-paying jobs cleaning up
    orphaned oil and gas wells across the country. Over the next year,
    we expect the DOI’s new Orphan Well Program will start work
    plugging, capping, and remediating over 8,000 abandoned oil & gas
    well sites in communities across the country.

<!-- -->

-   **Superfund: **EPA announced $1 billion to initiate cleanup and
    clear the backlog of 49 previously unfunded Superfund sites and
    accelerate cleanup at dozens of other sites across the country, with
    work expected at more than 80 Superfund cleanup projects in the next
    year.

<!-- -->

-   **Great Lakes Restoration: **EPA announced $1 billion for the Great
    Lakes Restoration Initiative, including $200 million in Fiscal Year
    2022, to accelerate progress in the clean-up and restoration of the
    Great Lakes’ most environmentally degraded sites, securing clean
    water and a better environment for millions of Americans in the
    Great Lakes region. In the next year, EPA will work across more than
    20 sites across the Great Lakes basin targeting open areas of
    concern.

<!-- -->

-   **Wildfire Resilience: **In the next year, the DOI will increase its
    work to reduce the risk of wildfires to communities by more than 30
    percent– removing over 300,000 acres of burnable fuels in the places
    where communities and wildlands meet – as well as the start of work
    to reduce wildfire risk on an additional 250,000 acres across the
    country. With BIL funding and existing appropriations, the US Forest
    Service at the Department of Agriculture also expects to execute
    hazardous fuels reduction work on more than 4 million acres over the
    next year, including reforesting up to 400,000 acres to create new
    carbon sinks on previously burned lands.

-   **Critical Mineral Refinery: **The Department of Energy (DOE)
    released a Request for Information for the construction and
    operation of a first-of-its kind $140 million demonstration facility
    to extract and separate rare earth elements and other critical
    minerals from coal ash, mine tailings, acid drainage, and other
    legacy fossil fuel waste to sustainably produce materials key to
    next-generation clean energy technologies. This facility will
    support good-paying manufacturing jobs and help secure a sustainable
    domestic supply chain to fight the climate crisis.  
     
-   **Battery Manufacturing:** This Spring, DOE will make available
    nearly $3 billion to bolster domestic manufacturing of advanced
    batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage. This includes
    refining and production of battery materials, manufacturing of
    battery cells and packs, and end-of-life recycling to create
    good-paying manufacturing jobs and support growing demand for
    electric vehicles and energy storage to meet the Administration’s
    ambitious net-zero climate goals.
