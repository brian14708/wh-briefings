Today, as part of Black History Month celebrations, the White House
hosted a virtual roundtable on Black mental health and wellness. White
House Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice moderated a discussion with
Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, Dr. Miriam
Delphin-Rittmon, from the Department of Health and Human Services;
Golden Globe Award-winning actress and singer, Taraji P. Henson;
professional tennis player and 2017 U.S. Open Champion Sloane Stephens;
and WNBA MVP and Players’ Association President, Nneka Ogwumike of the
Los Angeles Sparks. Participants spoke about their own mental health
challenges, the importance of seeking support and self-care, and their
work to end stigma. The conversation also highlighted efforts by the
Biden-Harris Administration to prioritize mental health and diversify
our nation’s behavioral health workforce.
