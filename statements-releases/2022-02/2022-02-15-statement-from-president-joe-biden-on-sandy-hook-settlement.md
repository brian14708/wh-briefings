title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Sandy Hook\_Settlement"
---
 
Today, the families of nine victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School
Shooting have secured a historic settlement with the gun manufacturer
Remington. While this settlement does not erase the pain of that tragic
day, it does begin the necessary work of holding gun manufacturers
accountable for manufacturing weapons of war and irresponsibly marketing
these firearms.  
   
This progress is the result of the perseverance of nine families who
turned tragedy into purpose. They have demonstrated that state and city
consumer protection laws – like Connecticut’s Unfair Trade Practices Act
– provide an opportunity to hold gun manufacturers and dealers
accountable for wrongdoing despite the persistence of the federal
immunity shield for these companies.   
   
As I have repeatedly called for, Congress must repeal the Protection of
Lawful Commerce in Arms Act so we can fully hold gun manufacturers and
dealers accountable. But, in the meantime, I will continue to urge state
and local lawmakers, lawyers, and survivors of gun violence to pursue
efforts to replicate the success of the Sandy Hook families. Together,
we can deliver a clear message to gun manufacturers and dealers: they
must either change their business models to be part of the solution for
the gun violence epidemic, or they will bear the financial cost of their
complicity.
