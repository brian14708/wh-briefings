In accordance with section 6603(a)(1) of the National Defense

that, no later than February 25, 2022, you issue, updated guidance to
the elements of your workforce who are determined to be at risk of

coordination with the AHI Interagency Coordinator.   
   
Swift implementation of the AHI provisions in the FY22 NDAA will serve
as an important demonstration of my Administration’s continued
commitment to the workforce and to enhancing the United States
