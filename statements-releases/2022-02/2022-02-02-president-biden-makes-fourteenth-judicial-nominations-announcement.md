title: President Biden Makes Fourteenth Judicial Nominations Announcement
---
 
The President is announcing a judicial nominee, who is extraordinarily
qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our
Constitution. This choice continues to fulfill the President’s promise
to ensure that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of
our greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.

Stephanie Dawkins Davis is the President’s nominee to the Sixth Circuit
of the U.S. Court of Appeals.  Judge Davis would be the first Black
woman to serve on the Sixth Circuit from Michigan and only the second
Black woman to serve on the Sixth Circuit.

This is President Biden’s fourteenth announcement of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 84.

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies.
