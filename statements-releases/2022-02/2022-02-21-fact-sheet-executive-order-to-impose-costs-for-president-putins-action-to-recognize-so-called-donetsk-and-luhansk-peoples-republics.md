title: "FACT SHEET: Executive Order to Impose Costs for President Putin\u2019s Action\
  \ to Recognize So-Called Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s\_Republics"
---
 
Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) to respond to
President Putin’s action to purportedly recognize the so-called Donetsk
and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR) as “independent” states.
President Putin’s action contradicts Russia’s commitments under the
Minsk agreements, refutes Russia’s claimed commitment to diplomacy, and
undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

This E.O. is distinct from the swift and severe economic measures we are
prepared to issue with Allies and partners in response to a further
Russian invasion of Ukraine. We are continuing to closely consult with
Ukraine and with Allies and partners on next steps and urge Russia to
immediately deescalate.

**Today’s E.O. prohibits:**

-   New investment in the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine by a
    United States person, wherever located;
-   The importation into the United States, directly or indirectly, of
    any goods, services, or technology from the so-called DNR or LNR
    regions of Ukraine;
-   The exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or
    indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person,
    wherever located, of any goods, services, or technology to the
    so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine;
-   And any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United
    States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign
    person where the transaction by that foreign person would be covered
    by these prohibitions if performed by a United States person or
    within the United States.

**The E.O. also provides authority to impose sanctions on persons
determined:**

-   To operate or have operated since the date of the order in the
    so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine;
-   To be or have been since the date of the order a leader, official,
    senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of an
    entity operating in the so-called DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine;
-   To be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act
    for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose
    property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this
    order;
-   Or to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial,
    material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or
    in support of, any person whose property and interests in property
    are blocked pursuant to this order.

**The Department of the Treasury is issuing six General Licenses to
ensure that humanitarian and other related activity can continue in
these regions:**

-   The purpose of this E.O. is to deny Russia the chance to profit from
    its blatant violations of international law. These actions are not
    directed at the people of Ukraine or the Ukrainian government.
-   Treasury’s General Licenses are designed to support the innocent
    people who live in the so-called DNR and LNR regions who did not
    have a choice in Russia’s destabilizing and illegitimate actions
    today.
-   The licenses allow a short-term wind down of activities, as well as
    for the export to the regions of food, medicine and medical devices,
    and ensure personal remittances can continue to flow.
-   The licenses also allow telecommunications and internet services to
    remain operational, and mail services to continue.
-   The licenses allow international organizations to be able to provide
    aid to the people in these two regions.

The United States will not hesitate to use its authorities to target
those supporting efforts to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and
territorial integrity. This authority provides the United States with
the flexibility to impose similar restrictions on any other regions of
Ukraine as appropriate.
