National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan held a secure video call with
Bjoern Seibert, Head of Cabinet of the President of the European
Commission on February 10. They discussed their concerns about Russia’s
continued build-up of military forces around Ukraine, as well as
preparations to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on
Russia should it choose military escalation.  They coordinated the
details of a potential transatlantic response, including both financial
sanctions and export controls, imposed in coordination by the United
States, the European Union, and other partners and Allies.  They also
agreed to continue the close partnership between the United States and
the European Union on a wide range of issues including energy security,
COVID-19, health security, and partnership on international
infrastructure development through the Build Back Better World and
Global Gateway initiatives.
