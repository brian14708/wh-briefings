  \ in\_2023"

We’re proud that the United States will be the host of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) in 2023, underscoring our commitment to
advance fair and open trade and investment, bolster American
competitiveness, and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. President
Biden and Vice President Harris offered to host APEC next year because
of our focus on expanding and deepening economic ties in the region –
and we thank our fellow APEC economies for supporting the U.S. offer to
host. 

It is a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration to serve as a
strong, reliable partner to APEC economies and identify common ways to
unleash economic opportunity, prosperity, and growth for us all.
Secretary of Commerce Raimondo, United States Trade Representative
Ambassador Tai, and our team are working to develop with our partners an
Indo-Pacific economic framework that will define our shared objectives
around issues vital to our future, including trade facilitation,
standards for the digital economy and technology, supply chain
resiliency, decarbonization and clean energy, infrastructure, and worker
standards. Secretary of State Blinken is also in the region this week to
continue strengthening key diplomatic relationships and advancing our
shared priorities.

The United States looks forward to working closely with Thailand, the
2022 APEC host, Peru, the 2024 APEC host, and all of the APEC economies
on an agenda that benefits all our people.
