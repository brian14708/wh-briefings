title: Readout of White House Meeting with Parents to Discuss Efforts to Invest in
  Children and Cut the Cost of Child Care
---
 
Today, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary
Xavier Becerra, Gender Policy Council Director Jen Klein, and Deputy
Assistant to the President for Economic Mobility Carmel Martin hosted a
conversation with parents and their children at the White House to
discuss the need to cut the crushing child care costs families face and
increase the supply of high-quality child care.

  
The Administration officials highlighted President Biden’s plans to make
the largest investment in child care and preschool in the nation’s
history, saving most working families more than half of their spending
on child care and expanding the number of high-quality child care
providers. The President’s plan would also enable states to deliver two
years of free pre-school for every 3- and 4-year old in a setting of
their parents’ choice – from public schools and child care providers to
Head Start. They reiterated that early learning experiences help
children succeed later in life; research shows that every $1 invested in
high-quality early childhood care and education can yield $3 to $7 over
the long-run, as children do better in school, are more likely to
graduate high-school and college, and earn more as adults.

  
The parents attending the event shared that the high costs of child care
and the difficulty of finding quality, affordable child care near their
homes made it challenging for them to provide for their families and
remain in the workforce. One family member noted spending more than
$2,000 a month in child care expense and the immense strain that put on
their family’s expenses. The families discussed how the pandemic
exacerbated many of the challenges they were already facing when it
comes to child care and emphasized how the President’s plans will help
families access high-quality early childhood care and education.
