Federal funding is available to Commonwealth and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a

facilities damaged by the severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes,
flooding, landslides, and mudslides in the counties of Boyd, Breathitt,
Carter, Christian, Clay, Floyd, Green, Johnson, Knott, Lawrence, Owsley,
