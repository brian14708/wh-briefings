title: 'Fact Sheet: President Biden Reignites Cancer Moonshot to End Cancer as We
  Know It'
---
 
*Biden-Harris Administration Sets Goal of Reducing Cancer Death Rate by
at least 50 Percent Over the Next 25 Years, and Improving the Experience
of Living with and Surviving Cancer*

As Vice President, in 2016, Joe Biden launched the Cancer Moonshot with
the mission to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer. The
cancer and patient community and medical researchers responded with
tremendous energy and ingenuity.

Today, President Biden is **reigniting the Cancer Moonshot with renewed
White House leadership of this effort**. Because of recent progress in
cancer therapeutics, diagnostics, and patient-driven care, as well as
the scientific advances and public health lessons of the COVID-19
pandemic, it’s now possible to set ambitious goals: to **reduce the
death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years,**
and **improve the experience of people and their families living with
and surviving cancer**— and, by doing this and more**, end cancer as we
know it today.  
**  
The President and First Lady Jill Biden are also announcing a **call to
action on cancer screening** to jumpstart progress on screenings that
were missed as a result of the pandemic, and help ensure that everyone
in the United States equitably benefits from the tools we have to
prevent, detect, and diagnose cancer.  
  
**Building on a Quarter Century of Bipartisan Support, Public Health
Progress, and Scientific Advances**  
Over the first 20 years of this century, the age-adjusted death rate
from cancer has fallen by about 25 percent, which means more people are
surviving cancer and living longer after being diagnosed with cancer.
That was enabled by progress on multiple fronts.

-   Science brought us **treatments that target specific mutations** in
    many types of cancer –for example, in certain types of lung cancer,
    leukemia, and skin cancers.
-   It has also provided therapies that use our immune system to detect
    and kill cancer cells and these **immunotherapies** are making a big
    difference in certain skin cancers, blood cancers, and others.
-   We also have **cancer vaccines** – like the HPV vaccine –which
    prevents the cause of up to seven kinds of cancer. 
-   We developed **tools, like low-dose CT scans and refined use of
    colonoscopies**, which help us detect lung cancer and colorectal
    cancers early when there are better treatment options.
-   Starting in the early 1990s, we also made progress against tobacco
    use through targeted public health education campaigns as well as
    **new, more effective approaches to smoking cessation**. We have
    seen a 50 percent decrease in adult long-term cigarette smoking and
    a 68 percent drop in smoking rates among youth.

Five years ago, with the bipartisan passage and enactment of the **21st
Century Cures Act, Congress invested $1.8 billion**, providing seven
years of new funding for cancer research in many areas including studies
on cancer disparities, new clinical trial networks to drive drug
discovery, and innovative projects examining childhood cancer. The law
streamlined cancer-related decision-making at the FDA through the
formation of an Oncology Center of Excellence, so that effective
treatments can be approved faster and patients can have more direct
access to information about the regulatory process.

First Lady Jill Biden’s advocacy for cancer education and prevention
began in 1993, when four of her friends were diagnosed with breast
cancer. Following that year, she launched the Biden Breast Health
Initiative to educate Delaware high school girls about the importance of
cancer prevention.  As First Lady she continues her work emphasizing
early detection efforts and the patient, family and caregiver experience
with cancer.   She will also stress the importance of cancer screenings,
especially those delayed or put off due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
will urge government partners, the business community, and non-profit
sectors to help make screenings more accessible and available to all. 

At the White House, then-Vice President Biden brought together a task
force and challenged the public and private sectors to join together in
making progress. Companies, patient groups, universities, and
foundations worked together to forge new partnerships and launch new
programs.

**The Biden-Harris Administration Has Maintained This Commitment**  
In the President’s first budget, he sustained strong funding for
biomedical and health research with **increased funding for the NIH**
and **NCI,** and full funding for the **21st Century Cures Act** and the
**Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative** at the NCI**.  
**  
President Biden proposed a bold new vision for biomedical and health
research in the **Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health
(ARPA-H).** The goal of this entity is to improve the U.S. government’s
capabilities to speed research that can improve human health — to
improve our ability to prevent, detect, and treat a range of diseases
including cancer, infectious diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, and many
others. ARPA-H funding has already been included in appropriation and
authorization bills pending in Congress.

President Biden committed to **a bilateral effort with the United
Kingdom** to take on the challenges of cancer together. This has already
resulted in a November 2021 US-UK Cancer Scientific Meeting of
leadership, patient advocates, and oncology research experts which
produced recommendations for how the two nations can work in partnership
to make even more urgent progress on cancer.

**The Biden-Harris Administration has also prioritized strengthening
health care for the American people** by lowering health care costs and
expanding coverage. The President’s health care agenda is the biggest
expansion of affordable health care in a decade, and includes cutting
prescription drug costs by letting Medicare negotiate prices;
strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reducing premiums for 9
million Americans; improving Medicare benefits by capping out-of-pocket
costs on drugs, including cancer drugs, purchased at a pharmacy; and
covering millions of uninsured Americans in states that have failed to
expand Medicaid. 

**New Goals for the Cancer Moonshot**  
Based on the progress made and the possibility before us, President
Biden today set new national goals for the Cancer Moonshot:

-   Working together over the next 25 years, **we will cut today’s
    age-adjusted death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent.**
-   We will **improve the experience of people and their families living
    with and surviving cancer.**

Taken together, these actions will drive us toward **ending cancer as we
know it today.**

There’s so much that can be done.

-   **To diagnose cancer sooner** — Today, we know cancer as a disease
    we often diagnose too late. We must increase access to existing ways
    to screen for cancer, and support patients through the process of
    diagnosis. We can also greatly expand the cancers we can screen for.
    Five years ago, detecting many cancers at once through blood tests
    was a dream. Now new technologies and rigorous clinical trials could
    put this within our reach. Detecting and diagnosing cancers earlier
    means there may be more effective treatment options.   
-   **To prevent cancer** — Today, we know cancer as a disease we have
    few good ways to prevent. But now, scientists are asking if mRNA
    technology, used in the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to
    teach your body to fight off the virus, could be used to stop cancer
    cells when they first appear. And we know we can address
    environmental exposures to cancer, including by cleaning up polluted
    sites and delivering clean water to American homes, for example,
    through the [Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-advances-environmental-justice/).  
-   **To address inequities** — Today, we know cancer as a disease for
    which there are stark inequities in access to cancer screening,
    diagnostics and treatment across race, gender, region, and
    resources. We can ensure that every community in America – rural,
    urban, Tribal, and everywhere else – has access to cutting-edge
    cancer diagnostics, therapeutics, and clinical trials.  
-   **To target the right treatments to the right patients** — Today, we
    know cancer as a disease for which we understand too little about
    why treatments work for some patients, but not for others. We are
    learning more about how to use information about genetics, immune
    responses, and other factors to tell which combinations of
    treatments are likely to work best in an individual patient.  
-   **To speed progress against the most deadly and rare cancers,
    including childhood cancers** — Today, we know cancer as a disease
    for which we lack good strategies for developing treatments against
    many of the more than 200 distinct types. We can invest in a robust
    pipeline for new treatments, and the COVID-19 pandemic response has
    demonstrated we can accelerate clinical trials without compromising
    safety and effectiveness.   
-   **To support patients, caregivers, and survivors** — Today, we know
    cancer as a disease in which we do not do enough to help people and
    families navigate cancer and its aftermath. We can help people
    overcome the medical, financial, and emotional burdens that cancer
    brings by providing support to navigate cancer diagnosis, treatment,
    and survivorship.  
-   **To learn from all patients** — Today, we know cancer as a disease
    in which we don’t learn from the experiences of most patients. We
    can turn our cancer care system into a learning system. When asked,
    most people with cancer are glad to make their data available for
    research to help future patients, if it can be done easily while
    respecting their privacy. Additionally, the diverse personal
    experiences of patients and their families make their input
    essential in developing approaches to end cancer as we know it.

**Mobilizing the Entire Government**  
Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the Cancer Moonshot will
specifically:

-   **Re-establish White House Leadership**, with a White House Cancer
    Moonshot coordinator in the Executive Office of the President, to
    demonstrate the President and First Lady’s personal commitment to
    making progress and to leverage the whole-of-government approach and
    national response that the challenge of cancer demands.  
-   **Form a Cancer Cabinet**, which will be convened by the White
    House, bringing together departments and agencies across government
    to address cancer on multiple fronts. These include the Department
    of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Veterans Affairs
    (VA), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE),
    Department of Agriculture (USDA), Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer
    Institute (NCI), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for
    Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC), Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP),
    Domestic Policy Council (DPC), Gender Policy Council (GPC), Office
    of the First Lady (OFL), Office of the Vice President (OVP), Office
    of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA),
    Office of Public Engagement (OPE), along with additional members, as
    needed, to help establish and make progress on Cancer Moonshot
    goals.   
-   **Issue a Call to Action on Cancer Screening and Early Detection**:
    -   To deliver the message of urgency and increased access to **get
        back on track after more than 9.5 million missed cancer
        screenings in the United States as a result of the COVID-19
        pandemic**. With regular recommended screenings, we can often
        catch cancer when there may be more effective treatment options
        or even prevent it from developing by removing pre-cancerous
        tissue.
    -   To help ensure equitable access to screening and prevention
        through **at-home screening** (especially for colon cancer and
        HPV, the virus that causes cervical, head, neck and other
        cancers), **mobile screening** in communities without easy
        access to a clinic, through the **community health networks** we
        have built and strengthened during the COVID-19 pandemic, and
        other ways to reduce barriers to cancer screening.
    -   NCI will organize the collective efforts of the NCI cancer
        centers, and other networks such as the NCI Community Oncology
        Research Network (NCORP), to **offer new access points to
        compensate for millions of delayed cancer screenings** due to
        the pandemic, with a focus on reaching those individuals most at
        risk.
    -   Federal agencies, led by the NCI, will develop a focused program
        to expeditiously **study and evaluate multicancer detection
        tests**, like we did for COVID-19 diagnostics, which could help
        detect cancers when there may be more effective treatment
        options.
    -   The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) commits to
        **accelerating efforts to nearly eliminate cervical cancer
        through screening and HPV vaccination**, with a particular focus
        on reaching people who are most at risk.
    -   The **President’s Cancer panel this week released a report
        “**[**Closing Gaps in Cancer
        Screening**](https://prescancerpanel.cancer.gov/report/cancerscreening)**”** laying
        out recommendations focused on connecting people, communities,
        and systems to increase equity and access.  
-   **Host a White House Cancer Moonshot Summit**, bringing together
    agency leadership, patient organizations, biopharmaceutical
    companies, the research, public health, and healthcare communities
    and more to highlight innovation, progress, and new commitments
    toward ending cancer as we know it.   
-   **Build on a White House Cancer Roundtable Conversation Series**
    hosted over the last six months, with experts, including people
    living with cancer, caregivers, and survivors. These discussions
    focused on cancer prevention, early detection, clinical trial design
    and access, patient support and navigation, childhood cancer,
    learning from all patients and issues relating to equity in access
    and outcomes. Going forward, this will include discussions on
    additional topics and the knowledge gained will continue to inform
    this whole-of-government approach on cancer.  
-   **Require an All-Hands-On-Deck Approach. President Biden calls on
    the private sector, foundations, academic institutions, healthcare
    providers, and all Americans** to take on the mission of reducing
    the deadly impact of cancer and improving patient experiences in the
    diagnosis, treatment, and survival of cancer. Progress will be
    informed by people living with cancer, caregivers, and families and
    contributed by all parts of the oncology community and beyond. We
    invite all Americans to share perspectives and ideas, and
    organizations, companies, and institutions to share actions they
    plan to take as part of this mission
    at **whitehouse.gov/cancermoonshot**.
