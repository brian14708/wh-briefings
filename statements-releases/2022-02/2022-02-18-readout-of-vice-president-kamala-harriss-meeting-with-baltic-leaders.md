Vice President Kamala Harris met today with President Egils Levits of
Latvia, President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania, and Prime Minister Kaja
Kallas of Estonia in Munich, Germany. This meeting was part of the
Biden-Harris Administration’s extensive engagement with Allies on a
unified approach to Russia’s aggressive actions. The leaders discussed
their readiness for a swift Transatlantic response should Russia further
invade Ukraine, including through adjustments to U.S. and NATO force
posture, and implementation of financial sanctions and export
controls.  
   
Vice President Harris emphasized that our commitment to Article 5 of the
NATO Treaty is ironclad and that we stand united with our NATO Allies in
opposing Russian aggression. The leaders also discussed efforts to
strengthen NATO’s deterrence and collective defense.
