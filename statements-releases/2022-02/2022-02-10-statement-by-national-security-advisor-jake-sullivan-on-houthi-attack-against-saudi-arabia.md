title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Houthi Attack Against\
  \ Saudi\_Arabia"

The United States strongly condemns today’s terrorist attack against
Abha in Saudi Arabia, which injured at least a dozen innocent civilians.
 The Houthis have claimed responsibility for this attack, and we will
work with our Saudi and international partners to hold them accountable.
  As the President told His Majesty King Salman yesterday, we are
committed to supporting Saudi Arabia in the defense of its people and
territory from these attacks.  America will have the backs of our
friends in the region.
