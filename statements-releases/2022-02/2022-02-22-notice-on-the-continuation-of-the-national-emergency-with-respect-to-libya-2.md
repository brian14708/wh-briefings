title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to\_Libya"
---
 
On February 25, 2011, by Executive Order 13566, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his
government, and close associates, which took extreme measures against
the people of Libya, including by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and
wanton violence against unarmed civilians.  In addition, there was a
serious risk that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated by
Qadhafi, members of his government, members of his family, or his close
associates if those assets were not protected.  The foregoing
circumstances, the prolonged attacks, and the increased numbers of
Libyans seeking refuge in other countries from the attacks caused a
deterioration in the security of Libya and posed a serious risk to its
stability.

On April 19, 2016, the President signed Executive Order 13726, which
expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13566.  The President found that the ongoing violence in Libya,
including attacks by armed groups against Libyan state facilities,
foreign missions in Libya, and critical infrastructure, as well as human
rights abuses, violations of the arms embargo imposed by United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1970 (2011), and misappropriation of Libya’s
natural resources threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty,
democratic transition, and territorial integrity of Libya, and thereby
constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security
and foreign policy of the United States.

The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,
and measures are needed to protect against the diversion of assets or
other abuses by members of Qadhafi’s family, their associates, and other
persons hindering Libyan national reconciliation.

For this reason, the national emergency declared on February 25, 2011,
and expanded on April 19, 2016, must continue in effect beyond February
25, 2022.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.  
                              

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. 

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
February 22, 2022.
