Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Proclamation 9994 of
March 13, 2020, beginning March 1, 2020, concerning the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is to continue in effect beyond March
1, 2022.  
  
There remains a need to continue this national emergency.  The COVID-19
pandemic continues to cause significant risk to the public health and
safety of the Nation.  More than 900,000 people in this Nation have
perished from the disease, and it is essential to continue to combat and
respond to COVID-19 with the full capacity and capability of the Federal
Government.  
  
Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Proclamation 9994 concerning the COVID-19
pandemic.

Sincerely,  
  
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
