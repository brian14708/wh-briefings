*Biden-Harris Administration, Companies Announce Major Investments to
Expand Domestic Critical Minerals Supply Chain, Breaking Dependence on
China and Boosting Sustainable Practices*

Critical minerals provide the building blocks for many modern
technologies and are essential to our national security and economic
prosperity. These minerals—such as rare earth elements, lithium, and
cobalt—can be found in products from computers to household appliances.
They are also key inputs in clean energy technologies like batteries,
electric vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels. As the world
transitions to a clean energy economy, global demand for these critical
minerals is set to skyrocket by 400-600 percent over the next several
decades, and, for minerals such as lithium and graphite used in electric
vehicle (EV) batteries, demand will increase by even more—as much as
4,000 percent. The U.S. is increasingly dependent on foreign sources for
many of the processed versions of these minerals. Globally, China
controls most of the market for processing and refining for cobalt,
lithium, rare earths and other critical minerals.

Executive Order 14017 (E.O.)*,* [*America’s Supply
Chains*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/),
signed one year ago this week, ordered a review of vulnerabilities in
our critical mineral and material supply chains within 100 days. In
June, the Biden-Harris Administration released a first-of-its-kind
[supply chain
assessment](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf)
that found our over-reliance on foreign sources and adversarial nations
for critical minerals and materials posed national and economic security
threats.

In addition to working with partners and allies to diversify sustainable
sources, the reports recommended expanding domestic mining, production,
processing, and recycling of critical minerals and materials—all with a
laser focus on boosting strong labor, environmental and environmental
justice, community engagement, and Tribal consultation standards.

**Today, President Biden will meet with Administration and state
partners, industry executives, community representatives, labor leaders,
and California Governor Gavin Newsom to announce major investments in
domestic production of key critical minerals and materials, ensuring
these resources benefit the community, and creating good-paying, union
jobs in sustainable production.**

-   President Biden will announce that the Department of Defense’s
    Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment program has awarded MP
    Materials **$35 million** to separate and process heavy rare earth
    elements at its facility in Mountain Pass, California, establishing
    a full end-to-end domestic permanent magnet supply chain. Paired
    with this catalytic public funding announcement, MP Materials will
    announce it will invest another **$700 million** and create more
    than 350 jobs in the magnet supply chain by 2024. Currently, China
    controls 87 percent of the global permanent magnet market, which are
    used in EV motors, defense systems, electronics, and wind
    turbines.  
-   Berkshire Hathaway Energy Renewables (BHE Renewables) will announce
    that this spring, they will break ground on a new demonstration
    facility in Imperial County, California, to test the commercial
    viability of their sustainable lithium extraction process from
    geothermal brine as part of a **multibillion-dollar** investment in
    sustainable lithium production over the next five years. If
    successful, this sets the company a path towards commercial scale
    production of battery grade lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate
    by 2026. Imperial Valley contains some of the largest deposits of
    lithium in the world. Once at scale, BHE Renewables facilities could
    produce 90,000 metric tons of lithium per year.  
-   Redwood Materials will discuss a pilot, in partnership with Ford and
    Volvo, for collection and recycling of end-of-life lithium-ion
    batteries at its Nevada based facilities to extract lithium, cobalt,
    nickel, and graphite. This builds upon Redwood’s recent
    announcements including a joint venture with Ford to build a
    recycling facility in Tennessee and its intention to begin
    construction on a new cathode manufacturing facility in Nevada in
    2022.  
-   Secretary Granholm will discuss DOE’s first-of-its-kind **$140
    million** [demonstration
    project](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-launches-140-million-program-develop-americas-first-kind-critical-minerals-refinery)
    funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) to recover rare
    earth elements and critical minerals from coal ash and other mine
    waste, reducing the need for new mining. This project will deliver
    on the work of the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant
    Communities and Economic Revitalization by creating good-paying
    manufacturing jobs in legacy coal communities.  
-   She will also discuss **$3 billion** in [BIL
    funding](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-doe-invest-3-billion-strengthen-us-supply-chain-advanced-batteries)
    to invest in refining battery materials such as lithium, cobalt,
    nickel, and graphite, and battery recycling facilities, creating
    good-paying clean energy manufacturing jobs.

**These are only the latest in announcements by major companies
committing to domestic sourcing of critical minerals and materials:**

-   MP Materials [recently
    announced](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-to-build-us-magnet-factory-enters-long-term-supply-agreement-with-general-motors/)
    construction of a rare earth metal, alloy and magnet manufacturing
    facility in Texas and a long-term supply agreement with General
    Motors to power the motors in more than a dozen of GM’s EV models.
    Production will begin next year, with capacity to produce enough
    magnets to power 500,000 EV motors annually.  
-   In addition to BHE Renewables, Controlled Thermal Resources (CTR)
    and EnergySource Minerals have established operations in Imperial
    County to extract lithium from geothermal brine. GM will source
    lithium for EV batteries from CTR. The companies are also working
    with the state-authorized Lithium Valley Commission to develop a
    royalty structure that would invest profits from their operations in
    infrastructure, health, and educational investments for the
    residents of the surrounding region.  
-   Tesla intends to source high-grade nickel for EV batteries from
    Talon Metals’ Tamarack nickel project under development in
    Minnesota. Talon Metals and the United Steelworkers (USW) have
    established a [workforce development
    partnership](https://talonmetals.com/talon-metals-and-steelworkers-union-partner-to-advance-the-tamarack-nickel-project-for-us-ev-battery-supply-chain/)
    for the project to train workers on next-generation technologies in
    the local community and from mining regions in the U.S. facing
    declining demand. As part of this partnership, Talon has agreed to
    remain neutral in any union organizing efforts by USW.

**Ahead of the one-year anniversary of E.O. 14017 this Thursday, the
Administration has taken action across the Federal government to secure
reliable and sustainable supplies of critical minerals and materials,
while also upholding the Administration’s labor, environmental and
environmental justice, and equity priorities:**

-   **Updating outdated mining laws and regulations.** This year, the
    Mining Law of 1872 turns 150. This law still governs mining of most
    critical minerals on federal public lands. Today, the Department of
    Interior (DOI)
    [announced](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-launches-interagency-working-group-mining-reform)
    it has established an Interagency Working Group (IWG) that will lead
    an Administration effort on legislative and regulatory reform of
    mine permitting and oversight. The IWG released a list of
    Biden-Harris Administration [fundamental principles for mining
    reform](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/biden-harris-administration-fundamental-principles-for-domestic-mining-reform.pdf)
    to promote responsible mining under strong social, environmental,
    and labor standards that avoids the historic injustice that too many
    mining operations have left behind. The IWG will deliver
    recommendations to Congress by November. They will also host
    extensive public input and comment sessions to ensure an inclusive
    process, and will work with the relevant agencies to initiate
    updates to mining regulations by the end of the calendar year.  
-   **Updating and prioritizing the Federal list of critical minerals.**
    Today, pursuant to the Energy Act of 2020, DOI will update its
    Federal list of critical minerals, listing minerals essential to
    economic or national security and vulnerable to disruption. To focus
    the work of Federal agencies on sourcing critical minerals, the
    Administration will direct agencies to prioritize the production and
    processing of minerals necessary to produce key products like
    batteries, semiconductors, and permanent magnets, consistent with
    our strong environmental, social and labor principles.  
-   **Strengthening critical mineral stockpiling.** DOE, DOD, and the
    Department of State signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) to better
    coordinate stockpiling activities to support the U.S. transition to
    clean energy and national security needs. In October, President
    Biden streamlined the National Defense Stockpile by signing [E.O.
    14051](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/10/31/executive-order-on-the-designation-to-exercise-authority-over-the-national-defense-stockpile/#:~:text=This%20order%20confers%20authority%20related,stockpiling%20for%20national%20defense%20purposes.)
    to delegate authority release of strategic and critical materials to
    the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.
