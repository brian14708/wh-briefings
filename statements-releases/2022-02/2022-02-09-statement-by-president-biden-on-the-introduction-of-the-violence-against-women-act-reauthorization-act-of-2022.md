title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Introduction of the Violence Against\
  \ Women Act Reauthorization Act of\_2022"

I applaud the bipartisan group of Senators who have joined together to
introduce the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022
(VAWA), following passage last year of a bipartisan bill in the House of
Representatives to renew and significantly strengthen this essential
law.  I am especially grateful to Senators Feinstein, Ernst, Durbin, and
Murkowski for their ongoing leadership and commitment. I commend the
tremendous dedication of advocates and honor the courage and resilience
of survivors who have been on the frontlines of advocacy efforts to
improve laws and work toward creating a society where everyone has an
opportunity to thrive without fear of violence or abuse.  I urge the
Senate to move quickly to get this passed. 

When I first wrote and championed the original VAWA legislation, it
helped break a dam of congressional and cultural resistance that too
often saw domestic violence as a ‘family issue,’ with legal and social
burdens placed on survivors rather than perpetrators.  In the nearly
three decades since its passage, the law has been reauthorized three
times with broad bipartisan support.  Each time, I have helped work to
strengthen its protections — expanding access to safety and resources
for all survivors, particularly those from marginalized communities. And
while studies have shown that domestic violence and sexual assault rates
have declined significantly since VAWA took effect, we know that we
still have work to do.

The VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022 will expand prevention efforts and
protections for survivors, including those from underserved communities,
and will provide increased resources and training for law enforcement
and our judicial system.  It will strengthen rape prevention and
education efforts, support rape crisis centers, improve the training of
sexual assault forensic examiners, and broaden access to legal services
for all survivors, among other things.

Combatting domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and
stalking should not be a Democratic issue or Republican issue. It’s a
matter of justice and compassion.  I am grateful that this critical
bipartisan bill is moving forward, and I look forward to Congress
delivering it to my desk without delay.
