title: Joint Statement Between the United States and France on the One Ocean Summit
  in France
---
 
The United States and France are committed to protecting our environment
for future generations. Recognizing the transboundary aspects of plastic
pollution and the importance of curbing it at its source, the United
States and France support launching negotiations at the upcoming 5th UN
Environment Assembly (UNEA) on a global agreement to address the full
lifecycle of plastics and promote a circular economy.  The agreement
should include binding and non-binding commitments, call on countries to
develop and implement ambitious national action plans, and foster robust
engagement of stakeholders to contribute toward the agreement’s
objectives while complementing national government contributions.  We
look forward to partnering with other countries to achieve a successful
outcome at UNEA and in the development of such a global agreement.
