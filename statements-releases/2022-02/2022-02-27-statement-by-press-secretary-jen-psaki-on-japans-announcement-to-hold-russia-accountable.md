  \ Russia\_Accountable"

We welcome Japan’s announcement today that it will stand with the
European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada,
and the United States to isolate Russia from the international financial
system and our economies. Following Japan’s announcement, the entire G7
now supports disconnecting selected Russian banks from SWIFT,
restrictions on the Russian Central Bank, and sanctioning key Russian
leaders, including President Putin. Prime Minister Kishida and the
Government of Japan have been leaders in condemning President Putin’s
attack on Ukraine and we will continue working closely together to
impose further severe costs and make Putin’s war of choice a strategic
failure.
