Even as we engage and respond forcefully to the crisis unfolding in
Ukraine, we are focused on the crucial work of advancing economic
progress at home. Today, we received news confirming the strength and
resilience of the American economy: GDP increased 7 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2021 and the four-week average of weekly unemployment
claims fell.  A year ago, President Biden signed  [Executive Order
14017](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/)
on *America’s Supply Chains,* launching [a historic year of action and
progress](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Capstone-Report-Biden.pdf)
to strengthen the resilience, security, and sustainability of America’s
supply chains. These actions are contributing to a historic recovery in
American manufacturing and industrial strength, helping to rebuild our
supply chains here at home and make more here in America.

As the President has said: we have more work to do, to bring back
manufacturing to the United States, to make things more affordable for
consumers, and to strengthen the resilience of our supply chains. But we
are making critical progress. The six industrial base reports released
today are an important milestone, laying a strong foundation [upon which
we can

America’s global leadership in technological development and
manufacturing, and create new jobs and new businesses in communities
across America.

To secure America’s supply chains and ensure the United States remains
the most productive and innovative nation in the world, President Biden
is urging Congress to pass a final version of comprehensive
competitiveness legislation, building on USICA and the COMPETES Act.
