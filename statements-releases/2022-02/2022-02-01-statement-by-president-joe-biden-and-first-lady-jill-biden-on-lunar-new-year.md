We send our warmest greetings to everyone celebrating the Lunar New
Year.

Across our country and around the world, families and friends are
gathering together in person and in spirit to celebrate the possibility
and hope of new beginnings.

As we enter this Year of the Tiger — representing strength and courage —
let us continue doing the work of our time to beat this pandemic,
rebuild our economy, and protect our very democracy, which includes
standing up to the hate that continues to target Asian Americans, Native
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.

Every person — no matter their race, background, religion, or language –
is created equal and deserves to be treated equally throughout their
lives. That is the very idea of America and the heart of our
Administration.

Each day, all of our communities are enriched by the diversity and
talents of the people of this nation — from frontline workers and
military families to business leaders and community activists to
artists, entertainers, writers, and public servants.

Together, you show what it means to be the hope and light for better
days ahead. From our family to yours, we wish you peace, prosperity,
health, and a happy Lunar New Year.
