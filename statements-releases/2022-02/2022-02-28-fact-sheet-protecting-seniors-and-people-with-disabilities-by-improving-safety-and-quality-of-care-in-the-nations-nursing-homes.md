title: "FACT SHEET:  Protecting Seniors by Improving Safety and Quality of Care in\
  \ the Nation\u2019s Nursing\_Homes"
---
 
All people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and to have
access to quality medical care. The President is committed to ensuring
that all Americans, including older Americans and people with
disabilities, live in a society that is accessible, inclusive, and
equitable.  To accomplish that goal, the Administration continues to be
committed to home- and community-based services and ensuring that in no
case should a health care facility be causing a patient harm. The
President believes we must improve the quality of our nursing homes so
that seniors, people with disabilities, and others living in nursing
homes get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve. That’s why he is
announcing a set of reforms—developed by and implemented through the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—that will improve the
safety and quality of nursing home care, hold nursing homes accountable
for the care they provide, and make the quality of care and facility
ownership more transparent so that potential residents and their loved
ones can make informed decisions about care.

To do this, the reforms the President is announcing will ensure that:

-   every nursing home provides a sufficient number of staff who are
    adequately trained to provide high-quality care;
-   poorly performing nursing homes are held accountable for improper
    and unsafe care and immediately improve their services or are cut
    off from taxpayer dollars; and
-   the public has better information about nursing home conditions so
    that they can find the best available options.

The pandemic has highlighted the tragic impact of substandard conditions
at nursing homes, which are home to many of our most at-risk community
members. More than [1.4 million
people](https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/featured-topics/nursing-homes/)
live in over 15,500 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes
across the nation. In the past two years, more than [200,000
residents](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/over-200000-residents-and-staff-in-long-term-care-facilities-have-died-from-covid-19/)
and staff in nursing homes have died from COVID-19—nearly a quarter of
all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.  

Despite the tens of billions of federal taxpayer dollars flowing to
nursing homes each year, too many continue to provide poor, sub-standard
care that leads to avoidable resident harm. In fact, failure to comply
with Federal guidelines at nursing homes is widespread. The Government
Accountability Office found that, from 2013 to 2017, [82% of all
inspected nursing homes](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-576r.pdf) had
an infection prevention and control deficiency, including a lack of
regular handwashing, that was identified through Medicare and Medicaid
surveys.  

Without decisive action now, these unacceptable conditions may get
worse. Private equity firms have been buying up struggling nursing
homes, and research shows that private equity-owned nursing homes tend
to have significantly worse outcomes for residents. Private equity
firms’ investment in nursing homes has
[ballooned](https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/WP_118-Appelbaum-and-Batt-2-rb-Clean.pdf)
from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion in 2018, with about
[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2772306)%
of all nursing homes now owned by private equity firms. Too often, the
private equity model has put profits before people—a particularly
dangerous model when it comes to the health and safety of vulnerable
seniors and people with disabilities. **Recent research has found that
resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned
nursing homes**:

-   A [recent
    study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2786442)
    found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity
    were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department
    visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable
    hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing
    homes not associated with private equity.
-   [One working
    paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28474/w28474.pdf)
    examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a seventeen-year
    period found that private equity ownership increased excess
    mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of
    antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of
    frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending
    per resident by 11%. That suggests an additional 20,150 lives lost
    as a result of private equity ownership.
-   Another
    [study](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AFREF-NJ-Private-Equity-Nursing-Homes-Covid.pdf)
    found that private equity-backed nursing homes’ COVID-19 infection
    rate and death rate were 30% and 40% above statewide averages,
    respectively.

Research also suggests that, **despite depriving residents of quality
care, private equity-owned nursing homes actually led to an** [**uptick
in Medicare
costs**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2786442)**,
too.** 

**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps by
Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) through its Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to improve the quality and safety of
nursing homes, to protect vulnerable residents and the health care
heroes who care for them, and to crack down on bad actors.** The
Administration is committed to these urgent actions as first steps
toward fulfilling a broader commitment to ensure taxpayer dollars go
toward the safe, adequate, and respectful care seniors and people with
disabilities deserve—not to the pockets of predatory owners and
operators who seek to maximize their profits at the expense of
vulnerable residents’ health and safety.

**Ensuring Taxpayer Dollars Support Nursing Homes That Provide Safe,
Adequate, and Dignified Care**

CMS is launching four new initiatives to ensure that residents get the
quality care they need—and that taxpayers pay for. These initiatives
will help ensure adequate staffing, dignity and safety in their
accommodations, and quality care.

-   *Establish a Minimum Nursing Home Staffing Requirement*. The
    adequacy of a nursing home’s staffing is the measure most closely
    linked to the quality of care residents receive. For example, a
    [recent
    study](https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jgs.16689)
    of one state’s nursing facilities found that increasing registered
    nurse staffing by just 20 minutes per resident day was associated
    with 22% fewer confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-19
    deaths. CMS intends to propose minimum standards for staffing
    adequacy that nursing homes must meet. CMS will conduct a new
    research study to determine the level and type of staffing needed to
    ensure safe and quality care and will issue proposed rules within
    one year. Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all
    nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care, and that
    workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care.
    Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this
    standard.
-   *Reduce Resident Room Crowding*. Most nursing home residents prefer
    to have private rooms to protect their privacy and dignity, but
    shared rooms with one or more other residents remain the default
    option. These multi-occupancy rooms increase residents’ risk of
    contracting infectious diseases, including COVID-19. CMS will
    explore ways to accelerate phasing out rooms with three or more
    residents and to promote single-occupancy rooms.
-   *Strengthen the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Value-Based
    Purchasing (“VBP”) Program.* The SNF-VBPprogram awards incentive
    funding to facilities based on quality performance. CMS has begun to
    measure and publish staff turnover and weekend staffing levels,
    metrics which closely align with the quality of care provided in a
    nursing home. CMS intends to propose new payment changes based on
    staffing adequacy, the resident experience, as well as how well
    facilities retain staff.
-   *Reinforce Safeguards against Unnecessary Medications and
    Treatments*. Thanks to CMS’ National Partnership to Improve Dementia
    Care in Nursing Homes, the nation has seen a dramatic decrease in
    the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes in recent years.
    However, inappropriate diagnoses and prescribing still occur at too
    many nursing homes. CMS will launch a new effort to identify
    problematic diagnoses and refocus efforts to continue to bring down
    the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications.

**Enhancing Accountability and Oversight**

Holding nursing homes accountable for their performance requires a
robust compliance program—a program that has adequate funding to perform
inspections and that imposes meaningful penalties when deficiencies are
found. Federal taxpayer dollars should not flow to nursing homes that
are unsafe.

-   *Adequately Fund Inspection Activities*. For over seven years,
    funding to conduct health and safety inspections has remained flat
    while the number of complaints about nursing homes has surged. To
    protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President
    Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a
    nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety inspections at
    nursing homes.
-   *Beef up Scrutiny on More of the Poorest Performers*. CMS’s Special
    Focus Facility (SFF) program identifies the poorest-performing
    nursing homes in the country for increased scrutiny in an effort to
    immediately improve the care they deliver. The SFF program currently
    requires more frequent compliance surveys for program participants,
    which must pass two consecutive inspections to “graduate” from the
    program. The SFF program will be overhauled to more quickly improve
    care for the affected residents, including changes that will make
    its requirements tougher and more impactful. CMS will also make
    changes that allow the program to scrutinize more facilities, by
    moving facilities through the program more quickly. Facilities that
    fail to improve will face increasingly larger enforcement actions,
    including termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid,
    when appropriate.
-   *Expand Financial Penalties and Other Enforcement Sanctions*. CMS
    will expand the instances in which it takes enforcement actions
    against poor-performing facilities based on desk reviews of data
    submissions, which will be performed in addition to on-site
    inspections. In July 2021, CMS rescinded a Trump Administration
    change that lowered penalty amounts on bad actor nursing homes for
    harmful deficiencies by imposing only a one-time fine, instead of
    more aggressive per-day fines that charge for each day a facility is
    out of compliance. CMS will now explore making such per-day
    penalties the default penalty for non-compliance. CMS will also use
    data, predictive analytics, and other information processing tools
    to improve enforcement. President Biden is also calling on Congress
    to raise the dollar limit on per-instance financial penalties levied
    on poor-performing facilities, from $21,000 to $1,000,000.
-   *Increase Accountability for Chain Owners of Substandard
    Facilities*. President Biden is calling on Congress to give CMS new
    authority to require minimum corporate competency to participate in
    Medicare and Medicaid programs, enabling CMS to prohibit an
    individual or entity from obtaining a Medicare or Medicaid provider
    agreement for a nursing home (new or existing) based on the Medicare
    compliance history of their other owned or operated facilities
    (previous or existing). He is further calling on Congress to expand
    CMS enforcement authority at the ownership level, enabling CMS to
    impose enforcement actions on the owners and operators of facilities
    even after they close a facility, as well as on owners or operators
    that provide persistent substandard and noncompliant care in some
    facilities, while still owning others.
-   *Provide Technical Assistance to Nursing Homes to Help them
    Improve*. CMS currently contracts with Quality Improvement
    Organizations that help providers across the health care spectrum
    make meaningful quality of care improvements. CMS will ensure that
    improving nursing home care is a core mission for these
    organizations and will explore pathways to expand on-demand
    trainings and information sharing around best practices, while
    expanding individualized, evidence-based assistance related to
    issues exacerbated by the pandemic.

  
**Increasing Transparency**

For too long, corporate owners and operators have not been held to
account for poor nursing home performance. CMS will improve the public
transparency of facility ownership and safeguard nursing home residents.

-   *Create a Database of Nursing Home Owners and Operators*. CMS will
    create a new database that will track and identify owners and
    operators across states to highlight previous problems with
    promoting resident health and safety. This registry will use
    information collected through provider enrollment and health and
    safety inspections to provide more information about prospective
    owners and operators to states. Giving the public a resource to
    better understand owners’ and operators’ previous violations will
    empower states to better protect the health and safety of residents.
-   *Improve Transparency of Facility Ownership and Finances*. CMS will
    implement Affordable Care Act requirements regarding transparency in
    corporate ownership of nursing homes, including by collecting and
    publicly reporting more robust corporate ownership and operating
    data. It will also make this information easier to find on the
    Nursing Home Care Compare website.
-   *Enhance Nursing Home Care Compare*: CMS will implement a range of
    initiatives to improve Nursing Home Care Compare, the rating website
    designed to help families pick a facility for their loved ones.
    Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership, CMS has already
    published new measures on Care Compare, which allow users to
    consider nursing home staff turnover, weekend staffing levels, and
    other important factors in their decision-making process.  When the
    new minimum staffing requirement comes online, Care Compare will
    also prominently display whether a facility is meeting these minimum
    staffing requirements. CMS will further improve Care Compare by
    improving the readability and usability of the information
    displayed—giving you and your family insight into how to interpret
    key metrics. Finally, CMS will ensure that ratings more closely
    reflect data that is verifiable, rather than self-reported, and will
    hold nursing homes accountable for providing inaccurate information.
    The President is calling on Congress to give CMS additional
    authority to validate data and take enforcement action against
    facilities that submit incorrect information.
-   *Examine the Role of Private Equity.* As described above, private
    equity investors are playing a growing role in the nursing home
    sector, and published research increasingly indicates that facility
    ownership by investment groups leads to worse outcomes while costing
    taxpayers more—particularly as these owners have sought to cut
    expenses at the cost of patient health and safety, including during
    the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS and other federal agencies will examine
    the role of private equity, real estate investment trusts (REITs),
    and other investment ownership in the nursing home sector and inform
    the public when corporate entities are not serving their residents’
    best interests.

**Creating Pathways to Good-paying Jobs with the Free and Fair Choice to
Join a Union**

-   *Ensure Nurse Aide Training is Affordable.* Lowering financial
    barriers to nurse aide training and certification will strengthen
    and diversify the nursing home workforce. CMSwill establish new
    requirements to ensure nurse aide trainees are notified about their
    potential entitlement to training reimbursement upon employment. CMS
    will further work with states to ensure reimbursement is being
    distributed and that free training opportunities are widely
    publicized.
-   *Support State Efforts to Improve Staffing and Workforce
    Sustainability.* Strengthening the nursing home workforce requires
    adequate compensation as well as a realistic career ladder. CMS will
    develop a template to assist and encourage States requesting to tie
    Medicaid payments to clinical staff wages and benefits, including
    additional pay for experience and specialization.

<!-- -->

-   *Launch National Nursing Career Pathways Campaign.* CMS, in
    collaboration with the Department of Labor, will work with external
    entities—including training intermediaries, registered
    apprenticeship programs, labor-management training programs, and
    labor unions—to conduct a robust nationwide campaign to recruit,
    train, retain, and transition workers into long-term care careers,
    with pathways into health-care careers like registered and licensed
    nurses.

**Ensuring Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness in Nursing Homes**

-   *Continued COVID-19 Testing in Long-term Care Facilities.*
    Throughout the pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has
    provided approximately 3 million tests per week to all Medicare- and
    Medicaid-certified nursing homes and thousands more assisted living
    facilities, supporting outbreak testing and regular testing of
    staff. HHS will continue to support this key mitigation strategy for
    vulnerable residents and the staff that care for them.
-   *Continued COVID-19 Vaccinations and Boosters in Long-term Care
    Facilities.* The Biden-Harris Administration has provided the full
    support of the federal government to states in ensuring that staff
    and residents across long-term care facilities have access to
    vaccinations and booster shots. Today, facilities are required to
    ensure staff are vaccinated and more than 87.1% of residents have
    received their primary series. CDC continues to offer all facilities
    the ability to be matched with a federal pharmacy partner to host an
    on-site vaccination clinic. CMS has reached out to thousands of
    these facilities directly to offer support, and the Agency for
    Healthcare Research and Quality has made a wide set of tools
    available. HHS will continue to promote access to these clinics and
    efforts to integrate vaccinations into routine services, incentivize
    vaccinations through provider quality payment programs, and continue
    to provide a full range of resources to continue to build confidence
    in the vaccine.
-   *Strengthen Requirements for On-site Infection Preventionists*. CMS
    will clarify and increase the standards for nursing homes on the
    level of staffing facilities need for on-site infection prevention
    employees, undoing the Trump Administration’s changes to these
    requirements to help improve resident health and safety.
-   *Enhance Requirements for Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness*. Both
    the pandemic and the increase in natural disasters have demonstrated
    how critical proactive emergency preparedness is to keeping
    residents of nursing homes safe. CMS is examining and considering
    changes to emergency preparedness requirements and is working to
    bolster the resiliency of the health care sector as part of an
    Administration-wide effort to be ready for the next pandemic and the
    next weather-related emergencies.
-   *Integrate Pandemic Lessons into Nursing Home Requirements.* The
    pandemic has underscored the need for resident-centered updates to
    nursing homes’ requirements of participation in Medicare and
    Medicaid. CMS will integrate new lessons on standards of care into
    nursing home requirements around fire safety, infection control, and
    other areas, using an equity lens*.*
