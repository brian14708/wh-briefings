title: Statement by President Biden on Nord Stream 2
---
 
Since Russia began deploying troops to the Ukrainian border, the United
States has worked closely with our Allies and partners to deliver a
strong, unified response. As I said when I met with Chancellor Scholz
earlier this month, Germany has been a leader in that effort, and we
have closely coordinated our efforts to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline
if Russia further invaded Ukraine.

Yesterday, after further close consultations between our two
governments, Germany announced that it would halt certification of the
pipeline. Today, I have directed my administration to impose sanctions
on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers. These steps are another
piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russiaâ€™s
actions in Ukraine. As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take
further steps if Russia continues to escalate.

Through his actions, President Putin has provided the world with an
overwhelming incentive to move away from Russian gas and to other forms
of energy. I want to thank Chancellor Scholz for his close partnership
and continued dedication to holding Russia accountable for its actions.
