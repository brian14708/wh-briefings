President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine to reaffirm the commitment of the United States to
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. President Biden
strongly condemned Russian President Putin’s decision to purportedly
recognize the “independence” of the so-called DNR and LNR regions of
Ukraine. He updated President Zelenskyy on the United States’ response,
including our plan to issue sanctions. President Biden reiterated that
the United States would respond swiftly and decisively, in lock-step
with its Allies and partners, to further Russian aggression against
Ukraine.
