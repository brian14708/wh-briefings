  \ with G7\_Leaders"

The President and G7 Leaders reaffirmed their resolve to respond swiftly
to President Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine and
expressed their solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The Leaders built
on their months-long coordination and agreed to move forward on
devastating packages of sanctions and other economic measures to hold
Russia to account. The G7 makes up the world’s leading democracies and
50% of the world’s economy—and the costs the G7 will impose together on
Russia will be unprecedented. As a result of Putin’s choices, Russia
will now face immediate and intense pressure on its economy and massive
costs from its isolation from the global financial system, global trade,
and cutting-edge technology. The Leaders also agreed to intensify
ongoing efforts to mitigate any spillover effects from Russia’s actions
and to secure stability in global energy markets. President Biden
conveyed his thanks to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for bringing all
the Leaders together in this critical moment.
