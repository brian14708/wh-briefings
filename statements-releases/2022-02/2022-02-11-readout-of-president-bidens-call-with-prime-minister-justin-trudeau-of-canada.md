title: "Readout of President Biden\u2019s Call With Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\
  \ of Canada"

Today President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada
to discuss the ongoing blockade of key bridges and crossings between the
United States and Canada, including Detroit/Windsor, Sweetwater/Coutts,
and Pembina/Emerson.  The two leaders agreed that the actions of the
individuals who are obstructing travel and commerce between our two
countries are having significant direct impacts on citizens’ lives and
livelihoods.  The President expressed his concern that U.S. companies
and workers are experiencing serious effects, including slowdowns in
production, shortened work hours, and plant closures. The Prime Minister
promised quick action in enforcing the law, and the President thanked
him for the steps he and other Canadian authorities are taking to
restore the open passage of bridges to the United States.  In turn, the
Prime Minister thanked the President and his administration, the
Governor of Michigan, and US officials for all of the assistance that
the United States is providing to resolve this disruption.  The two
leaders agreed to stay in close touch in the days ahead to ensure that
the free flow of traffic is restored at these vital transit points.
