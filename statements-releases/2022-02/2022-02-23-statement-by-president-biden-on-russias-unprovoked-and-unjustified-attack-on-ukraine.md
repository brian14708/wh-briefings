title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Russia\u2019s Unprovoked and Unjustified\
  \ Attack on\_Ukraine"
---
 
The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight
as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military
forces. President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a
catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is
responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and
the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united
and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.

I will be monitoring the situation from the White House this evening and
will continue to get regular updates from my national security team.
Tomorrow, I will meet with my G7 counterparts in the morning and then
speak to the American people to announce the further consequences the
United States and our Allies and partners will impose on Russia for this
needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and
security. We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a
strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance.
Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of
Ukraine.
