title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration\u2019s Commitment to Global\_Health"
---
 
The United States Government is proud to be the largest donor for global
health. As we work to end the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to
strengthening health systems and institutions; advancing global health
security; combatting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; advancing
sexual and reproductive health and rights, and maternal, neonatal, and
child health; closing gaps in nutrition and non-communicable diseases;
and accelerating efforts towards universal health coverage and the
Sustainable Development Agenda. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, the United
States appropriated over $9 billion in global health programs, in
addition to almost $16 billion in emergency supplemental funding for
COVID-19.    
  
We continue to lead the global community toward a safer, more equitable
future. Over the last year, the Biden-Harris Administration has renewed
the U.S. leadership in global health, and taken decisive steps to
advance global health priorities, including:

-   **Supporting and strengthening the WHO.** Among his first acts in
    office one year ago, President Biden declared the United States
    would reengage with the World Health Organization (WHO),
    highlighting our nation’s commitment to advancing multilateral
    cooperation in a time of international health crisis. Last week, the
    United States once again demonstrated that commitment, by leading a
    successful decision at the WHO Executive Board meeting to strengthen
    the International Health Regulations (2005). This strengthening will
    enhance the world’s ability to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond
    to infectious disease outbreaks in the future. Beyond COVID-19, the
    United States is collaborating with global partners through WHO on a
    wide range of global health challenges such as childhood
    immunization, nutrition, polio eradication, strengthening the global
    health workforce to achieve universal health coverage, and tackling
    the threat that climate change poses to health. These and other
    issues remain critical priorities, especially in the wake of
    COVID-19, and demonstrate the importance of strong, equitable health
    systems that serve those most at risk.  
-   **Leading the global COVID-19 response.** Under President Biden’s
    leadership, the United States has committed to donate 1.2 billion
    doses of safe and effective vaccine to the world, more than any
    other nation. To date, we have shipped over 400 million of those
    vaccines to 112 countries around the world, all for free, with no
    strings attached or promises extracted. We were the first nation to
    purchase doses solely for the purpose of donation, with the historic
    purchase of 1 billion doses of Pfizer vaccine. We were the first
    nation to step out of the queue for Moderna vaccines, allowing the
    African Union quicker access to tens of millions of doses. We were
    the first to broker access to doses for individuals in humanitarian
    crises. And now, we are leading the push to turn vaccines into
    vaccinations, with the creation of the Global Vaccine Initiative. To
    date, the United States is providing nearly $16 billion for
    life-saving health, economic, and humanitarian COVID-19 assistance
    to our partners to fight this virus and its impacts. These funds are
    delivering shots in arms, lifesaving supplies to hospitals, and
    support that reaches the most vulnerable communities.  
-   **Advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights.** One of
    President Biden’s first actions was issuing a Presidential
    Memorandum on Protecting Women’s Health at Home and Abroad, which
    revoked the expanded Mexico City Policy and directed agencies to
    resume funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in
    support of its essential work to prevent maternal deaths, expand
    access to voluntary family planning, and prevent and respond to
    gender-based violence around the world. The Administration continues
    to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all
    in the face of continued threats. The White House Gender Policy
    Council released the first-ever [National Strategy on Gender Equity
    and
    Equality](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf),
    which emphasizes the core role of advancing SRHR to achieve gender
    equality. As the largest bilateral donor to family planning, the
    United States also leads globally by advancing SRHR in multilateral
    fora and with bilateral partners. As we address the indirect impacts
    of the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems and vulnerable
    populations, the United States has supported increased access to
    SRHR services, particularly in emergency contexts.  
-   **Continued global leadership on addressing HIV/AIDS, malaria, and
    tuberculosis.** Last week, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for
    AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) celebrated its nineteen-year anniversary. Since
    its inception and with bilateral support, the U.S. Government has
    invested $100 billion to transform the global AIDS response. PEPFAR
    has saved more than 21 million lives, prevented millions of HIV
    infections, and helped countries build a strong foundation to
    prevent, detect, and respond to other health threats, including
    COVID-19. Across 55 countries, PEPFAR invests over $1 billion
    annually in local health systems strengthening to respond to HIV. At
    the end of FY21, PEPFAR supported 63.4 million people with HIV
    testing services, and 18.96 million people with antiretroviral
    treatment. With $250 million in funding through the American Rescue
    Plan Act, PEPFAR has continued to advance HIV gains and supported
    the global COVID-19 response. The U.S. President’s Malaria
    Initiative invested $770 million in 2020 to forge forward in the
    fight against malaria, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching
    almost 60 million people with malaria medicine and protecting more
    than 7.5 million pregnant women with preventive treatment for
    malaria. Through the most recent five-year U.S. Government Global TB
    Strategy, U.S. government investments led to the treatment of 15.7
    million people with TB, starting 438,000 individuals with drug
    resistant TB on second-line drug therapy, and accomplished a
    treatment success rate of almost 90 percent.  
-   **Building health security capacities.** The United States continues
    to work with partners across the globe, including 19 intensive
    support partner countries, to provide assistance to better prevent,
    detect, and respond to infectious disease threats and to meet the
    target of the multilateral Global Health Security Agenda. The need
    for these capacities has never been more clear, and robust
    interagency efforts helped address numerous outbreaks including
    Ebola, Anthrax, Influenza, Rabies, Polio, Cholera, and more. The
    U.S. Government’s global health security programs also pivoted to
    support critical COVID-19 response activities.  
-   **Sustaining commitments in maternal and child health.** The United
    States’ sustained commitment, financial investment, and adaptability
    has ensured that critical health services continue reaching women,
    children, and families. In 2020, the United States helped more than
    92 million women and children access essential—and often
    lifesaving—care. The U.S. Government’s investments towards polio
    eradication have also helped ensure over 400 million children are
    vaccinated against polio each year; last year was a significant
    milestone as Africa was declared wild polio free.

In the coming year, the Administration will take the following steps to
continue to advance global health priorities:

-   **Continue supporting and strengthening the World Health
    Organization**. The United States looks forward to rejoining the WHO
    Executive Board in May 2022, and will launch a Strategic Dialogue
    with WHO to ensure our mutual priorities are fully aligned. The
    United States will continue to work closely with WHO and partners
    around the world, to ensure that the prevention of sexual
    exploitation and abuse, and support for victims and survivors,
    remain priority issues.  
-   **Accelerate global COVID-19 response efforts.** The U.S. Government
    will continue to roll out the Initiative for Global Vaccine Access
    (Global VAX) to accelerate global efforts to get COVID-19 shots into
    arms and enhance international coordination. This whole of
    government effort will bolster cold chain supply and logistics,
    service delivery, vaccine confidence and demand, human resources,
    data and analytics, local planning, and vaccine safety and
    effectiveness. The United States has committed more than $1.6
    billion in funding to help get shots into arms around the world.  
-   **Advance health security and pandemic preparedness.** The United
    States will continue to advance health security and pandemic
    preparedness abroad, including through strengthening WHO, working
    with partners towards targeted IHR amendments and a new pandemic
    instrument, building country capacities towards the Global Health
    Security Agenda target, strengthening sustained financing including
    establishing a new financial intermediary fund at the World Bank,
    building back better biosafety and biosecurity norms and mitigating
    biotechnological risks, innovating our science and technological
    capabilities to shorten the cycle for development of safe, effect,
    and affordable vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, and more.

-   **Continue investments to strengthen health systems.** The United
    States will continue to advance the newly launched [Vision for
    Health System
    Strengthening](https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-systems-innovation/health-systems/Vision-HSS-2030)
    and will work to align global partners toward shared commitments for
    the health workforce. The United States has committed to supporting
    and protecting health workers, and affirmed support for WHO’s Gender
    Equal Health and Care Workforce Initiative, which aim to address
    gender inequities and inequalities health workers face globally. The
    United States will continue to invest resources and provide
    assistance to strengthen countries’ disease surveillance and
    laboratory detection capacities, continue to lead efforts to
    eradicate polio, and also strengthen immunization systems and
    vaccine delivery to ensure a world where people live healthier,
    safer lives.  
-   **Continue championing and expanding sexual and reproductive health
    and rights.** In addition to maintaining strong financial support,
    the United States will continue to collaborate with allies and
    partners through multilateral, bilateral and civil society
    partnerships to expand progress and leadership to advance sexual and
    reproductive health and rights. Federal agencies are developing SRHR
    implementation plans and the National Security Council will continue
    to elevate and expand SRHR as a core component of our global health
    policy.  
-   **Continue the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.**
    This year, President Biden will host the Global Fund’s Seventh
    Replenishment Conference, advancing global efforts to address
    HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, alongside the U.S. government’s
    programs.  PEPFAR is saving lives and curbing new HIV infections
    while supporting the health systems infrastructure in countries that
    continue to serve as a backbone of the COVID-19 response. PEPFAR’s
    assets can be further leveraged to support the COVID-19 response,
    while protecting and expanding HIV services and serving the most
    vulnerable populations around the world. PMI is reshaping its fight
    against malaria, focusing on reaching the unreached, further
    building community health systems, and increasing the impact of
    community health workers as part of its new “[End Malaria
    Faster](https://www.pmi.gov/home/pmis-strategy/)” Strategy. Current
    investments are building countries’ capacities to respond to both
    tuberculosis and COVID-19 with support for bi-directional testing
    approaches for both diseases, joint contact investigations and
    community screenings, stigma reduction and community empowerment,
    and expanding infection prevention and control measures—providing
    vital platforms to address both diseases and respond to future
    airborne pandemics.  
-   **Continue demonstrating strong global leadership on nutrition.** At
    the 2021 Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit, the United States
    announced a financial commitment of up to $11 billion over three
    years to combat global malnutrition. The United States also launched
    the [Global Nutrition Coordination
    Plan](https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-areas/nutrition/usgplan),
    which will guide the collaborative work of seven U.S. government
    agencies engaged in scaling up proven approaches to better
    nutrition.
