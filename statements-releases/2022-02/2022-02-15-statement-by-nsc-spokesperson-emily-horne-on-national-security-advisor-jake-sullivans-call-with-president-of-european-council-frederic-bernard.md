National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with Frédéric Bernard,
Head of Cabinet of the President of the European Council, on February
14. They discussed their shared concerns about Russia’s continued
build-up of military forces around Ukraine. They reviewed recent
diplomatic engagements to address the crisis, ongoing preparations by
the U.S. and EU to impose severe economic consequences if Russia chooses
further military escalation, and efforts to provide continued support to
Ukraine, including through economic assistance.
