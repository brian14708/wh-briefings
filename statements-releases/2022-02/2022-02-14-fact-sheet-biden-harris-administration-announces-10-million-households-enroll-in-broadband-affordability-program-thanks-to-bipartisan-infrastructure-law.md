*Announcement made during White House event with Vice President Kamala
Harris, Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica
Rosenworcel, Senior Advisor Mitch Landrieu*

  
 Today, during a White House event with Vice President Harris, Federal
Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, and Senior
Advisor Mitch Landrieu, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing
more than 10 million households are enrolled in the Affordable
Connectivity Program, the nation’s largest ever broadband affordability
program. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to removing
barriers to high-speed, affordable internet access. Thanks to the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, millions of families who previously could
not get online or struggled to pay for this modern-day necessity are now
connected.   
  
The President and Vice President have made it a top priority to ensure
all Americans have access to reliable, affordable, high-speed internet
to learn, work, and participate in the 21st century economy. Broadband
connectivity is vital for work, school, health care and more. But
affordable broadband remains out of reach for too many, with one
estimate showing almost one out of three internet users worried about
paying their internet bills during the pandemic. President Biden, Vice
President Harris, and the entire Administration are committed to
changing this through implementation of the broadband provisions of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that address the affordability of internet
service, a modern-day necessity.  
  
WHAT IS THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM?  
  
The Affordable Connectivity Program is the nation’s largest broadband
affordability program.  Created through the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, it is a $14.2 billion successor program to the Emergency Broadband
Benefit.  Low-income households are encouraged to apply to receive a
discount of up to $30 per month toward internet service and up to $75
per month for eligible households on Tribal lands.  Eligible households
can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop,
desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers if the
household contributes more than $10 and less than $50 toward the
purchase price.  
  
WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM?  
  
A household is eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program if the
household income is at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines,
or if a member of the household meets at least *one* of the criteria
below:

-   Participates in certain assistance programs, such as SNAP, Medicaid,
    Federal Public Housing Assistance, SSI, WIC, or Lifeline;
-   Participates in Tribal specific programs, such as Bureau of Indian
    Affairs General Assistance, Tribal TANF, or Food Distribution
    Program on Indian Reservations;
-   Eligible to participate in the National School Lunch Program or the
    School Breakfast Program, including through the USDA Community
    Eligibility Provision;
-   Received a Federal Pell Grant during the current award year; or
-   Meets the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband
    provider’s existing low-income internet program.
