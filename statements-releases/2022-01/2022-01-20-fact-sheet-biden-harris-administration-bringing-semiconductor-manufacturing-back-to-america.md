*Intel Announces $20 Billion Ohio Facility; Latest Company to Invest in
U.S., Strengthen Domestic Supply Chains*

  
Semiconductors are an essential building block in the goods and products
that Americans use every day. These computer chips are critical to a
range of sectors and products from cars to smartphones to medical
equipment and even vacuum cleaners. They help power our infrastructure
from our grid to our broadband. The United States used to lead the world
in global semiconductor manufacturing. But in recent decades, the U.S.
lost its edge—our share of global semiconductor production has fallen
from 37 percent to just 12 percent over the last 30 years. 

The COVID-19 pandemic shined a spotlight on the fragility in the global
semiconductor supply chain. Experts estimate that the global chip
shortage knocked off a full percentage point from U.S. gross domestic
product (GDP) last year. U.S. autoworkers faced furloughs and production
shut downs due to pandemic-driven disruptions in Asian semiconductor
factories, contributing to large increases in the price of cars for U.S.
consumers. One-third of the annual price increases in core consumer
price index (CPI) last year was due to high car prices alone.

The Biden-Harris Administration has been working around the clock with
Congress, our international allies and partners, and the private sector
to expand U.S. chip manufacturing capacity, bring back critical American
manufacturing jobs, address the chip shortage, and ensure we are not
exposed to these disruptions again. Today, Intel will announce a new $20
billion factory outside Columbus, Ohio.

Today’s announcement is the latest marker of progress in the
Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to ramp up domestic manufacturing
for critical goods like semiconductors, tackle near-term supply chain
bottlenecks, revitalize our manufacturing base, and create good jobs
here at home. This investment will create 7,000 construction jobs and
another 3,000 permanent jobs, another sign of the strength of the
American economy.

To accelerate this progress, the President is urging Congress to pass
legislation to strengthen U.S. research and development and
manufacturing for critical supply chains, including semiconductors. The
Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) in June
and the Administration is working with the House and Senate to finalize
this legislation. It includes full funding for the CHIPS for America
Act, which will provide $52 billion to catalyze more private-sector
investments and continued American technological leadership.

**Since the beginning of 2021, the semiconductor industry has announced
nearly $80 billion in new investments in the United States through
2025**, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. These
investments will create tens of thousands of good-paying U.S. jobs,
support U.S. technological leadership, and promote security and
resilience in global semiconductor supply chains. In addition to Intel’s
announcement today, investments include:

-   A $17 billion Samsung factory in Texas – the result of sustained
    work by the Administration, including the President’s meeting with
    President Moon of the Republic of Korea in May.
-   Texas Instruments investing up to $30 billion in Texas;
-    A new Global Foundries factory in New York state;
-   Cree’s intention to spend $1 billion to expand a current plant in
    North Carolina;
-   SK Group investments in a new U.S. R&D center; and
-   Micron to expanding U.S. production.

**The Biden-Harris Administration has led a whole of government effort
to secure these critical investments**.

-   President Biden prioritized domestic semiconductor manufacturing and
    research and development (R&D) shortly after taking office,
    designating semiconductor supply chains as a centerpiece of his
    national [supply chain
    initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/24/fact-sheet-securing-americas-critical-supply-chains/)
    launched in February 2021.  
-   In June, the Commerce Department issued a [set of
    recommendations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf)
    on how to secure the U.S. semiconductor supply chain. Since that
    time, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, National Security Advisor
    Jake Sullivan, and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese
    have held regular follow-up engagements with industry leaders and
    diplomatic partners and allies to advance practical solutions to
    strengthen the global semiconductor supply chain. This includes
    White House has met with the CEOs of multiple semiconductor
    companies in this effort.   
-   In October, President Biden hosted a global summit on supply chains
    with the heads of state from 14 countries and the European Union on
    the margins of the G20 in Italy to discuss supply chain disruptions,
    with a focus on semiconductors. The President also focused on
    semiconductor supply chain resilience in his bilateral meetings with
    foreign leaders and directed the Administration to cooperate with
    Europe on strengthening global supply chains through the U.S.-E.U.
    Trade and Technology Council (TTC) and through the Quad’s focus on
    critical technologies.

**Investments in new foundries are critical to the long-term resilience
of our semiconductor supply chains. At the same time, the Administration
is working to address the near-term disruptions in semiconductor supply
chains that have contributed to challenges in a number of manufacturing
sectors and to price increases for U.S. consumers.**

-   In April 2021, the President hosted a [virtual
    summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/12/readout-of-white-house-ceo-summit-on-semiconductor-and-supply-chain-resilience/)
    with leading firms that produce chips and those that use chips to
    identify practical ways to discuss actions they could to address the
    disruptions resulting from the global chip shortage. By the end of
    the year, the participants [had announced new
    partnerships](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-enters-semiconductor-business-amid-chip-shortage-impact-11637242202)
    between semiconductor companies and U.S. automakers to strengthen
    the resiliency of the automotive chip supply chain.  
-   In the summer, the Administration worked with governments and
    companies around the world to mitigate COVID-related disruptions to
    semiconductor manufacturing and in September 2021 established a
    [global early alert
    system](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/09/23/when-the-chips-are-down-preventing-and-addressing-supply-chain-disruptions/)
    to identify and address pandemic-related disruptions.  
-   The Commerce Department promoted transparency in semiconductor
    supply chains, including through a Fall 2021 survey on the chips
    shortage to identify the key chokepoints in the semiconductor supply
    chains. Over 150 responses were received from all parts of the
    supply chain – producers, consumers, and intermediaries – include
    responses from nearly all the major semiconductor producers and the
    major automakers. The results of the survey will be released
    publicly by the end of January 2021.  
-   The U.S. Department of Defense has used Defense Production Act
    authorities to strengthen supply chains for key defense-related
    semiconductors.
