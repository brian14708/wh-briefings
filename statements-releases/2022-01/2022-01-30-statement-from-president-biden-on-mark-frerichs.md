title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Mark\_Frerichs"
---
 
Two years ago tomorrow, U.S. Navy veteran Mark Frerichs was taken
hostage in Afghanistan. A civil engineer, he spent a decade helping the
people of Afghanistan. He has done nothing wrong. And yet, for two years
the Taliban has held him captive.  
  
Mark is a native of Illinois. A son. A brother. And his family has now
endured two gut-wrenching years—praying for his safety, wondering where
and how he is, aching for his return.   
  
Threatening the safety of Americans or any innocent civilians is always
unacceptable, and hostage-taking is an act of particular cruelty and
cowardice. The Taliban must immediately release Mark before it can
expect any consideration of its aspirations for legitimacy. This is not
negotiable.   
  
To Mark, and to all the Americans being held hostage and wrongfully
detained overseas, and to all their families and friends who are
enduring the nightmare of their absence: know that my administration
will continue to work steadfastly until every American being unjustly
held against their will comes home.
