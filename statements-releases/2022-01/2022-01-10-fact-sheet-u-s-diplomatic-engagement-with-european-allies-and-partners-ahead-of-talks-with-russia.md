title: "FACT SHEET: U.S. Diplomatic Engagement with European Allies and Partners Ahead\
  \ of Talks with\_Russia"

*“We are absolutely committed to the principle nothing about Ukraine
without Ukraine, just as we are fully committed to the principle nothing
about Europe without Europe.”  
Secretary of State Tony Blinken, January 7, 2022*

  
 The United States, along with its Allies and partners, has underscored
its readiness to impose significant costs on Russia if it takes further
military action against Ukraine. At the same time, we have stressed our
preference for de-escalation through diplomacy. The United States laid
out clear principles ahead of talks with Russia. First, we will not
commit to anything about Europe without Europe. Second, any discussions
must be reciprocal. Third, genuine progress can only take place in a
climate of de-escalation.  
  
The United States has approached this week’s diplomatic engagements with
Russia – in the bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue, the NATO-Russia
Council, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) – closely aligned with our European Allies and partners,
including Ukraine, after extensive consultations. In recent weeks,
President Biden has spoken to leaders across Europe. Officials across
the U.S. government – including at the National Security Council, State
Department, Defense Department, Treasury Department, Energy Department,
and U.S. Agency for International Development – have engaged frequently
with their European counterparts.

Highlights of the Biden Administration’s close coordination with Allies
and partners in recent weeks include:

-   *President Biden has spoken with 16 European leaders to discuss
    European security issues and to develop a coordinated and
    comprehensive transatlantic approach.*

<!-- -->

-   *Secretary Blinken has held more than two dozen calls and meetings
    with foreign leaders and foreign ministers to discuss our
    coordinated response to Russia’s military buildup along Ukraine’s
    border. In addition, he has participated in ministerial meetings at
    the G7, NATO, and the OSCE as well as engaged with the EU and
    Ukrainian leadership.*

<!-- -->

-   *Secretary Austin has spoken with eight of his European counterparts
    about security issues in Europe and Russia’s destabilizing actions
    in the region. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Milley has
    similarly engaged military leaders across Europe.*

<!-- -->

-   *National Security Advisor Sullivan has coordinated extensively with
    his European counterparts, having made dozens of calls to bilateral
    counterparts across Europe from the EU and Turkey to Finland and
    Romania.  He has also convened calls in multilateral formats,
    including with the Nordic countries, eastern flank Allies, and
    France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the UK. He has also been in
    regular contact with his Ukrainian counterpart.*

<!-- -->

-   *The Biden Administration is in constant contact with Ukrainian
    officials. In the last few weeks, President Biden has spoken twice
    to President Zelenskyy. Secretary Blinken has spoken twice with
    President Zelenskyy and twice with Foreign Minister Kuleba. National
    Security Advisor Sullivan has spoken seven times with Head of
    Presidential Administration Yermak. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
    Staff Milley has spoken four times with Commander-in-Chief of the
    Ukrainian Armed Forces Lt. Gen. Zaluzhny. In addition, senior
    officials at the State Department and Defense Department engage
    regularly with their Ukrainian counterparts.*

<!-- -->

-   *The Biden Administration has sought close consultations with NATO’s
    eastern flank Allies given their security concerns, including calls
    both bilaterally and in the Bucharest Nine (B9) format by President
    Biden, Secretary Blinken, National Security Advisor Sullivan, and
    other Administration officials.*

<!-- -->

-   *The Biden Administration continues to work closely with the
    European Union. President Biden hosted EU Commission President von
    der Leyen. Secretary Blinken spoke with European Council President
    Michel and High Representative Borrell. Senior officials in the
    State Department and National Security Council have held numerous
    calls and meetings with their EU counterparts, including in
    Brussels. The Administration welcomed the *[*December 2021 European
    Council
    Conclusions*](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/12/17/european-council-conclusions-16-december-2021/)* that
    expressed the EU’s readiness to impose severe economic consequences
    if Russia further invades Ukraine. Officials from the Treasury
    Department, State Department, and National Security Council continue
    to engage with EU counterparts to coordinate our sanctions
    response.*

<!-- -->

-   *In addition to extensive consultations at NATO, the Biden
    Administration has engaged with NATO partners – including Georgia,
    also a victim of Russian aggression, as well as Sweden and Finland –
    to discuss their views on European security.*  
     
-   *Senior Administration officials remain in regular contact with
    their counterparts. In addition to the interactions listed below,
    scores of calls have also been made by Principal Deputy National
    Security Advisor Jon Finer, Under Secretary of State Victoria
    Nuland, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian
    Affairs Karen Donfried, and other officials across the U.S.
    government. Our recently confirmed ambassadors to NATO and the OSCE,
    Julianne Smith and Michael Carpenter, have also worked closely with
    their counterparts.*

**OVERVIEW OF DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENTS**  
Below is an illustrative list of consultations undertaken by the Biden
Administration in advance of talks with Russia. This list is not
exhaustive or comprehensive, as there have been extensive calls and
