title: "Statement by President\_Biden on General Motors Investment in\_Michigan"
---
 
Today’s announcement by GM – to make its largest investment ever, $7
billion to create 4,000 new jobs at EV manufacturing sites in Michigan –
is the latest sign that my economic strategy is helping power an
historic American manufacturing comeback. From day one, my
Administration has been laser focused on making sure that America leads
the manufacturing future of electric vehicles. This announcement is just
the latest in over $100 billion of investment this past year in American
auto manufacturing to build electric vehicles and batteries. Over the
last year, I hosted the United Auto Workers and automakers at the White
House, signed an executive order aimed at getting to 50% electric
vehicle sales share in 2030, and set ambitious new standards. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was a major step toward this future by
investing in EV charging, and Congress can catalyze more with additional
incentives for Made in America electric vehicles, batteries, and
semi-conductors built by union hands.
