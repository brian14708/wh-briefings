Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Washington and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Clallam, Skagit, and Whatcom and the
Lummi Nation, Nooksack Indian Tribe, and Quileute Tribe.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Toney Raines as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
