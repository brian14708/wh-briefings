title: "Readout of the President\u2019s Meeting with the Infrastructure Implementation\
  \ Task Force"
---
 
Today, on the anniversary of their first year in office, President Biden
and Vice President Harris convened the Infrastructure Implementation
Task Force to discuss the first two months of progress delivering
results from one of their landmark achievements, the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law.   
  
President Biden commended his team for hitting the ground running to
deliver the largest long-term investment in America’s infrastructure and
competitiveness in nearly a century. He discussed his priorities for
building a better America, including creating good-paying, union jobs,
supporting domestic manufacturing, strengthening supply chains, ensuring
investments advance equity and racial justice, and bolstering the
nation’s resilience to climate change. Members of the Cabinet and task
force provided the President updates on the swift action they are taking
to get investments out the door that will repair road and bridges,
replace lead pipes and provide clean water, help provide high-speed
internet to every family in America, and produce concrete results that
change people’s lives for the better.   
  
The President also directed Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator
Mitch Landrieu to work across federal, state, local, and Tribal
governments to ensure strong accountability so that government is a good
steward of taxpayer dollars.
