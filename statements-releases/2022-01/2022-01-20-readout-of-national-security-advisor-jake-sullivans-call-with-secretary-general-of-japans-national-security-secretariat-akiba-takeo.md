National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with Akiba Takeo,
Secretary General of Japan’s National Security Secretariat, to prepare
for the President’s meeting on January 21 with Prime Minister Kishida
and to discuss the ongoing situation in Russia and Ukraine. The two
discussed key issues in the U.S.-Japan Alliance, and our respective
approaches to North Korea, China, and economic issues in the
Indo-Pacific. Sullivan underscored concern about the possibility of
further Russian aggression in Ukraine, and the two concurred on the
importance of solidarity in signaling to Moscow the strong, united
response that would result from any attack.
