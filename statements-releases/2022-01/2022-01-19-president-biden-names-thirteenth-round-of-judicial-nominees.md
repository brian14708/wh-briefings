title: "President\_Biden Names Thirteenth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing eight new federal judicial nominees, all of
whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule
of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.

For example, this slate includes: 

-   A nominee who would be the first Bangladeshi-American, the first
    Muslim-American woman, and only the second Muslim-American person to
    serve as a federal judge.
-   A nominee who would be the first African-American woman—and the
    first woman of color—ever to serve on the Third Circuit.
-   A nominee who would be the first Latina ever to serve on the Eastern
    District of California and the second Hispanic judge actively
    serving on that court.
-   A nominee who immigrated from Taiwan as a child and would be the
    second Asian-American person to serve on the United States District
    Court for the District of Colorado—the first being President Biden’s
    nominee, Judge Regina Rodriguez, who was confirmed in June 2021.

This is President Biden’s thirteenth round of nominees for federal
judicial positions and his first slate of nominations in 2022, bringing
the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 83.  
  
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
