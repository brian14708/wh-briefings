title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Senate Vote on Voting\_\
  Rights"
---
 
Every member of the United States Senate—Democrats, Republicans, and
Independents—takes an oath to preserve and protect our Constitution. It
is their duty to safeguard our democracy and secure the freedom to vote.
Yet tonight, Senators voted to preserve an arcane Senate rule rather
than secure that fundamental freedom. The American people will not
forget this moment. Neither will history.  

Across our nation, anti-voter laws could make it more difficult for as
many as 55 million Americans to vote, and will be felt by every
American.

Our Administration will continue to fight to pass federal
legislation—and to change Senate rules—to secure the right to vote. We
will not stop fighting against the anti-voter legislation that
Republican legislatures continue to push at the state level—and to
champion and support state and local elected officials who work to enact
pro-voter legislation. We will work to ensure Americans everywhere can
register to vote, cast their vote, and have their vote counted in a free
and fair election.  

Generations of Americans have fought to strengthen and expand the
freedom to vote. While victory was never assured and almost always
preceded by setback, ultimately, We the People have prevailed. We will
again.
