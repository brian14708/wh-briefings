title: "Fact Sheet: The Biden Administration to Begin Distributing At-Home, Rapid\
  \ COVID- \u2060 19 Tests to Americans for Free"
---
 
* The Biden Administration is Buying One Billion Tests to Give to
Americans for Free; Online Ordering of a Half-Billion Tests Begins on
January 19th; Builds on Significant Actions to Expand Testing Capacity
and Increase Access to Free Testing*

Testing is an important tool to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
Public health experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
recommend that Americans use at-home tests if they begin to have
symptoms, at least five days after coming in close contact with someone
who has COVID-19, or are gathering indoors with a group of people who
are at risk of severe disease or unvaccinated.  
  
To help ensure Americans have tests on hand if a need arises, the Biden
Administration is purchasing one billion at-home, rapid COVID-19 tests
to give to Americans for free. A half-billion tests will be available
for order on January 19<sup>th</sup> and will be mailed directly to
American households.  
  
There will be free tests available for every household, and to promote
broad access, the initial program will allow four free tests to be
requested per residential address. Starting January 19<sup>th</sup>,
Americans will be able to order their tests online at COVIDTests.gov,
and tests will typically ship within 7-12 days of ordering.  
  
To ensure equity and access for all Americans, the Administration will
also launch a call line to help those unable to access the website to
place orders, and work with national and local community-based
organizations to support the nation’s hardest-hit and highest-risk
communities in requesting tests.  
  
In addition to this new program, there are many other options for
Americans to get tested. There are now over 20,000 free testing sites
across the nation, including four times as many pharmacies participating
in the federal pharmacy free testing program as there were in January
2021, as well as federal surge free testing sites, with more free
testing sites opening each week. Millions of free, at-home COVID-19
tests have been delivered to thousands of community health centers and
rural health clinics to distribute to their patients, with more
delivered each week. In addition, the Administration provided schools
$10 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding to get tests to K-12
school districts. And, the Administration invested nearly $6 billion in
ARP funding to cover free testing for uninsured individuals, and support
testing in correctional facilities, shelters for people experiencing
homelessness, and mental health facilities.  
  
Just this week, the Administration also announced that starting January
15<sup>th</sup>, private health insurance companies will be required to
cover at-home COVID-19 tests for free—and made an additional 10 million
COVID-19 tests available to schools nationwide, each month.  
  
Since January 2021, the Administration has taken significant action to
dramatically increase the nation’s overall COVID-19 testing supply, the
number of tests authorized for use in the U.S., and the number of places
where Americans can get a test, while lowering costs for consumers and
increasing access to free tests.  
  
This comprehensive approach has produced important results: Today, there
are nine at-home, rapid tests on the market in the U.S.—up from zero
when the President took office. In December, there were more than 300
million at-home, rapid tests available in the U.S. market, up from 24
million in August—a more than 10-fold rise. This month, the number of
at-home, rapid tests available to the U.S. market will rise to 375
million—in addition to the free tests available through
COVIDTests.gov.  
  
**Distributing At-Home, Rapid COVID-19 Tests to American Homes for
Free:** This program will ensure that Americans have at-home, rapid
COVID-19 tests available in the weeks and months ahead—in addition to
the number of other ways they can get tested. The Administration is
quickly completing a contracting process for the unprecedented purchase
of one billion at-home, rapid tests to distribute as part of this
program. The Department of Defense, in coordination with the Department
of Health and Human Services, has already awarded several of the
contracts that will result from this process—with over 420 million tests
already under contract. Given the incredible volume of tests being
procured and the diversity of manufacturers, additional contracts will
continue to be awarded over the coming weeks.

-   Ordering Process: Starting on January 19<sup>th</sup>, Americans
    will be able to order a test online at COVIDTests.gov. To ensure
    broad access, the program will limit the number of tests sent to
    each residential address to four tests. Tests will usually ship
    within 7-12 days of ordering.  
-   Distribution and Delivery Process: The Administration will partner
    with the United States Postal Service to package and deliver tests
    to Americans that want them. All orders in the continental United
    States will be sent through First Class Package Service, with
    shipments to Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. Territories and
    APO/FPO/DPO addresses sent through Priority Mail.   
-   Ensuring Equity and Reaching Hardest-Hit Communities: The
    Administration is taking a number of steps to ensure this program
    reaches our hardest-hit and highest-risk communities. This includes
    prioritizing processing orders to households experiencing the
    highest social vulnerability and in communities that have
    experienced a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and deaths,
    particularly during this Omicron surge; launching a free call line,
    so that Americans who have difficulty accessing the internet or need
    additional support can phone-in orders for their tests; and, working
    with national and local organizations with deep experience serving
    communities of color, people living with disabilities, and other
    high-risk communities to serve as navigators, raise awareness about
    the program, and help people submit requests.

***The Biden Administration continues acting aggressively to further
increase equitable access to free COVID-19 testing for all Americans, as
testing needs arise. This includes:***

-   **Requiring Health Insurers to Cover the Cost of At-Home COVID-19
    Tests Starting January 15<sup>th</sup>:** On Monday, the
    Administration announced that, starting January 15<sup>th</sup>,
    private insurance companies will be required to cover at-home
    COVID-19 tests. This means consumers with private health insurance
    coverage will be able to get these tests for free. Insurance
    companies and health plans are required to cover eight free at-home
    tests per covered individual per month. That means a family of four,
    all on the same plan, would be able to get 32 of these tests covered
    by their health plan per month. As part of the requirement, the
    Administration is strongly incentivizing plans and insurers to allow
    people to get these tests directly through preferred pharmacies or
    retailers with no out-of-pocket costs, with the plan or insurer
    covering the cost upfront, eliminating the need for people to submit
    reimbursement claims.  
-   **Making 10 Million More Tests Available to Schools Nationwide:** On
    Wednesday, the Administration took new actions to increase access to
    COVID-19 testing in schools. This includes increasing the number of
    COVID-19 tests available to schools by 10 million per month to help
    schools safely remain open and implement screening testing and
    test-to-stay programs—which will allow schools to double the volume
    of testing they were performing in November 2021—and supporting free
    testing access for students, school staff, and families through
    federal testing sites. These actions double down on the
    Administration’s commitment to keeping all schools safely open for
    full-time in-person learning, and build on the historic investments
    the Administration has already made to expand school testing,
    including providing states $10 billion in American Rescue Plan
    funding to support COVID-19 screening testing for teachers, staff,
    and students and $130 billion in American Rescue Plan funding that
    schools can use on COVID-19 testing. In addition to these resources,
    at the President’s direction, FEMA has been providing states,
    Tribes, and territories 100 percent federal reimbursement to support
    COVID-19 testing, including at schools. There was no federal support
    for testing in schools prior to the start of the Administration.  
-   **Standing Up New Federal Surge Free Testing Sites:** To help states
    and communities that need additional testing capacity as they battle
    Omicron, the Administration has rapidly stood up many new, federal
    free testing sites across the nation over the past several weeks.
    Already, there are 18 accessible sites operating in New York, New
    Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Washington D.C.—with approximately
    20 additional sites opening soon. These new federal sites have been
    effective in ensuring our hardest-hit and high-risk communities have
    equitable access to testing, with initial data showing that over
    three in four tests at the New York and New Jersey sites—sites that
    have been open the longest—have been administered to people of
    color.

***These actions build on the significant steps the Administration has
taken since Day One on testing to:***

-   **Increase Overall Testing Supply in the U.S.:** Starting last
    February, the Administration has used the Defense Production Act,
    industrial mobilization and advance purchase commitments to ramp up
    supply of testing, including at-home, rapid tests. This includes $3
    billion in advance purchase commitments this Fall, which allowed
    domestic testing manufacturers to increase production, add factory
    lines, increase staffing, and move up manufacturing timelines. As a
    result, the U.S. went from 24 million at-home, rapid tests on the
    market in August, to 46 million in October, to 100 million in
    November, to over 300 million in December, to 375 million in
    January. This is on top of the work the Administration has done to
    increase capacity for lab-based COVID-19 testing; the U.S. is now
    conducting more lab-based tests per capita than many peer countries,
    including Germany, Canada, and Japan.  
-   **Increase the Number of Tests Authorized in the U.S.:** In March,
    to bring more at-home, rapid tests to market, the Administration
    worked to create a new, streamlined pathway for manufacturers to
    more quickly receive authorization from the Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) for their tests. This accelerated pathway has
    been successfully used by at least six manufacturers this year. In
    addition, using resources from the American Rescue Plan, the
    Administration launched a new, innovative partnership between NIH
    and FDA last October to help manufacturers further accelerate
    authorization. The first two tests to use this pathway were
    authorized in December—weeks, if not months, ahead of schedule.
    These actions have paid off: When the President took office, there
    were zero at-home, rapid tests on the market. Today, there are nine
    on the market. This gives consumers more options and increases
    competition to lower prices.  
-   **Increase the Number of Places to Get Tested in the U.S.:** Since
    January 2021, the Administration has more than quadrupled the number
    of pharmacies participating in the federal program for in-store
    testing—from 2,500 to over 10,000. At the President’s direction,
    FEMA has provided states, Tribes, and territories with 100 percent
    reimbursement for a range of testing costs, including state-run
    testing sites, since January 2021. Overall, there are now over
    20,000 federally-supported free testing sites nationwide, with more
    pharmacies joining the federal free testing program each week. In
    addition, the Administration has stood up new federal free surge
    testing sites in areas of need, with more opening each week.  
-   **Increase Access to Free Testing in the U.S.:** From the start, the
    Administration has taken significant action to reduce the cost of
    testing and increase access to free testing. Last February, the
    Administration required insurers to cover provider-ordered testing
    for free, including for asymptomatic individuals. The Administration
    also acted to ensure Medicaid programs cover all COVID-19 testing,
    and invested nearly $5 billion to cover testing costs for uninsured
    individuals—resulting in over 47 million tests covered. In addition
    to expanding the number of free testing sites to over 20,000
    nationwide, the Administration delivers 2.5 million tests to
    long-term care facilities each week, and also launched a program to
    distribute 50 million free at-home tests to thousands of locations,
    including community health centers and rural health clinics that
    serve our hardest-hit and highest-risk communities. The
    announcements made today and earlier this week build on this work
    and will further ensure all Americans have equitable access to free
    testing.
