title: "FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Hits the Ground Running 60\
  \ Days into Infrastructure Implementation"
---
 
Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 60 days
ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to
deliver results. The Administration has made key progress towards
implementing the largest long-term investment in America’s
infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century.  
  
The historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild crumbling road
and bridges, replace lead pipes, help provide high-speed internet to
every family in America, and produce concrete results that change
people’s lives for the better. These results will create good-paying,
union jobs, support domestic manufacturing and supply chains, and
position the United States to win the 21st century. As the
Administration implements the law, it is following through on President
Biden’s commitment to ensure investments advance equity and racial
justice, reach communities all across the country – including rural
communities, communities of color, and disability communities – and
strengthen the nation’s resilience to climate change.

On the day President Biden signed the bill into law, he
appointed** Mitch Landrieu as Senior Adviser and Infrastructure
Implementation Coordinator **and signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/15/fact-sheet-president-bidens-executive-order-establishing-priorities-and-task-force-for-implementation-of-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law/) establishing
an **Infrastructure Implementation Task Force** to ensure the
Administration achieves results for the American people. The
Administration launched Build.gov to serve as a growing hub of
implementation resources, and it kicked off a nationwide tour to
highlight the benefits of the law for people across the country.  
  
President Biden surveyed a bridge needing repairs in New Hampshire,
toured an electric vehicle plant in Michigan, visited a public transit
authority in Missouri. Vice President Harris joined Transportation
Secretary Buttigieg in North Carolina to tour an electric bus facility.
EPA Administrator traveled across the South during an environmental
justice tour. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland toured the West to discuss
resilience projects while Energy Secretary Jen Granholm touted clean
energy projects from Illinois to Tennessee to Rhode Island. Throughout
the tour, the Administration demonstrated how we will work as one team
with one mission: to deliver results to the American people while
advancing racial equity, combatting climate change, and creating job
opportunities for American workers.
