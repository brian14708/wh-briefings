title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on the United\_States Providing\
  \ Additional Humanitarian Assistance to the People of\_Afghanistan"
---
 
The United States is announcing a new contribution of more than $308
million in humanitarian assistance for the people of Afghanistan. This
brings total U.S. humanitarian aid in Afghanistan and for Afghan
refugees in the region to nearly $782 million since October 2021, and we
remain the single largest donor of humanitarian aid in Afghanistan. In
addition, the United States is providing the people of Afghanistan one
million additional COVID-19 vaccine doses through COVAX, bringing our
total to 4.3 million doses.

The new humanitarian assistance by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) will directly flow through independent
humanitarian organizations and help provide lifesaving protection and
shelter, essential health care, winterization assistance, emergency food
aid, water, sanitation, and hygiene services in response to the growing
humanitarian needs exacerbated by COVID-19 and healthcare shortages,
drought, malnutrition, and the winter season.Â 

The United States is committed to supporting the Afghan people and we
continue to consider all options available to us. We stand with the
people of Afghanistan.
