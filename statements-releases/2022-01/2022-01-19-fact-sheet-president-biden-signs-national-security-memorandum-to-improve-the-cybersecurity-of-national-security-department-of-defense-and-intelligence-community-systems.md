title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Signs National Security Memorandum to Improve\
  \ the Cybersecurity of National Security, Department of Defense, and Intelligence\
  \ Community\_Systems"
---
 
Today, President Biden signed a National Security Memorandum (NSM) to
improve the cybersecurity of National Security, Department of Defense,
and Intelligence Community Systems, as required in his Executive Order
(E.O) 14028, [Improving the Nation’s
Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/).
This NSM requires that, at minimum, National Security Systems employ the
same network cybersecurity measures as those required of federal
civilian networks in Executive Order 14028. The NSM builds on the Biden
Administration’s work to protect our Nation from sophisticated malicious
cyber activity, from both nation-state actors and cyber criminals.

Cybersecurity is a national security and economic security imperative
for the Biden Administration, and we are prioritizing and elevating
cybersecurity like never before. To secure our critical infrastructure,
the Biden Administration launched a surge effort to improve
cybersecurity across the electric and pipelines sectors which has
resulted in more than 150 utilities serving 90 million Americans
committing to deploy cybersecurity technologies, and we are working with
additional critical sectors on similar action plans. The President

establishing voluntary cybersecurity goals that clearly outline our
expectations for owners and operators of critical infrastructure, and we
continue to [work closely with the private
sector](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/25/fact-sheet-biden-administration-and-private-sector-leaders-announce-ambitious-initiatives-to-bolster-the-nations-cybersecurity/)
on the [importance of prioritizing
cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/protecting-against-malicious-cyber-activity-before-the-holidays/)
as a central part of their efforts to maintain business continuity. And
internationally, the Biden Administration has rallied G7 countries to
hold accountable nations who harbor ransomware criminals, updated NATO
cyber policy for the first time in seven years, and [brought together
more than 30 allies and
partners](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/14/joint-statement-of-the-ministers-and-representatives-from-the-counter-ransomware-initiative-meeting-october-2021/)
to accelerate our cooperation in combatting cybercrime, improve law
enforcement collaboration, and stem the illicit use of cryptocurrency.

Modernizing our cybersecurity defenses and protecting *all* federal
networks is a priority for the Biden Administration, and this National
Security Memorandum raises the bar for the cybersecurity of our most
sensitive systems. This NSM:

-   **Specifies how the provisions of EO 14028 apply to National
    Security Systems.** The President’s May 2021 Executive Order
    required that the government “shall adopt National Security Systems
    requirements that are equivalent to or exceed the cybersecurity
    requirements set forth in this order.” Consistent with that mandate,
    this NSM establishes timelines and guidance for how these
    cybersecurity requirements will be implemented, including
    multifactor authentication, encryption, cloud technologies, and
    endpoint detection services.
-   **Improves the visibility of cybersecurity incidents that occur on
    these systems.** It requires agencies to identify their national
    security systems and report cyber incidents that occur on them to
    the National Security Agency, which by prior policy is the “National
    Manager” for the U.S. government’s classified systems. This will
    improve the government’s ability to identify, understand, and
    mitigate cyber risk across all National Security Systems.
-   **Requires agencies to act to protect or mitigate a cyber threat to
    National Security Systems.** The NSM authorizes the National
    Security Agency, through its role as National Manager for National
    Security Systems, to create Binding Operational Directives requiring
    agencies to take specific actions against known or suspected
    cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. This directive is modeled
    on the Department of Homeland Security’s Binding Operational
    Directive authority for civilian government networks. The NSM
    directs NSA and DHS to share directives and to learn from each other
    to determine if any of the requirements from one agency’s directive
    should be adopted by the other. 
-   **Requires agencies to secure cross domain solutions – tools that
    transfer data between classified and unclassified systems.**
    Adversaries can seek to leverage these tools to get access to our
    classified networks, and the NSM directs decisive action to mitigate
    this threat. The NSM requires agencies to inventory their
    cross-domain solutions and directs NSA to establish security
    standards and testing requirements to better protect these critical
    systems.
