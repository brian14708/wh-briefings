title: "President\_Biden Statement on First Year GDP\_Growth"
---
 
The GDP numbers for my first year show that we are finally building an
American economy for the 21st Century, with the fastest economic growth
in nearly four decades, along with the greatest year of job growth in
American history. And, for the first time in 20 years, our economy grew
faster than China’s.

This is no accident. My economic strategy is creating good jobs for
Americans, rebuilding our manufacturing, and strengthening our supply
chains here at home to help make our companies more competitive.

Today, Americans are finding better jobs with better pay and better
benefits. Layoffs are near record lows.

Companies are investing in new manufacturing lines and factories here in
the United States, with recent announcements of Intel in Ohio and GM in
Michigan. We’re making the future in America again.

And, new small business applications have increased by more than 30%
since 2019. Americans are dreaming again – believing in themselves and
America.

We are finally building an American economy for the 21st Century, and I
urge Congress to continue this momentum by passing legislation to make
America more competitive, bolster our supply chains, strengthen our
manufacturing and innovation, invest in our families and clean energy,
and lower kitchen table costs.
