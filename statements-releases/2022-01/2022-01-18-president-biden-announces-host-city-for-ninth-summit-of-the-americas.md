title: "President\_Biden Announces Host City for Ninth Summit of the\_Americas"
---
 
The vital national interests of the United States are inextricably bound
to the fortunes of our closest neighbors in the Americas. To that end,
the ability of our democracies to close the gap between what we promise
and what we deliver depends in no small part on what we do, together, to
make it better.  
  
The United States will host the Ninth Summit of the Americas in Los
Angeles, California in June 2022 with a focus on “Building a
Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Future” for our hemisphere.  
  
The Summit of the Americas is the only hemisphere-wide convening of
leaders from the countries of North, South, and Central America and the
Caribbean. U.S. leadership in the Summit process underscores our deep
and historical commitment to the people of the Western Hemisphere as
well as our commitment to realizing the Build Back Better World (B3W)
initiative. Working with the city of Los Angeles, Mayor of Los Angeles
Eric Garcetti, and Governor of California Gavin Newsom, the United
States looks forward to convening leaders and stakeholders across
the hemisphere to advance our shared commitment to economic prosperity,
security, human rights, and dignity.
