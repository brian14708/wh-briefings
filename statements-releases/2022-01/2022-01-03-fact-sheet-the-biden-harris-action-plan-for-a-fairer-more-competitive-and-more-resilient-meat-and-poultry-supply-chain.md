title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Action Plan for a Fairer, More Competitive,\
  \ and More Resilient Meat and Poultry Supply\_Chain"
---
 
In July, President Biden signed an [Executive Order on Promoting
Competition in the American
Economy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/competition) to create a fairer, more
resilient, and more dynamic economy. Over the last few decades, we’ve
seen too many industries become dominated by a handful of large
companies that control most of the business and most of the
opportunities—raising prices and decreasing options for American
families, while also squeezing out small businesses and entrepreneurs.  
  
The [meat and poultry processing
sector](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/09/08/addressing-concentration-in-the-meat-processing-industry-to-lower-food-prices-for-american-families/)
is a textbook example, with lack of competition hurting consumers,
producers, and our economy.  
  
Four large meat-packing companies control 85 percent of the beef market.
In poultry, the top four processing firms control 54 percent of the
market. And in pork, the top four processing firms control about 70
percent of the market. The meatpackers and processors buy from farmers
and sell to retailers like grocery stores, making them a key bottleneck
in the food supply chain.  
  
When dominant middlemen control so much of the supply chain, they can
increase their own
[profits](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/12/10/recent-data-show-dominant-meat-processing-companies-are-taking-advantage-of-market-power-to-raise-prices-and-grow-profit-margins/)
at the expense of both farmers—who make less—and consumers—who pay more.
Most farmers now have little or no choice of buyer for their product and
little leverage to negotiate, causing their share of every dollar spent
on food to decline. Fifty years ago, ranchers got over 60 cents of every
dollar a consumer spent on beef, compared to about 39 cents today.
Similarly, hog farmers got 40 to 60 cents on each dollar spent 50 years
ago, down to about 19 cents today.  
  
Even as farmers’ share of profits have dwindled, American consumers are
paying more—with meat and poultry prices now the [single largest
contributor](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/12/10/recent-data-show-dominant-meat-processing-companies-are-taking-advantage-of-market-power-to-raise-prices-and-grow-profit-margins/)
to the rising cost of food people consume at home.  
  
And, when too few companies control such a large portion of the market,
our food supply chains are susceptible to shocks. When COVID-19 or other
disasters such as fires or cyberattacks shutter a plant, many ranchers
have no other place to take their animals. Our overreliance on just a
handful of giant processors leaves us all vulnerable, with any
disruptions at these bottlenecks rippling throughout our food system.  
  
**Today, President Biden will meet with farmers, ranchers, and
independent processors from across the country to hear from them and to
announce the Biden-Harris Administration’s Action Plan for a Fairer,
More Competitive, and More Resilient Meat and Poultry Supply Chain.**
The Action Plan includes four core strategies for creating a more
competitive, fair, resilient meat and poultry sector, with better
earnings for producers and more choices and affordable prices for
consumers:    
  
**The Biden-Harris Administration will dedicate $1 billion in American
Rescue Plan funds for expansion of independent processing capacity.**
USDA reviewed [nearly 450
comments](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Competition-RFI-Anecdotes-010322.pdf)
received over the summer in response to its request for input on how
best to increase independent processing capacity. Through their analysis
of stakeholder input, USDA identified an urgent need to:

-   Expand and diversify meat and poultry processing capacity;
-   Increase producer income;
-   Provide producers an opportunity to have ownership in processing
    facilities;
-   Create stable, well-paying jobs in rural regions;
-   Raise the bar on worker health, safety, training, and wages for
    meatpacking jobs;
-   Spur collaboration among producers and workers;
-   Prompt state, tribal, and private co-investment; and
-   Provide consumers with more choices.

To these ends, USDA has increased available funding and is releasing new
program details to support the meat and poultry supply chain.
Specifically, the Biden-Harris Administration will:  
  
***Expand independent processing capacity***

-   **Increase competition and create more options for producers and
    consumers in the near-term by jump-starting independent processing
    projects that will increase competition and enhance the resiliency
    of the food supply chain.** This new processing capacity will build
    momentum in a currently concentrated market. For example, 50 beef
    slaughter plants owned by just a handful of companies currently
    process nearly all the cattle in the United States. USDA will
    provide gap financing grants totaling up to **$375 million** for
    independent processing plant projects that fill a demonstrated need
    for more diversified processing capacity.
    -   USDA will publish a Request for Proposals for Phase I of this
        initiative this Spring. Phase I will invest approximately **$150
        million to jump-start an estimated 15 projects**, focused on
        deploying financial support for projects with the greatest
        near-term impact. USDA will deploy an additional $225 million to
        support additional projects in Phase II, which will open in
        Summer 2022. USDA will also ensure these funds truly expand
        capacity outside the largest meat and poultry processors,
        funding only independent operations.  
-   **Strengthen the financing systems for independent processors**.
    USDA will work with lenders to make more capital available to
    independent processors that need credit. To address the credit
    access gap, USDA will deploy up to **$275 million** in partnership
    with lenders that will, in turn, provide loans and other support to
    businesses at rates and on terms that increase access to long-term,
    affordable capital. USDA will solicit applications from potential
    partners by Summer 2022, with an initial focus on lenders that
    provide financing in underserved communities.  
-   **Back private lenders that invest in independently owned food
    processing and distribution infrastructure**. From cold storage to
    specialized equipment, building a more distributed and resilient
    food system requires independent producers to have access to food
    processing and distribution infrastructure that enables them to move
    their product throughout the supply chain. To assist in the
    financing of this infrastructure, USDA has [**deployed $100
    million**](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/12/09/usda-launches-loan-guarantee-program-create-more-market)
    in American Rescue Plan funds, to make **more than $1 billion** in
    guaranteed loans available immediately. Applications for these
    guaranteed loans will be accepted until funds are expended; more
    information on how to apply can be found
    [here](https://www.rd.usda.gov/food-supply-chain-guaranteed-loans).

***Support workers and the independent processor industry***

-   **Build a pipeline of well-trained workers and support safe
    workplaces with fair wages.** New and expanded meat and poultry
    processing facility capacity will create new job opportunities in
    rural communities. Building a well-trained workforce and ensuring
    that meat and poultry processing jobs are safe requires dedicated
    attention and investment. USDA will dedicate **$100 million** to
    support development of a well-trained workforce, safe workplaces,
    and good-paying, quality jobs by working closely with partner
    organizations, including labor unions, with expertise in workforce
    development and worker health and safety.  
-   **Promote innovation and lower barriers to entry via publicly
    accessible expert knowledge.** Meat and poultry processing is a
    complex and technical sector that requires strict adherence to a
    host of environmental, food safety, and worker safety requirements.
    Creating new business models that support both workers and producers
    is similarly complex and time-intensive. At the same time,
    processors need access to new and emerging innovative practices and
    technologies. USDA will invest an estimated **$50 million** in
    technical assistance and research and development to help
    independent business owners, entrepreneurs, producers, and other
    groups, such as cooperatives and worker associations, create new
    capacity or expand existing capacity.  
-   **Provide $100 million in reduced overtime inspection costs to help
    small and very small processing plants keep up with unprecedented
    demand.** With bipartisan support in Congress, USDA [is
    reducing](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/policy/federal-register-rulemaking/federal-register-notices/overtime-and-holiday-inspection-fee)
    the financial burden of overtime and holiday inspection fees for
    small and very small poultry, meat, and egg processing plants, by 30
    percent and 75 percent respectively, which provide farmers and
    ranchers with local alternatives to process livestock and poultry.
-   In addition to the above investments from the American Rescue Plan,
    **USDA** **has made $32 million in grants to 167 existing meat and
    poultry processing facilities to help them reach more customers by
    becoming Federally inspected through the** [**Meat and Poultry
    Inspection Readiness Grants
    Program.**](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/11/22/usda-invests-32-million-strengthen-us-food-supply-chain-solidifies)
    With this grant funding, meat and poultry processing businesses can
    cover the costs for improvements, such as expanding existing
    facilities, modernizing processing equipment, and meeting packaging,
    labeling, and food safety requirements needed to achieve a Federal
    Grant of Inspection under the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the
    Poultry Products Inspection Act, or to operate under a state’s
    Cooperative Interstate Shipment program. These changes will allow
    these facilities to serve more customers in more markets. An
    additional round of funding for this program will be made available
    through a forthcoming Request for Applications.

**The Biden-Harris Administration will strengthen the rules that protect
farmers, ranchers, and consumers.** Specifically, in 2022, the
Biden-Harris Administration will:

-   **Issue new, stronger rules under the Packers and Stockyards Act—the
    law designed to combat abuses by the meatpackers and processors.**
    The law was systematically weakened by the Trump Administration
    USDA, and in the Biden Administration, USDA has [already begun
    work](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/06/11/usda-begin-work-strengthen-enforcement-packers-and-stockyards-act)
    on three proposed rules to provide greater clarity and strengthen
    enforcement under the Act. USDA is also currently working with the
    Federal Trade Commission to prepare a report on access to retail and
    competition’s role in protecting new market entrants in meat
    processing.  
-   **Issue new “Product of USA” labeling rules** **so that consumers
    can better understand where their meat comes from.** Under current
    labeling rules, meat can be labeled “Product of USA” if it is only
    processed here—including when meat is raised overseas and then
    merely processed into cuts of meat here. We believe this could make
    it hard for American consumers to know what they are getting. USDA
    has [already
    begun](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/07/01/usda-announces-efforts-promote-transparency-product-usa-labeling)
    its top-to-bottom review of the current labeling rules and
    consumers’ understanding of the labels, with the goal of new
    rulemaking to clarify “Product of USA” standards.

**It is the policy of the Administration to promote vigorous and fair
enforcement of the existing competition laws, and to ensure “all of
government” works together to promote competition:**

-   **Today, DOJ and USDA are announcing a [new joint
    initiative](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-agriculture-department-issue-shared-principles-and-commitments-protect)
    to better coordinate their efforts—including launching within 30
    days a new portal for reporting concerns about potential violations
    of the competition laws. **The President’s Executive Order on
    Promoting Competition established the White House Competition
    Council to coordinate a “whole of government approach” to promoting
    competition. In furtherance of this approach, Competition Council
    members USDA and DOJ will provide a new joint channel for farmers
    and ranchers to report complaints of potentially unfair and
    anticompetitive practices in the agricultural sector to them—whether
    under the Sherman and Clayton Acts or the Packers and Stockyards
    Act. This joint channel will facilitate the agencies’ ability to
    work together based on a common understanding of farmers’ and
    ranchers’ concerns. The agencies will protect the confidentiality of
    the complainants to the fullest extent allowed under the law. The
    agencies also announced their commitment to the strongest possible
    whistleblower protections. DOJ and USDA further announced that they
    will enhance their collaboration on referrals, information sharing,
    and identifying areas of the law in need of modernization.

**The Biden-Harris Administration will work to increase transparency in
cattle markets so that ranchers can get a fair price for their work:**

-   **USDA is using its existing authorities to increase transparency to
    the extent possible.** Right now, meatpackers have outsized power in
    setting the prices for beef. The dominance of opaque contracts and
    insufficient competition undermine price discovery and fairness in
    the independent livestock markets, which ultimately lock producers
    into prices that aren’t the product of free and fair negotiation. In
    August, USDA began issuing [new market
    reports](https://www.ams.usda.gov/press-release/new-usda-market-news-reports-enhance-price-transparency-cattle-markets) on
    what beef-processors pay to provide additional insight into formula
    cattle trades and help promote fair and competitive markets. USDA is
    looking at what more can be done under existing authorities.  
-   **The Biden-Harris Administration will also work with Congress to
    make cattle markets fairer and more transparent.** The
    Administration is encouraged to see bipartisan legislation in the
    Senate by Senators Grassley, Fischer, Tester, and Wyden, and in the
    House by Representatives Axne and Feenstra, that seeks to improve
    price discovery in the cattle markets and facilitate actual
    negotiation of prices between livestock producers and packers. We
    look forward to working with Congress on these important issues, and
    we hope that they will also look for ways to ensure farmers and
    ranchers have fair access to processing capacity.
