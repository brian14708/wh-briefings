title: Statement by President Biden on the Consumer Price Index
---
 
Today’s report—which shows a meaningful reduction in headline inflation
over last month, with gas prices and food prices falling—demonstrates
that we are making progress in slowing the rate of price increases. At
the same time, this report underscores that we still have more work to
do, with price increases still too high and squeezing family budgets.

Inflation is a global challenge, appearing in virtually every developed
nation as it emerges from the pandemic economic slump. America is
fortunate that we have one of the fastest growing economies—thanks in
part to the American Rescue Plan—which enables us to address price
increases and maintain strong, sustainable economic growth. That is my
goal and I am focused on reaching it every day.
