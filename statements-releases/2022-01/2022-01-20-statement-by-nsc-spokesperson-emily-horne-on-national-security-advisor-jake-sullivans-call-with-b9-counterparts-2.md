National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with National
Security Advisors, Foreign Ministers, and other officials from the
Bucharest Nine (B9) group of our eastern flank NATO Allies. Mr. Sullivan
briefed on U.S. diplomatic efforts related to Russia’s destabilizing
military buildup along Ukraine’s border, including Secretary Blinken’s
upcoming meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, and welcomed
continued close coordination with the B9 countries on NATO deterrence
and defense efforts. Participants underscored the importance of
Transatlantic unity, which is our greatest strength. They also
emphasized their commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity in the face of Russian aggression, including through continued
provision of defensive assistance.  
  
The Bucharest Nine members are Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia.
