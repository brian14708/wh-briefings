The Nor’easter that will move up through the mid-Atlantic States to the
Northeast this weekend will bring extreme cold and hazardous conditions
to many communities. Be sure to pay close attention to the information
and guidance that is provided by your State and local leaders and
homeland security and emergency preparedness officials. We will be
actively monitoring the storm’s projected impacts and working closely
with FEMA to ensure that we are prepared to support any needs for
Federal assistance that may arise in your community.
