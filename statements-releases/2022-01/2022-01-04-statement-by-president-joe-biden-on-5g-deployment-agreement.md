title: Statement by President Joe Biden on 5G Deployment Agreement
---
 
My Administration is committed to rapid 5G deployment, while minimizing
disruptions to air operations and continuing to maintain the world’s
safest airspace. Last night’s agreement is a significant step in the
right direction, and we’re grateful to all parties for their cooperation
and good faith. This agreement ensures that there will be no disruptions
to air operations over the next two weeks and puts us on track to
substantially reduce disruptions to air operations when AT&T and Verizon
launch 5G on January 19<sup>th</sup>.  For the last few months, my
Administration has been convening technical experts at the FAA, the FCC,
and from the wireless and aviation industries to discuss a solution that
allows the expansion of 5G and aviation to safely co-exist, and I am
pleased those efforts helped produce yesterday’s agreement.  I want to
thank Secretary Buttigieg, FAA Administrator Dickson, and FCC Chair
Rosenworcel, as well as AT&T and Verizon and airline industry leaders,
for their tireless work to ensure that the expansion of 5G and aviation
can safely co-exist.
