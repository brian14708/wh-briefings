This afternoon, the President met with the White House Competition
Council in the East Room to discuss actions they have taken to deliver
concrete cost savings to American families and to discuss plans for
further action over the weeks, months, and years ahead.

The July 9 Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American
Economy established the Competition Council to drive forward the
Administration’s whole-of-government effort to promoting competition.
Its purpose is to coordinate progress on the Order’s 72 initiatives to
restore competition in the economy, to collaborate on addressing
pressing competition problems across the economy, and to find new ways
of delivering concrete benefits to America’s consumers, workers,
farmers, and small businesses. The Council is comprised of ten Cabinet
members and the heads of seven independent agencies.

The President commended the Council’s members for meeting each deadline
set forth in the Executive Order so far. He emphasized that, thanks to
the Council’s actions across a broad range of industries, American
families will feel more breathing room in their budgets over the coming
months. The President highlighted several examples, including:

-   New proposed rules from the Food and Drug Administration that would
    make hearing aids available over-the-counter, lowering their cost
    from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars for the millions of
    Americans suffering from hearing loss.
-   Progress on the “right to repair” that is making it cheaper and
    easier for Americans to fix the products they already own. Following
    the Order’s support for the right to repair, the Federal Trade
    Commission unanimously announced that it will ramp up enforcement
    against illegal repair restrictions. Since then, large firms have
    voluntarily announced changes to their policies to make it easier
    for consumers to repair their own electronics.
-   Agencies with merger oversight authority have ramped up their
    efforts to challenge or block mergers that are bad for the American
    economy and for families’ pocketbooks. For example, the Department
    of Justice recently blocked an insurance mega-merger that would have
    raised insurance costs for consumers and businesses alike.

The President made clear that the Council’s work is about steadily
making changes that will promote competition—resulting in lower prices,
fairer wages, and more innovation across the economy.

To that end, the Council’s members used the rest of the meeting to
discuss a broad agenda for action. Each member agency spoke to their top
competition priorities for the coming months. For example:

-   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced an initiative to
    save consumers tens of billions of dollars in junk fees in banking,
    credit cards, and mortgages.
-   The Department of Transportation described efforts to promote
    consumer choice and protect consumers by ensuring travelers can tell
    the true cost of air travel.
-   The Federal Communications Commission described efforts to lower
    broadband prices by preventing landlords and providers from entering
    sweetheart deals that shut out broadband competition in apartment
    buildings, and by adopting a Broadband Nutrition Label that helps
    Americans comparison shop.
-   The Department of Agriculture explained its plan to expand
    competition in meat processing by funding new and independent
    processors and strengthening rules to protect farmers and ranchers.

Each member described a robust agenda to promote competition—actions
that will help reduce the prices people pay for everyday things, from
internet plans, to groceries, to shipping costs, to vacation travel.

In-person participants in today’s meeting included:

-   Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen
-   Attorney General Merrick Garland
-   Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack
-   Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo
-   Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh
