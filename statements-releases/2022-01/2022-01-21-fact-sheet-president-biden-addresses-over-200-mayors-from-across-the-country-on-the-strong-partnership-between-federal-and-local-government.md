title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Addresses Over 200 Mayors from Across the Country\
  \ on the Strong Partnership between Federal and Local\_Government"
---
 
Today, President Biden addressed over 200 bipartisan mayors during their
annual U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM) Winter Meeting. This was the
President’s first time addressing the entire USCM since taking office.
At this year’s convening, the President highlighted the strong
partnership between his Administration and mayors during the past year
to tackle unprecedented crises, rebuild the economy, and deliver results
for working families. The President also discussed ways to further
partner with cities on implementing the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the importance of passing the Build
Back Better Act. 

Ten members of the President’s Cabinet spoke at the USCM Winter Meeting,
including Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, Secretary of Health
and Human Services Xavier Becerra, Secretary of the Department of
Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh,
Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Secretary of Transportation Pete
Buttigieg, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development Marcia Fudge, Attorney General Merrick Garland, and
EPA Administrator Regan. Senior Administration officials including ARP
Coordinator Gene Sperling, Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator
Mitch Landrieu, and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie
Rodriguez will also speak at the event.

*Below are some of the ways the Biden-Harris Administration is working
with Mayors to deliver for communities across the country:*

**<u>Getting Shots in Arms and Saving Lives</u>**

Since the start of his Administration, President Biden has prioritized
local partnerships and has worked closely with mayors across the country
who have been instrumental as trusted sources of information about the
COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.

Working with local governments, the Administration has shipped over 160
million pieces of personal protective equipment – gloves, gowns, masks –
to protect frontline health care workers in cities across the United
States. Since first launching surge response teams on July 1st, the
Administration has deployed over 3,000 personnel to 39 states and 4 U.S.
territories. The Administration also recently worked with several mayors
and local jurisdictions to surge federal testing support and federal
test sites to several cities.

Over 115 mayors across the country joined the White House, HHS, and We
Can Do This campaign to launch a [Mayors Challenge to Increase COVID-19
Vaccinations](https://www.usmayors.org/vaccination-challenge/). This
campaign was instrumental in increasing the adult vaccination rate
through mayors sharing best practices and launching innovative efforts
to boost vaccinations, including grassroots outreach, mobile and
neighborhood vaccine clinics, incentives, prizes, and other efforts.

-   Richmond, VA Mayor Levar Stoney as co-lead of the Mayors Challenge,
    launched the \#HotVaccinatedSummer campaign with the Richmond Health
    Department focused on taking the vaccine to residents through mobile
    vaccination units, pop-up vaccine sites at grocery stores, food
    pantries, apartment complexes, and churches, and neighborhood block
    parties.
-   Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome and New Orleans Mayor LaToya
    Cantrell, mayors of Louisiana’s two largest cities, launched a
    month-long, inter-city “New Orleans vs Baton Rouge COVID challenge”
    to motivate citizens to get vaccinated.
-   Detroit, MI Mayor Mike Duggan launched an innovative “Good Neighbor
    Program” where residents received gift cards for driving their
    neighbors to get vaccinated, as well as a door-to-door vaccination
    education canvassing effort.
-   San Antonio, TX Mayor Ron Nirenberg along with making pop-up vaccine
    clinics accessible, collaborated with local artists to create murals
    reminding residents of the importance of getting vaccinated.

**<u>Getting People Back to Work</u>**

President Biden has grown the economy faster than any first-year
administration ever with 6.4 million jobs added, the most in one year on
record. The unemployment rate is 3.9% – four years faster than projected
because of the American Rescue Plan. The Biden-Harris agenda has
provided substantial resources to state and local governments to expand
and improve America’s workforce development system so that workers of
all kinds from diverse communities will be prepared and successful in
good-paying union jobs.

The American Rescue Plan (ARP) included $350 billion in state and local
fiscal recovery funds that governments can use to assist workers who
want and are available to work – including job training, public jobs
programs, job fairs, childcare, transportation, hiring bonuses, and
subsidized employment efforts). The ARP also invested $3 billion in the
Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) to
assist communities in their efforts to build back better from the
pandemic, including $1 billion for the Build Back Better Regional
Challenge and $500 million for a Good Jobs Challenge that will support
sector partnerships that bring employers, unions, non-profits, community
colleges, training providers, and local governments together to enhance
local training and hiring efforts.

-   **Building Bridges to Infrastructure Jobs**:
    -   Washington, DC is using ARP resources to expand the city’s
        Infrastructure Academy to ensure a diverse workforce is ready to
        fill the infrastructure jobs that will be created by the
        historic bipartisan infrastructure law.

    <!-- -->

    -   Milwaukee, WI has dedicated ARP funds to launch a lead abatement
        workforce development program and an Earn and Learn program
        which assists young people entering manufacturing and other
        high-skill jobs.

    <!-- -->

    -   Phoenix, AZ is using Rescue Plan funds to partner with local
        community colleges and the private sector on job training
        programs that not only will re-skill and re-employ individuals
        for new careers in high demand workforce areas, such as
        manufacturing, construction, and the region’s emerging
        semiconductor industry.
-   **Supporting our Essential Education Workers:**
    -   Seattle, WA used ARP fiscal recovery funds to provide premium
        pay for local child care workers, up to $835 per worker who have
        been there for at least 6 months.
-   **Bolstering our Health Care Workforce:**
    -   Chicago, IL is leveraging ARP funds to build a 2,200 public
        health workforce working as vaccine ambassadors and addressing
        vaccine resistance.

    <!-- -->

    -   New York City is dedicating ARP funds to bolster their public
        health workforce through the New York City Public Health Corps
        program, which will focus on a range of public health needs –
        from vaccine access, to primary care, to mental health
        counseling.

**<u>Building a Better America</u>**

Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the
Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running with a focus on
fostering strong partnerships and working with mayors to implement the
largest long-term investment in America’s infrastructure and
competitiveness in nearly a century. The historic Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law will rebuild crumbling road and bridges, replace lead
pipes, help provide high-speed internet to every family in America, and
produce concrete results that change people’s lives for the better.
These results will create good-paying, union jobs, support domestic
manufacturing and supply chains, and position the United States to win
the 21st century. As the Administration implements the law, it is
following through on President Biden’s commitment to ensure investments
advance equity and racial justice, reach communities all across the
country – including rural communities, communities of color, and
disability communities – and strengthen the nation’s resilience to
climate change. Since the enactment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, the Biden Administration has it the ground running. Some of the key
actions since the law’s passage include:

-   Understanding the importance of strong partnership with local
    governments to deliver results on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
    the White House appointed Mitch Landrieu, former Mayor of New
    Orleans and former President of the US Conference of Mayors, as
    Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator.
-   The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and Federal Highway
    Administration (FHWA) announced $27 billion in funding to replace,
    repair, and rehabilitate bridges across the country over the next
    five years, including many locally-owned “off system” bridges.
-   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that it will invest more
    than $14 billion of funding for over 500 projects across 52 states
    and territories. These key projects will strengthen the nation’s
    supply chain, provide significant new economic opportunities
    nationwide, and bolster our defenses against climate change.
-   USDOT awarded $1 billion in Rebuilding American Infrastructure with
    Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grants to invest in 90 major
    projects across 47 states funding that will be boosted by an
    additional $7.5 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
-   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at USDOT announced $3
    billion for 3,075 airports across the country that can use
    investments to upgrade critical infrastructure.
-   **The Vice President announced the Administration’s Lead Pipe and
    Paint Action Plan, which includes action items focused
    on c**ollaboration with local partners to accelerate the replacement
    of lead pipes over the next decade. As part of this plan, EPA
    announced $7.4 billion in funding allocations for states to upgrade
    America’s aging water infrastructure, sewerage systems, pipes and
    service lines, and more.
-   The Federal Communications Commission launched the Affordable
    Connectivity Program providing broadband subsidies of up to
    $30/month for low-income households (up to $75/month for households
    on Tribal Lands) and up to $100 towards the purchase of a desktop,
    laptop or tablet computer.
-   EPA announced $1 billion in funding to clean up 49 Superfund sites
    across 24 states to accelerate cleanup at dozens of other sites
    across the country, stop toxic waste from harming communities, and
    create good-paying jobs.
-   The Department of the Interior released initial guidance for the
    states interested in applying for funding to cap and plug orphaned
    oil and gas wells that reduce methane emissions and create jobs,
    with 26 states expressing interest in a portion of the $4.7 billion
    in funding for well plugging, remediation and restoration available
    in infrastructure programs.
-   The Department of Energy launched a new Building a Better Grid
    initiative to accelerate the deployment of new transition lines, and
    it released a notice of intent to inform the design and
    implementation of this historic investment.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes billions of dollars in
competitive funding available to cities, towns, and municipalities
across dozens of new and existing programs. As local governments begin
to rebuild and reinvest in their communities, the Biden-Harris
Administration stands ready to support local leaders as they combine
funding streams, organize around their priorities, and build local
support for long overdue infrastructure projects. The White House
released a [fact sheet](http://wh.gov/localBILfunding) highlights 25
already available or soon-to-be-available sources of funding that local
governments – particularly cities – can compete or apply for directly.
The White House will also be releasing a comprehensive guidebook of all
available funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in the coming
weeks.

**Addressing Supply Chain Blockages**

As our economy has turned back on from the unprecedented shutdown
resulting from the pandemic, our supply chains have been strained. The
Administration is working closely with  mayors and local governments
across the country to mitigate supply chain blockages and ensure shelves
are stocked.

-   The Administration’s port envoy has held weekly meetings with
    city-owned ports, including the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,
    to identify ways to reduce congestion and move toward 24/7
    operations, which reduces the emissions and traffic in communities.
-   The Department of Transportation awarded more than $241 million in
    discretionary grants to improve ports facilities and address supply
    chain disruptions in 19 cities, including Houston, TX; Brunswick,
    GA; Bay St Louis, MS; Tell City, IN; Alpena, MI; Delcambre, LA;
    Oakland, CA; Portsmouth, VA; Tacoma, WA; and Long Beach, CA.
-   The Administration is working to help schools experiencing
    challenges purchasing and reliably obtaining food for their meal
    plans. USDA has committed $1.5 billion for schools and states to
    purchase foods including funding to purchase local foods from
    historically underserved producers and announced an adjustment in
    school meal reimbursements that put an estimated $750 million more
    into school meal programs across the nation this year.

**Advancing Local Climate Action**

On Day One, President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement, reestablished
U.S. leadership, and renewed the federal government’s partnership with
the states, cities, Tribes, and localities that carried forward
America’s progress on climate. Since then, President Biden has deployed
clean wind and solar energy across the country, jumpstarted an electric
vehicle future that will be built in America, advanced environmental
justice in underserved communities, and taken aggressive action to make
our country more resilient to climate change and extreme weather.

Today, President Biden will announce how the Biden-Harris Administration
is teaming up with states, cities, labor, and industry to launch the
Building Performance Standards Coalition, a first-of-its-kind
partnership between 33 state and local governments dedicated to
delivering cleaner, healthier, and more affordable buildings. States and
cities part of the coalition will design and implement building
performance standards that create good paying union jobs, lower the cost
of energy bills for consumers, keep residents and workers safe from
harmful pollution, and cut emissions from the building sector.

The Administration is also empowering local leaders to advance climate
solutions across other sectors—for example:

-   The Department of Energy set a new National Community Solar
    Partnership target of powering 5 million homes by 2025, with
    on-demand technical assistance available to local governments, and
    launched the SolarAPP+ tool to help them speed up permitting of
    rooftop solar installations.
-   The Department of Transportation announced $182 million in grants
    for transit agencies to deploy zero-emission and low-emission
    transit buses, including awards to the Chicago Transit Authority;
    Anaheim, CA; Fort Collins, CO; Lawrence, KS; Jackson, MS;
    Fayetteville, NC; Lincoln, NE; Norman, OK; and more.
-   The EPA announced $50 million for environmental justice initiatives
    using ARP funds, including water infrastructure job training in
    Baltimore, MD; indoor air quality improvements in Fort Collins, CO;
    and outreach on asthma and environmental hazards in Hartford, CT. 
-   FEMA announced $1 billion for the FY2021 Building Resilient
    Infrastructure and Communities program, available for cities and
    other levels of government to proactively invest in community
    resilience to hurricanes, wildfires, and other disasters.
-   In November 2021, President Biden and 15 bipartisan mayors
    representing communities across the country participated in COP26,
    where the President announced bold plans to reduce methane
    emissions, create clean energy jobs, and build back better with
    infrastructure initiatives that advance prosperity and combat the
    climate crisis.

**Addressing Gun Violence and Crime**

During the President’s first year in office, the Biden-Harris
Administration has partnered with mayors across the country on actions
to [reduce gun
violence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/14/fact-sheet-highlights-from-the-biden-administrations-historic-efforts-to-reduce-gun-violence/)
and has provided historic levels of funding for community-oriented
policing and expanding community violence interventions (CVI) –
neighborhood-based programs proven to combat gun violence. The
Administration has made historic levels of funding from the American
Rescue Plan – including $350 billion in state and local funding –
available to state and local governments for law enforcement purposes to
advance community policing strategies and community violence
interventions.

-   Working with 16-jurisdictions, the White House launched the
    [Community Violence Intervention
    Collaborative](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=868f3461c3&e=afac06d7b3),
    a cohort of mayors, law enforcement, CVI experts and philanthropic
    organizations committed to using ARP funding to increase investment
    in their community violence intervention infrastructure and share
    best practices. 
-   Cities including Milwaukee, WI; Albuquerque, NM; Syracuse, NY; and
    Mobile, AL responded to the President’s call by committing and
    deploying ARP funds for advancing community-oriented policing.
-   Mayors from cities across the country including Seattle, WA;
    Buffalo, NY; and Atlanta, GA have committed to deploy ARP fund for
    community violence interventions following a memo from Senior White
    House advisors on how state and local officials can implement ARP
    funding into CVI work.
-   Cities across the country including St. Louis, MO and Tucson, AZ
    committed to investing ARP funding in public safety strategies such
    as summer jobs for young adults and substance abuse and mental
    health services.

**Prevent Housing Instability and Homelessness**

During the President’s first year in office, the Biden-Harris
Administration partnered with mayors across the country to keep
Americans housed. The American Rescue Plan (ARP) included over $21
billion for the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program. These funds,
together with $25 billion signed into law under the previous
Administration but implemented under this Administration, enabled
households to catch up on rent and avoid evictions. State and local
grantees obligated over $25 billion in ERA in 2021, and these funds
contributed to a historically low eviction filing rate. Also included
within ARP were $5 billion in supplemental funding for HOME, which
enables state and local governments to create and preserve affordable
housing, and $5 billion in emergency housing vouchers to help people
experiencing and at risk of homelessness secure housing.

-   In June, 46 cities joined the White House to create eviction
    prevention action plans as part of a first-of-its-kind summit. More
    than 100 eviction diversion programs were created or expanded as
    part of this partnership with the White House and local leaders.
-   Mayors from Louisville, Milwaukee, San Antonio, and Boston shared
    best practices in subsequent White House events including strategies
    to prevent evictions and distribute rental assistance to renters and
    landlords in need.
-   Dozens of mayors have signed onto [House
    America](https://www.hud.gov/house_america), a federal initiative
    aimed at maximizing the ARP resources to address homelessness. The
    goal of this initiative is to cumulatively re-house 100,000
    households experiencing homelessness and add 20,000 new units of
    affordable housing into the development pipeline by the end of 2022.

**Building an Orderly, Fair, and Humane Immigration System**

The Biden-Harris Administration is working to build a humane, orderly,
and fair 21<sup>st</sup> century immigration system at the border and
beyond. One that invests in smart technology and infrastructure at the
border, that prioritizes our resources and values immigrants living in
our country and contributing to our communities for generations, and
that once again welcomes refugees and is a beacon of light for those
seeking safe haven.

Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration took steps to undo the
wrongdoings of the previous Administration, including getting rid of the
Muslim ban, taking steps to protect DACA recipients, and restoring our
asylum system. On day one, President Biden also sent his immigration
bill to Congress – The U.S. Citizenship Act – which laid out the
components needed to build an updated immigration system that reflects
our values and responds to our hemisphere’s current needs.

Working with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of
State and non-profit organizations in Mexico and the United States, the
Administration assisted 13,000 people in the wind down of the Migrant
Protection Protocol to fight their cases in the United States. The
Administration also designated Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to
Haiti, Venezuela, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Burma, and expanded to El
Salvador and Honduras.

The President tasked Vice President Harris with leading efforts to
address the root causes of migration from Mexico, Guatemala, El
Salvador, and Honduras. The Vice President announced $310 million in
urgent humanitarian relief in April 2021, in addition to the President’s
FY22 budget request for $861 million for Central America. The Vice
President also secured $1.2 billion from the private sector to create
job programs and invest in the economic stability and prosperity for our
partner countries. In addition to the work the Vice President is
leading, the Administration is working with countries in South America
and leaders in the hemisphere to address migration as a regional issue
that necessitates regional leadership and a regional response.

The Administration remains committed to immigration reform, to restoring
asylum, and to working with partners to ensure the safety, security, and
dignity of immigrants in the region:

-   Engaged mayors and cities to amplify the broad sweeping impact
    President Biden’s U.S. Citizenship Act would have on all 11 million
    undocumented immigrants, including farm workers and individuals with
    Temporary Protected Status.
-   Partnered with cities including San Diego, Long Beach, Pomona,
    Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio to stand up Emergency Influx Sites
    to provide temporary shelter and care for thousands of unaccompanied
    children.
-   Awarded $110 million in supplemental humanitarian funding to the
    National Board for Emergency Food and Shelter Program eligible to
    cities and services providers providing humanitarian assistance to
    migrants at the southern border.
-   Regularly engaged bipartisan border mayors to discuss and coordinate
    rebuilding America’s border management and asylum systems that were
    previously gutted by the prior administration. Additionally, engaged
    local elected leaders in the Rio Grande Valley, San Diego, and El
    Centro border sectors to protect border communities from the
    physical dangers resulting from the previous administration’s
    approach to border wall construction.

**Welcoming Refugees and Resettlement Efforts**

The Biden-Harris Administration has taken a whole-of-America approach to
safely, securely, and effectively welcome more than 76,000 Afghan allies
to the United States through the Operation Allies Welcome.

In close coordination with Departments and Agencies across the Federal
government, the Administration has worked with state and local
officials; refugee resettlement organizations; veterans; faith, private
sector, and non-profit leaders to ensure Afghans are set up for success
in their new communities. The White House Operation Allies Welcome team
provided briefings to USCM and visited resettlement sites in six states
to engage with local officials and stakeholders on the frontlines of
welcoming our Afghan allies. In his capacity as OAW Coordinator, Jack
Markell attended the 2021 USCM Summer Meeting in Dayton, Ohio to brief
mayors on their important role in the resettlement effort.

-   USCM Past President Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley and Hartford Mayor Luke
    Bronin led the effort for USCM’s resolution in support of Afghan
    resettlement and welcomed briefings from senior Administration
    officials to keep mayors updated on resettlement efforts
-   Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner worked with local resettlement
    agencies to raise more than $8.5 million dollars for the Houston
    Afghan Resettlement Fund (HARF) to help the local resettlement
    agencies provide additional services for Afghan evacuees
-   Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt collaborated with the local
    resettlement agency to identify additional funding stream to for
    affordable housing for Afghan evacuees
-   Lansing Mayor Andy Schor worked with the local school district to
    ensure a warm welcome to arriving Afghans students and families.
-   Sacramento Mayor Darryl Steinberg coordinated with state, county,
    and local leaders to create a new coalition called the American
    Network of Services for Afghanistan Refugees (ANSAR) to assist in
    meeting the needs of Afghan families.
