title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Iranian Threats and\
  \ Provocations Against American\_Citizens"
---
 
Yesterday, Iran purported to impose sanctions on 51 Americans. They do
so as Iran’s proxy militias continue to attack American troops in the
Middle East, and as Iranian officials threaten to carry out terror
operations inside the United States and elsewhere around the world. Make
no mistake: the United States of America will protect and defend its
citizens. This includes those serving the United States now and those
who formerly served.  As Americans, we have our disagreements on
politics.  We have our disagreements on Iran policy.  But we are united
in our resolve against threats and provocations.  We are united in the
defense of our people. We will work with our allies and partners to
deter and respond to any attacks carried out by Iran. Should Iran attack
any of our nationals, including any of the 51 people named yesterday, it
will face severe consequences.
