title: "FACT SHEET: President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat\
  \ Trafficking in Persons"
---
 
*“As a nation, we must require serious consequence and accountability
for those who commit these crimes. And we must work to stop these crimes
before they happen.”  
  
“Our plan centers on the key pillars of U.S. and global anti-trafficking
efforts: prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnerships…There is
a clear line that runs throughout our Administration’s work: We are
focused on the most vulnerable.”  
  
– Vice President Kamala Harris*

On January 25, 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration convened its first
meeting of the President’s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat
Trafficking in Persons (PITF).  A cabinet-level entity created by the
Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, the PITF has primary
responsibility for coordinating efforts across 20 Federal agencies to
combat trafficking in persons, and implementing the recently
released [National Action Plan to Combat Human
Trafficking](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/National-Action-Plan-to-Combat-Human-Trafficking.pdf).
PITF members were also joined by the U.S. Advisory Council on Human
Trafficking, which provides advice and recommendations on Federal
anti-trafficking policies.     
  
The new National Action Plan, released in December 2021, is a
comprehensive and forward-looking strategy with over 60 priority actions
focused on the foundational pillars of U.S. and global anti-trafficking
efforts – prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnerships.  
  
Human trafficking disproportionately impacts persons of color, women and
girls, LGBTQI+ individuals, migrants, and others from historically
marginalized and underserved communities. In an effort to link
anti-trafficking strategies to the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader
efforts to advance equity and support for underserved communities, the
National Action Plan emphasizes the Administration’s commitment to
promoting gender and racial equity, advancing workers’ rights,
preventing and addressing forced labor in global supply chains, and
ensuring safe, orderly, and humane migration.

  
*Prevention*

-   The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the
    establishment of the HHS Task Force to Prevent Human Trafficking,
    which will focus on expanding access to services for survivors,
    preventing forced labor in health care supply chains, and building
    scientific understanding of the intersections between public health
    and human trafficking, among other initiatives.  
     
-   The Senior Policy Operating Group, consisting of senior officials
    from across the U.S. government, established a working group in 2021
    that will analyze the rights and protections granted to temporary
    employment-based visa holders and develop solutions for addressing
    gaps.  
     
-   Last year, the Department of Commerce (DOC), in collaboration with
    the Departments of State and Labor, launched a new coordination
    group to develop innovative approaches to combating forced labor in
    the seafood industry.  
     
-   In December 2021, the U.S. Agency for International Development
    (USAID) released its revised policy to counter trafficking in
    persons (C-TIP).  USAID will use this policy to promote
    trauma-informed and survivor-centered approaches in C-TIP
    programming to empower survivors.  
     
-   The Department of Defense launched a Student Guide to Preventing
    Human Trafficking to inform military-connected high school students
    about human trafficking, with a focus on how human trafficking is
    occurring in student settings.  
     
-   DHS designated a senior accountable official to prevent human
    trafficking in DHS contracts and acquisitions.   
     
-   The Department of Labor (DOL) will provide additional trauma- and
    survivor-informed awareness and referral training to DOL
    investigators nationwide in order to combat forced labor and abusive
    labor practices.  
     
-   The Department of Education will launch a series of webinars to
    inform the education community about recognizing, understanding, and
    preventing human trafficking in and around school environments.  
     
-   The Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force, chaired by the Department
    of Homeland Security (DHS), will work to implement the Uyghur Forced
    Labor Prevention Act by developing a strategy for supporting
    enforcement of Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to prohibit the
    importation of goods made by forced labor from the People’s Republic
    of China.

*Protection*

-   In December 2021, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced almost
    $87 million in funding to combat human trafficking, provide
    supportive services to trafficking victims throughout the United
    States, and conduct research into the nature and causes of labor and
    sex trafficking. This includes approximately $15 million to provide
    safe, stable housing and appropriate services to victims of human
    trafficking.  
     
-   The Senior Policy Operating Group established a working group that
    will develop best practices in implementing screening forms and
    protocols for Federal officials who have the potential to encounter
    a human trafficking victim in the course of their regular duties.  
     
-   The Department of State (State) will launch a publicly available
    online training on understanding trauma and trauma-informed
    approaches, which will give anti-trafficking stakeholders tips for
    how to more successfully engage with survivors and potential victims
    of trafficking while mitigating the risk of re-traumatization.  The
    training features a consultant from its Human Trafficking Expert
    Consultant Network, made up of individuals with lived experience of
    enduring human trafficking and other subject matter experts.  State
    will also engage a Network consultant to develop a training for
    Federal agencies on conducting trauma-informed conversations and
    interviews with potential victims of trafficking.  
     
-   DOJ and HHS will launch a joint effort to develop evidence-based
    standards of care for trafficking victims to inform the provision of
    victim services across the country.  
     
-   DHS will incorporate a victim-centered approach into all policies
    and programs involving victims of crime.

*Prosecution*

-   In 2021, DOJ launched Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA), in partnership
    with DHS and other law enforcement agencies, to combat migrant
    smuggling and trafficking in persons from Guatemala, El Salvador,
    Honduras, and Mexico.  The Task Force is working within the United
    States and with our foreign partners to dismantle criminal networks
    that engage in human trafficking and subject smuggled migrants to
    dangerous, abusive, and exploitive conditions.  
     
-   Last year, DHS detained more shipments of goods (in value and
    number) made by forced labor than in any previous year, leading four
    separate international corporations to remediate forced labor
    conditions.  DHS also initiated the first-ever criminal
    investigations to hold accountable companies and individuals who use
    forced labor to produce goods abroad.  
     
-   In April 2021, the Department of the Interior announced the
    formation of a new Missing & Murdered Unit within the Bureau of
    Indian Affairs Office of Justice Services to provide leadership and
    direction for cross-departmental and interagency work to resolve
    “cold cases” involving missing and murdered American Indians and
    Alaska Natives and to address underlying causes, including human
    trafficking.    
     
-   In 2022, DOJ will release an intra-Departmental National Strategy to
    Combat Human Trafficking to strengthen Department-wide
    anti-trafficking efforts and enhance the Department’s capacity to
    implement the National Action Plan.  The forthcoming Strategy
    includes measures aimed at countering emerging labor trafficking
    threats, streamlining access to victim services, strengthening
    intelligence-driven targeting, and enhancing dissemination of
    specialized anti-trafficking expertise.  
     
-   In 2022, DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) will launch a
    new National Law Enforcement Training and Technical Assistance
    Consortium and will work to ensure that the Consortium addresses the
    intersection of human trafficking with domestic violence, dating
    violence, sexual assault, and stalking with a focus on tribal
    grantees and potential grantees.  OVW’s comprehensive technical
    assistance project on prosecution will also incorporate training on
    this topic.  
     
-   Over the next year, the Intelligence Community (IC) will work to
    improve information sharing between the IC and Federal, state,
    local, and tribal law enforcement on human trafficking.

*Partnerships*

-   The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) has increased engagement
    with the financial industry and civil society, including co-hosting
    a training with DOJ and DHS on identifying human trafficking in the
    gaming industry, and hosted a public-private partnership focusing on
    forced labor and supply chain due diligence.  Treasury’s Financial
    Crimes Enforcement Network issued the first government-wide
    priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of
    terrorism for the financial industry, which included initiatives
    focused on disrupting the illicit financial flows that enable human
    trafficking.  Treasury will continue to engage and use all available
    tools to prevent human trafficking, protect survivors, and hold
    human traffickers accountable.      
     
-   The Department of Transportation (DOT) will continue working with
    stakeholders across all modes of transportation to combat human
    trafficking, educate transportation employees and the traveling
    public on the signs of human trafficking and how to report the
    crime, expand its Transportation Leaders Against Human Trafficking
    initiative and, in coordination with the Department of Homeland
    Security, expand training program for aviation personnel under the
    Blue Lightning Initiative.  DOT will also reestablish the Advisory
    Committee on Human Trafficking to prepare and submit a triennial
    counter-trafficking report with recommendations, best practices, and
    human trafficking violations involving commercial motor vehicles in
    coordination with the Attorney General.  
     
-   DOC will develop training and guidance for U.S. companies and
    private-sector stakeholders on the use of forced labor in supply
    chains, including offering best practices to identify and address
    possible violations.  
     
-   The Office of Management and Budget will facilitate increased
    dialogue within the Federal government, as well as with the
    contractor community and non-governmental organizations, to better
    align our efforts to prevent and address trafficking in Federal
    procurement.  
     
-   As announced at the North American Leaders’ Summit in November 2021,
    the U.S. Government, led by the Department of State, will work with
    Canada and Mexico to restart the Trilateral Working Group on
    Trafficking in Persons and will promote legal pathways that
    encourage orderly, safe, and regular migration.  
     
-   In 2022, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative will continue
    to develop a trade strategy for combating forced labor, including in
    global supply chains, which will be shaped by an inclusive process
    allowing for public participation with key stakeholders, such as
    labor organizations, civil society, survivors, and businesses.
