title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on President\_Biden\u2019\
  s Meeting with Bipartisan Senators on\_Ukraine"
---
 
This morning President Biden met virtually with a bipartisan group of
senators to discuss Russia’s military build-up on Ukraine’s borders. The
group included senators who returned yesterday from a Congressional
delegation to Ukraine, where they met with Ukrainian leadership and
affirmed the United States’ longstanding bipartisan support for
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. President Biden and the
senators exchanged views on the best ways the United States can continue
to work closely with our allies and partners in support of Ukraine,
including both ongoing diplomacy to try to resolve the current crisis
and deterrence measures. President Biden commended the strong history of
support for Ukraine from both sides of the aisle, and agreed to keep
working closely with Congress as the Administration prepares to impose
significant consequences in response to further Russian aggression
against Ukraine.  
  
Senators at this briefing included Senators Rob Portman (OH), Jeanne
Shaheen (NH), Kevin Cramer (ND), Amy Klobuchar (MN), Chris Murphy (CT),
Richard Blumenthal (CT), and Roger Wicker (MS) – all of whom
participated in the Congressional delegation. The virtual meeting also
included Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Jim Risch
(ID).
