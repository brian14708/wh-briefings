title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Equal Rights\_Amendment"
---
 
Today, as the House announces a resolution on the Equal Rights
Amendment, I once again want to express my support for the ERA loudly
and clearly. I have been a strong supporter of the ERA ever since I
first ran for the Senate as a 29-year-old. We must recognize the clear
will of the American people and definitively enshrine the principle of
gender equality in the Constitution. It is long past time that we put
all doubt to rest. I am calling on Congress to act immediately to pass a
resolution recognizing ratification of the ERA. As the recently
published Office of Legal Counsel memorandum makes clear, there is
nothing standing in Congress’s way from doing so. No one should be
discriminated against based on their sex—and we, as a nation, must stand
up for full women’s equality.
