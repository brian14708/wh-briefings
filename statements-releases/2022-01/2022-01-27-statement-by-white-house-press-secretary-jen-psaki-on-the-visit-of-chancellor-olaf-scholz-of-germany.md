President Biden looks forward to welcoming Chancellor Olaf Scholz of

United States and Germany. The leaders will discuss their shared
commitment to both ongoing diplomacy and joint efforts to deter further
Russian aggression against Ukraine. They will also discuss the
importance of continued close cooperation on a range of common
challenges, including ending the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing the
threat of climate change, and promoting economic prosperity and
international security based on our shared democratic values.
