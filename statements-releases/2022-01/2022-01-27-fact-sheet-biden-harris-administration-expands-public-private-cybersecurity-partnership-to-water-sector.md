title: "Fact Sheet: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Expands Public-Private Cybersecurity\
  \ Partnership to Water Sector"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced it will extend the
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Cybersecurity Initiative to the water
sector. The Water Sector Action plan outlines surge actions that will
take place over the next 100 days to improve the cybersecurity of the
sector. The action plan was developed in close partnership with the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Water Sector Coordinating
Council (WSCC).

The incidents at Colonial Pipeline, JBS Foods, and other high-profile
critical infrastructure providers are an important reminder that the
federal government has limited authorities to set cybersecurity
baselines for critical infrastructure and managing this risk requires
partnership with the private sector and municipal owners and operators
of that infrastructure. The Administration has already established ICS
initiatives for the electric and natural gas pipeline subsectors, and
today over 150 electricity utilities serving over 90 million residential
customers and multiple critical natural gas pipelines have deployed or
are in the process of deploying additional cybersecurity technologies.

**The Water Sector Action Plan is a collaborative effort between the
federal government and the critical infrastructure community to
facilitate the deployment of technologies and systems that provide
cyber-related threat visibility, indicators, detections, and warnings:**

-   Similar to electric and pipeline action plans, this plan will assist
    owners and operators with deploying technology that will monitor
    their systems and provide near real-time situational awareness and
    warnings. The plan will also allow for rapidly sharing relevant
    cybersecurity information with the government and other
    stakeholders, which will improve the sector’s ability to detect
    malicious activity.  
     
-   EPA and CISA will work with water utilities and invite them to
    participate in a pilot program for ICS monitoring and information
    sharing. This pilot will demonstrate the value of such technology to
    the sector. The WSCC, CISA, and EPA will also collaborate to promote
    cybersecurity monitoring to the entire sector.

-   The plan will meet the particular requirements of this sector. This
    sector is made up of thousands of systems that range in size from
    the very small to ones that service major metropolitan cities that
    have little or no cybersecurity expertise and are unsure what steps
    they should take to address cyber risks. EPA and CISA will work with
    appropriate private sector partners to develop protocols for sharing
    information. The government will not select, endorse, or recommend
    any specific technology or provider.  
     
-   The plan will initially focus on the utilities that serve the
    largest populations and have the highest consequence systems;
    however, it will lay the foundation for supporting enhanced ICS
    cybersecurity across water systems of all sizes.

**Efforts like this highlight cybersecurity as a top economic and
national security priority for the Biden-Harris Administration:**

-   The Administration [has rapidly moved out on a whole-of-government
    effort](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/13/fact-sheet-ongoing-public-u-s-efforts-to-counter-ransomware/) to
    counter ransomware including disrupting ransomware infrastructure
    and actors, bolstering public and private resilience to withstand
    ransomware attacks, and leverage international cooperation to
    address safe harbors for ransomware criminals and disrupt the
    ransomware ecosystem.  
     
-   President Biden [signed an Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/) to
    modernize cybersecurity defenses by protecting federal networks,
    improving information-sharing between the U.S. government and the
    private sector on cyber issues, and strengthening the United States’
    ability to respond to incidents when they occur. The Executive Order
    uses the federal government’s buying power to drive security in the
    software we all use.    
     
-   President Biden met with private sector and education leaders in
    August to discuss the whole-of-nation effort needed to address
    cybersecurity threats – and leaders announced ambitious initiatives
    to bolster the Nation’s cybersecurity. The White House [convened
    government and private sector
    stakeholders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/13/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-software-security/) to
    improve the security of open source software and ways new
    collaboration could rapidly drive improvements. And
    officials [continue calling on the private
    sector](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Memo-What-We-Urge-You-To-Do-To-Protect-Against-The-Threat-of-Ransomware.pdf) publicly
    and privately to implement best practices to defend against
    malicious cyber activity, [including backing up data, implementing
    multi-factor authentication, and testing incident response
    plans.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/protecting-against-malicious-cyber-activity-before-the-holidays/)  
     
-   The Administration has rallied G7 countries to hold accountable
    nations who harbor ransomware criminals, updated NATO cyber policy
    for the first time in seven years, and [brought together more than
    30 allies and
    partners](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/14/joint-statement-of-the-ministers-and-representatives-from-the-counter-ransomware-initiative-meeting-october-2021/) to
    accelerate our cooperation in combatting cybercrime, improve law
    enforcement collaboration, and stem the illicit use of
    cryptocurrency. The Administration has imposed costs on Russia for
    SolarWinds, attributed malicious cyber activity to the PRC with a
    strong coalition, including NATO for the first time, and have made
    clear to nation-states and malicious actors that we will continue to
    use every tool available to us to protect the American people and
    American interests against cyber threats.
