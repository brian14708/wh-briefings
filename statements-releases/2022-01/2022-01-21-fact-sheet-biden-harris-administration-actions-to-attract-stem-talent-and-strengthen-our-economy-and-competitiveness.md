title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Actions to Attract STEM Talent\
  \ and Strengthen our Economy and\_Competitiveness"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration believes that one of America’s greatest
strengths is our ability to attract global talent to strengthen our
economy and technological competitiveness, and benefit working people
and communities all across the country.

In the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) – fields that are critical to the prosperity, security, and
health of our Nation – our history is filled with examples of how
America’s ability to attract global talent has spurred path-breaking
innovation. This innovation has led to the creation of new jobs, new
industries, and new opportunities for Americans across the United
States. Our commitment as a nation to welcoming new talent has long
provided America with a global competitive advantage, and we must
continue to lead in this effort.

Today, the Departments of State and Homeland Security are announcing new
actions to advance predictability and clarity for pathways for
international STEM scholars, students, researchers, and experts to
contribute to innovation and job creation efforts across America. These
actions will allow international STEM talent to continue to make
meaningful contributions to America’s scholarly, research and
development, and innovation communities. 

These announcements build on the Biden Administration’s efforts to
remove barriers to legal immigration, such as under [Executive Order
14012, Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and
Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New
Americans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/02/executive-order-restoring-faith-in-our-legal-immigration-systems-and-strengthening-integration-and-inclusion-efforts-for-new-americans/),
and to promote educational exchange, such as under the recent [Joint
Statement of Principles in Support of International
Education](http://educationusa.state.gov/us-higher-education-professionals/us-government-resources-and-guidance/joint-statement)
issued by Secretaries Blinken and Cardona.

Today’s agency announcements include:

-   The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural
    Affairs (ECA) is announcing an “[Early Career STEM Research
    Initiative](https://j1visa.state.gov/programs/early-career-stem-research-initiative),”
    to facilitate non-immigrant BridgeUSA exchange visitors coming to
    the United States to engage in STEM research through research,
    training or educational exchange visitor programs with host
    organizations, including businesses. ECA is also announcing [new
    guidance that will facilitate additional academic
    training](https://j1visa.state.gov/opportunity-for-academic-training-extensions-for-j-1-college-and-university-students-in-stem-fields/)
    for undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields on the J-1
    visa for periods of up to 36 months.

-   Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas is announcing
    that 22 new fields of study are now included in the STEM Optional
    Practical Training (OPT) program through the Student and Exchange
    Visitor Program (SEVP). The program permits F-1 students earning
    Bachelors, Masters, and Doctorates in certain STEM fields to remain
    in the United States for up to 36 months to complete Optional
    Practical Training after earning their degrees. Information on the
    new fields of study will be communicated to schools and students in
    a forthcoming Federal Register notice. The added fields of study are
    primarily new multidisciplinary or emerging fields, and are critical
    in attracting talent to support U.S. economic growth and
    technological competitiveness.
-   DHS is issuing an update to its policy manual related to
    “extraordinary ability” (O-1A) nonimmigrant status regarding what
    evidence may satisfy the O-1A evidentiary criteria.

<!-- -->

-   O-1A nonimmigrant status is available to persons of extraordinary
    ability in the fields of science, business, education, or athletics.
    In this update, DHS is clarifying how it determines eligibility for
    immigrants of extraordinary abilities, such as PHD holders, in the
    science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) fields.
-   The new update provides examples of evidence that may satisfy the
    O-1A evidentiary criteria and discusses considerations that are
    relevant to evaluating such evidence, with a focus on the highly
    technical nature of STEM fields and the complexity of the evidence
    often submitted.
-   The update also emphasizes that, if a petitioner demonstrates that a
    particular criterion does not readily apply to their occupation,
    they may submit evidence that is of comparable significance to that
    criterion to establish sustained acclaim and recognition.
    Additionally, it provides examples of possible comparable evidence
    that may be submitted in support of petitions for beneficiaries
    working in STEM fields.
-   With respect to immigration, DHS is issuing an update to its policy
    manual on how U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a
    DHS component, adjudicates national interest waivers for certain
    immigrants with exceptional abilities in their field of work.
    -   The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides that an
        employer can file an immigrant petition for a person of
        exceptional ability or a member of the professions with an
        advanced degree. The INA provides that USCIS may waive a job
        offer requirement, allowing immigrants whose work is in the
        national interest to petition for themselves, without an
        employer.
    -   The USCIS policy update clarifies how the national interest
        waiver can be used for persons with advanced degrees in STEM
        fields and entrepreneurs, as well as the significance of letters
        from governmental and quasi-governmental entities. This update
        will promote efficient and effective benefit processing as USCIS
        reviews requests for national interest waivers. This effort is
        consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration’s priorities to
        restore faith in the legal immigration system.
