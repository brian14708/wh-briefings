title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Hostage Situation at Congregation Beth\
  \ Israel in Colleyville,\_Texas"

Thanks to the courageous work of state, local and federal law
enforcement, four Americans who were held hostage at a Texas synagogue
will soon be home with their families. I am grateful to the tireless
work of law enforcement at all levels who acted cooperatively and
fearlessly to rescue the hostages. We are sending love and strength to
the members of Congregation Beth Israel, Colleyville, and the Jewish
community.

There is more we will learn in the days ahead about the motivations of
the hostage taker. But let me be clear to anyone who intends to spread
hate—we will stand against antisemitism and against the rise of
extremism in this country. That is who we are, and tonight, the men and
women of law enforcement made us all proud.
