title: "Statement by President\_Biden on 5G\_Agreement"
---
 
I want to thank Verizon and AT&T for agreeing to delay 5G deployment
around key airports and to continue working with the Department of
Transportation on safe 5G deployment at this limited set of locations.
This agreement will avoid potentially devastating disruptions to
passenger travel, cargo operations, and our economic recovery, while
allowing more than 90 percent of wireless tower deployment to occur as
scheduled. This agreement protects flight safety and allows aviation
operations to continue without significant disruption and will bring
more high-speed internet options to millions of Americans. Expanding 5G
and promoting competition in internet service are critical priorities of
mine, and tomorrow will be a massive step in the right direction. My
team has been engaging non-stop with the wireless carriers, airlines,
and aviation equipment manufacturers to chart a path forward for 5G
deployment and aviation to safely co-exist â€“ and, at my direction, they
will continue to do so until we close the remaining gap and reach a
permanent, workable solution around these key airports.
