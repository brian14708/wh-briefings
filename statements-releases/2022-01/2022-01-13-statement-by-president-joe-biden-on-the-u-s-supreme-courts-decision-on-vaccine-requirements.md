title: "Statement by President Joe Biden On the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Decision\
  \ on Vaccine Requirements"
---
 
My administration began to institute vaccination requirements last July,
when after months of making vaccinations free and widely available, 90
million Americans were still unvaccinated. Today, that number is down to
under 35 million. These vaccine requirements applied to members of the
Armed Forces, federal workers and contractors, health care workers, and
employees in large firms. Had my administration not put vaccination
requirements in place, we would be now experiencing a higher death toll
from COVID-19 and even more hospitalizations. 

Today’s decision by the Supreme Court to uphold the requirement for
health care workers will save lives:  the lives of patients who seek
care in medical facilities, as well as the lives of doctors, nurses, and
others who work there. It will cover 10.4 million health care workers at
76,000 medical facilities. We will enforce it.

At the same time, I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to
block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large
businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law. This
emergency standard allowed employers to require vaccinations or to
permit workers to refuse to be vaccinated, so long as they were tested
once a week and wore a mask at work: a very modest burden.    
   
As a result of the Court’s decision, it is now up to States and
individual employers to determine whether to make their workplaces as
safe as possible for employees, and whether their businesses will be
safe for consumers during this pandemic by requiring employees to take
the simple and effective step of getting vaccinated. The Court has ruled
that my administration cannot use the authority granted to it by
Congress to require this measure, but that does not stop me from using
my voice as President to advocate for employers to do the right thing to
protect Americans’ health and economy. I call on business leaders to
immediately join those who have already stepped up – including one third
of Fortune 100 companies – and institute vaccination requirements to
protect their workers, customers, and communities. 

We have to keep working together if we want to save lives, keep people
working, and put this pandemic behind us.
