title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden and Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the\
  \ 49th Anniversary of Roe v.\_Wade"
---
 
The constitutional right established in *Roe v. Wade* nearly 50 years
ago today is under assault as never before. It is a right we believe
should be codified into law, and we pledge to defend it with every tool
we possess. We are deeply committed to protecting access to health care,
including reproductive health care—and to ensuring that this country is
not pushed backwards on women’s equality.

In recent years, we have seen efforts to restrict access to reproductive
health care increase at an alarming rate. In Texas, Mississippi, and
many other states around the country, access to reproductive health care
is under attack. These state restrictions constrain the freedom of all
women. And they are particularly devastating for those who have fewer
options and fewer resources, such as those in underserved communities,
including communities of color and many in rural areas.

The Biden-Harris Administration strongly supports efforts to codify
*Roe,* and we will continue to work with Congress on the Women’s Health
Protection Act. All people deserve access to reproductive health care
regardless of their gender, income, race, zip code, health insurance
status, immigration status, disability, or sexual orientation. And the
continued defense of this constitutional right is essential to our
health, safety, and progress as a nation.

We must ensure that our daughters and granddaughters have the same
fundamental rights that their mothers and grandmothers fought for and
won on this day, 49 years ago—including leaders like the late Sarah
Weddington, whose successful arguments before the Supreme Court led to
the landmark *Roe v. Wade* decision in 1973.

At this pivotal moment, we recommit to strengthening access to critical
reproductive health care, defending the constitutional right established
by *Roe*, and protecting the freedom of all people to build their own
future.
