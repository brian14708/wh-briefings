title: "Fact Sheet: The New Small Business Boom Under the Biden-\u2060Harris\_Administration"
---
 
Since day one in office, President Biden has focused on providing
America’s small businesses with the tools and resources they need to
reopen, rehire, and build back better. To-date, the Biden-Harris
Administration has distributed more than $400 billion in critical relief
to more than 6 million small businesses.

President Biden’s efforts have not only helped millions of Main Street
businesses keep their lights on and employees on payroll, they have
enabled a remarkable rebound in small business activity, with small
business demand for labor and inventories near record highs. According
to a leading survey of small business owners, the share of small
businesses planning to create new jobs in the next three months is
higher than it ever was at any point during the previous Administration.
Another recent survey of small business owners found that 71 percent are
optimistic about their own performance in 2022, up from 63 percent one
year ago. The broader economic recovery – one of the fastest on record –
has also helped spur a surge in entrepreneurship. **Americans are
applying to start new businesses at a record rate, up about 30 percent
compared to before the pandemic.**

**The historically high level of new business applications has taken
place amidst the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic bottom-up
approach to economic recovery.** Soon after taking office, the
Biden-Harris Administration enacted the American Rescue Plan (ARP),
which provided direct relief to families and small businesses and
supported the vaccination of more than 200 million Americans. Through
the combination of ARP investments and existing emergency relief
programs, the Biden-Harris Administration distributed more than $400
billion in critical relief to more than 6 million small businesses. The
ARP also provided thousands of entrepreneurs with the personal and
financial security to launch their own business.  This support included
$1,400 per-person Economic Impact Payments, expanded Child Tax Credit
payments of up to $300 per child per month, Affordable Care Act credits
and COBRA premium support to ensure health care coverage remained
available, and an expansion of the Employer Retention Credit, including
expanding eligibility to recent startups. 

**Despite the historic progress made to-date, the Biden-Harris
Administration remains committed to helping America’s new small
businesses grow, create jobs, and provide the essential goods and
services our communities depend on.** Specifically, the Biden-Harris
Administration is:

-   **Expanding access to low cost loans and investments.** The Treasury
    Department is working with all states and territories plus 400
    Tribal governments on standing up small business lending and
    investment programs as part of the $10 billion State Small Business
    Credit Initiative (SSBCI) established through the ARP. and By this
    summer, the first wave of programs will launch, unlocking billions
    of dollars in new lending and investment capital for small
    businesses in big cities and small towns all across America. Small
    businesses can also continue to access the Small Business
    Administration’s (SBA) traditional 7a, 504, and microloan programs,
    which collectively reached record high loan volume in Fiscal Year
    2021 [by providing $44.8 billion through more than 61,000
    loans](https://www.sba.gov/article/2021/oct/29/sba-administrator-guzman-announces-448-billion-through-signature-lending-programs).
-   **Increasing access to billions of dollars in federal contracts for
    small businesses.** Last year, the Biden-Harris Administration
    [announced its
    strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-reforms-to-increase-equity-and-level-the-playing-field-for-underserved-small-business-owners/)
    for increasing the share of federal procurement dollars that go to
    socially disadvantaged businesses by 50% by 2025.  President Biden’s
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also includes a historic procurement
    effort designed to support small businesses and tackle long standing
    inequities in the contracting system. Among other things, the
    legislation directs DOT to attempt to award more than $37 billion in
    federal contracts to small disadvantaged business contractors.
-   **Helping small businesses hire new employees and reach new
    customers by providing universal broadband**.  Broadband internet is
    necessary for Americans to do their jobs and increasingly important
    for small business owners all across America. President Biden’s
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will invest $65 billion in broadband
    infrastructure, helping ensure that every American has access to
    reliable high-speed internet and creating new opportunities for
    small businesses nationwide.
-   **Connecting small businesses to the resources they need to grow and
    succeed.** The SBA Community Navigator program launched last year
    and is deploying trusted messengers in underrepresented communities
    to offer small businesses a broad array of support services. The
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made permanent the Minority Business
    Development Agency (MBDA), elevated its Director to Under Secretary
    of Commerce, and gave the agency more tools and authority.  SBA also
    recently launched the [Small Business Digital
    Alliance](https://www.smallbusinessdigitalalliance.com/), a
    public-private partnership to offer small businesses with critical
    tech resources to start and expand their e-commerce business, with
    an eye toward scaling for success.
