title: "Statement from President\_Biden on United Nations Security Council\_Meeting"
---
 
Today in the United Nations Security Council, the United States
presented in detail the full nature of Russia’s threat to Ukraine’s
sovereignty and territorial integrity. And we made clear to the
international community the full implications of that threat — not just
for Ukraine, but for core tenets of the UN Charter and the modern
international order.  

If Russia is sincere about addressing our respective security concerns
through dialogue, the United States and our Allies and partners will
continue to engage in good faith.  If instead Russia chooses to walk
away from diplomacy and attack Ukraine, Russia will bear the
responsibility, and it will face swift and severe consequences.  

The United States and our Allies and partners continue to prepare for
every scenario. The world must be clear-eyed about the actions Russia is
threatening and ready to respond to the risks those actions present to
all of us. Today’s Security Council meeting is a critical step in
rallying the world to speak out in one voice:  rejecting the use of
force, calling for military de-escalation, supporting diplomacy as the
best path forward, and demanding accountability from every member state
to refrain from military aggression against its neighbors.
