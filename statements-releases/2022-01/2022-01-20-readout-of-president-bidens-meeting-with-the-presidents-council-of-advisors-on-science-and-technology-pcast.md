title: "Readout of President Biden\u2019s Meeting with the President\u2019s Council\
  \ of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST)"
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden convened a meeting of the President’s Council
of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) – a group of renowned
experts from outside of the Federal government who advise the president
on key issues of science, technology, and innovation – to discuss their
ongoing work to help the Administration deliver on its science and
technology priorities and drive American innovation.

The President highlighted the role of science-based decision making in
his efforts to tackle the challenges of the moment, including fighting
the pandemic, implementing bold climate solutions, and working to
harness the power of game-changing energy technologies. He also
emphasized the Administration’s steadfast commitment to upholding
scientific integrity to help restore the American people’s trust in
government.

The President’s Science Advisor and PCAST Co-Chair Eric Lander noted
that it was fitting that the meeting coincided with the one-year
anniversary of President Biden taking office given the President’s
passion and commitment to using science and technology as a driver to
improve the lives of all Americans.

PCAST Co-Chairs Frances Arnold and Maria Zuber outlined four key areas
of update for the President, including 1) how our Nation can use new
scientific advances to assess and protect against physical and financial
risks from climate change; 2) how to use science and technology to
strengthen the Nation’s ability to detect, track, and fight wildfires;
3) what might be needed to reimagine the American public health system
to address decades-old challenges laid bare by the pandemic; and 4) what
steps are necessary to ensure America’s continued global leadership in
science and technology innovation in the 21st century.

PCAST members detailed the group’s work to explore each of the critical
areas outlined by the co-chairs and provided subject matter expertise on
the path forward.

PCAST’s next public virtual meeting will be held on March 24-25, 2022.
