**New Actions Advance Offshore Wind, Leverage Public Lands for Clean
Energy, and Build the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Transmission
Lines**

When President Biden came into office nearly a year ago, he pulled every
lever to position America to scale up clean energy that creates
good-paying, union jobs and lowers energy bills for consumers. Since
then, the Biden-Harris Administration has readied offshore areas to
harness power from wind, approved new solar projects on public lands,
and passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build thousands of miles
of transmission lines that deliver clean energy.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is making major leaps forward on
wind, solar, transmission, and other clean energy projects to create
high-quality jobs and deliver affordable, carbon pollution-free
electricity across the country. Seven federal agencies are announcing
clean energy projects and plans that demonstrate the Administration’s
unwavering commitment to creating cleaner and cheaper energy, and the
actions showcase President Biden’s unprecedented coordination activating
the entire government to fight climate change, produce good-paying,
union jobs, and accelerate America’s clean energy economy.  
  
These actions include:

-   The Department of the Interior is **holding a record-breaking
    offshore wind lease sale, with the most lease areas ever
    offered, **in the New York Bight off the coasts of New York and New
    Jersey. The upcoming lease sale is projected to generate up to 7
    gigawatts (GW) of clean energy, power two million homes, and create
    thousands of jobs in manufacturing, construction, operations,
    maintenance, and service industries in nearby communities. The sale
    includes innovative lease provisions that will lead to offshore wind
    projects being built with union labor and Made in America materials.
    Working together, New York, New Jersey and the federal government
    will build on these new lease stipulations through a new
    federal-state partnership that will ensure local residents—including
    underserved communities—benefit from new developments.
-   A number of agencies are working together to drive the rapid
    build-up of offshore wind—a brand new U.S. clean energy industry
    that can create nearly 80,000 good-paying jobs by 2030. For example,
    the Department of Transportation recently announced **port
    investments** to help develop areas that will be used to build and
    stage offshore wind turbine components, and efforts are underway
    across the Departments of Commerce, the Interior, and Energy to
    promote biodiversity and cooperative ocean use and support
    innovation across the supply chain.
-   The Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, and
    the Environmental Protection Agency are forming a new collaboration
    to** improve the efficiency and effectiveness of reviews of clean
    energy projects on public lands**, in order to expand solar, onshore
    wind, and geothermal energy, building on the Department of the
    Interior’s approvals over the past year of 18 onshore projects that
    will deliver 4.175 GW of clean energy.
-   The Department of Energy is** launching a new Building a Better Grid
    initiative to accelerate the deployment of new transmission
    lines—**as enabled by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law**—**to
    connect more Americans to cleaner, cheaper energy. This transmission
    buildout will make our grid more reliable and resilient in the face
    of intensifying extreme weather and is critical to achieving the
    President’s goal of 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.
-   To ensure that these benefits reach all Americans, the Department of
    Agriculture is creating a new pilot program to **support clean
    energy in underserved rural communities** and the Department of
    Commerce is awarding American Rescue Plan funds to support regional
    coalitions to grow new industry clusters focused on clean energy
    deployment and job training. And the release of a new report from
    the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that the
    Administration’s SolarAPP+ tool is reducing permitting times for
    residential installations to less than one day, helping local
    governments fast-track rooftop solar. 

Today’s announcements **build on a year of unprecedented progress on
clean energy deployment. **Before President Biden took office, projects
were stalled and agencies were hollowed out. But during his first week,
the President issued an Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis
at Home and Abroad, which mobilized the entire federal government to
activate and deploy clean energy so that Americans can reap the immense
climate and economic benefits of the clean energy future.  
  
The Administration continues to use every tool available to deploy clean
energy at a record pace. But to fully seize the opportunities of a clean
energy economy, President Biden is pressing forward on passing
the** Build Back Better Act**. The historic legislation will amount to
the nation’s largest investment in combatting climate change, lowering
energy costs for working families, and building a clean energy future.
It will support domestic manufacturing of wind turbines, solar panels,
and other clean technologies; invest in workforce development programs
to launch careers in these growing industries; and provide a historic
set of clean energy tax credits that are more powerful and accessible.
With these investments, the U.S. will lead the world on innovative
climate solutions and save the average American family hundreds of
dollars each year in energy costs.  
  
As work continues to pass the Build Back Better Act, today’s
announcements further the Administration’s ongoing commitment to
powering our economy with clean American energy:  
  
**ADVANCING OFFSHORE WIND TO CREATE JOBS**  
  
To deploy offshore wind at the speed and scale necessary to achieve our
climate goals and create tens of thousands of jobs, the Administration
is announcing:

-   **Record-Breaking Lease Sale in the New York Bight.** Last year, the
    Administration [established](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-jumpstarts-offshore-wind-energy-projects-to-create-jobs/) a
    Wind Energy Area in the New York Bight off the coasts of New York
    and New Jersey. Today, the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of
    Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is announcing the Final Sale Notice
    of six commercial lease areas—the most ever offered—with the
    potential to generate 5.6 to 7 GW of clean energy across 488,201
    acres. Innovative leasing provisions will encourage winning bidders
    to enter into Project Labor Agreements (PLA) that support union
    jobs. They also will financially incentivize lessees to utilize wind
    turbine blades, towers, and cables made in America. To promote
    meaningful stakeholder engagement, lessees must identify any Tribes,
    ocean users, underserved communities, and others potentially
    affected by projects and report on engagement activities.  
-   **New State-Federal Partnership.** Today, Interior Secretary Deb
    Haaland joined New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New Jersey
    Governor Phil Murphy to celebrate progress in the New York Bight and
    announce a new collaboration between BOEM, New York, and New Jersey
    on offshore wind with a focus on job creation and environmental
    justice. Through a new shared vision and working group, these
    partners will work together on strengthening regional supply chains
    and delivering benefits to underserved communities.  
     
-   **DOT Port Investments for Manufacturing and Staging Hubs.** The
    Department of Transportation (DOT) recently awarded Port
    Infrastructure Development Program Grants to two hubs that will
    strengthen the U.S. offshore wind supply chain. In Virginia,
    the **Portsmouth Marine Terminal** will receive $20 million to
    construct staging and storage areas for wind turbine
    components—supporting union jobs for dockworkers, crane operators,
    and building trades members. In New York, the **Port of
    Albany** will receive $29.5 million for the Offshore Wind Tower
    Manufacturing Port Project, which will develop vacant areas along
    the Hudson River for a first-of-its-kind U.S. facility for
    fabrication and assembly of offshore wind towers, creating hundreds
    of jobs in construction, manufacturing, and maritime activities. DOT
    announced in March 2021 that this discretionary port funding would
    be available to support offshore wind activities, and that climate
    and environmental justice considerations would factor into the
    review process. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law significantly
    increases funding for the Port Infrastructure Development Program
    Grants to expand federal investments in ports.

-   **Funding for Innovative Supply Chain and Maintenance
    Projects. **The National Offshore Wind Research and Development
    Consortium is awarding over $3 million to six offshore wind R&D
    projects, bringing total investment through NOWRDC over the past
    year to $14 million. The competitive awards will fund three new
    supply chain projects to facilitate U.S. manufacturing, ensure
    quality component production, and simplify transportation of major
    wind plant components. Three additional projects will support asset
    monitoring and inspection to reduce operational costs for offshore
    wind farms. The NOWRDC was established in 2018 with a $20.5 million
    Department of Energy (DOE) investment and matching funds from the
    New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA),
    with follow-on contributions from state agencies in Maryland,
    Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine, and New Jersey—all resulting in
    approximately $48 million in committed funds.  
     
-   **NOAA-BOEM Memorandum of Understanding. **The Commerce Department’s
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and BOEM are
    entering an interagency agreement to collaboratively advance
    offshore wind energy while protecting biodiversity and promoting
    cooperative ocean use. This partnership underscores NOAA and BOEM’s
    commitment to leverage their resources and expertise to responsibly
    deploy 30 GW by 2030 in a way that protects environmental quality,
    creates jobs, and advances environmental justice.  
     
-   **DOE Report Underscoring Need for Continued Offshore Wind
    Investment. **The Department of Energy will be issuing a report on
    “Offshore Wind Energy Strategies: Regional and National Strategies
    to Maximize the Effectiveness, Reliability, and Sustainability of
    U.S. Offshore Wind Energy Development and Operation.” It outlines
    five strategic priorities for tapping into the enormous potential
    for growth and job creation in the offshore wind industry: expanding
    targeted federal incentives, reducing costs through innovation,
    improving siting and permitting processes, investing in supply chain
    development, and facilitating grid integration of offshore wind
    projects. The President’s Build Back Better Act would advance these
    priorities with expanded investment and production tax credits for
    offshore wind deployment, advanced manufacturing credits to
    incentivize Made in America wind turbine components, and investments
    across transmission planning, port infrastructure, and improved
    leasing and permitting processes.  
      
    These actions follow a year of interagency collaboration to
    jumpstart the U.S. offshore wind industry—in 2021, the
    Administration:

-   Launched an offshore wind strategy to achieve a [new national target
    of deploying 30 GW by
    2030](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-jumpstarts-offshore-wind-energy-projects-to-create-jobs/) and
    create jobs up and down the supply chain, from factories in the
    heartland to shipyards on the coasts.
-   Approved the nation’s first two commercial-scale offshore wind
    projects, [Vineyard
    Wind](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-first-major-offshore-wind-project-us-waters) 1
    and [South Fork
    Wind](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-approves-second-major-offshore-wind-project-us-federal-waters),
    which will be built by a highly skilled, well-paid union workforce. 
-   Developed
    a [roadmap](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-outlines-ambitious-offshore-wind-leasing-strategy) for
    holding seven offshore wind lease sales and completing reviews of 16
    multi-billion dollar offshore wind projects—representing 22 GW of
    clean energy—by 2025.

Moving ahead in 2022, BOEM will conduct reviews of wind energy areas
offshore northern California (Humboldt) and central California (Morro
Bay); explore new potential Wind Energy Areas in the Gulf of Mexico and
off the coasts of Oregon and the central Atlantic; and advance lease
sales in the Carolina Long Bay and offshore California.  
  
**FAST-TRACKING CLEAN ENERGY ONSHORE**

America’s public lands have substantial potential to support solar,
wind, and geothermal energy projects. As part of ongoing efforts to
advance these projects in an environmentally sound way and in close
collaboration with community stakeholders, the Administration is
announcing:

-   **Five-Agency Collaboration to Expedite Reviews.** The Departments
    of the Interior, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, and the Environmental
    Protection Agency have issued a new Memorandum of Understanding to
    improve federal agency coordination and prioritize reviews for
    renewable energy projects located on public lands managed by the
    Interior and Agriculture Departments. This collaboration will
    expedite decision-making by establishing interagency coordination
    teams with qualified staff to facilitate environmental reviews and
    other federal reviews.  
     
-   **Renewable Energy Coordination Offices.** The Department of the
    Interior is developing plans for new Renewable Energy Coordination
    Offices (RECOs), authorized by the Energy Act of 2020. The RECOs
    will realign Bureau of Land Management resources to consolidate
    renewable energy work, and support collaboration on public lands
    renewable energy project permitting across Interior and other
    federal agencies.  
     
-   **Major Progress toward 25 GW by 2025. **Since President Biden took
    office, the Administration has approved 18 onshore projects totaling
    4.175 GW (including eight located on public lands and ten with
    interconnection lines on public lands) and initiated processing of
    another 54 priority projects with the potential to add at least 27.5
    GW of clean energy. Most recently, the Bureau of Land
    Management [approved](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-advances-three-solar-projects-california-marking-significant) the
    Arica and Victory Pass solar projects in California, which will
    provide up to 465 megawatts of electricity with up to 400 megawatts
    of battery storage. With today’s actions, the Administration will
    continue advancing toward the goal of permitting 25 GW of solar,
    onshore wind, and geothermal energy on public lands by 2025.

**BUILDING CLEAN TRANSMISSION LINES**

The President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is the largest-ever
investment in America’s power grid, including funding to build out
thousands of miles of new transmission lines that are critical to
unlocking clean energy resources and providing American homes, schools,
and businesses with electricity that is more affordable and reliable in
the face of extreme weather, wildfires, and other disasters. 

To harness the new funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, today
the Department of Energy is announcing a coordinated transmission
deployment program, which will catalyze nationwide buildout of
long-distance, high-voltage transmission lines. As outlined in a new
Notice of Intent, the pillars of the **“Building a Better
Grid”** initiative are:

-   **Financing transmission lines and other grid upgrades, **including
    through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s new $2.5 billion
    Transmission Facilitation Program, a revolving fund for new,
    replacement, or upgraded transmission lines; $3 billion expansion of
    the Smart Grid Investment Grant Program, focused on advanced
    technologies that increase capacity and enhance flexibility of the
    existing grid; and more than $10 billion in grants for states,
    Tribes, and utilities to enhance grid resilience and prevent power
    outages. DOE will also leverage existing financing, including the
    $3.25 billion Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) Transmission
    Infrastructure Program, which facilitates deployment of renewable
    energy in WAPA’s 15-state service territory, and a number of loan
    guarantee programs through the Loan Programs Office.  
-   **Strengthening coordination with state and local governments,
    Tribal nations, and other stakeholders**, including through
    participation in regional convenings with independent system
    operators (ISOs), regional transmission organizations (RTOs), state
    regulatory commissions, utilities, and others.
-   **Modernizing transmission planning** to drive investment to the
    highest-need projects, including through a new National Transmission
    Planning Study, National Transmission Needs Study, Offshore Wind
    Transmission Study, and expanded technical assistance to help states
    and regions with policy implementation.
-   **Improving permitting processes**, in coordination with the
    Infrastructure Implementation Task Force and other federal
    initiatives, including by helping developers provide early
    information to permitting agencies; using public-private
    partnerships to advance new transmission lines and system upgrades;
    and designating National Corridors in areas with transmission
    capacity constraints that harm consumers.
-   **Supporting research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) **of
    next-generation transmission technology, including through
    collaborations with the National Laboratories and industry partners.

Last year, the Administration laid the foundation for these efforts by
revitalizing Department of Energy transmission financing assistance
programs and through Department of Transportation actions to help states
host transmission lines along public highways and other transportation
rights-of-way.  
**DELIVERING BENEFITS TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY**  
  
The Administration has prioritized clean energy deployment in rural
communities, [providing
financing](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/09/09/usda-invests-464-million-renewable-energy-infrastructure-help-rural) for
agricultural producers and rural small businesses to install solar
arrays and other clean energy infrastructure and for grid upgrades
across rural areas. To build on these investments, the Department of
Agriculture is **creating a new Rural Energy Pilot Program** with $10
million in available grants for rural communities that are particularly
underserved to deploy community-scale clean energy technologies,
innovations, and solutions. This upcoming pilot program will also help
economically distressed rural communities conduct community energy
planning to advance local goals for clean, affordable, and reliable
power.  
  
Additionally, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan is driving historic
economic recovery from the pandemic—including by helping communities
create new jobs and industries in clean energy. The Department of
Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) [recently
announced](https://eda.gov/files/arpa/build-back-better/finalists/BBBRC-Finalist-Fact-Sheet.pdf) the
finalists for Phase 1 of the **Build Back Better Regional Challenge**,
which uses American Rescue Plan funds to support regional industry
clusters that will promote equitable economic growth and workforce
development. The finalists include 14 regional coalitions focused on
clean energy and other climate-related industries, which will receive a
combined $7 million in planning grants and compete to win awards of $25
million to $100 million for implementation. Among these finalists are
projects to reuse abandoned mine lands for solar, wind, and geothermal
energy generation; utilize offshore wind as a power source for hydrogen
production in industrial areas; and support clean energy job training,
entrepreneurship, and innovation in areas historically dependent on
fossil fuel economies.  
  
The Administration is also helping local governments speed up approvals
for rooftop solar in order to unlock economic and health benefits for
their communities. In July 2021, the Department of Energy launched the
Solar Automated Permit Processing (SolarAPP+) tool, an online platform
that enables jurisdictions to rapidly approve residential solar
installation permits. Now, a [new
report](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81603.pdf) from the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that in a pilot conducted in Arizona
and California, **the SolarAPP+ tool reduced the average permit review
time to less than one day.** More than 125 localities have already
signed up to consider using SolarAPP+, and the Department of Energy is
continuing to recruit additional communities across the country.
