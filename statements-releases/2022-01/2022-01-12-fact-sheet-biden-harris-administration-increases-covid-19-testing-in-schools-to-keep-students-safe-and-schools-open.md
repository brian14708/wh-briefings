title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Increases COVID-\u206019 Testing\
  \ in Schools to Keep Students Safe and Schools\_Open"
---
 
Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken every step
available to keep schools safely open for full-time, in-person
instruction. These efforts have resulted in 96% of schools open
in-person in January 2022, up from 46% of schools in January 2021.
Students have sacrificed so much over the course of the pandemic, and
the President has been clear in his words and his actions that his
Administration will do all that it can to keep schools safely open for
all students.  
  
Today the Biden-Harris Administration is doubling down on our commitment
to keeping all schools safely open for full-time in-person learning by
taking new action to increase access to COVID-19 testing in schools.
Through these new initiatives, the Administration will increase the
number of COVID-19 tests available to schools by 10 million per month.
These additional tests will help schools safely remain open and
implement screening testing and test to stay programs. With the
additional ten million tests per month, we will make available to
schools more than double the volume of testing that took place in
schools across the nation in November 2021 (the most recent data
available).  
  
We know how to keep students and staff safely in school—including
through vaccinations and boosters, implementing universal indoor
masking, maintaining physical distancing, improving ventilation, and
performing COVID-19 screening testing. Over the past year, the
Biden-Harris Administration has provided historic funding and extensive
resources to states and school districts across the country to make sure
schools reopen and remain open – including $130 billion in the
Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief fund to safely reopen
schools and address students’ academic and mental health needs, and $10
billion in the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) cooperative
agreement to support COVID-19 testing for students and staff.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is increasing COVID-19 testing
for schools by:

-   **Sending 5 Million No-Cost Point-of-Care Tests Per Month to
    Schools.** The Administration will distribute 5 million free, rapid
    tests to schools each month to help K-12 schools stay open and to
    implement and sustain screening testing and test to stay programs in
    accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC). This new allocation builds on the CDC Epidemiology
    and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) program, which distributed $10 billion
    in resources to states to support COVID-19 testing in schools. CDC
    will work with states who can submit requests to receive additional
    tests for high-need school districts that can put these tests
    immediately to use. After states submit initial requests, the first
    shipments will be delivered later this month.  
-   **Providing 5 Million Additional Lab-Based PCR Tests for Free to
    Schools Per Month:** The Administration is making available lab
    capacity to support an additional 5 million PCR tests per month for
    schools to perform individual and pooled testing in classrooms
    nationwide. The additional testing will be delivered through the
    Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Operation Expanded
    Testing (ET) program, funded by the American Rescue Plan to provide
    free PCR testing at schools nationwide. Three federally funded
    regional providers offer testing materials, supplies, and lab
    results and reporting at no direct cost to recipients through four
    regional hubs. Schools can immediately gain access to this free
    lab-based testing.  
-   **Deploying Federal Surge Testing Units to Support Free Testing
    Access for Students, School Staff, and Families at Community Testing
    Sites.** HHS and FEMA are working with state, territorial, and
    tribal partners to address testing needs in communities and stand up
    federal testing sites. These surge testing sites are focused on
    ensuring hardest-hit and highest-risk communities have equitable
    access to free and convenient testing. Effective immediately, as the
    agencies review state, territorial, and tribal requests, they will
    consider how these sites can support the safe operations of K-12
    schools. Opportunities to support K-12 schools may include locating
    federal testing units on or near school grounds; establishing
    specific operating hours for students, their families, and school
    staff; or dedicating a specific portion of daily testing to school
    communities. By incorporating school needs, state leaders can more
    effectively build school testing into their requests and planning
    while surge test sites continue to provide robust access to
    communities with greatest need.  
-   **Connecting Schools with COVID-19 Testing Providers to Set Up
    School Testing Programs using American Rescue Plan Funds.** In
    addition to $10 billion for states to set up K-12 testing programs
    in the ELC program, the American Rescue Plan included $130 billion
    in the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief fund to
    safely reopen schools, which may be used to support school-based
    COVID-19 testing. To support schools that want to set up COVID-19
    testing programs, the Department of Education and CDC will work with
    states and outside organizations to help schools make connections to
    testing providers that are available in their state. This includes
    connecting local school districts with the testing providers
    contracted by their states to set up COVID-19 testing in school
    using ELC funding. While programs vary by state, these arrangements
    allow schools to access testing resources quickly and coordinated
    with statewide activities, including accessing test supply and
    administration. Schools should [contact their
    jurisdiction](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dpei/elc/covid-response/index.html)
    to join existing state efforts funded by ELC. CDC and ED will also
    engage school to help them learn how to set up testing programs and
    how they can use their American Rescue Plan funds to support them.  
-   **New Training, Resources, and Materials for Implementing Test to
    Stay in Schools.** Last month, CDC released guidance on “test to
    stay,” an approach that allows students to remain safely in the
    classroom during their quarantine period as long as they wear masks
    and test at least two times in the seven days following an exposure.
    Test to stay programs are an effective approach for identifying and
    containing infection at school, and help enable schools to minimize
    and avoid interruptions to in-person instruction. Later this week,
    CDC will release additional materials for schools on how to
    implement test to stay programs, including a school checklist and
    frequently asked questions and answers. Additionally, ED and CDC
    will continue to provide additional opportunities for states and
    school districts to learn about test to stay and how to effectively
    implement test to stay approaches in school.

The actions announced today builds on more than $10 billion in
investments that the Biden-Harris Administration has made in setting up
testing programs in K-12 schools. School districts can also take
advantage of the below resources immediately, as outlined in a letter
Secretary Cardona is sending this week to school officials demonstrating
available resources to support COVID-19 testing and urging them to get
started today. Supports also include:

-   **Free Community COVID-19 Testing Sites.** Schools may consider
    referring students, teachers, and staff to community-based testing
    sites that are supported by federal funding. HHS continues to work
    with pharmacies and retail companies to accelerate testing for more
    Americans in communities across the country.  
-   **Full Reimbursement for COVID-19 Testing Programs.** FEMA’s Public
    Assistance Program continues to provide federal funding to states,
    tribal nations, territories and localities to support COVID-19
    testing. This includes testing needed to safely open and operate
    public facilities, including K-12 schools. 100% reimbursement is
    available for schools and localities to set up diagnostic and
    screening testing programs. This provides an important way for
    communities to expand upon federal surge testing sites by providing
    resources for state and local leaders to open and operate additional
    testing sites in partnership with schools.
