  Group"

U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Israeli National
Security Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata convened a virtual meeting on January
26 of the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group (SCG).  They were
joined by senior representatives from their respective foreign policy,
defense, and intelligence agencies.  The two sides discussed upcoming
military training exercises, and welcomed American observation at a
recent aerial exercise conducted by the Israel Defense Forces.  The
officials also discussed significant regional developments since the
last SCG meeting in December, including advances in Iran’s nuclear
program.  Mr. Sullivan emphasized that while the United States remains
committed to diplomacy as the best means for preventing Iran from
obtaining a nuclear weapon, the United States is preparing alternative
options, in coordination with its partners, should diplomacy fail.  The
U.S. and Israeli officials agreed that they will remain in close
coordination on the full range of issues of mutual interest, and to
remain united against all threats to their national security.
