The House took an important step forward today in advancing legislation
that will make our supply chains stronger and reinvigorate the
innovation engine of our economy to outcompete China and the rest of the
world for decades to come.

The proposals laid out by the House and Senate represent the sort of
transformational investments in our industrial base and research and
development that helped power the United States to lead the global
economy in the 20th century and expand opportunity for middle class
families. They’ll help bring manufacturing jobs back to the United
States, and they’re squarely focused on easing the sort of supply chain
bottlenecks like semiconductors that have led to higher prices for the
middle class. Building on the historic investments in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law that I signed last year – and on signs of progress
like last week’s Intel announcement and today’s GM announcement –
comprehensive competitiveness legislation will power our economy to
create good-paying jobs for all Americans, no matter where you live or
whether you have a college degree, and will help tackle the climate
crisis.

I’m heartened by Congress’ bipartisan work so far, and its commitment to
quick action to get this to my desk as soon as possible. Together, we
have an opportunity to show China and the rest of the world that the
21st century will be the American century – forged by the ingenuity and
hard work of our innovators, workers, and businesses.
