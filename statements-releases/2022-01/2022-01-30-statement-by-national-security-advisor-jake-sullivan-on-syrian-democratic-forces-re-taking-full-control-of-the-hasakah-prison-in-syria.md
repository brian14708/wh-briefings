title: Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Syrian Democratic Forces
  Re-Taking Full Control of the Hasakah Prison in Syria
---
 
The United States commends the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who,
along with Coalition forces, completed operations to re-take full
control of the Hasakah prison in Syria.  Thanks to the bravery and
determination of the SDF, many of whom paid the ultimate sacrifice, 
ISIS failed in its efforts to conduct a large-scale prison break to
reconstitute its ranks.  The barbarity of ISIS’s actions during this
attack reaffirms why this group must be denied the ability to regenerate
and why nations must work together to address the thousands of ISIS
detainees in inadequate detention facilities.  ISIS remains a global
threat that requires a global solution. The United States remains
committed to working with our partners in Iraq and northeast Syria, and
the Defeat-ISIS Coalition, to counter the ISIS threat to our homelands.
