title: Biden Administration Releases Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Guidebook for State,
  Local, Tribal and Territorial Governments
---
 
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the White House released the [first edition of
its Bipartisan Infrastructure Law guidebook](https://www.build.gov/) to
help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments unlock the
benefits from the historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure.
The guidebook is a one-stop-shop on the law and contains the most
comprehensive information to date on the more than 375 programs included
in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.    
   
“This resource is a critical part of our extensive outreach to state,
local, tribal and territorial governments to ensure the people of
America can benefit from this once-in-a-generation investment,” said
**Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor & Infrastructure Implementation
Coordinator**. “Building a better America is a shared endeavor no one
can do alone, and investing infrastructure dollars will require
significant coordination between the federal government, cities, states,
Tribal governments, community members, and other key partners. Our
primary goal is to empower people across the country with information,
so they know what to apply for, who to contact, and how to get ready to
rebuild.”  
   
The guidebook is a roadmap to the funding available under the law, as
well as an explanatory document that shows direct federal spending at
the program level. To this end, the White House has also published an
accompanying data file that allows users to quickly sort programs funded
under the law by fields like agency, amount, recipient, or program name.
The guidebook contains 12 chapters grouping Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law programs by issue area. Each chapter contains a cover note
explaining how to get ready to receive this funding, and these memoranda
also identify additional resources our partners can and should utilize
to prepare, while the federal government gets ready to distribute
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds from new and existing programs.  
   
Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law more than
two months ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground
running to deliver results. The Administration has made key progress
towards implementing the largest long-term investment in America’s
infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. More than $80
billion has been allocated to states from formula and competitive
programs for roads and highways, bridges, ports, airports, and water
systems. Additional programs are being rolled out to deploy high speed
internet, electric vehicle chargers, energy grid upgrades and clean
energy demonstration projects.  
   
Earlier this month, the White House Infrastructure Implementation
Coordinator sent a [letter to
Governors](https://www.ibtta.org/sites/default/files/documents/Advocacy/GA053-Mitch%20Landrieu%20Letter%20to%20Governors%202022-0104.pdf)
recommending a series of preparatory actions, including appointing
infrastructure coordinators to manage the flow of funds to their states.
Yesterday, he addressed the National Governors Association winter
meeting.  Landrieu also [outlined steps
cities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BIL-Factsheet-Local-Competitive-Funding.pdf)
can take to prepare at the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and he has begun
deeper intergovernmental engagements with Tribal leaders, county
officials, and territorial leaders through outreach calls, listening
sessions, and Tribal consultations.  
   
The White House also recognizes state, local, Tribal and territorial
capacity may be strained due to the pandemic, historic underinvestment,
or just the challenges of day-to-day governance. A community’s lack of
capacity to apply for federal funds can create significant inequities –
and for many communities, this will be their first time applying for
funds from a suite of federal agencies. While many funding streams in
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law specifically set aside funds for
disadvantaged communities, the White House Infrastructure Implementation
Team will be engaging states, local governments, Tribal governments,
territories, federal agencies, philanthropies, and others to leverage
all available resources to quickly deliver the necessary technical
assistance and capacity to underserved communities. We intend to use
this guidebook is a critical tool to accelerate and amplify the impact
of this work.  
   
Future phases of the guidebook will update dates, key timelines for
program implementation, best practices, case studies, and links to key
resources developed by the White House and key partners.  
   
The historic $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild
crumbling road and bridges, replace lead pipes, help provide high-speed
internet to every family in America, and produce concrete results that
change people’s lives for the better. These results will create
good-paying, union jobs, support domestic manufacturing and supply
chains, and position the United States to win the 21st century. As the
Administration implements the law, it is following through on President
Biden’s commitment to ensure investments advance equity and racial
justice, reach communities all across the country – including rural
communities, communities of color, and disability communities – and
strengthen the nation’s resilience to climate change.
