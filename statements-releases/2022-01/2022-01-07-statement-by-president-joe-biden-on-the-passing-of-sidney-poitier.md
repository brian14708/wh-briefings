title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the Passing of Sidney Poitier
---
 
Jill and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Sidney Poitier, the
once-in-a-generation actor and advocate whose work carried so much
dignity, power, and grace that it changed the world on and off the big
screen.  
   
Sidney was more than just one of the finest actors in our history.  His
iconic performances in films like *The Defiant Ones*,* A Raisin in the
Sun*, *Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner*, and *In the Heat of the
Night* held a mirror up to America’s racial attitudes in the 1950s and
1960s.  With unflinching grandeur and poise — his singular warmth,
depth, and stature on-screen — Sidney helped open the hearts of millions
and changed the way America saw itself.  
   
The son of tomato farmers in the Bahamas, Sidney became the first Black
man to win the Academy Award for Best Actor — but the trail he blazed
extended leaps and bounds beyond his background or profession.  He
blazed a path for our Nation to follow, and a legacy that touches every
part of our society today.  
   
Jill and I send our love and prayers to Sidney’s wife, Joanna, his
daughters, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  
   
May God bless Sidney Poitier.
