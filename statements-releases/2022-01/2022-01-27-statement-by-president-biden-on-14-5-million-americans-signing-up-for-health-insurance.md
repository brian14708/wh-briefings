title: "Statement by President\_Biden on 14.5 Million Americans Signing up for Health\_\
  Insurance"

Health care should be a right, not a privilege, for all Americans. And
one year into my Administration, we are making that right a reality for
a record number of people—bringing down costs and increasing access for
families across the country.

Today, I am proud to announce that since November 1<sup>st</sup>, 14.5
million Americans have signed up for quality, affordable health
coverage, including more than 10 million who enrolled through
HealthCare.gov—the highest numbers ever produced in an open enrollment
period. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
shows that one in seven uninsured Americans got covered between the end
of 2020 and September 2021, with lower-income Americans gaining coverage
at the highest rate.

This did not happen by accident. The American Rescue Plan did more to
lower costs and expand access to health care than any action since the
passage of the Affordable Care Act. It made quality coverage more
affordable than ever—with families saving an average of $2,400 on their
annual premiums, and four out of five consumers finding quality coverage
for under $10 a month. As a result, millions of our fellow Americans
have now gained the security and peace of mind that dependable health
insurance brings.

For Americans who live in California, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York,
Rhode Island, and Washington, DC—places with their own health insurance
marketplaces—the opportunity to secure that peace of mind extends
through January 31<sup>st</sup>, and I urge you to take these last few
days to sign up for quality, affordable coverage. In the meantime, as
long as any American lies awake at night, wondering how they’re going to
pay their medical bills, my Administration will keep fighting to lower
costs and expand health coverage even more—including through my Build
Back Better agenda.
