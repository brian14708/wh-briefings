Today National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with both UAE
Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al Otaiba and Saudi Ambassador to
the United States Reema bint Bandar Al Saud to discuss ongoing Houthi
attacks against civilian targets in the UAE and Saudi Arabia that have
resulted in civilian casualties in both countries.  The Ambassadors and
Mr. Sullivan discussed joint efforts to hold the Houthis accountable. 
Mr. Sullivan reiterated the United States’ commitment to the security of
both the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where tens of thousands of American
citizens live and work.  He also welcomed their commitment to supporting
UN-led efforts to ultimately end the war in Yemen through a political
process, and underscored the importance of all parties to the conflict
abiding by their obligations under international humanitarian law.
