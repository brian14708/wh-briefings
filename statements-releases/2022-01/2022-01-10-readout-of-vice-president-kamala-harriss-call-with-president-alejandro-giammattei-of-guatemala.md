 Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with President Alejandro
Giammattei of Guatemala.  She reaffirmed the administration’s commitment
to working together with Guatemala on a broad agenda that includes the
root causes of migration, trafficking, economic development, and
anti-corruption.  The two leaders discussed ongoing bilateral
cooperation to disrupt human smuggling networks through the Human
Smuggling and Trafficking Task Force the Vice President announced during
her June 2021 visit to Guatemala.  The Vice President noted the
importance of holding corrupt actors accountable, highlighting that
corruption erodes public trust and undermines effective, accountable
governance.  The Vice President updated President Giammattei on U.S.
government efforts to generate economic growth through the Call to
Action she launched in May 2021, which has generated over $1.2 billion
dollars of private sector investment to the region.
