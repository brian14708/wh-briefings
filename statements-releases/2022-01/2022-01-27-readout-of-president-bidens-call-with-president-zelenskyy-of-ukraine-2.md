President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine. President Biden reaffirmed the readiness of the
United States along with its allies and partners to respond decisively
if Russia further invades Ukraine. He also underscored the commitment of
the United States to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
President Biden noted the United States has provided Ukraine with over
half a billion dollars in development and humanitarian assistance in the
last year, and is exploring additional macroeconomic support to help
Ukraine’s economy amidst pressure resulting from Russia’s military
build-up. President Biden made clear that despite the departure of
American family members of embassy personnel, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv,
remains open and fully operational. The leaders discussed coordinated
diplomatic efforts on European security, underscoring the principle of
“nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” President Biden relayed the
United States’ support for conflict resolution efforts in the Normandy
Format, expressing his hope that the sides’ recommitment on January 26
to the terms of the July 2020 ceasefire will help decrease tensions and
advance the implementation of the Minsk Agreements.
