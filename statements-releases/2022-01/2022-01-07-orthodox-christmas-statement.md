title: Orthodox Christmas Statement
---
 
Jill and I wish a joyful Christmas to Orthodox Christians in the United
States and around the world who are celebrating the birth of Jesus
Christ and the hope and blessings of this sacred season. Like so many
others over the past year, Orthodox Christians have demonstrated great
character and resilience, continuing to show love to their neighbors and
serve their communities during challenging times. We are keeping in our
hearts all those who have lost loved ones during this pandemic and for
whom this Christmas will be tinged with grief. Our prayer for all those
who are struggling is that you find strength from sorrow and purpose
from pain.

As we begin a new year with many Orthodox Christians around the world
continuing to face persecution and discrimination, we also reaffirm our
unwavering commitment to uphold the universal and inalienable right of
religious freedom.Â 

Christmas reminds us that a Child brought to us a light that shines in
the darkness, and that light can never be overcome. We join Orthodox
Christians in giving thanks for that promise and in praying for peace,
justice, freedom, and healing in the year to come.
