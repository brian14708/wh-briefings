  UAE

The United States strongly condemns today’s terrorist attack in Abu
Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, which killed three innocent
civilians. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for this attack, and
we will work with the UAE and international partners to hold them
accountable. Our commitment to the security of the UAE is unwavering and
we stand beside our Emirati partners against all threats to their
territory.
