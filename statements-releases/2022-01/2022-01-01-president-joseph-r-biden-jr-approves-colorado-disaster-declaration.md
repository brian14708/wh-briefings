title: President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Colorado Disaster Declaration
---
 
Yesterday, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Colorado and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by wildfires and
straight-line winds beginning on December 30, 2021, and continuing.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in Boulder County.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to State and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the Boulder County.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Nancy M. Casper as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
counties can begin applying for assistance tomorrow by registering
online at <http://www.DisasterAssistance.gov> or by calling
