President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will meet virtually with Prime Minister
Kishida Fumio of Japan on Friday, January 21 to further deepen ties
between our governments, economies, and our people. The meeting will
highlight the strength of the U.S.-Japan Alliance, which is the
cornerstone of peace, security, and stability in the Indo-Pacific and
around the world. President Biden looks forward to working with Prime
Minister Kishida to advance our shared vision for a free and open
Indo-Pacific, and to expand our close cooperation on critical issues
like combatting COVID-19, addressing the climate crisis, and partnering
on new and emerging technologies, including through the Quad.
