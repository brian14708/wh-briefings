President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine. President Biden made clear that the United States
and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further
invades Ukraine. The leaders expressed support for diplomatic efforts,
starting next week with the bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue, at
NATO through the NATO-Russia Council, and at the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe. President Biden underscored the
commitment of the United States and its allies and partners to the
principle of “nothing about you without you.” He reaffirmed the United
States’ commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
He also expressed support for confidence-building measures to
de-escalate tensions in Donbas and active diplomacy to advance the
implementation of the Minsk Agreements, in support of the Normandy
Format.
