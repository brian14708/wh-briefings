This morning, we are grateful that four people held hostage in a
synagogue in Colleyville, Texas are safe and going home to their
families. We thank the brave men and women in federal, state, and local
law enforcement, and we stand in solidarity with the Congregation Beth
Israel community and the entire Jewish community. While we will learn
more about the hostage taker’s motivation, we know this: what happened
yesterday at Congregation Beth Israel is a reminder that we must speak
up and combat antisemitism and hate wherever it exists. Everyone has a
right to pray, work, study, and spend time with loved ones not as the
other – but as us.
