title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on $15 Minimum Wage for Federal Workers\
  \ and Contractors Going into\_Effect"
---
 
A job is about more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. When I was
running for president, I said it was past time to increase the federal
minimum wage to $15 an hour. Last year, I made a down payment on that
pledge with Executive Orders directing my Administration to work toward
ensuring that [employees working on federal
contracts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-issues-an-executive-order-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-15-for-federal-contractors/)
and [federal
employees](https://www.opm.gov/news/releases/2022/01/release-opm-announces-dollar15-minimum-wage-for-us-federal-civilian-employees/)
earned a $15 per hour minimum wage.  
  
These directives go into effect this Sunday, meaning nearly 70,000
federal workers will immediately start to earn $15 an hour, and 300,000
employees of federal contractors will start to see a raise to $15 an
hour reflected in their paychecks over the course of the year.  
  
These are the customer service representatives who answer the phones to
ensure that Americans get the health care they deserve; wildland
firefighters who protect our forests and communities; custodial workers
who keep our military bases clean and safe; nursing assistants who care
for our veterans; and laborers who build and repair federal facilities.
The workers that will disproportionately benefit from this pay increase
are women, workers of color, and workers with disabilities.  
  
This increase will provide those workers and their families a little
more breathing room. And because we know that higher wages boost
productivity and mean lower job turnover, these orders will allow the
government to do its work better and faster.  
  
These workers benefiting from these actions are critical to the
functioning of the federal government and of our nation, and I’m proud
that their wages will begin to reflect that. I continue to urge Congress
to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, so that American
workers can have a job that delivers dignity.
