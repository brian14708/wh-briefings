President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered results for the
American people in their first year in office. The President and Vice
President made history growing our economy, addressing the climate
crisis, and building a judiciary and government that represents America.
Despite unprecedented challenges, 2021 was a year of record progress for
working families.

**Jobs:** President Biden’s first year was the greatest year of job
creation in American history, with more than 6 million jobs created.

**Unemployment Rate:** The unemployment rate dropped from 6.2% when
Biden took office to 3.9%, the biggest single year drop in American
history.

**Unemployment Claims:** The average number of Americans filing for
unemployment has been near its lowest level since 1969. When the
President took office, over 18 million were receiving unemployment
benefits, today only 2 million are—also the biggest single year drop in
history.

any first-year president.

any president since President Kennedy.

U.S. Court of Appeals than any president – even over 8 years – in
history.

**Cabinet:** First majority non-white Cabinet in history, with most
women in the Cabinet, including first woman Treasury Secretary, first
LGBTQ+ and Native American Cabinet officials, and first woman Director
of National Intelligence.

**Climate Investments:** Largest investments ever in the power grid,
electric vehicle chargers, and climate resilience.

**Clean Water**: Largest investment and national, bipartisan plan to get
safe and clean drinking water to all Americans.

**Cleaner Cars**: Strongest vehicle emissions standards ever to save
drivers money at the pump and reduce pollution.

**Wind:** First-ever approvals of large-scale offshore wind projects.

**Personnel:** Most diverse Administration in history – most women,
people of color, disability, LGBTQ+, first generation American, and
first-generation college graduates.
