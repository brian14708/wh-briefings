title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden\u2019s Event with Farmers, Ranchers on his\
  \ Action Plan for a More Competitive Meat and Poultry Supply\_Chain"
---
 
Today, President Biden convened a roundtable with farmers, ranchers, an
independent poultry processor, and members of his Cabinet to discuss the
need for greater competition in beef, pork and poultry processing and to
announce the Administration’s Action Plan for a Fairer, More
Competitive, and More Resilient Meat and Poultry Supply Chain. The
President, Secretary Vilsack, and Attorney General Garland explained the
steps the Administration is taking to increase processing options for
farmers and ranchers, create fairer and more competitive markets, bring
down prices for consumers, and ensure farmers and ranchers get a fair
price for their product.  
   
The President highlighted the strong economy going into 2022 and
explained that under his July Executive Order on Promoting Competition
in the American Economy, the Administration has been focused on tackling
the lack of competition in agricultural markets. He explained that just
a small handful of companies control the majority of the markets for
beef, pork, and poultry, enabling them to squeeze farmers and ranchers
while also raising prices on consumers. He also thanked bipartisan
members of Congress working together on legislation to increase
transparency in the cattle market.  
   
Secretary Vilsack provided details on the Administration’s $1 billion
investment of American Rescue Plan Funds to finance and support
independent processing projects that will give farmers and ranchers more
and better options. He further described the Department of Agriculture’s
commitment to work in concert with the Department of Justice and other
enforcement agencies, including new rulemakings under the Packers and
Stockyards Act, and new rules to protect consumers from confusion over
whether products labeled “Product of USA” are really made here at
home.  
   
Attorney General Garland spoke to the Justice Department’s commitment to
increase competition across industries, including in the agricultural
sector, and to enforce federal laws robustly and vigorously. He
described a new joint initiative with the Department of Agriculture to
better coordinate the two agencies’ federal enforcement efforts,
including the launch of a new joint portal within 30 days where farmers
and ranchers can lodge concerns about potential violations of the
Clayton Act, Sherman Act, or Packers and Stockyards Act. Garland also
described the Department’s commitment to supporting the strongest
possible whistleblower protections.  
   
Roundtable participants described how lack of competition in the meat
and poultry supply chain impacts their businesses and their lives, and
the challenges they face because a few large companies dominate the
processing markets. The farmers and ranchers explained that they are
often at the mercy of just a few buyers who determine the price they
receive, and that even as these conglomerates raise prices at the
grocery stores, they push down prices for farmers and ranchers, taking
wealth out of rural communities and hurting consumers.  
   
The independent poultry processor also described the dominant poultry
production model in which large, integrated companies dictate the terms
of restrictive contracts that leave growers with little control over
their own operations and laden them with debt, and how support for
alternative business models and market structures can serve consumers,
workers, and producers.  
   
Participants explained the start-up costs and challenges to independent
processing and marketing, and how USDA funding to support the food
supply chain will help independent processing operations start up,
expand, and grow—while creating more competition and options for
producers and consumers.  
   
Attorney General Garland urged participants and farmers and ranchers to
use the new joint web portal to confidentially share possible
anticompetitive practices and actions they’ve faced. President Biden
closed the meeting by reiterating the Administration’s
whole-of-government-commitment to tackle competition issues across
industries. He thanked participants for their hard work and feedback.
