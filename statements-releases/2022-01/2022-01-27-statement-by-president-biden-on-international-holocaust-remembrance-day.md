title: "Statement by President\_Biden on International Holocaust Remembrance\_Day"

Today, we attempt to fill a piercing silence from our past—to give voice
to the six million Jews who were systematically and ruthlessly murdered
by the Nazis and their collaborators, and to remember the millions of
Roma, Sinti, Slavs, disabled persons, LGBTQ+ individuals, and political
dissidents who were killed during the *Shoah.* It was a destructive
force so unimaginable that it gave rise to an entirely new vocabulary of
evil: words like *“holocaust,” “genocide,”* and *“crimes against
humanity.”* We join with nations of the world to grieve one of the
darkest chapters in human history—and to bear witness for future
generations so that we can make real our sacred vow: “never again.”

This charge is even more urgent with each passing year, as fewer and
fewer survivors remain to share their stories of lives lost and lives
rebuilt.

As a child, I first learned of the Holocaust listening to my father at
our dining room table. As a father and grandfather, I brought my own
family to see its haunting remnants at the Dachau concentration camp.
And today, as President, I’ll welcome Bronia Brandman to the Oval
Office. A survivor of Auschwitz who lost her parents and four of five
siblings, she could not speak of her experiences for half-a-century.
Today, she’ll share her story at the White House—and speak for millions
who never got the chance.

Today, and every day, we have a moral obligation to honor the victims,
learn from the survivors, pay tribute to the rescuers, and carry forth
the lessons of last century’s most heinous crime. From the streets of
Charlottesville, Virginia, to a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, we are
continually and painfully reminded that hate doesn’t go away; it only
hides. And it falls to each of us to speak out against the resurgence of
antisemitism and ensure that bigotry and hate receive no safe harbor, at
home and around the world.

We must teach accurately about the Holocaust and push back against
attempts to ignore, deny, distort, and revise history—as we did this
month, when the United States co-sponsored a UN resolution that charged
the international community with combating Holocaust denial through
education. We must continue to pursue justice for survivors and their
families. And we must ensure that aging survivors have access to the
services they need to live out their lives in dignity.

We cannot redeem the past. But, on this day, as we mourn humanity’s
capacity to inflict inhuman cruelty, let us commit to making a better
future and to always upholding the fundamental values of justice,
equality, and diversity that strengthen free societies.
