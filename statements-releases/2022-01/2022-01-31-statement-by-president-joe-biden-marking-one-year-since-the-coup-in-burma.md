title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden Marking One Year Since the Coup in\_Burma"
---
 
One year ago, the Burmese military denied the will of the people of
Burma, overthrew the democratically elected government, and seized power
in a coup d’etat.  
  
Since then, the regime has perpetrated countless brutal actions and
committed unspeakable violence against civilians, including children.
More than 1,500 people have been killed. Thousands have been unjustly
detained or subjected to sham trials. Corruption is rampant. Civil
conflict has worsened. The coup has caused immense suffering across
Burma and undermined regional stability, while the leaders of the regime
and their supporters seek to profit off the chaos they have created. And
though millions across Burma are in desperate need of life-saving aid,
the regime denies humanitarian access and attacks aid workers.  
  
We condemn these outrages and we are working closely with our partners
and allies, including in ASEAN, to hold accountable all those
responsible for the coup and attacks on civilians. The military regime
must reverse course and release all those unjustly detained—including
Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint, other democratically elected leaders,
journalists, civil society leaders, activists, and foreign citizens.
Humanitarian workers must be allowed unhindered access. And the regime
should immediately engage in a meaningful dialogue with all parties to
return Burma to its democratic path.  
  
As long as the regime continues to deny the people of Burma their
democratic voice, we will continue to impose further costs on the
military and its supporters.  
  
To the people of Burma: We have not forgotten your struggle. And we will
continue to support your valiant determination to bring democracy and
the rule of law to your country.
