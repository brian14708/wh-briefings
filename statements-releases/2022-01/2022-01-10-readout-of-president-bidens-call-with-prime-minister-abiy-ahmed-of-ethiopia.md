prisoners, and the two leaders discussed ways to accelerate dialogue
toward a negotiated ceasefire, the urgency of improving humanitarian
access across Ethiopia, and the need to address the human rights
concerns of all affected Ethiopians, including concerns about detentions
of Ethiopians under the state of emergency.Â President Biden expressed
concern that the ongoing hostilities, including recent air strikes,
continue to cause civilian casualties and suffering, and he reaffirmed
the U.S. commitment to work alongside the African Union and regional
partners to help Ethiopians peacefully resolve the conflict. Both
leaders underscored the importance of the U.S.-Ethiopia relationship,
the potential to strengthen cooperation on a range of issues, and the
need for concrete progress to resolve the conflict.
