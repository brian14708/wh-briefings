---
 
President Biden is announcing six new nominees to serve as U.S.
Attorneys across the country, officials who will be indispensable to
upholding the rule of law as the top federal law enforcement officials
for their districts.

These individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law,
their professionalism, their experience and credentials in this field,
their dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment
to the independence of the Department of Justice.

The President launched a comprehensive effort to take on the uptick in
gun crime that has been taking place since 2020—putting more cops on the
beat, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on
illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys as the chief federal
law enforcement officers in their district is important for these
efforts.

The President has now announced 43 nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys.
