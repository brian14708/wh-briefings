*White House Marks Year of Progress Since President Biden Activated All
of Government to Advance Environmental Justice*

Nearly one year ago on January 27, 2021, President Biden signed an
Executive Order on [*Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/),
laying the foundation for the most ambitious environmental justice
agenda ever undertaken by an Administration and putting environmental
justice and climate action at the center of the federal government’s
work.

The executive order formalized the President and the Vice President’s
commitment to ensuring that all federal agencies develop programs,
policies, and activities to address the disproportionately high and
adverse health, environmental, economic, climate, and other cumulative
impacts on communities that are marginalized, underserved, and
overburdened by pollution.

Over the past year, senior administration leaders have worked tirelessly
to secure [historic and long overdue
investments](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ceq/news-updates/2021/12/02/delivering-on-justice40/)
in environmental justice, advance science-based regulations that reduce
environmental pollution, strengthen enforcement of the nation’s
environmental and civil rights laws, and elevate the voices of
environmental justice communities in the White House and throughout the
Administration.

**Mobilizing a Whole-of-Government Approach to Environmental Justice**

-   **Delivering on Justice40.** As part of the President’s historic
    commitment to environmental justice, he created the [Justice40
    Initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/)
    to ensure that federal agencies deliver 40 percent of the overall
    benefits of climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable
    housing, clean water, and other investments to underserved
    communities. In total, hundreds of federal programs, representing
    billions of dollars in annual investment — including programs that
    were funded or created in the President’s [Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-advances-environmental-justice/)
    — are being reimagined and transformed to maximize benefits to
    disadvantaged communities through the Justice40 Initiative. An
    initial cohort of Justice40 pilot programs [are
    already](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ceq/news-updates/2021/12/02/delivering-on-justice40/)
    working to maximize the delivery of benefits to disadvantaged
    communities, and some agencies are creating new programs to maximize
    the benefits of climate and clean energy programs directed to
    disadvantaged communities, such as the [Communities
    LEAP](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-16-million-support-community-driven-pathways-clean-energy)
    (Local Energy Action Program) Pilot, the [Inclusive Energy
    Innovation
    Prize](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-new-25-million-prize-support-diversity-innovation),
    and the [Energy Storage for Social Equity
    Initiative.](https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/energy-storage-social-equity-initiative)
    An annual Federal environmental justice scorecard, the first of
    which will be published this year, will report on agencies’ progress
    in the implementation of the Justice40 Initiative and other key
    environmental justice priorities and commitments.
-   **Building a Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool**. This
    screening tool, which will be continuously updated and refined based
    on public feedback and research, will improve the consistency across
    the federal government of how agencies implement programs and
    initiatives that are intended to benefit underserved communities. A
    beta version of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool will
    be released for public review and comment early this year.
-   **Establishing the** [**First-Ever White House Environmental Justice
    Advisory
    Council**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ceq/news-updates/2021/03/29/white-house-announces-environmental-justice-advisory-council-members/)**.**
    This advisory body – [which brings together national environmental
    justice leaders from across the
    country](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council)
    – ensures that the voices of overburdened and underserved
    communities are heard in the White House and reflected in the
    policies and investments of federal agencies. This body has provided
    extensive 
    [recommendations](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ceq/news-updates/2021/05/13/statement-from-ceq-chair-brenda-mallory-on-recommendations-from-the-white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council/)
    that are informing the implementation of the Justice40 Initiative,
    the development of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool,
    and other policies and programs across the Administration.
-   **Renewing Focus on Environmental Equity and Justice across the
    Federal Government.**  Agencies, including the [Environmental
    Protection
    Agency](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/documents/regan-messageoncommitmenttoenvironmentaljustice-april072021.pdf)
    (EPA), the Department of Energy (DOE), the [Department of the
    Interior
    (DOI),](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/elips/documents/so-3399-508_0.pdf)
    the Department of Labor, the General Services Administration, the
    Department of [Health and Human
    Services](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/08/30/hhs-establishes-office-climate-change-and-health-equity.html)
    (HHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of
    Transportation (DOT) have launched new or strengthened equity and
    justice offices, task forces, strategies and policies. USDA, for
    example, is standing up an independent [Equity
    Commission](https://www.usda.gov/equity-commission) to examine USDA
    programs to identify and make recommendations for how USDA can
    reduce barriers to access and advance equity. The Commission will
    also ensure accountability within and empower stakeholders in
    underserved communities outside of USDA to take fuller advantage of
    the department’s programs and services. To coordinate, lead, and
    elevate environmental justice policy and implementation across the
    government, the Administration has also established the [White House
    Environmental Interagency
    Council](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/)
    led by Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory.

**Protecting Communities from Toxic Pollution**

-   **Advancing an Ambitious Regulatory Agenda.** Over the last year,
    the Biden-Harris Administration has taken more than 200 actions to
    repair the damage caused by the prior Administration’s rollbacks and
    implemented an ambitious regulatory agenda to address environmental
    justice. From [revoking usage of
    chlorpyrifos](/www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-takes-action-address-risk-chlorpyrifos-and-protect-childrens-health%3c),
    a pesticide that has negative health impacts on farmworkers and
    children, to [taking action on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
    (PFAS),](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-plan-to-combat-pfas-pollution/)
    a dangerous “forever chemical” linked to certain cancers, weakened
    immunity, thyroid disease, and other health effects – this
    Administration has prioritized rulemakings that protect the health
    and well-being of vulnerable communities. The President’s Task Force
    on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children is also
    leading and
    [coordinating](https://ptfceh.niehs.nih.gov/features/featured-activity/page930423.htm)
    cross-agency work to reduce pollution burdens and exposures,
    including lead exposure and asthma disparities in children of color.
-   **Strengthening Enforcement of Environmental Laws.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration has taken steps to enhance civil and
    criminal enforcement of environmental violations in communities
    overburdened by pollution. The [EPA, for
    example,](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/environmental-justice-enforcement-and-compliance-assurance-initiative)
    has taken steps to initiate early and expedited cleanup actions,
    deliver case outcomes that bring tangible benefits to overburdened
    communities, provide more robust monitoring and transparency tools,
    and bolster community engagement. The President’s Fiscal Year 2022
    budget request for the [Department of
    Justice](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-fiscal-year-2022-funding-request)
    includes $5.0 million in increased funding for the Environment and
    Natural Resources Division to expand its use of existing authorities
    in affirmative cases to advance environmental justice and to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts of climate change
    and to continue defensive and other work related to climate change.
-   **Journey to Justice Tour.** In November 2021, EPA Administrator
    Michael Regan embarked on a “[Journey to
    Justice](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/icymi-his-journey-justice-epa-administrator-michael-s-regan-toured-historically)”
    tour, traveling to Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas to spotlight
    longstanding environmental justice concerns in historically
    overburdened communities and to hear firsthand from residents
    dealing with the impacts of pollution. Today, EPA is announcing a
    series of concrete actions to respond to the communities’ concerns,
    including more community air pollution monitoring, fenceline
    monitoring, inspections, and funding commitments.
-   **Addressing Legacy Pollution.** The President’s [Bipartisan
    Infrastructure
    Law](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-advances-environmental-justice/)
    delivers the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in
    American history. The law will invest $21 billion to clean up
    Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine lands, and
    cap orphaned oil and gas wells that are sources of blight and
    pollution. These investments are happening now. EPA recently
    [announced](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-plans-use-first-1b-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-funds-clear-out)
    a historic $1 billion investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law to initiate cleanup at 49 previously unfunded Superfund sites
    and accelerate cleanup at dozens of other sites across the country.
    Approximately 60 percent of the sites to receive funding for new
    cleanup projects are in historically underserved communities.

Recognizing that millions of Americans live within a mile of one of the
tens of thousands of abandoned mines and oil and gas wells across the
country, DOI is working to speed the deployment of initial grants from
the law’s $16 billion in funding for mine and well clean-ups. DOI
recently
[released](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-releases-implementation-guidance-states-infrastructure-law-efforts)
initial
[guidance](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/state-notification-letter-bil-12-17-21.pdf) for
states interested in applying for Federal grants that will fund the
proper cleanup of orphaned oil and gas wells and well sites, with 26
states responding to express their intent to apply for formula grant
funding.

-   **Investing in Clean Drinking Water.** The President’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law will expand access to clean drinking water to all
    American families, eliminate the nation’s lead service lines, and
    help to clean up dangerous PFAS chemicals. Specifically, the law
    will invest $55 billion to expand access to clean drinking water and
    wastewater infrastructure for households, businesses, schools, and
    child care centers all across the country, including in Tribal
    Nations and rural disadvantaged communities that need it most. These
    investments will be guided by the Biden-Harris Administration’s
    [Lead Pipe and Paint Action
    Plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/),
    a historic and ambitious effort to deploy catalytic resources from
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law while leveraging every tool across
    Federal, state, and local government to deliver clean drinking
    water, replace lead pipes, and remediate lead paint. The plan
    includes over 15 new actions from more than 10 Federal agencies to
    ensure the Federal government is marshalling every resource and
    making rapid progress towards replacing all lead pipes in the next
    decade. The White House also has developed a whole-of government
    [research
    plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/01-2022_CECPlan_Update.pdf)
    on contaminants of emerging concern in drinking water that will
    support safe drinking water advisories, standards, and mitigation
    efforts that protect public health.  
-   **Improving Air Quality.** The Biden-Harris Administration has taken
    decisive action to improve air quality – especially in disadvantaged
    communities. EPA has initiated rulemakings to reduce [harmful air
    pollutants from heavy-duty
    trucks](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/)
    that heavily impact low-income communities and communities of color.
    EPA has also [targeted leaded fuel used in small
    planes](/www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/petitions-and-epa-response-memorandums-related-lead%3c),
    which contributes to air pollution and accounts for 70 percent of
    lead borne emissions. In December 2021, EPA’s Office of Air and
    Radiation
    [launched](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-opens-20-million-grant-competition-community-air-pollution-monitoring)
    a $20 million grant competition that calls for proposals to conduct
    air pollution monitoring in communities experiencing disparities in
    health outcomes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
    on behalf of DOT, is proposing revised fuel economy standards for
    passenger cars and light trucks for model years 2024-2026; DOT
    estimates that this would increase the average fleet’s fuel
    efficiency by 12 miles per gallon by model year 2026.  In addition,
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests [$17 billion in
    modernizing ports and waterways, including funds that will support
    electrification of port infrastructure and provides the investment
    needed to deliver thousands of clean school
    buses](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-advances-environmental-justice/)
    to help reduce harmful environmental impacts on communities on the
    fence line of industry and transportation corridors. The law also
    provides a $5 billion investment in electric vehicles that will
    support the deployment of an equitable nationwide network of 500,000
    electric vehicle chargers.

**Strengthening Resilience to Extreme Weather and Climate Change**

-   **Investing in Community Resilience.** The President’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law is the largest investment in the resilience of
    physical and natural infrastructure in American history. The law
    invests over $50 billion to make communities safer and
    infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change –
    droughts, heat waves, wildfires and floods – which
    disproportionately impact communities of color. These investments
    have already begun flowing to resilience projects in underserved and
    overburdened communities, [including a $163 million investment to
    restore the Cano Martin Pena urban tidal channel and surrounding
    areas of the San Juan Bay National
    Estuary](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-investment-to-americas-port-and-waterway-infrastructure/)
    – an urban waterway project that will significantly improve the
    health and welfare of the surrounding communities in San Juan. In
    the coming year, the Army Corps will also engage with environmental
    justice communities in the development of a strategy to allocate
    $130 million for two pilot programs that target the needs of
    economically-disadvantaged communities.
-   **Building a Coordinated Federal Response to Climate Impacts.** To
    address the multi-faceted nature of climate change and its impact on
    frontline communities, the Biden-Harris Administration launched five
    cabinet secretary level Resilience Interagency Working Groups under
    the [National Climate Task
    Force](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/climate/) focused on coastal
    resilience, drought, extreme heat, flood, and wildfire. These
    Working Groups are tasked with recommending and coordinating
    actions, programs, and resources to mitigate climate impacts and
    subsequent recovery challenges that are often felt most heavily by
    underserved and overburdened communities. For example, the Extreme
    Heat Working Group was responsible for [launching a coordinated,
    interagency effort to address extreme heat – including the
    first-ever employer mandates on heat
    risk](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/20/fact-sheet-biden-administration-mobilizes-to-protect-workers-and-communities-from-extreme-heat/)
    –  to respond to extreme heat that threatens the lives and
    livelihoods of Americans, especially frontline and essential
    workers, pregnant workers, children, seniors, economically
    disadvantaged groups and those with underlying health conditions.
-   **Advancing Equitable Outcomes for Disaster Survivors.** Pursuant to
    Executive Order 13985, *Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
    Underserved Communities through the Federal Government*, the Federal
    Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) evaluated the equity of its
    programs and processes to reduce barriers to access experienced by
    underserved populations through programs that provide individual
    assistance to disaster survivors. Based on this review, FEMA has
    begun to amend its policies to provide greater flexibility and
    increase access to assistance for disaster survivors. The [policy
    changes](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_updated-iappg-version-1.1.pdf)
    that FEMA is implementing include: expanding the types of
    documentation that homeowners and renters can use to prove ownership
    or occupancy; expanding financial assistance for home cleaning and
    sanitizing as well as for disaster-caused disability; and changing
    how the threshold for property losses are calculated to qualify for
    direct housing assistance, which helps ensure that damage
    evaluations are done in an equitable manner regardless of the size
    of the damaged home. As of mid-January 2021, these changes have
    resulted in the delivery of more than $120 million in financial
    assistance for mold remediation; $22 million for the cleaning and
    sanitization of homes; and more than 100,000 survivors receiving
    home repair and rental assistance as a result of expanded ownership
    and occupancy documentation requirements.  
-   **Bolstering Tribal Community Resilience.** The President’s
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes [historic
    investments](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-makes-historic-investments-tribal-infrastructure)
    in Indigenous communities’ efforts to tackle the climate crisis and
    boost the resilience of physical and natural systems. Enabled by the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, [the Administration recently
    committed](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-investment-to-americas-port-and-waterway-infrastructure/)
    $40 million to the **Espanola Valley, Rio Grande and Tributaries,
    New Mexico** to restore and protect 958 acres of aquatic and
    riparian habitats that are an integral part of constructing social
    identity and transmission and retention of traditional knowledge for
    both the Pueblo of Santa Clara and Ohkay Owingeh. As part of this
    broader commitment to Tribal community resilience, [DOI also
    recently awarded
    nearly](https://www.bia.gov/news/bia-announces-tribal-climate-resilience-grants-totaling-1384-million-awarded-fy-2021)
    $14 million to dozens of American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal
    Nations and organizations to support their climate adaptation
    planning, ocean and coastal management planning, capacity building,
    and relocation, managed retreat, and protect-in-place planning for
    climate risks. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) has invited Tribal leaders to consult on the agency’s
    implementation of its Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding,
    including $400 million to enhance fish passage (of which up to 15
    percent will go directly to Tribes), $492 million to improve and
    restore natural infrastructure through the National Coastal
    Resilience Fund, and $172 million to support recovery of Pacific
    coastal salmon. Further, the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget
    includes an increase of more than $450 million to facilitate climate
    mitigation, resilience, adaptation, and environmental justice
    projects in Indian Country. This includes investments to begin the
    process of transitioning Tribal colleges to renewable energy through
    DOE, and a new Indian Land Consolidation Program through DOI that
    will enhance the ability of Tribal Nations to plan for and adapt to
    climate change and promote economic development on lands restored to
    Tribal ownership.
-   **Empowering Communities with Actionable Climate Data.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration [launched a whole-of-government
    initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/12/fact-sheet-biden-administration-makes-climate-information-and-decision-tools-more-accessible/)
    to deliver accessible and actionable information to individuals and
    communities that are being hit by flooding, drought, wildfires,
    extreme heat, coastal erosion, and other intensifying climate
    impacts. This effort is designed to put authoritative and useful
    information into the hands of more Americans—from broadcast
    meteorologists sharing climate information with communities, to
    farmers checking drought outlooks, to businesses planning for
    extreme weather, to families making decisions about their homes and
    neighborhoods. By continuing to strengthen partnerships with
    community stakeholders, state, local, Tribal, and territorial
    governments, and businesses, the Biden-Harris Administration will
    ensure that Federal information services respond to evolving needs,
    particularly those of disadvantaged communities.

**Delivering Clean, Affordable Energy**

-   **Lowering Energy Burdens.** The Biden-Harris Administration has
    provided $8.2 billion in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
    (LIHEAP) funds to States, Territories, Tribes, and Tribal
    Organizations, including $4.5 billion from the American Rescue Plan
    Act (ARP). Combined, these funds more than doubled the typical
    annual appropriations—the largest increase in the program’s
    history—to assist low-income households with meeting their home
    energy needs. HHS followed this with guidance providing flexible
    options for states, territories, Tribes, and Tribal organizations to
    adjust their LIHEAP programs to address extreme heat. The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law doubles down on the Administration’s commitment
    to lowering energy burdens by investing: an additional $500 million
    in LIHEAP, which will prioritize eligible households with young
    children, the elderly, and people with disabilities; and [a historic
    $3.5 billion in the Weatherization Assistance
    Program](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-fact-sheet-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-will-deliver-american-workers-families-and-0),
    reducing energy costs for more than 700,000 low-income households by
    increasing the energy efficiency of their homes, while ensuring
    health and safety and creating jobs.
-   **Increasing Access to Clean Energy.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration has prioritized the deployment of distributed and
    community scale energy resources in the underserved and overburdened
    communities that need them most. The Department of Agriculture
    [launched the Rural Energy Pilot
    Program](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/energy-programs/rural-energy-pilot-program)
    with $10 million in available grants for rural communities that are
    particularly underserved to deploy community-scale clean energy
    technologies, innovations, and solutions. DOE launched the [Solar
    Automated Permit Processing (SolarAPP+)
    tool](https://solarapp.nrel.gov/), an online platform that enables
    jurisdictions to rapidly approve residential solar installation
    permits. EPA [launched new residential sector partnerships to
    accelerate efficiency and electrification
    retrofits](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-upgrades-one-million-homes-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-provides-massive-investment)
    with a focus on underserved residential households through its
    ENERGY STAR Home Upgrade Program. To coordinate these interagency
    actions, the Biden-Harris Administration launched a Distributed
    Energy Resources Working Group under the National Climate Task Force
    focused specifically on accelerating deployment of distributed
    energy resources in disadvantaged communities.
-   **Modernizing the Grid.** FEMA and the Department of Housing and
    Urban Development (HUD) are working collaboratively with the
    government of [Puerto Rico to administer over $12 billion of Federal
    recovery
    funds](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/20/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-supports-puerto-ricos-recovery-and-renewal-in-its-first-year-in-office/)
    earmarked for rebuilding and improving Puerto Rico’s grid. These
    funds are being used to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and
    support initiatives in Puerto Rico that focus on mitigation,
    adaptation, and resilience. DOE and FEMA have also launched a
    comprehensive study to evaluate pathways to meeting Puerto Rico’s
    100 percent renewable energy targets in a way that achieves both
    short-term recovery goals and long-term energy resilience. The
    study, titled PR100, will be grounded in a commitment to
    environmental and energy justice and informed by extensive
    engagement with Puerto Rico stakeholders to reflect the island’s
    diverse priorities.

**Enabling Equitable and Sustainable Communities**

-   **Increasing Affordable Transportation Options.** The President’s
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law expands access to public transit and
    makes the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of
    Amtrak – a major investment in transit equity. The law will invest
    $66 billion to provide healthy, sustainable transportation options
    for millions of Americans by modernizing and expanding rail networks
    across the country. The law also provides $1.2 billion annually
    through the Safe Streets and Roads for All program to fund Vision
    Zero plans and construct projects that will prevent
    transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries, which
    disproportionately impact rural communities and communities of
    color.  To ensure these funds facilitate equitable outcomes, DOT has
    [solicited input from
    stakeholders](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportation-announces-request-information-transportation-data-and)
    on the data and assessment tools available to assess transportation
    equity.  The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also includes investments
    for a new program that will reconnect neighborhoods cut off by
    historic transportation investments and ensure new projects increase
    opportunity, advance racial equity and environmental justice, and
    promote affordable access. DOT also requested $110 million in its
    Fiscal Year 22 budget to create a new Thriving Communities program
    that would establish a new office to support communities with
    eliminating persistent transportation barriers and increasing access
    to jobs, school, and businesses.
-   **Tackling Segregation, Discrimination, and Exclusion.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration has [restored the implementation of the
    “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing”
    requirement](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_21_098),
    which requires HUD and its funding recipients, such as local
    communities, to take affirmative steps to remedy fair housing issues
    such as racially segregated neighborhoods, lack of housing choice,

    the availability of approximately $10 million in competitive grant
    funds for FTA’s [Pilot Program for Transit-Oriented Development

    state-level revolving loan funds for energy efficiency; and $500
    million for competitive grants to fund efficiency and renewable
    improvements in public school facilities.
