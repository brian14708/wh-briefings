title: Readout of White House Roundtable with Civil Rights Leaders on Equitable Implementation
  of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
---
 
Yesterday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, White House
Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu, and Acting
Director of the Office of Management and Budget Shalanda Young hosted a
roundtable with national civil rights leaders to discuss how the
Administration will advance equity and racial justice and build a better
America by implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

The senior White House officials outlined the President’s commitment to
ensuring that federal infrastructure funding reaches underserved
communities and addresses persistent poverty, generates equitable job
creation, maximizes the power of new federal contracting opportunities
to narrow racial and gender wealth gaps and historical disparities,
improves accessibility for people with disabilities, and advances civil
rights. They underscored that the President has directed his team to
ensure that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law advances equity and
environmental justice. Finally, the officials thanked the civil rights
leaders present for their powerful advocacy and for their partnership in
advancing equitable implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Civil rights leaders shared a number of ideas about how implementation
of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law can advance equitable outcomes in
underserved and low-income communities and make long overdue investments
in communities of color, communities facing persistent poverty, Tribal
and territorial communities, and urban and rural communities that have
faced decades of disinvestment or harmful infrastructure projects.
Advocates also highlighted that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will
create new, good-paying, and union jobs that present a generational
opportunity to expand job opportunities for underserved communities who
face disproportionately high unemployment rates. Participants emphasized
the value of continued meaningful collaboration with businesses,
workers, and communities to help realize these goals of equity in
infrastructure investments.
