  Ukraine"

President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any
Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a
renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united
response from the United States and our Allies. President Biden also
knows from long experience that the Russians have an extensive playbook
of aggression short of military action, including cyberattacks and
paramilitary tactics. And he affirmed today that those acts of Russian
aggression will be met with a decisive, reciprocal, and united response.
