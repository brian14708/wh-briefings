title: Statement of President Joe Biden on the Senate Vote on Voting Rights
---
 
At the core of our democracy is a basic principle: the right to vote,
and to have that vote counted. That principle was assaulted one year
ago, when a violent mob attempted a coup seeking to overturn the will of
the people. And today, in state after state, Republican state
legislatures are engaged in an unprecedented effort to suppress the
sacred right to vote and subvert the American bedrock of free and fair
elections.  
  
In the face of those threats, I am profoundly disappointed that the
United States Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy. I am
disappointed — but I am not deterred.  
  
My Administration will never stop fighting to ensure that the heart and
soul of our democracy — the right to vote — is protected at all
costs. We will continue to work with allies to advance necessary
legislation to protect the right to vote. And to push for Senate
procedural changes that will protect the fundamental right to vote.  
  
As dangerous new Republican laws plainly designed to suppress and
subvert voting rights proliferate in states across the country, we will
explore every measure and use every tool at our disposal to stand up for
democracy. The Vice President will continue to lead this effort, as she
has for the past year.
