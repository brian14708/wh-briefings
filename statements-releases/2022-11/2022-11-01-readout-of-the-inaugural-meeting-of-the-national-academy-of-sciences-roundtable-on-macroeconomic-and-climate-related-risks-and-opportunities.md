  \ Roundtable on Macroeconomic and Climate-related Risks and\_Opportunities"
---
 
Yesterday, Council of Economic Advisers Member Heather Boushey, Office
of Management and Budget Chief Economist Zach Liscow, and other
officials from across the Biden-Harris Administration, attended the
Inaugural Meeting of the [Roundtable on Macroeconomic and
Climate-related Risks and
Opportunities](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/roundtable-on-macroeconomics-and-climate-related-risks-and-opportunities)
convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine.  
  
This Roundtable’s goal is to improve our understanding of how the
physical and transition effects of climate change relate to and affect
macroeconomic performance, in addition to exploring the implications for
fiscal, monetary, and financial stability policies. To that end, in
attendance were dozens of scholars focused on the intersection of
climate change and macroeconomic modeling.  
  
The United States is in the midst of implementing an unprecedented and
ambitious agenda to address climate change, following the passage of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the
Inflation Reduction Act. The President knows that to address the serious
challenges science change presents, we must take swift action, which is
why he has set an ambitious goal of rapidly transitioning our economy to
produce and use clean energy by 2050.  
  
To support this effort, the President’s [Executive Order on
Climate-Related Financial
Risk](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/)
called on the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management
and Budget to “identify the primary sources of Federal climate-related
financial risk exposure and develop methodologies to quantify climate
risk within the economic assumptions and the long-term budget
projections of the President’s Budget.” New analytic tools to accurately
model the economic effects of climate change will enable policymakers to
transition existing productive capabilities into new uses that are
consistent with a sustainable, modern economy. To that end, the Council
of Economic Advisors and Office of Management and Budget have
spearheaded a new Interagency Technical Working Group, delivered an
[assessment](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/written-materials/2022/04/04/climate-related-macroeconomic-risks-and-opportunities/)
of the Federal government’s capacity, and incorporated an initial
estimate of the risks of climate change in the Budget’s [Long-Term
Outlook](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ap_3_long_term_fy2023.pdf).  
  
The launch of the [National Academies’ Roundtable on Macroeconomic and
Climate-related Risks and
Opportunities](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/roundtable-on-macroeconomics-and-climate-related-risks-and-opportunities)
is critical to these endeavors. The findings from the Roundtable will
help realize the President’s vision and inform the Interagency Technical
Working Group. The Roundtable will help address core issues, such as how
to translate the uncertain impacts of climate change and the transition
to net-zero carbon emissions economies into macroeconomic analyses, in
addition to exploring how to adjust macroeconomic models and analytic
approaches to accommodate the unique characteristics of climate risks
and opportunities.  
  
Biden Administration ex-officio members of the panel include:  
  
Heather Boushey, Council of Economic Advisers  
Carla Frisch, U.S. Department of Energy  
Justina W. Gallegos, National Economic Council  
Sarah B. Kapnick, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  
Zachary Liscow, Office of Management and Budget  
Kelly Maguire, U.S. Department of Agriculture  
Tara M. Sinclair, U.S. Department of Treasury
