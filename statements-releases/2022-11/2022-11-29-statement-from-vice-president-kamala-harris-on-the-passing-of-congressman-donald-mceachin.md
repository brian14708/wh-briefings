title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Congressman\
  \ Donald\_McEachin"

Congressman Donald McEachin was a relentless advocate for his community,
a dedicated colleague, and loving husband, father, and grandfather. In
Virginia’s General Assembly and the United States Congress, he was
tireless in the fight for justice. We were elected to Congress and
joined the Congressional Black Caucus the same year, and worked together
to advance critical issues on behalf of the American people. I was
particularly honored to partner with him on legislation to advance
environmental justice and secure a cleaner, healthier, and more fair
future for all. I will miss his friendship and his advocacy and passion
for improving our world for generations to come.  
   
The Second Gentleman and I send our condolences and prayers to his wife
Colette, their three children, and all those mourning his loss.
