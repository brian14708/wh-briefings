title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the U.S.-UAE\
  \ Partnership to Accelerate Transition to Clean Energy\_(PACE)"
---
 
Today the United States joined with the United Arab Emirates in taking a
bold step toward the resilient, affordable clean energy future the world
needs. Our new Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) will
catalyze $100 billion in clean energy financing in both countries, as
well as robust commercial investment and other support for the emerging
economies whose clean development is both underfunded and essential to
the global climate effort. Through PACE, the U.S. and UAE will focus on
the scalable development of low-emission energy sources, with the goal
of deploying 100 gigawatts of clean energy globally by 2035.  Our
countries will also invest in the management of harmful emissions like
carbon and methane, the development of advanced nuclear technology, and
the decarbonization of the industrial and transportation sectors. The
President thanks His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan,
President of the UAE, for his leadership in advancing this initiative
and for hosting COP28 in 2023.  The President appreciates the hard work
by both countries to negotiate this important framework.  This is just
the latest demonstration of the deep strategic relationship our
countries share, and of the broader U.S. commitment to promoting
economic prosperity, security, and stability in the Middle East region.
 As the President prepares to travel to Egypt for COP 27, PACE also
reflects our unwavering commitment to working closely with allies and
partners to accelerate the clean energy transition and deliver the
climate action our shared future depends on.
