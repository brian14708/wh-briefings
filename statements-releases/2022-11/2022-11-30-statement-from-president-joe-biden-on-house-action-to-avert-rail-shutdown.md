title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on House Action to Avert Rail\_Shutdown"
---
 
I am grateful to Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats and Republicans for
taking urgent action to prevent a rail shutdown. This overwhelming
bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives makes clear that
Democrats and Republicans agree that a rail shutdown would be
devastating to our economy and families across the country. The Senate
must now act urgently.  Without the certainty of a final vote to avoid a
shutdown this week, railroads will begin to halt the movement of
critical materials like chemicals to clean our drinking water as soon as
this weekend.  Let me say that again: without action this week,
disruptions to our auto supply chains, our ability to move food to
tables, and our ability to remove hazardous waste from gasoline
refineries will begin. The Senate must move quickly and send a bill to
my desk for my signature immediately.
