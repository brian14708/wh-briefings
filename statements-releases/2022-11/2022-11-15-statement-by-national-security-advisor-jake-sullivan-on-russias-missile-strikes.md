title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Russia\u2019s Missile\_\
  Strikes"

The United States strongly condemns Russia’s latest
missile attacks against Ukraine, which appear to have struck residential
buildings in Kyiv and additional sites across the country. It is not
lost on us that, as world leaders meet at the G-20 in Bali to discuss
the issues of significant importance to the lives and livelihoods of
people around the world, Russia again threatens those lives and
destroys Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. These Russian strikes will
serve to only deepen the concerns among the G-20 about the destabilizing
impact of Putin’s war. Our thoughts are with the brave Ukrainian people,
who continue to demonstrate resilience and courage in their defense of
their sovereignty and democracy. The United States and our allies and
partners will continue to provide Ukraine with what it needs to defend
itself, including air defense systems. We will stand with Ukraine for as
long as it takes.
