title: "The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity for\
  \ Black Americans and Communities Across the\_Country"
---
 
From the first day in office and every day since, the Biden-Harris
Administration has led the charge to ensure that all African American
families and communities can live with dignity, safety, respect, and
achieve greater economic opportunity. The Administration has taken an
historic approach to advancing racial equity, including directing every
agency across the whole of the federal government to address the lasting
impacts of systemic racism on Black communities. For generations,
entrenched disparities in our society and economy, at times facilitated
by the federal government, have made it harder for Black Americans to
have a fair shot at the American dream. Centuries of injustice and
decades of disinvestment in Black communities not only undermine the
American promise of equal opportunity, but also keep our entire nation
from reaching its potential.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is working to protect and advance civil
rights, voter protections, racial equity, and economic opportunity for
Black communities. That has meant: record drops in unemployment for
Black workers; historically low credit card delinquency rates – which
hit Black and Latino borrowers hardest; historically low foreclosures
and evictions; and historically low Black child poverty rates. The
Administration has delivered real and lasting change and continues to
work each day to deliver equitable outcomes and opportunity for African
Americans.   
  
**Economic Opportunity for Black Families and Communities.** By signing
into law the historic American Rescue Plan (ARP),  Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and implementing robust
regulatory reform, President Biden has led [the most equitable economic
recovery on
record](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-report-advancing-equity-through-the-american-rescue-plan/),
creating nearly 10 million jobs since coming to office, and helping
create new economic opportunities for African Americans, including
Black-owned businesses, and made long overdue investments in Black
communities.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration’s vital policies and programs include: 

-   **Lowering Energy Costs and Creating Economic Opportunities Through
    the Inflation Reduction Act.** By signing the Inflation Reduction
    Act, President Biden is delivering on his promise to build an
    economy that works for working families, including Black families.
    President Biden and Congressional Democrats successfully fought to
    pass this historic legislation to help all Americans, including
    African Americans, who have been at the frontline of climate change,
    by lowering costs, advancing environmental justice while building a
    cleaner future, and growing the economy from the bottom up and the
    middle out by creating good-paying, union jobs across the country.
    The IRA will also lower the deficit and ask the ultra-wealthy and
    corporations to pay their fair share. No one earning under $400,000
    per year will pay a penny more in taxes. It’s also the most
    aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate crisis.  
    -   **Making Home Efficiency Upgrades More Affordable.** Households
        can save up to 30% with tax credits for efficient heating and
        cooling equipment that will save them hundreds of dollars on
        utility bills. Households can also save up to 30% with tax
        credits for home construction projects on windows, doors,
        insulation, or other weatherization measures that prevent energy
        from escaping homes. When families need to replace or upgrade
        stoves, ovens, or other home appliances, they can receive direct
        rebates when buying more energy efficient and electric
        appliances that can lower future utility bills by at least $350
        per year. Families in affordable housing units will benefit from
        resources to support projects that boost efficiency, improve
        indoor air quality, make clean energy or electrification
        upgrades, or strengthen their climate resilience.
    -   **Creating Economic Opportunities and Good Paying Jobs.** The
        IRA spurs solar project development in environmental justice
        communities by providing a 20% bonus credit for solar projects
        on federally-subsidized affordable housing projects and a 10%
        bonus credit for solar projects in low-income communities. It
        also creates a new Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator
        that will seed state and local clean energy financing
        institutions, support the deployment of distributed
        zero-emission technologies like heat-pumps and community solar
        and EV charging, while prioritizing over 50% of its investments
        in disadvantaged communities. The IRA expands clean energy tax
        credits for wind, solar, nuclear, clean hydrogen, clean fuels,
        and carbon capture including a bonus credit for businesses that
        pay workers a prevailing wage and hire using registered
        apprenticeship programs – so that the clean energy we use
        creates good-paying jobs.
    -   **Providing Relief to Farmers.** The Inflation Reduction Act
        includes $5.3 billion that will provide relief to tens of
        thousands of farmers, including Black, brown, and Native
        American farmers. Of that money, $3.1 billion will help
        distressed borrowers pay off their farm debts without ultimately
        taking the land or making the farmer ineligible for future
        assistance. An additional $2.2 billion will go to farmers who
        have suffered discrimination by USDA farm programs.    
-   **Making Critical Investments in Black Families & Communities in the
    American Rescue Plan.** When President Biden signed the American
    Rescue Plan (ARP) into law, it provided a lifeline to millions of
    families who were struggling from the economic fallout of the
    pandemic.  
    -   **Historic Expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) – cutting
        child poverty to record lows for Black children:** ARP provided
        cash relief directly to low- and middle-income Americans, and
        cut Black child poverty by more than half in 2021.  The expanded
        Child Tax Credit provided a critical lifeline to millions of
        Black families during the nation’s recovery from the economic
        crisis created by the pandemic, and the President continues to
        urge Congress to extend this life-changing tax relief. In
        addition, the ARP increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
        Program (SNAP) benefits by 15% through September 2021. Beginning
        on October 1, 2021, USDA’s Thrifty Food Plan update increased
        SNAP benefits by $36.30 per person per month.
    -   **Supporting Child Care Providers and Reducing Child Care Costs
        for Black Families.** Black families are nearly two times more
        likely than white parents to have to quit, turn down, or make a
        major change in their job due to child care disruptions. The
        American Rescue Plan provided a $39 billion lifeline to help
        child care providers stay open and compensate early childhood
        educators, as they provide safe and healthy environments for
        children and help parents work. States have already delivered
        American Rescue Plan stabilization grants to more [than 200,000
        child care
        providers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-funds-provided-a-critical-lifeline-to-200000-child-care-providers-helping-millions-of-families-to-work/),
        1 in 5 of whom are Black, serving as many as 9.5 million
        children and their families. In most states, providers in at
        least 98% of counties received aid. One
        [survey](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.naeyc.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fwysiwyg%2Fuser-98%2Fnaeyc_ece_field_survey_february2022.pdf&data=05%7C01%7CRuth.Friedman%40acf.hhs.gov%7C68b0d1c6968b4915c22b08da4fe1dc13%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C637910128735916374%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=oRvZWvVB6wMpkM5RtLGePBraGyuhc6Hi0fFU0YqqIKI%3D&reserved=0) finds
        that 92% of providers receiving funds relied on them
        to help stay open and nearly half used them to repay debt
        incurred during the pandemic. Many states also used funds to
        help boost compensation of the child care workforce, which is
        disproportionately led by Black women. The ARP also helped lower
        child care costs for Black families, including by expanding the
        Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit—allowing a median income
        family with two kids under age 13 to receive up to $8,000
        towards their child care expenses, compared with a maximum of
        $1,200 previously.
    -   **The American Rescue Plan tripled the EITC for 17 million
        workers without dependent children:** The American Rescue Plan
        nearly tripled the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without
        dependent children for 2021 from $540 to $1,500 and extended the
        credit to younger and older workers. This was the first increase
        in the credit in real terms since 1993, and especially impacted
        front-line workers, including cashiers and retail salespeople,
        cooks and food prep workers, and childcare workers.
    -   **Helping Black Americans Stay in their Homes.** President
        Biden’s American Rescue Plan has helped Black Americans stay in
        their homes by providing emergency rental assistance. Of the $25
        billion in rental assistance that was spent in 2021, Black
        Americans were the largest group that received this help,
        representing more than 40% of aid recipients.  The
        Administration implemented a series of measures that protected
        homeowners from foreclosure, including a foreclosure moratorium,
        increased options for mortgage payment forbearance, enhanced
        loan modifications to resolve delinquencies.  In addition, the
        ARP is helping struggling homeowners catch up with their
        mortgage payments and utility costs through the Homeowner
        Assistance Fund. As a result of these protections, foreclosure
        filings in 2021 were at a historic low with 29 percent fewer
        filings than in 2020 and 95 percent below the 2010 peak
        experienced in the previous economic downturn during the Great
        Recession. In addition, the ARP provided $10 billion in funding
        for families and individuals who are recovering from or at risk
        of homelessness.
    -   **Extending a Lifeline to Struggling Small Businesses.** Through
        the American Rescue Plan and the equitable implementation of
        emergency relief programs, President Biden and Vice President
        Harris have fostered the strongest recovery for Main Street on
        record. In 2021, Americans applied to start 5.4 million new
        businesses—more than 20 percent higher than any previous year on
        record, and with new business creation especially strong among
        entrepreneurs of color. The American Rescue Plan provided
        emergency grants, lending, and investment to hard-hit small
        businesses – including Black businesses – so they can rehire and
        retain workers and purchase the health and sanitation equipment
        they need to keep workers safe. This includes the new $10
        billion State Small Business Credit Initiative, which will
        provide growth capital to early-stage companies and main street
        small businesses in economically disadvantaged areas, including
        minority-owned businesses.
    -   **Investing in Equitable Workforce Training.** The President is
        committed to creating pathways to the middle class, especially
        for people from underserved communities, by expanding
        skills-based hiring and increasing access to Registered
        Apprenticeship and workforce training. States, localities,
        community colleges, and community-based organizations have
        leveraged $40 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to
        deliver training, expand career paths, encourage more Registered
        Apprenticeships, provide retention and hiring bonuses in
        critical industries, and power efforts to help underserved
        Americans and those who face barriers to employment secure good
        jobs. In 2022, the Department of Labor has awarded $121 million
        in grants to expand, diversify, and improve access to Registered
        Apprenticeships for underserved communities. The agency is also
        awarding $95 million help people in marginalized and
        underrepresented populations overcome barriers to career and
        technical education programs they need to connect with quality
        jobs.  
-   **Ensuring Black Homeowners Get Full Value for their Homes.** In
    March 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration’s Interagency Task Force
    on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) released the PAVE
    Action Plan, which represents the most wide-ranging set of reforms
    ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process.
    Federal agencies are taking action on more than 20 commitments
    across all stages of the valuation process, including: making the
    appraisal industry more accountable; empowering consumers with
    critical information and assistance if they receive a valuation that
    is lower than expected; preventing algorithmic bias in home
    valuation; cultivating an appraiser profession that is well-trained
    and looks like the communities it serves; and leveraging federal
    data and expertise to inform policy, practice, and research on
    appraisal bias.  
-   **Protecting Black Americans’ Access to Housing by Combating Housing
    Discrimination.** Following President Biden’s Presidential
    Memorandum directing his Administration to address racial
    discrimination in the housing market, HUD published an interim final
    rule in the Federal Register entitled “Restoring Affirmatively
    Furthering Fair Housing Definitions and Certifications” that
    requires HUD funding recipients to complete an assessment of fair
    housing issues, identify fair housing priorities and goals, and then
    commit to meaningful actions to meet those goals and remedy
    identified issues.  Last fall, HUD solicited input from stakeholders
    to inform a Notice of Public Rulemaking, which will be published
    this year for public comment.  
-   **Leveraging Federal Procurement to Narrow the Racial Wealth Gap for
    Black Entrepreneurs and Families.** Federal procurement is one of
    our most powerful tools to advance equity and build wealth in
    underserved communities, but only around 10 percent of federal
    agencies’ total eligible contracting dollars typically go to small
    disadvantaged businesses, a category under federal law for which
    Black-owned businesses are presumed to qualify. Recognizing the
    importance of using the government’s purchasing power to advance
    opportunity and equity, the Biden-Harris Administration has launched
    an all-of-government effort to expand contracting opportunities for
    underserved small businesses, including Black-owned businesses. 
    President Biden has set a goal of increasing the share of federal
    contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by
    2025— projected to translate to an additional $100 billion to
    minority-owned businesses, and helping more Americans realize their
    entrepreneurial dreams. In December 2021, the Administration
    [announced](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=3914654cd1&e=cf669202c8)
    further reforms to the federal procurement process to help meet the
    President’s ambitious target and deliver new opportunities for Black
    owned and other small disadvantaged businesses.  
-   **Advancing Equitable Employment Outcomes and Boosting Wages for
    Black Federal Workers.** On June 25, 2021, President Biden signed an
    Executive Order on Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and
    Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce. This Executive Order
    launched a whole-of-government initiative to cultivate a federal
    workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation and that
    advances equitable employment opportunities for workers from
    underserved communities. Further, in 2021 the President signed a
    series of executive actions leading to a $15 minimum wage for
    employees of federal contractors and federal employees. These
    actions will impact more than 370,000 workers in 2022 alone, a
    population that is disproportionately Black, and takes a step
    towards addressing longstanding wage disparities.  
-   **Reversing Decades of Disinvestment Through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law.** For years, politicians have talked about
    investing in our national infrastructure, but up until now they have
    failed to follow through. The lack of investment has fallen most
    heavily on Black communities and other underserved communities. The
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will: replace lead pipes; increase
    access to training and good-quality jobs; expand affordable
    high-speed internet, reliable public transit, and clean drinking
    water; reconnect Black neighborhoods divided by legacy highway
    infrastructure; and provide other resources to finally give Black
    communities a fair shot at the American Dream.  
      
    During the 20<sup>th</sup> century, federally funded infrastructure
    projects too often segregated and harmed low-income communities,
    especially predominantly Black neighborhoods. Construction of the
    federal highway system in particular cut off once thriving Black
    communities from resources and opportunity.
    -   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law launched a new Reconnecting
        Communities program, which will invest $1 billion to help
        reconnect communities that were previously cut off from economic
        opportunities by transportation infrastructure. In addition, the
        Inflation Reduction Act includes $3 billion for the Neighborhood
        Access and Equity Grant Program to help advance transportation
        projects in disadvantaged or underserved communities. Over the
        past year, DOT has awarded grants to multiple projects to
        reconnect communities including an interstate capping project in
        Atlanta, a greenway project in St. Louis, and the I-375 Detroit
        Community Reconnection Project.
    -   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law permanently authorized the
        Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) for the first time
        since its inception and elevated the agency head to the position
        of Under Secretary, granting the agency expanded power to
        support Black- and other minority-owned businesses. Don Cravins
        – former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of
        the National Urban League – was unanimously confirmed by the
        Senate this August to serve in this post.
    -   EPA announced that it will allocate [$2.9
        billion](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=f840c7c7b9&e=cf669202c8)
        in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for lead service line
        replacement in 2022— the first allocation of $15 billion over
        five years dedicated to lead service line replacement. States
        can also leverage expanded eligibilities under the EPA’s
        Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) to spend up to $11.7
        billion in additional DWSRF funds on lead service line
        replacement, plus funds from the American Rescue Plan to work
        towards the Administration’s goal of replacing 100% of the lead
        pipes and service lines. EPA will encourage states to use these
        funds to advance proactive lead line replacement programs with a
        particular focus on disadvantaged communities, including Black
        communities. Moving forward, EPA will continue to encourage
        states to prioritize communities with the highest lead levels
        and those with environmental justice concerns.
    -   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is the largest ever investment
        in tackling legacy pollution in American history by: cleaning up
        Superfund and Brownfield sites; reclaiming abandoned mine land;
        and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. More than one in four
        Black Americans live within 3 miles of a [Superfund
        site](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=406ac95a00&e=cf669202c8)
        – a higher percentage than for Americans overall.  
-   **Assisting Black Land Owners in Resolving Title Issues.** An
    estimated 60% of Black-owned land in the South is heirs’
    property—property that passes through inheritance without a will and
    that, as a result, has historically rendered owners ineligible for
    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including lending.
    In July 2021, the USDA rolled out the Heirs’ Property Relending
    Program, which primarily aids underserved communities, including
    Black Americans. The new program provides funds to assist heirs in
    resolving ownership and succession issues on farmland with multiple
    owners.  
-   **Dismantling Barriers to Accessing USDA Programs and Services**. In
    February 2022, USDA launched an Equity Commission Advisory Committee
    using ARP funds. The Equity Commission Advisory Committee advises
    the Secretary of Agriculture by identifying USDA programs, policies,
    systems, structures, and practices that contribute to barriers to
    inclusion or access, systemic discrimination, or exacerbate or
    perpetuate racial, economic, health and social disparities.  
-   **Launched an initiative to cut fees for Americans.** In September
    2022, the President announced an initiative to reduce or eliminate
    hidden fees, charges, and add-ons for everything from banking
    services to cable and internet bills to airline and concert tickets.
    While the extra costs of junk fees affect everyone, they
    disproportionately impact lower income households and people of
    color. Agencies have already taken a number of steps: CFPB has
    issued guidance to restrict or ban a number of common banking
    practices, including credit card late fees, surprise overdraft fees,
    and depositor (or “bounced check”) fees, and FTC has initiated the
    rulemaking process that would broadly reduce junk fee practices
    across the economy, including for event ticketing, hotels, funeral
    homes, and any other industry that uses mandatory fees.  
-   **Reducing Barriers for Black Communities Facing Natural
    Disasters.** In
    [September](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=acd8fa07ee&e=cf669202c8)
    2021, FEMA implemented policy changes to reduce barriers that
    contributed to disparities experienced by Black Americans through
    programs that provide individual assistance to disaster survivors.
    These included changes to FEMA policies to make it easier for people
    living on heirs’ property – which is estimated to be the majority of
    Black-owned land in the South – to apply for disaster aid.

**Lowering Health Care Costs and Improving Health Outcomes for Black
Communities.** President Biden is committed to keeping health care costs
down for individuals and families and improving access to health care to
address disparities in Black communities. These policies and programs
include:

-   **Lowering Health Care Costs and Expanding Coverage.** Millions of
    lower- and middle-income Black families enrolled in health insurance
    marketplaces saw their premiums lowered or eliminated as a result of
    the ARP and will continue to benefit from provisions included in the
    Inflation Reduction Act. After substantially increasing Affordable
    Care Act Marketplace outreach and education, and with the American
    Rescue Plan’s enhanced and expanded premium tax credits, Black
    consumers saw a 49 percent increase in enrollment from 2020 to 2022.
    -   Almost [3.9 million Black
        people](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/)
        were uninsured in 2019 before President Biden took office and
        over [570,000 Black
        people](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/taking-a-closer-look-at-characteristics-of-people-in-the-coverage-gap/)
        fell into the Medicaid “coverage gap” and were locked out of
        coverage because their state refused to expand Medicaid. Since
        President Biden took office, the [uninsured rate has reached a
        new historic low of 8% and 5.2 million of Americans have gained
        health insurance
        coverage](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/08/02/new-hhs-report-shows-national-uninsured-rate-reached-all-time-low-in-2022.html).
        -   The Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower monthly premiums
            – more than three quarters of uninsured Black Americans had
            access to a plan with a monthly premium of $50 or less and
            about two thirds could find a plan for $0-premium plan in
            2021.
        -   By continuing the improvements made through ARP, the
            Inflation Reduction Act will help keep free or low-cost
            health insurance available. [Over half a million more Black
            Americans](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/What%20If%20the%20American%20Rescue%20Plan%20Act%20Premium%20Tax%20Credits%20Expire.pdf)
            will have health insurance coverage next year, compared to
            without the IRA.  
-   **Lowering Prescription Drug Costs.** Among adults 65 and older,
    Black Medicare beneficiaries were roughly 1.5 times as likely as
    White beneficiaries to have trouble affording medications, and about
    2 times as likely to not fill needed prescriptions due to cost. This
    law caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription
    drugs they buy at the pharmacy at $2,000 a year, caps the amount
    that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for a month’s
    supply, and will further lower prescription drug costs for seniors
    by allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of high-cost drugs and
    requiring drug manufacturers to pay Medicare a rebate when they
    raise prices faster than inflation.  
-   **Protecting Black Maternal Health.** The Administration is also
    committed to protecting Black moms and improving maternal health
    outcomes, including addressing the unacceptably high rates of
    maternal mortality and morbidity that disproportionately impact
    Black mothers and families.  
      
    In June 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration’s Blueprint for
    Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis was released to ensure a
    whole-of-government approach to combatting maternal mortality and
    morbidity through several key initiatives:
    -   The Administration has approved over a dozen state requests to
        extend Medicaid postpartum coverage for 12 months, including
        requests to take up the new state option under the ARP. The ARP
        gives states an easier pathway to extend coverage for pregnant
        women from 60 days to 12 months postpartum. To date, over
        250,000 people have gained coverage through these Medicaid
        postpartum extensions. The Administration continues to encourage
        all states to take up this option so women can get the care they
        need to stay healthy.
    -   In April 2021, President Biden issued the first ever
        [Presidential Proclamation on Black Maternal Health
        Week](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=3c9546a4cd&e=cf669202c8),
        calling on all Americans to recognize the importance of
        addressing the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity.
        The President issued a proclamation in April 2022 as well.
    -   Further, in December 2021, Vice President Harris
        [issued](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=42a57fd1ee&e=cf669202c8)
        a nationwide call to action to both public and private sectors
        to improve health outcomes for Black mothers and their children.
        As part of this call to action, the Centers for Medicare &
        Medicaid Services issued new guidance to help states provide 12
        months (up from 60 days currently) of continuous postpartum
        coverage through their Medicaid programs. If every state adopted
        an extension — as required in the President’s plans — then the
        number of Americans getting coverage for a full year postpartum
        would roughly double, extending coverage for an estimated
        720,000 people in a given year. HHS also announced plans to
        create a new “Birthing Friendly” hospital designation, which
        would be the first-ever hospital quality designation by HHS
        specifically focused on maternity care.  
    -   The Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis also
        includes:
        -   Improved Maternal Health Data: Through enhanced federal
            partnerships with state and local maternal health data
            collection entities, communities, hospitals, and researchers
            will have access to better data to they can analyze poor
            outcomes during pregnancy and make improvements to support
            healthy pregnancies.
        -   A More Diverse Maternal Care Workforce: Federal agencies
            will invest more in hiring, training, and deploying more
            physicians, certified nurse midwives, doulas, and community
            health workers to support women during pregnancy, delivery,
            and postpartum. The federal government will work to ensure
            these providers come from diverse communities and
            backgrounds.
        -   Better Access to Doulas and Midwives: The Administration
            will work with states to expand access to doulas and
            midwives, and encourage insurance companies to cover their
            services.  
-   **Protects Public Health.** Climate change disproportionately
    impacts low-income communities and communities of color. Through the
    Inflation Reduction Act, the law will create Environmental Justice
    Block Grants, and a dedicated program to tackle pollution in port
    communities – where air pollution is especially dense and deadly. It
    will also fund programs to reduce air pollution, including for
    fenceline monitoring and screening near industrial facilities, air
    quality sensors in disadvantaged communities, new and upgraded
    multipollutant monitoring sites, and monitoring and mitigation of
    methane and wood heater emissions. These grants will also help
    protect our children with investments to monitor and reduce
    pollution at public schools in disadvantaged communities.  
-   **White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health**. The
    Biden-Harris Administration hosted the first conference on hunger,
    nutrition, and health in more than 50 years and released a National
    Strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases and
    disparities by 2030. The National Strategy outlines actions the
    federal government will take and includes calls on other sectors to
    drive solutions to achieve the President’s goal. This includes:
    creating a pathway for free, healthy school meals for all; expanding
    coverage of nutrition and obesity counseling in Medicare and
    Medicaid; and ending the federal prohibition on SNAP benefits for
    formerly incarcerated individuals, which disproportionately impacts
    Black Americans. It also includes strategies to diversify the
    nutrition workforce, such as HHS partnering with HBCUs to recruit
    and train more Black nutrition professionals. The White House
    Conference galvanized stakeholders around the National Strategy and
    spurred over $8 billion in commitments from the public- and
    private-sectors.  
-   **Proposing Rules to Significantly Reduce Tobacco-Related Disease
    and Death:** Smoking product use is the leading cause of preventable
    death in the US. In April 2022, the Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA) announced [two proposed
    rules](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-proposes-rules-prohibiting-menthol-cigarettes-and-flavored-cigars-prevent-youth-initiation)
    to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. Studies estimate that
    banning menthol cigarettes could prevent as many as 654,000 deaths
    in the US – up to 238,000 among African Americans – over the next 40
    years. Banning flavored cigars – which are used by over half a
    million youth in the US – will help reduce nicotine dependence and
    improve health outcomes long-term.  
-   **Increasing Cultural Competence for Black Americans with
    Disabilities**. The Administration provided funding to create and
    maintain a national resource center on disability and equity to
    build capacity across the nation to be more inclusive and culturally
    competent towards individuals with disabilities.  The center will
    focus on resources to increase equitable access by: supporting
    forums for cross-cultural and cross-disability exchanges that will
    advance a culturally competent disability framework; translating
    research into action and disseminating information using multiple
    methods; developing tools, such as an organizational self-assessment
    tool, and supporting communities of practices for transforming
    systems and organizations; and building the next generation and
    future leaders of this work through engagement with youth with
    disabilities.  
-   **Building the Pipeline of Black Health Care Providers.** The
    Administration made a historic $1.5 billion investment to help grow
    and diversify the nation’s health care workforce, and bolster
    equitable health care in the communities that need it most during
    the COVID-19 pandemic and in the years to come. This funding is
    supporting the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and
    Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs. These
    programs address workforce shortages and health disparities by
    providing scholarship and loan repayment funding for health care
    students and professionals, in exchange for a service commitment in
    hard-hit and high-risk communities.  With funding from the American
    Rescue Plan, the investment supports over 22,700 providers—the
    largest field strength in history for these programs and a record
    number of skilled doctors, dentists, nurses, and behavioral health
    providers committed to working in underserved communities during a
    moment when we need them the most. Only about 5 percent of
    physicians in the United States identify as Black despite the fact
    that Black Americans account for 12 percent of the nation’s total
    population; over 13 percent of physicians serving through the
    National Health Service Corps identify as Black.  
-   **Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.** President Biden
    released a new National HIV/AIDS Strategy to provide the framework
    and direction for the Administration’s policies, research, programs,
    and planning through 2025 and lead us toward ending the HIV epidemic
    in the United States by 2030. The new National HIV/AIDS Strategy
    incorporates the latest data on HIV incidence, prevalence and
    trends; expands the focus on addressing the social determinants of
    health that influence an individual’s HIV risk or outcomes;
    encourages reform of state HIV criminalization laws; adds a new
    focus on opportunities to engage the private sector in novel and
    important ways in the nation’s work to end the HIV epidemic.  
-   **Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response.** The ARP provided $160
    billion for the vaccines, tests, personal protective equipment, and
    public health workforce needed to address the spread of COVID-19, an
    investment that is helping to drive down racial disparities in
    prevention and care. Due to the ARP and the President’s commitment
    to center equity in our vaccination effort, multiple studies show
    that the gap in COVID-19 vaccination rates in Black adults compared
    to White and Latino adults has closed. Data as of June 2022 show
    that 86% of Black adults, 85% of Latinos and 86% of White adults
    have received at least one shot, compared to 56%, 57%, and 65%,
    respectively, in May 2021.
    -   In January 2021, President Biden signed an [Executive
        Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=03fb5b89f7&e=cf669202c8)
        on Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery,
        creating a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to provide specific
        recommendations to the President for mitigating the health
        inequities caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and
        for preventing such inequities in the future. The Task force
        transmitted its final report to the White House Office of the
        COVID-19 Response in November 2021, including recommendations
        related to interpersonal stress linked to racism, addressing the
        behavioral health consequences of the pandemic in communities of
        color, and vaccine, testing, and therapeutics access and
        confidence. By the end of 2021, the Administration had begun
        action on over 80 percent of the Task Force recommendations, and
        remains committed to engaging these recommendations within the
        historic initiatives and programs built to promote and sustain
        equity across the federal government. In 2022, the
        Administration is working to ensure our progress on COVID-19
        equity is reflected and embedded in U.S. health policy more
        broadly. 

The Administration built channels to increase access in our hardest-hit,
highest-risk communities with funding from the American Rescue Plan.
President Biden centered equity in his historic vaccine effort, going
into communities to close the racial vaccination gap to make sure all
Black Americans — no matter where they live, no matter what their
circumstance has access to vaccines:

-   Offering new, updated COVID-19 vaccines for free at tens of
    thousands of trusted locations, with convenient appointment and
    walk-in hours: The Administration has secured over 170 million doses
    of the updated COVID-19 vaccines, which were made available to the
    American people for free at tens of thousands of convenient
    locations nationwide, including pharmacies, doctor’s offices, health
    centers, and state and local health departments. Americans can visit
    Vaccines.gov to find locations with the new, updated vaccines near
    them—with more locations and appointments becoming available in the
    coming days and weeks.
-   Engaging community organizations to reach people with trusted
    information on the new, updated COVID-19 vaccines. Building on the
    successful efforts that have gotten over 600 million shots in arms
    since January 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services is
    engaging national, regional, and local community-based
    organizations, and houses of worship, including those with strong
    reach among racial and ethnic minority communities, to host
    community health expos and vaccine drives in cities. Over 50% of
    vaccines administered at the federally-run community vaccination
    centers went to Black Americans and other people of color, and more
    than 75% of people vaccinated at Community Health Centers are people
    of color. This continued collaboration will help meet people where
    they are, and foster conversations with trusted members of their
    communities.
-   **Expanding crisis response and access to treatment.**  Our country
    faces an unprecedented mental health crisis among people of all
    ages. Two out of five adults report symptoms of anxiety or
    depression. And, Black and brown communities are disproportionately
    undertreated – even as their burden of mental illness has continued
    to rise. Ensuring timely access to crisis intervention saves lives.
    -   In July, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and
        the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) [successfully
        transitioned to the new easy to remember number
        9-8-8](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/policy-value-based-care/news/21280395/hhs-releases-data-on-transition-to-988-suicide-and-crisis-lifeline),
        making it easier for individuals in crisis to access life-saving
        crisis counseling. The Biden Administration has invested $432
        million – an 18-fold increase in federal support – to help
        states with the transition and launch of the program, providing
        critical resources to help ensure access to trained crisis
        counselors via phone, chat, and text.

**Promoting Mental Health for Black Youth**. Studies have documented
that over the past decade rates of mental illness and substance use
disorder have increased among Black youth 12-17 hears of age. Studies
have also shown that Black children under 13 years are twice as likely
to die by suicide than White peers. In March 2022, and in support of the
President’s strategy for tackling the mental health crisis, the
Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health
announced $3 million in funding for up to 8 awards to evaluate the
effectiveness of general health and wellness policies for improving
Black youth mental health. These awards complement the ongoing work
within the SAMHSA funded [African American Behavioral Health Center of
Excellence](https://africanamericanbehavioralhealth.org/about/about-us.aspx),
which provides resources and tools to promote greater equity and
effectiveness in behavioral health services for African Americans.  
  
**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity in K-12 Schools and an
Education Beyond High School.** President Biden has delivered the
support necessary to enable every school to return to full-time,
in-person instruction; accelerate academic achievement; address the
mental health needs of students; and build school communities where all
students feel they belong. At the same time, President Biden has made
college more affordable and ensured college students are supported
through completion. He has also worked to ensure equitable access to
high-quality education for Black students. These policies and programs
include:

-   **Historic Investments to Safely Reopen Schools and Address the
    Needs of Students.** The American Rescue Plan provided $130 billion
    to help elementary and secondary schools safely reopen and address
    the academic, social and emotional and mental health needs of all
    students, with funding set-aside to address the needs of students
    disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including Black
    students. The Administration’s efforts to encourage and support all
    schools in adopting the CDC’s recommendations on COVID-19 prevention
    and mitigation – including COVID-19 vaccination for staff, students,
    and school communities – have been critical in getting schools
    safely reopened and remaining open, including in Black communities
    hit hard by COVID-19. In addition to funding the implementation of
    COVID-19 protocols, these funds are being used to provide tutors,
    establish and expand summer and after-school programming, and
    provide a wide range of supports that address the needs of Black
    students. They are also being used to hire counselors and social
    workers.  
      
    With the help of American Rescue Plan funds, today all schools in
    America have reopened, and virtually all remain open every school
    day with the supports they received from the Biden-Harris
    Administration providing crucial protections for students, staff,
    and families. Additionally, the number of social workers in public
    schools have increased by 67% and the number of counselors by 18%,
    relative to the years before the pandemic. The availability of funds
    for this purpose particularly benefits Black students; [schools
    where more than half of students are students of color have higher
    student to counselor and student to school psychologist ratios than
    those serving majority-white
    schools](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019020.pdf). It also provided
    funds to every Head Start grantee, which disproportionately serve
    Black children and families, so that grantees could safely open
    safely for in-person services and support children and families
    through the pandemic.
-   **Providing Black Borrowers with Student Debt Relief.** President
    Biden believes that a post-high school education should be a ticket
    to a middle-class life, but for too many Black Americans, the cost
    of borrowing for college is a lifelong burden that deprives them of
    that opportunity. President Biden released a three-part plan to
    provide more breathing room to America’s working families as they
    continue to recover from the strains associated with the COVID-19
    pandemic:
    -   **Provide targeted debt relief to address the financial harms of
        the pandemic, fulfilling the President’s campaign commitment.**
        The Department of Education will provide up to $20,000 in debt
        cancellation to Pell Grant recipients with loans held by the
        Department of Education, and up to $10,000 in debt relief to
        non-Pell Grant recipients. Borrowers are eligible for this
        relief if their individual income is less than $125,000
        ($250,000 for married couples). More than 70% of Black
        undergraduate borrowers are Pell Grant recipients and Black
        borrowers are twice as likely to have received Pell Grants
        compared to their white peers. No high-income individual or
        high-income household – in the top 5% of incomes – will benefit
        from this action. By targeting relief to borrowers with the
        highest economic need, the Administration’s actions are also
        likely to help narrow the racial wealth gap.
    -   **Make the student loan system more manageable for current and
        future borrowers.** These steps include:
        -   Cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans.
            The Department of Education is proposing a new income-driven
            repayment plan that protects more low-income borrowers from
            making any payments and caps monthly payments for
            undergraduate loans at 5% of a borrower’s discretionary
            income—half of the rate that borrowers must pay now under
            most existing plans. This means that the average annual
            student loan payment will be lowered by more than $1,000 for
            both current and future borrowers.
        -   Fixing the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)
            program by issuing a rule that borrowers who have worked at
            a nonprofit, in the military, or in federal, state, Tribal,
            or local government, receive appropriate credit toward loan
            forgiveness. These improvements build on temporary changes
            the Department of Education made to PSLF, under which more
            than 235,000 public servants have already had more than $14
            billion in loan forgiveness approved.  
-   **Protect future students and taxpayers by reducing the cost of
    college and holding schools accountable when they hike up prices.**
    The President championed the largest increase to Pell Grants in the
    last decade – a $400 increase in the maximum award for students in
    the 2022-2023 school year – and has a plan to double the maximum
    Pell Grant by 2029 to nearly $13,000. To further reduce the cost of
    college, the President will continue to fight to make community
    college free. Meanwhile, colleges have an obligation to keep prices
    reasonable and ensure borrowers get value for their investments, not
    debt they cannot afford. This Administration has already taken key
    steps to strengthen accountability, including in areas where the
    previous Administration weakened rules such as holding career
    colleges accountable for leaving their students with mountains of
    debt that they cannot repay.  
-   **Protecting Students from Funding Cuts.** The ARP’s Elementary and
    Secondary School Emergency Relief program includes a first of its
    kind maintenance of equity requirement to ensure that high-poverty
    school districts and schools are protected in the event of state or
    local education funding cuts. The Department of Education has
    provided resources and technical assistance to states and school
    districts as they implement this new requirement, which will ensure
    that school districts and schools serving a large share of students
    from low-income backgrounds will not experience disproportionate
    cuts, and that school districts with the highest poverty levels do
    not experience any decrease in state per-pupil funding below their
    pre-pandemic level.  
-   **Increasing Funding for Schools in Low-Income Communities.** The
    FY22 Omnibus included an additional $1 billion in funding for Title
    I – the largest increase in over a decade, which provides funding
    for schools serving students in low-income communities. The
    President’s FY23 Budget includes an additional $19 billion for Title
    I, addressing long-standing funding disparities between
    under-resourced schools—which disproportionately serve Black
    students —and their wealthier counterparts. The President’s proposal
    includes funding for states to voluntarily establish commissions to
    identify and create plans to address inequities in their education
    funding systems and gaps in access to educational opportunity.  
-   **Providing Historic Support for Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities (HBCUs).** The Biden-Harris Administration has
    delivered an historic $5.8 billion cumulative investment in and
    support for HBCUs, including:
    -   The ARP and other pandemic relief programs have provided
        approximately $3.7 billion to HBCUs since President Biden took
        office.
    -   In April 2021, the Department of Education provided
        approximately $1.6 billion in debt relief to 45 HBCUs, including
        13 public institutions and 32 private institutions.
    -   In July and August of 2021, the Department of Education awarded
        more than $500 million in grant funding to HBCUs for academic
        capacity-building and fiscal stability.
    -   This year, the Department of Education has awarded Project
        School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) grants to
        six HBCUs that experienced bomb threats.  
-   **Re-establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing
    Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for
    Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).** In September
    2021, President Biden signed a Executive Order re-establishing the
    White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence,
    and Economic Opportunity for HBCUs, which will create a
    government-wide approach to support the needs of HBCUs and the
    communities they serve and eliminate systemic barriers impeding HBCU
    participation in Federal programs.  The Executive Order helps to
    strengthen the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality
    education for students, increase opportunities for these
    institutions to participate in and benefit from Federal programs,
    and ensure that HBCUs can continue to be engines of opportunity.  
-   **Re-establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing
    Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Black
    Americans.** In October 2021, President Biden signed a Executive
    Order reestablishing and expanding the White House Initiative on
    Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity
    for Black Americans. The Initiative works to strengthen the Nation
    by improving educational outcomes for Black Americans of all ages,
    and to help ensure that all African Americans receive an education
    that properly prepares them for college and productive careers. The
    Initiative manages a cross-agency effort to improve student
    achievement and advance educational equity and economic opportunity
    for African American and Black students, families, and communities.

**Appointing and Confirming a Historic Number of Black Women to the
Bench.** President Biden is committed to ensuring that the judiciary is
filled with highly qualified individuals who bring both personal and
professional diversity to the bench. Since January 2021, President Biden
has nominated a total of 144 individuals for federal judgeships, 46 of
whom are African American, and 15 individuals for local judgeships in
Washington, D.C., 6 of whom are African American. In April 2022, Ketanji
Brown Jackson was confirmed by the United States Senate as Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court, the first Black woman to ever serve on the
Court. Of the 86 individuals who have been confirmed to positions on
federal courts, 24 are African American.  
  
**Launching a Whole-Of-Government Initiative to Advance Equity and
Justice for Underserved Communities, Including Black Communities.** On
his first day in office, President Biden signed the historic Executive
Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities
Through the Federal Government. The President’s Order emphasized the
enormous human costs of systemic racism, persistent poverty, and other
disparities, and directed the Federal Government to advance an ambitious
whole-of-government equity agenda that matches the scale of the
challenges we face as a country and the opportunities we have to build a
more perfect union. Over 90 federal agencies across the federal
government, including all Cabinet-level agencies as well as over 50
independent agencies, conducted equity assessments of 3-5 of their
agency’s high-impact services for the American people, to uncover where
systemic barriers to access may exist. Using those findings, agencies
developed Equity Action Plans for addressing—and achieving—equity in
their mission delivery for all Americans. Equity Action Plans were
required to include accountability mechanisms and to identify success
metrics and key milestones toward progress.  
  
**Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the
Federal Government.** In June 2021, President Biden signed an Executive
Order on Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in
the Federal Workforce, that is helping develop a Federal workforce that
looks like America where qualified people from every background and walk
of life have an equal opportunity to serve our Nation.  
  
**Making the promise of equal justice a reality for all.** President
Biden believes that our criminal justice system must respect the dignity
and rights of all persons and adhere to our fundamental obligation to
ensure fair and impartial justice for all. This is imperative—not only
to live up to our principles as a Nation, but also to build secure,
safe, and healthy communities. President Biden believes that it is time
that we acknowledge the legacy of systemic racism in our criminal
justice system and work together to eliminate the racial disparities
that endure to this day. Doing so serves all Americans.

-   **Reforming Federal Marijuana Laws to Promote Equity and Fairness in
    the Justice System.**  As President Biden repeatedly said during his
    campaign, no one should be in jail for using or possessing
    marijuana. Sending people to prison for possessing marijuana has
    upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many
    states no longer prohibit. In addition, although white and Black,
    and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown
    people have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted at
    disproportionate rates. The President recently took three steps to
    end this failed approach and to begin to right these wrongs:  
    -   Announcing a pardon of all prior Federal offenses of simple
        possession of marijuana, including offenses under District of
        Columbia law. There are thousands of people who have prior
        Federal convictions for marijuana possession, who may be denied
        employment, housing, or educational opportunities as a result. 
        This action will help relieve the collateral consequences
        arising from these convictions.
    -   Urging all Governors to pardon state offenses of simple
        marijuana possession, because just as no one should be in a
        Federal prison solely for possessing marijuana, no one should be
        in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either.
    -   Asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the
        Attorney General to begin the administrative process to review
        expeditiously how marijuana is scheduled under Federal law.
        Marijuana is currently classified in Schedule I of the
        Controlled Substances Act, the same classification as heroin and
        LSD and higher than fentanyl and methamphetamine, the drugs
        driving our overdose epidemic.

Finally, even as federal and state regulation of marijuana changes,
important limitations on trafficking, marketing, and under-age sales
should stay in place. 

-   **Implementing Historic Executive Order on Policing and Criminal
    Justice Reform.** On May 25, 2022 – the second anniversary of the
    murder of George Floyd – the President signed an [executive
    order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/05/25/executive-order-on-advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and-public-safety/)
    (EO) to advance effective, accountable policing and criminal justice
    practices to enhance public trust and public safety. The EO makes
    good on the President’s promise to do more to ensure that our Nation
    lives up to its founding promise of fair and impartial justice for
    all under the law, which he made after Senate Republicans rejected
    even modest reforms supported by many in law enforcement in the
    course of negotiating the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.  The
    EO, a summary of which can be found
    [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-historic-executive-order-to-advance-effective-accountable-policing-and-strengthen-public-safety/),
    promotes accountability, raises standards, increases transparency,
    and helps reform the criminal justice system.  It requires all
    federal law enforcement agencies to raise use of force standards and
    ban chokeholds and carotid restraints; restrict the use of no-knock
    entries; adopt body worn camera policies; contribute records to a
    new national law enforcement accountability database; and adopting
    new standards to screen and vet officers for promotion of unlawful
    violence, white supremacy, and bias on the basis of protected
    characteristics.  In addition, the EO directs the Attorney General
    and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue
    guidance and identify federal resources for innovative models to
    respond to persons in crisis, including co-responder and alternative
    responder models, community-based crisis centers, and post-crisis
    care. It also orders guidance on the use of pharmacological agents
    such as ketamine outside the hospital setting.    
-   **Ensuring Constitutional Policing.** The Department of Justice
    (DOJ) rescinded guidance issued in the previous Administration that
    curtailed the use of consent decrees, including within
    investigations into patterns or practices of discrimination and
    misconduct by police departments. Pattern and practice
    investigations and consent decrees are critical tools to promote
    constitutional policing in jurisdictions where reform is warranted.
    DOJ has opened six such investigations in Minneapolis, Louisville,
    Phoenix, Mount Vernon, New York City, and Louisiana in addition to
    its investigation into alleged discriminatory hiring by the Maryland
    State Police.  
-   **Improving Prosecutorial Guidance to Prevent Unduly Harsh
    Sentencing.** The DOJ withdrew guidance issued in the previous
    Administration that required prosecutors to always charge the
    harshest sentences, replacing it with guidance that restored
    discretion to make decisions about charging, plea agreements, and
    advocacy at sentencing based on an individualized assessment of
    relevant facts.  
-   **Supporting Legislation to End Racial Disparities in Cocaine
    Sentencing.** As President Biden first advocated in 2007, he
    continues to call on Congress to end once and for all the racially
    discriminatory crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity and make
    the change fully retroactive. This step would provide immediate
    sentencing relief to the 10,000 individuals, more than 90 percent of
    whom are Black, currently serving time in federal prison pursuant to
    the crack/powder disparity. The Administration has urged the swift
    passage of the EQUAL Act.  
-   **Implementing an Executive Order Limiting Use of Private Prisons.**
    The President ordered DOJ not to renew contracts for
    privately-operated criminal detention facilities, covering the
    Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). To date,
    over 8,000 people have been moved out of privately owned or operated
    facilities.  
-   **Initiating a whole-of-government effort to promote reform of the
    criminal justice system.**  The President’s Policing EO also created
    a new interagency Alternatives and Reentry Committee to produce and
    execute on a strategic plan that will safely reduce unnecessary
    criminal justice system interactions, improve rehabilitation, and
    support successful reentry while addressing existing disparities in
    the federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial juvenile and
    criminal justice systems.  
-   **Supporting Reentry of Returning Citizens.** In April 2022, in
    honor of Second Chance Month, the President
    [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-expands-second-chance-opportunities-for-formerly-incarcerated-persons/)
    grants of clemency to 78 individuals, along with a series of [over
    20 actions from a dozen federal
    agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-expands-second-chance-opportunities-for-formerly-incarcerated-persons/)
    to support returning citizens.   
    -   To expand employment opportunities, the Administration is also
        leveraging historic investments in infrastructure to promote the
        hiring of formerly incarcerated persons, using over $5 billion
        in grant programs in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
        prioritize grantees who hire formerly incarcerated persons and
        other historically marginalized groups.
    -   The Department of Justice and Department of Labor announced a
        first-of-its-kind collaboration to invest $145 million over
        FY22-23 to provide job skills training and intensive
        individualized employment and reentry plans for people
        incarcerated in select Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities to
        enhance their successful return to their communities. 
    -   To protect equal housing opportunity, the Department of Housing
        and Urban Development is undertaking a comprehensive review to
        identify changes to its programs to ensure that they
        appropriately include individuals with arrest and conviction
        records.
    -   To expand educational opportunities, the Department of Education
        expanded its Second Chance Pell Program, which provides Pell
        Grants to incarcerated students, to 73 schools that will educate
        thousands of additional students. This raises the total number
        of participating schools to 200 and will help the Department
        prepare for the full expansion of Pell Grant eligibility to
        incarcerated students in July 2023.
    -   The Department of Labor also opened solicitations for $140
        million in new grant funding for justice-involved youth and
        adults.
    -   The Department of Health and Human Services is starting the
        process to establish a Special Enrollment Period for Medicare
        for people who miss their enrollment periods while incarcerated,
        which will reduce coverage gaps and penalties for people
        returning home from prison.
    -   To support veterans, a new collaboration among the Social
        Security Administration, Bureau of Prisons, and the Department
        of Veterans Affairs will automate information-sharing among
        these agencies, accelerating the restoration of benefits and
        reducing red tape for returning veterans.

**Advancing Public Safety for Black Communities.** President Biden
believes that the surge in gun violence that has affected communities
across the country is unacceptable, and his Administration is acting
decisively with a whole-of-government approach. Black Americans are
[disproportionately
harmed](https://efsgv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019CDCdata.pdf) by the
direct and indirect consequences of gun violence, which causes lasting
trauma for children, families, and communities. The President continues
to call on Congress to take action to end this gun violence epidemic.
But he knows we cannot afford to wait a single day while lives are being
taken, which is why he has taken more action to reduce gun violence than
any other President at this point in their Administration. These
policies and programs include:

-   **Passing the First Commonsense Gun Safety Law in 30 years.** In
    June 2022, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities
    Act into law. It includes actions he has long called for and that
    will save lives, including funding crisis intervention, including
    red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a
    danger to themselves and to others; finally closing what’s known as
    the “boyfriend loophole,” so if you assault your girlfriend or
    boyfriend you cannot buy or own a gun; requires young people aged
    18-21 to undergo enhanced background checks; includes the first
    federal law that makes gun trafficking and straw purchases distinct
    federal crimes; clarifies who needs to register as a federally
    licensed gun dealer and run background checks before selling a gun;
    provides historic funding to address the youth mental health crisis
    in this country, especially the trauma experienced by survivors of
    gun violence; and invests in anti-violence programs to work directly
    with people who are most likely to commit gun crimes or become
    victims of gun crimes. President Biden continues to call on Congress
    to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require
    background checks for all gun sales, and repeal gun manufacturer
    immunity.
-   **Additional Funding to Prevent and Fight Crime.** The President’s
    FY 2023 budget and his Safer America Plan requests new funding to
    recruit, train, and hire police officers consistent with the
    standards in the President’s Executive Order to advance safe,
    effective, accountable, community policing in order to enhance
    public trust and public safety; and to invest in crime prevention
    and a fairer criminal justice, including by investing $20 billion in
    services that address the root causes of crime and by incentivizing
    the reform of laws that increase incarceration without redressing
    public safety.
-   **Keeping Especially Dangerous Weapons and Repeat Shooters Off Our
    Streets.** The Justice Department issued a final rule to rein in the
    proliferation of ghost guns, which are un-serialized, privately made
    firearms that are increasingly being recovered at crime scenes. The
    Attorney General directed every U.S. Attorney’s Office nationwide to
    increase resources dedicated to district-specific violent crime
    strategies.
-   **Keeping Guns Out of the Wrong Hands.** The Justice Department
    published model extreme risk protection order legislation to make it
    easier for states that want to adopt these red flag laws to do so.
    The Justice Department also issued a series of reforms: the first
    volume of its new, comprehensive report on firearms commerce and
    trafficking; new policy to underscore zero tolerance for willful
    violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that
    put public safety at risk; and the launch of five new law
    enforcement strike forces focused on addressing significant firearms
    trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York, Chicago,
    Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C.
-   **Tackling and Preventing Violence Crime through Community Violence
    Intervention (CVI) Programs.** Black boys and young men ages 15-34
    make up 2% of the population but are 37% of homicide victims, and
    homicide is the leading cause of death for Black men under the age
    of 45. Until this Administration, however, CVI programs like
    violence interrupters and hospital-based programs, which are
    demonstrated to reduce violence by up to 60%, have been badly
    underfunded. Under President Biden, the Treasury Department and
    Education Department issued guidance stating that CVI programs are
    eligible uses of American Rescue Plan funds—both the $350 billion in
    aid to state, Tribal, and local governments and the $122 billion to
    school districts. The Administration pivoted 26 existing grant
    programs across five agencies to support CVI.  President Biden
    secured $100 million in the first-ever dedicated CVI funding in
    Fiscal Year 2022 and continues to seek $5 billion in dedicated
    funding for CVI programs. These historic funds, along with new
    funding to support accountable, community-oriented policing, would
    help curtail the epidemic of gun violence that hits Black
    communities hardest. 
-   **Addressing Domestic Violent Extremism.** President Biden directed
    the U.S. government to assess the threat of domestic violent
    extremism in the United States. In January, Secretary of the
    Department of Defense (DOD) Lloyd J. Austin III ordered a DOD-wide
    stand down to discuss the problem of extremism in the ranks, and in
    April he established a countering extremism working group, directing
    DOD officials to review and update the definition of extremism
    contained in [DOD Instruction
    1325.06](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=ed5a029c91&e=cf669202c8),
    and calling on the services to update transition instructions to
    prevent those leaving the military from being recruited by extremist
    groups. In March 2021, the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence released the unclassified executive summary of the
    comprehensive assessment acknowledging that enduring domestic
    violent extremism motivations stem from biases against minority
    populations. In April 2021, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
    Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ordered an internal review to root out
    white supremacy and extremism within DHS.
-   **United We Stand Summit.** The Biden-Harris Administration hosted
    the United We Stand Summit to counter the corrosive effects of
    hate-fueled violence on our democracy and public safety. The Summit
    featured survivors and leaders from communities impacted by
    hate-fueled violence, including the mass shootings in Buffalo and at
    the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. The Administration
    announced a historic package of new actions the federal government,
    civic communities, faith communities, and business leaders will take
    to address hate-fueled violence and advance national unity. These
    included the establishment of the White House Initiative on
    Hate-Motivated Violence to strengthen interagency coordination,
    leverage federal research and resources, and enhance engagement in
    preventing and responding to hate-motivated violence, as well as the
    mobilization of over $1 billion in new investments to increase
    support for programs that build bridges among Americans of different
    backgrounds to foster unity. Bipartisan former White House officials
    also launched Dignity.US, a Citizens’ Initiative to Address
    Hate-Fueled Violence in America, to foster dialogue in communities
    across the country and identify solutions to address hate-fueled
    violence.
-   **Expanding Access to Justice.** To expand the promise of equal
    justice under law, the President issued a Presidential Memorandum in
    May 2021 that
    [asked](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=32f2f54d32&e=cf669202c8)
    the Attorney General to consider expanding the Department of
    Justice’s access to justice work and that reinvigorated the White
    House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable to prioritize and expand
    access to legal services and federal programs in criminal and civil
    legal proceedings. In October 2021, the Attorney General announced
    the reestablishment of the Office for Access to Justice as a
    standalone component within the Justice Department dedicated to
    improving the federal government’s understanding of and capacity to
    address the most urgent legal needs of communities across America.
    In May 2022, the Attorney General announced the office’s Director
    and its efforts to address the housing and eviction crisis, ensure
    equal access to justice for veterans and service members, and reduce
    and remove barriers to successful reentry for previously
    incarcerated individuals.  

**Using Executive Authority to Protect Voting Rights and Democracy.**
These policies and programs include:

-   **Implementing Executive Order Promoting Access to Voter
    Registration and Voting.** On the 2021 anniversary of Bloody Sunday,
    President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=1d4d1ebc06&e=cf669202c8)
    to leverage the resources of the federal government to provide
    information about the election process and increased access to voter
    registration opportunities. Agencies across the federal government
    have [announced
    steps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-report-on-native-american-voting-rights/)
    they are taking to respond to the President’s call for an
    all-of-government action to enhance the ability of all eligible
    Americans to participate in our democracy, including the Centers for
    Medicare & Medicaid Services’ [recent
    commitment](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=280f4a922c&e=cf669202c8)
    to make it easier for consumers using HealthCare.gov to connect to
    voter registration services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs’
    commitment to a pilot project seeking to have VA Medical Centers
    formally designated as voter registration agencies in six states.
-   **Pressing Legislation to Protect the Right to Vote.** President
    Biden recognizes the anti-democratic impact of state attacks on
    voting and judicial decisions gutting the Voting Rights Act and has
    repeatedly stressed the need for Congress to protect the right to
    vote and fight discrimination in the electoral process. President
    Biden has repeatedly and forcefully pressed for passage of critical
    protective legislation, including the John Lewis Voting Rights
    Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.  And when a minority of
    Senators representing a minority of Americans blocked these historic
    voting rights bills from getting even a debate, President Biden
    called for a change in the Senate rules to defend our democracy. 
-   **Ensuring Compliance with Voting Rights Laws.** The Department of
    Justice has taken strong action to help protect the right to vote,
    including doubling the number of voting rights attorneys, taking
    steps to ensure compliance with voting rights statutes, launching a
    task force to combat the increase of threats against election
    officials and election workers, and issuing guidance on (1) the
    civil and criminal statutes that apply to post-election audits, (2)
    methods of voting, including early voting and voting by mail, (3)
    the vote-dilution protections that apply to all jurisdictions under
    Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as they engage in redistricting,
    and (4) the state voting rules that apply after criminal
    convictions.

**Restoring Fairness and Humanity to Our Immigration System.** 
President Biden is committed to reforming our immigration system,
promoting racial equity in our immigration policies, and providing legal
protections for Black noncitizens who call this country home.

-   **Revoking the Discriminatory Muslim and African Ban.** On his first
    day in office, President Biden signed a Proclamation revoking the
    previous administration’s discriminatory Muslim and African Ban, a
    policy that was rooted in racial and religious animus and
    xenophobia.
-   **Restarting the Haitian Family Reunification Parole (HFRP)
    Program.** The Obama-Biden Administration created the HFRP Program
    in 2014, allowing U.S. citizens and permanent residents to apply for
    parole on behalf of family members in Haiti who have approved
    immigrant visa petitions.  The prior administration announced the
    termination of this program in 2019.  The Biden-Harris
    Administration restored the HFRP Program and remains committed to
    helping Haitian-American families reunify in our country.
-   **Extending, Re-designating, or Designating, Cameroon, Ethiopia,
    Haiti, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan for Temporary Protected
    Status (TPS).**  The Administration extended legal protections to
    nationals of these countries who have lived in the United States for
    years.  TPS is a form of immigration relief available to noncitizens
    in the United States who cannot return home due to dangerous
    conditions in their home countries; it enables those individuals to
    live with their families and work in our communities without fear of
    removal.
-   **Promoting Naturalization.** President Biden is committed to making
    the naturalization process more accessible for eligible noncitizens,
    directing the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
    and the Secretary of State to improve naturalization processing,
    identify and remove barriers to naturalization, and reduce backlogs
    for naturalization applications. To advance these goals, the
    President also established an Interagency Working Group to Promote
    Naturalization. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, U.S. Citizenship and
    Immigration Services (USCIS) awarded nearly $60 million in grants to
    66 organizations to provide citizenship preparation resources,
    support, and information to immigrants and immigrant-serving
    organizations.
-   **Supporting Immigrant Veterans.** The Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA) has partnered with DHS to provide needed care and
    services to deported veterans, including timely and accurate
    information on immigration services. In addition, DHS established an
    online center to consolidate federal resources for immigrant
    veterans, which includes a portal for deported veterans requesting
    permission to return to the United States or accessing VA benefits
    to which they may be entitled.
-   **Supporting Immigration Reform Legislation.**  President Biden
    remains committed to passing broad-based legislation to finally
    reform our broken immigration system. These reforms would provide a
    pathway to citizenship to millions of undocumented individuals,
    including Black noncitizens.
