  \ Fumio of\_Japan"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. today met with Japanese Prime Minister
Kishida Fumio in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. In the meeting, President Biden
reinforced the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of
Japan following recent destabilizing ballistic missile tests by the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), including the long-range
ballistic missile launch over Japan on October 3. The two leaders
condemned these provocative acts and as well as the DPRK’s continued
development of its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missile programs. They reiterated their resolve to maintain peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait and to continue to impose costs on
Russia for its unprovoked war on Ukraine. President Biden thanked Prime
Minister Kishida for his powerful voice against the threat of use of
nuclear weapons, noting that the Prime Minister’s declaration that “any
use of a nuclear weapon would be an act of hostility against humanity”
has resonated around the world.

Standing together for peace, stability and prosperity in the face of
historic challenges, the two leaders resolved to further strengthen and
modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance to address threats to the free and
open Indo-Pacific. President Biden applauded Prime Minister Kishida’s
determination to substantially increase investments in defense
capabilities. They emphasized the importance of defending the
rules-based economic order in the face of threats including economic
coercion, predatory debt and supply chain uncertainties and resolved to
address these issues together, including through advancing our
negotiations in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.

President Biden assured the Prime Minister that Japan has the full
support of the United States to ensure the success of Japan’s
multilateral leadership roles in 2023, including as a member of the
United Nations Security Council and as host of the G7. The President
looked forward to visiting the Prime Minister’s home town of Hiroshima
in May for the G7 Leaders’ Summit.
