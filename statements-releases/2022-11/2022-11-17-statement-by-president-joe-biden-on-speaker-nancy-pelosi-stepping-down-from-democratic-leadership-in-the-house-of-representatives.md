title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden On Speaker Nancy Pelosi Stepping Down from\
  \ Democratic Leadership in the House of\_Representatives"
---
 
When I think of Nancy Pelosi, I think of dignity.  
   
History will note she is the most consequential Speaker of the House of
Representatives in our history. There are countless examples of how she
embodies the obligation of elected officials to uphold their oath to God
and country to ensure our democracy delivers and remains a beacon to the
world. In everything she does, she reflects a dignity in her actions and
a dignity she sees in the lives of the people of this nation.  
   
In 2007, she made history as the first woman Speaker, but that was just
the beginning of the history she has made during her four terms. I know
because I’ve seen her in action during my career as Senator, Vice
President, and now as President. With Nancy, you see a father’s daughter
who learned by his side how to win and govern. With her leading the way,
you never worry about whether a bill will pass. If she says she has the
votes, she has the votes.  Every time.  
   
History will record her leadership with President Obama to rescue the
economy in crisis from the Great Recession. With her sheer will, passing
the Affordable Care Act to ensure health care is a right not a
privilege.  Ending Don’t Ask Don’t Tell so patriotic Americans can serve
the country they love no matter who they love. The list goes on,
including her leadership in defending democracy and advancing human
rights around the world.  
   
In the first two years of my presidency, she is a singular force
securing once-in-a-generation bills that will define our nation for
decades to come. The American Rescue Plan to get us through COVID-19.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to rebuild our roads and bridges. The
CHIPS and Science Act to ensure the most advanced manufacturing is done
here in America. The most significant gun safety law in nearly thirty
years – for the children. One of the most significant bills helping
veterans and their families exposed to toxic materials. And, the
Inflation Reduction Act that took on Big Pharma and won, and reflects
the most aggressive action ever to tackle the climate crisis.  
   
Because of Nancy Pelosi, the lives of millions and millions of Americans
are better, even in districts represented by Republicans who voted
against her bills and too often vilify her. That’s Nancy – always
working for the dignity of all of the people. And, as a fierce defender
of democracy through our laws, history will also note her fierceness and
resolve to protect our democracy from the violent, deadly insurrection
of January 6<sup>th</sup>. It’s a threat of political violence and
intimidation that continues and she and her family know all too well,
but that will never stop her from serving our nation.  
   
She might be stepping down from her leadership role in the House
Democratic Caucus, but she will never waiver in protecting our sacred
democracy.  
  
Nancy Pelosi is first, last, and always for the people.  Jill and I
count Nancy, Paul, and their family among our dearest friends. As a
nation, we owe her a deep debt of gratitude for her service, her
patriotism, and above all, her absolute dignity.
