title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Releases National Security Memorandum\
  \ to Strengthen the Security and Resilience of U.S. Food and\_Agriculture"
---
 
Today President Joe Biden signed National Security Memorandum-16
(NSM-16) to strengthen the security and resilience of United States food
and agriculture. The National Security Memorandum builds on the
Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing work to ensure that American
families have access to safe, affordable food, that America’s producers
are able to get their goods to market, and that the American food and
agricultural system is better prepared for threats that may harm the
health of crops and livestock and cause shocks to the cost or
availability of food.

Agriculture, food, and related industries contribute about five percent
of the United States gross domestic product (GDP), representing over one
trillion dollars per year and more than 19 million jobs.  Inherently
vital to American life, wellness, health, and economy, this critical
food and agriculture sector has, in recent years, faced a range of
deliberate and naturally occurring threats to its security and
resilience:

-   In June 2021, one of the world’s largest meat suppliers was forced
    to halt North American operations due to a ransomware attack;

<!-- -->

-   Over the past year, highly pathogenic avian influenza has spread
    across the United States, threatening the health and wellness of our
    poultry and contributing to increases in the price of everyday
    groceries; and

<!-- -->

-   Russia’s unjust war in Ukraine has caused grain shortages and is
    threatening global food security.

Food and agriculture systems and supply chains are designated as
critical infrastructure, primarily owned and operated by private sector
and non-Federal entities, and can be vulnerable to disruption and damage
from domestic and global threats.  To strengthen the security and
resilience of this vital sector, President Biden approved NSM-16. NSM-16
supersedes Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (Defense of United
States Agriculture and Food) (HSPD-9), issued in 2004, and provides
presidential guidance to (i) identify and assess the threats of greatest
consequence; (ii) strengthen partnerships to enhance the resilience of
the workforce; and coordinating our government to act more efficiently
and effectively, and (iii) enhance preparedness and response. This work
builds upon ongoing actions by the Administration, [including the U.S.
Department of Agriculture](https://www.ams.usda.gov/supply-chain), to
strengthen the resilience of U.S. food and agriculture supply chains.

**Identify and Assess the Threats of Greatest Consequence:** The NSM
outlines a process for the Federal Government to identify and assess
threats of greatest consequence to the food and agriculture sector. This
includes:

-   Redefining the way that chemical, biological, radiological, and
    nuclear (CBRN) threats are defined, in relation to the food and
    agriculture sector specifically;
-   Focusing on cyber threats and the consequences of the climate
    crisis;
-   Enhancing threat and risk assessments, disseminating needed
    information with relevant Federal, State, local, Tribal, and
    territorial (SLTT) governments and private sector partners; and
-   Mandating a continuous process to assess and mitigate the risks and
    vulnerabilities of the food and agriculture sector.

**Strengthen Partnerships to Enhance the Resilience of the Workforce:**
 The private sector owns and operates the majority of the food and
agriculture sector and, in conjunction with SLTT officials, is generally
the first line of response when an incident happens. This NSM sets out
to strengthen the resilience of the food and agriculture workforce, who
are essential critical infrastructure workers, by:

-   Refining and promoting the identification of, and guidance for,
    essential critical infrastructure workers in the food and
    agriculture sector to continue to work safely while supporting
    ongoing operations during high-consequence or catastrophic
    incidents; and
-   Supporting the development, provision, and promotion of relevant
    education at all levels to train the existing workforce and build a
    pipeline of future essential workers.

**Enhance Preparedness and Response:** This NSM positions the Federal
Government to develop, maintain, assess, enhance, and encourage the
adoption of systems and activities that will harden the Nation’s ability
to prepare and respond to an agricultural incident by:

-   Training Federal, SLTT, and private sector partners together on how
    to prepare for and respond to threats to the food and agriculture
    sector;
-   Integrating Federal, SLTT, private, and academic laboratories to
    increase testing and diagnostic surge capacity and standardizing
    diagnostic and reporting protocols to facilitate timely information
    sharing;
-   Enhancing our National Veterinary Stockpile, which is the
    animal-health equivalent of the Secure National Stockpile; and
-   Strengthening our plant disease response capability with the
    National Plant Disease Recovery System.
