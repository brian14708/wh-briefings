At the 10<sup>th</sup> annual U.S.-ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia,
President Biden and the ASEAN leaders will elevate U.S.-ASEAN relations
to a *Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP)*. President Biden will

United States’ prioritization of the Indo-Pacific and the ASEAN-led
regional architecture.  
  
At both summits, President Biden will reaffirm the United States’ strong
support for ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific,
building on the historic success of the first-ever U.S.-ASEAN Special
Summit in Washington, DC earlier this year. President Biden will review
implementation of the many new U.S.-ASEAN initiatives he has launched
with ASEAN leaders over the past year, and he will also announce
several new initiatives designed to supportthe four pillars of the ASEAN

economics, and defense, led on the U.S. side by Secretary Becerra,
Secretary Buttigieg, Administrator Power, Secretary Kerry, Secretary
Granholm, Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Tai, and Secretary Austin,
respectively. Under the framework of our newly established U.S.-ASEAN
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the United States and ASEAN will
institutionalize and expand cooperation in each of these important
areas, in order to support robust implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on
the Indo-Pacific and promote a free and open region that is connected,
prosperous, secure, and resilient.
