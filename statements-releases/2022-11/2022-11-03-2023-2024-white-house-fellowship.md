The application for the 2023-2024 White House Fellowship is now open.  
  
Today, Rose Vela, Director of the President’s Commission on White House
Fellows, announced the opening of the application season for the
2023-2024 White House Fellowship year: “This uniquely non-partisan
program has a distinguished legacy that reaches back more than half a
century, and we hope that Americans with a passion for leadership and
public service will take a look at the website, examine the criteria,
and consider applying – or urge others to consider applying.”  
  
Founded in 1964, the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships
is the Nation’s premier program for leadership and public service. The
White House Fellowship offers exceptional Americans first-hand
experience working at the highest levels of the Federal Government on a
strictly non-partisan basis. Selected individuals spend one year in
Washington, D.C., working as a full-time paid government employee,
aiding Cabinet Secretaries, senior White House staff, and other
top-ranking government officials.  
  
The program has fostered a remarkable legacy of leadership. Of the more
than 800 alumni in the last half-century, scores have gone on to top
positions in the military, business, education, media, and philanthropy.
Alumni currently serving in the Administration include Deputy Assistant
to the President and NSC Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs Dr. Kurt
Campbell and Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging
Technology Anne Neuberger. The 2023-2024 White House Fellowship program
year will begin in August 2023, and conclude in August 2024. All
applicants must be United States citizens, and must have completed their
undergraduate education. With the exception of active duty military
personnel, Federal Government employees are not eligible to apply.  
  
Selection criteria include:

-   A record of remarkable early-career professional achievement.
-   Evidence of leadership skills and the potential for further growth.
-   A demonstrated commitment to public service.
-   The skills to succeed at the highest levels of the Federal
    Government and the ability to work effectively as part of a team.
