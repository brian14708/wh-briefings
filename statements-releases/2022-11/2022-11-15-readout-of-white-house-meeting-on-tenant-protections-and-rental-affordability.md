title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting on Tenant Protections and Rental\_Affordability"
---
 
Yesterday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, National Economic Council
Director Brian Deese, and American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling
convened a meeting with officials from across the Biden-Harris
Administration and more than 70 tenant leaders and advocates, housing
providers, legal advocates, and housing policy experts to discuss the
Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to strengthen tenant protections
and improve rental affordability.  
   
Participants discussed several key topics related to tenant protections
and rental affordability, including the right of tenants to safe,
decent, and affordable housing. The participants also discussed the need
for clear and fair leases, the importance of tenants being able to live
free from retaliation or interference from landlords, and tenants’ right
to organize without fear. Administration officials underscored their
commitment to enforcing the Fair Housing Act, and to preventing unlawful
discrimination and advancing fair tenant screening practices and safety.
Building off lessons learned during the pandemic, participants also
discussed ways to institutionalize best practices such as eviction
diversion and ways to ensure due process rights and fair proceedings.  
   
Administration officials underscored the importance of this work within
the context of the President’s broader housing agenda, which includes
actions to increase the supply of housing for purchase and rent and
expand the availability of rental assistance.
