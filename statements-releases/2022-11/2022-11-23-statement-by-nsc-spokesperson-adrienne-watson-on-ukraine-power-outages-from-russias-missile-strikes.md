  \ Russia\u2019s Missile\_Strikes"

As Russia struggles on the battlefield, it is increasingly turning to
horrific attacks against the Ukrainian people with punishing strikes
damaging energy grid infrastructure, and deliberately doing so as winter
approaches. These strikes do not appear aimed at any military purpose
and instead** **further the goal of the Putin regime to increase the
suffering and death of Ukrainian men, women and children. It also shows
Russia is willing to increase the risk of a nuclear safety incident that
could not only further harm Ukraine, but affect the entire region as
well. The United States and our allies and partners will continue to
provide Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself including air
defense. Today, we announced an additional $400 million security
assistance package that includes additional munitions for the National
Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System  (NASAMS) and heavy machine guns
to help Ukraine counter these urgent threats. We are in constant touch
with Ukraine on its energy infrastructure needs and are working with
allies and partners to support Ukraine – including the United States’
provision of $1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance since February with
more than $250 million for winterization efforts to distribute heating
fuel, generators, shelter repair materials, and blankets. Russia
continues to underestimate the strength and resolve of the Ukrainian
people and its attempt to demoralize them will fail yet again.
