title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Continued\
  \ Wrongful Detention of American Brittney\_Griner"
---
 
Every minute that Brittney Griner must endure wrongful detention in
Russia is a minute too long. As the Administration continues to work
tirelessly to secure her release, the President has directed the
Administration to prevail on her Russian captors to improve her
treatment and the conditions she may be forced to endure in a penal
colony. As we have said before, the U.S. Government made a significant
offer to the Russians to resolve the current unacceptable and wrongful
detentions of American citizens. In the subsequent weeks, despite a lack
of good faith negotiation by the Russians, the U.S. Government has
continued to follow up on that offer and propose alternative potential
ways forward with the Russians through all available channels. The U.S.
Government is unwavering in its commitment to its work on behalf of
Brittney and other Americans detained in Russia – including fellow
wrongful detainee Paul Whelan.
