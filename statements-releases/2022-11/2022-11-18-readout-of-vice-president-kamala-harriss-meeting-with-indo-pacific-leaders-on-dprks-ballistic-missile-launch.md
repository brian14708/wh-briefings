  \ Leaders on DPRK\u2019s Ballistic Missile\_Launch"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris convened today Indo-Pacific leaders on the
margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Meeting
in Bangkok, Thailand. In addition to the Vice President, the meeting
included: Prime Minister Kishida of Japan, Prime Minister Han of the
Republic of Korea, Prime Minister Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister
Ardern of New Zealand, and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada. They met to
consult closely on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)’s
test of a long-range ballistic missile earlier today. They agreed that,
together with their national security teams, they would continue to
assess the situation in close coordination with other allies and
partners. They agreed that this launch is a brazen violation of multiple
UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions and the leaders called on all UN
Member States to fully implement all relevant UNSC Resolutions.  The
leaders reaffirmed that a DPRK nuclear test would be met with a strong
and resolute response from the international community. They reiterated
that the path to dialogue remains open for the DPRK, and they called on
the DPRK to abandon needless provocation and to return to serious and
sustained diplomacy.
