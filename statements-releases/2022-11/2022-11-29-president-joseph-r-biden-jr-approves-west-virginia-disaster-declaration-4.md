On November 28, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major
disaster exists in the State of West Virginia and ordered Federal aid to
supplement State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides during the period of
August 14 to August 15, 2022.  
   
Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides in Fayette
County.  
   
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
   
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Jeffrey L. Jones as the
