title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Launches Initiatives to Support U.S.-Philippines\
  \ Maritime\_Cooperation"

*Support for maritime livelihoods, marine ecosystems, sustainable
development*

In May 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris led a working lunch with
Southeast Asian leaders on maritime cooperation as part of the historic
U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington, DC, where she launched [$60
million worth of new regional maritime
initiatives](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=1fdaf944ef&e=0ca263633c),
most of which are led by the U.S. Coast Guard. Her visit to Palawan, the
Philippines and her engagement with the Philippines Coast Guard
continues this work, as she will see firsthand the outcomes of this
partnership, and work to strengthen it further.  
   
The Vice President’s visit demonstrates the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to stand with our Philippine allies in
upholding the rules-based international maritime order in the South
China Sea, promoting marine conservation, supporting maritime
livelihoods, and countering illegal, unregulated, and unreported
fishing.  
   
As part of her effort to uphold international rules and norms, the Vice
President will reiterate the importance of international law, unimpeded
commerce, and freedom of the seas, and will make clear that upholding
such rules and norms helps protect Philippine lives and livelihoods.  
   
And as part of her efforts to strengthen maritime cooperation throughout
Southeast Asia, the Vice President will expand the United States’
whole-of-government partnership with Philippine maritime law enforcement
agencies, building on our longstanding partnership and continuing to
expand training and build capacity.  
   
Building on the new initiatives
[announced](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=4842d0b3bd&e=0ca263633c)
in Manila yesterday, the Vice President is now launching the following
the new initiatives:

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Maritime Law Enforcement
    Assistance:</span>  The United States will provide $7.5 million in
    additional assistance to enhance the capabilities of Philippine
    maritime law enforcement agencies.  This will enable Philippine
    maritime law enforcement agencies to increase their capacity and
    capability to counter illegal fishing, improve maritime domain
    awareness, and provide search and rescue support, including in the
    South China Sea.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Supporting Sustainable
    Fishing in the South China Sea:</span> The United States, through
    USAID, will launch a new partnership with local stakeholders in the
    western Philippines to support traditional livelihoods and
    sustainable fishing practices, strengthen food security, and advance
    the conservation marine ecosystems in the South China Sea that are
    vulnerable to development and climate change. Through this
    partnership, USAID is also announcing a grant to a local
    organization to implement conservation and climate change actions in
    the South China Sea, including but not limited to building capacity
    in marine resource governance, conducting marine scientific research
    and disseminating findings, raising public awareness about the
    importance of the South China Sea, and supporting sustainable
    natural resource production by coastal communities and micro- and
    small enterprises.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Philippine Coast Guard
    Vessel Traffic Management System:</span>  The U.S. Trade and
    Development Agency, pending Congressional notification, will support
    the Philippine Coast Guard in upgrading and expanding its vessel
    traffic management system (VTMS) to enable improved maritime safety
    and environmental monitoring.  As a nation comprised of over 7,000
    islands and growing vessel traffic activity, the Philippines needs
    to expand its VTMS capabilities to cover major ports and navigation
    paths. This support will help develop a comprehensive VTMS for major
    ports in the Philippines to enable improved maritime safety, search
    and rescue operations, and environmental monitoring.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Increase in Visa Validity
    for C1/D Crew Visas**:**</span>  The United States is increasing the
    validity of C-1/D nonimmigrant visas for Philippine merchant and
    cruise ship crew personnel to 10 years.   Philippine workers
    dominate the global cargo and cruise industries, accounting for over
    30 percent of the world’s seafarers.  By increasing the visa
    reciprocity, the United States will further facilitate the travel
    of Filipino seafarers to strengthen the global supply chain, support
    the U.S. cruise industry, and continue providing an important source
    of income for Filipino workers.
