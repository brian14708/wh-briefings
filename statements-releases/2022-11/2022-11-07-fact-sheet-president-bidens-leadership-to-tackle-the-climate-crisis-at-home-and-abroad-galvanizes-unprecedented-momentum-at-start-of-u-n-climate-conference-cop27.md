title: "FACT SHEET:\_President\_Biden\u2019s Leadership to Tackle the Climate Crisis\
  \ at Home and Abroad Galvanizes Unprecedented Momentum at Start of U.N. Climate\
  \ Conference\_(COP27)"
---
 
In less than two years since taking office, President Biden’s leadership
to tackle the climate crisis has boosted U.S. manufacturing and
deployment of cost-cutting clean energy technologies, put the country on
a durable path aligned with limiting warming to 1.5 °C, and galvanized
global action by partners and the private sector – building
unprecedented momentum towards achieving critical climate goals and
strengthening global resilience. As more than a hundred countries gather
for the 27<sup>th</sup> Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the
United States will work with partners to enhance global ambition to
accelerate growth of the clean energy economy, avert the most
catastrophic impacts of climate change, and help lower- and middle-
income countries build resilience to climate impacts. In fact, the
President has pledged to work with Congress to increase U.S.
international climate finance to over $11 billion a year – which would
make the United States the single largest contributor of climate
finance. These actions are key to strengthening global security –
including energy, water, food, and health security – which has been made
all the more urgent following Russia’s war against Ukraine that has
disrupted energy markets, strained economies with rising prices, and
threatened vulnerable countries with severe food shortages.

At COP27 and beyond, the United States will encourage countries –
particularly major economies – and the private sector to not only
implement existing commitments and goals, but to also enhance
commitments and goals to help close the gap between current pledges and
what the latest science tells us is urgently needed.  And the United
States will also encourage the international community to accelerate
vulnerable countries’ ability to implement adaptation efforts. Through
the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience, PREPARE,
the United States is rapidly increasing its support of adaptation and
resilience programming to help more than half a billion people in
developing countries adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change.

On November 11, President Biden will be at COP27 to build on efforts by
the United States to accelerate growth of an equitable clean energy
economy that will cut consumer energy costs, reduce global greenhouse
gas emissions, advance the global climate fight, and help the most
vulnerable build resilience to climate impacts. The United States is
leading by example at home and abroad:

-   **<u>Leading at Home by Taking the Most Ambitious Climate Actions in
    U.S. History</u>**.  The President is delivering on his day one
    promise by positioning the United States to achieve our ambitious
    goals of reducing emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030 and to
    net-zero by 2050 through a series of unprecedented climate actions.
     These actions will not only reduce emissions, but will bolster
    energy security, help families save money on their energy bills,
    create good-paying jobs for workers and spur a new era of clean
    American manufacturing, advance environmental justice, and ensure
    healthier air and cleaner water for communities.  Key actions
    include passing the **Inflation Reduction Act** and **Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law** (BIL), ratifying the **Kigali Amendment** to
    the Montreal Protocol, tackling super-pollutants like methane,
    leveraging the purchasing power of the federal government, advancing
    decarbonization across all sectors, ensuring the clean energy
    transition benefits disadvantaged communities, and spurring
    innovation and supporting a new era of clean American
    manufacturing.  
-   **<u>Supporting Vulnerable Countries in Building Resilience to
    Current and Future Climate Impacts</u>** by implementing the
    **President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience
    (PREPARE)**. PREPARE aims to accelerate the ability of developing
    countries to adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change by
    preparing knowledge, plans, programs, finance, and private capital
    for adaptation and resilience efforts. Nineteen U.S. Federal
    agencies and departments are committed to working with partner
    countries to help them build resilience to climate impacts on food
    systems, water, infrastructure, health, and the economy.  
-   **<u>Leading Global Efforts to Keep the 1.5 °C Goal within
    Reach</u>**. We are implementing the President’s major initiatives
    and priorities to accelerate global climate action.  This includes
    the **Plan to Conserve Global Forests**, mobilizing climate finance
    through the **Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment**
    (PGII), advancing implementation of the **Global Methane Pledge**
    (GMP), **decarbonizing transportation** (e.g., zero emissions
    vehicles, shipping, and aviation), **accelerating innovation in and
    deployment of clean energy** technologies, and **enhancing food
    security**.

**<u>LEADING AT HOME BY TAKING THE MOST AMBITIOUS CLIMATE ACTIONS IN
U.S. HISTORY</u>**

-   **The Inflation Reduction Act** is by far the most ambitious climate
    and clean energy legislation in U.S. history, with $370 billion for
    building a clean energy economy, cutting consumer energy costs,
    combating the climate crisis, advancing environmental justice, and
    enhancing climate resilience.  The Inflation Reduction Act is
    expected to more than double U.S. clean energy production (*e.g.*,
    solar, wind, battery storage, and more), save families hundreds of
    dollars per year on energy costs, and create millions of good-paying
    jobs, all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 gigaton
    in 2030 – 10 times more climate impact than any other U.S.
    legislation ever enacted. This law also leans in on ensuring
    communities are prepared for climate impacts already here, by
    funding coastal resilience, drought, and tools to help communities
    make science-backed decisions.  
-   **The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)** delivers record support
    for upgrading the power grid to transmit more clean energy and
    withstand extreme weather, building a nationwide network of electric
    vehicle chargers, expanding public transit and passenger rail,
    investing in drought and wildfire preparedness, and cleaning up
    legacy pollution.  
-   **Bipartisan Senate Ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the
    Montreal Protocol** and helping to phase down global production and
    consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), super-polluting chemicals
    that are hundreds to thousands of times more powerful than carbon
    dioxide while also spurring growth in domestic manufacturing jobs in
    making HFC alternatives, where American companies are already
    leading the way.  As more countries join the United States in
    ratifying this amendment, we can prevent up to half a degree Celsius
    of warming this century.  
-   **Tackling super-pollutants like methane** through implementation of
    the comprehensive U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan and
    measures in the Inflation Reduction Act and BIL covering the oil and
    gas industry, agriculture, buildings and addressing abandoned mine
    lands, and orphan oil and gas wells – a source of toxic pollution
    and methane emissions.  
-   **Leading by example through the Federal Sustainability Plan** to
    reduce emissions across 300,000 buildings, 600,000 vehicles, and
    $650 billion in annual purchasing power, and launching new
    initiatives like the Federal Buy Clean Initiative to spur
    private-sector commitments to reduce industrial emissions and the
    White House-HHS Health Care Sector Climate Pledge, which has secured
    aligned commitments from more than 100 health systems and industry
    organizations committed to resilience and decarbonization.  
-   **Addressing Climate Related Financial Risk** to the federal
    government, real economy, and financial system by refining
    approaches and tools to assess fiscal risk in the President’s
    budget, conducting sensitivity analysis to federal programs, and
    undertaking macroeconomic risk analysis as well as through
    leadership from U.S. independent financial regulators improving
    their understanding and management of these risks, for example
    through the proposed climate disclosure rule by the Securities and
    Exchange Commission and the OCC’s and FDIC’s proposed principles on
    climate-related financial risk management for large banks.  
-   **Taking decisive action to decarbonize all key sectors –**
    including power, transportation, buildings, industry, and lands and
    waters:  
    -   *Power* *Sector Deployment* – securing historic clean power
        investments that will more than double wind, solar, and battery
        storage deployment; jumpstart the American offshore wind
        industry; support hydrogen infrastructure; fast-track the
        process for permitting and deploying clean energy and
        transmission projects.  
    -   *Clean Energy Research –* through the recently launched Net Zero
        Gamechangers Initiative, driving the major innovation
        breakthroughs that we know the world needs to solve the climate
        crisis by addressing the toughest remaining technological
        challenges and cost hurdles in key sectors, and rapidly advance
        solutions to help achieve our climate and economic
        competitiveness goals. Billions of dollars have been committed
        to coordinate research so far on six key areas:  hydrogen,
        long-duration energy storage, carbon dioxide removal
        technologies, floating off-shore wind, advanced geothermal, and
        industrial heat.  
    -   *Transportation* – securing the largest investments ever in
        public transportation, passenger rail, an electric vehicle (EV)
        charging network, hydrogen infrastructure, and battery supply
        chains; rallying automakers and autoworkers around an electric
        transportation future, by setting a national target of 50%
        electric vehicle sales share in 2030, spurring more than $85
        billion of investment in American manufacturing of EVs,
        batteries, and chargers, and launching the American Battery
        Materials Initiative; finalized strongest passenger vehicle
        standards in American history to increase average fuel economy
        to 49 miles per gallon – reducing emissions and savings drivers
        money at the pump; and advancing cleaner transit, shipping, and
        aviation; launching the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) grand
        challenge to achieve a minimum of a 50% reduction in life cycle
        greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional fuel and
        supply sufficient SAF to meet 100% of aviation fuel demand by
        2050.  
    -   *Buildings* – making historic investments in energy efficient
        homes and decarbonization, with more than $1 billion to expand
        weatherization and incentivize electrification, with more than
        $1 billion to expand weatherization and incentivize electric
        appliance and efficiency upgrades that will lower energy bills
        and emissions; updated energy-saving appliance and equipment
        standards to save households an average of $100 a year;
        accelerate next-generation clean building technologies.  
    -   *Industrial* – launched a breakthrough “Buy Clean” initiative
        leveraging federal standard setting and procurement and secured
        historic investments to reduce industrial emissions, including
        support for clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and cleaner
        industrial facilities for steel, iron, cement and other
        energy-intensive materials; and advanced manufacturing
        processes.  
    -   *Lands and Waters* – secured historic investments to enlist
        nature-based solutions in the fight against climate change with
        over $20 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act to support
        climate-smart farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners and the
        BIL support for climate resilience and ecosystem restoration;
        launched new initiatives to support conservation and carbon
        sequestration, including the America the Beautiful initiative to
        conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030; and issued
        an Executive Order on strengthening America’s forests.  
-   **Ensuring the clean energy transition benefits disadvantaged
    communities** by implementing the Justice40 Initiative to deliver
    40% of overall benefits from federal investments in climate and
    clean energy to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized,
    underserved, and overburdened by pollution.  
-   **Investing in economic revitalization of coal communities** by
    creating the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant
    Communities and Economic Revitalization, chaired by the White House
    and including eleven federal agencies, dedicated to increasing
    federal investment in land remediation and reclamation, economic
    diversification, and workforce training strategies for displaced
    fossil energy workers in diverse communities across the U.S.; and by
    directing significant new resources to fossil energy communities
    through the BIL and Inflation Reduction Act.   
-   **Spurring innovation and supporting a new era of clean American
    manufacturing** by passing the CHIPS and Science Act, using trade
    policy and Buy Clean actions to incentivize low-carbon production of
    key materials like steel, and invoking the Defense Production Act
    for five critical clean energy technologies.

**<u>LEADING GLOBAL EFFORTS TO SUPPORT VULNERABLE COUNTRIESIN BUILDING
RESILIENCE TO CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE IMPACTS</u>**

-   **Scaling up U.S. public finance for climate adaptation and
    resilience** by advancing President Biden’s commitment to work with
    Congress to increase U.S. international climate adaptation finance
    to $3 billion a year by 2024, a six-fold increase from the highest
    historical funded level. 
-   **Helping more than half a billion people** in developing countries
    adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change through ambitious
    efforts outlined in a whole-of-government PREPARE Action Plan by:  
    -   Responding to the UN Secretary-General’s call to ensure “Early
        Warning for All” by 2027 and increasing co-production and use of
        climate information;  
    -   Equipping the decision-makers of today and tomorrow with the
        skills, knowledge, networks, and outlook needed to adapt to
        climate impacts;  
    -   Building capacity to mainstream adaptation into policies,
        programs, and budgets and to support locally led adaptation;  
    -   Improving partner governments’ ability to assess, plan for, and
        implement programs that increase resilience to the impacts of
        climate change on food security, water, health, and
        infrastructure;  
    -   Increasing the amount and quality of finance that accelerates
        climate adaptation and resilience and supports
        gender-responsive, locally-led adaptation;  
    -   Assisting partner governments to assess, plan, and budget for
        adaptation costs, and scale up financing in all sectors;  
    -   Facilitating increased investment from the philanthropic and
        private sectors to advance adaptation and resilience in
        climate-vulnerable partner countries; and  
    -   Increasing and enhancing the use and effectiveness of disaster
        risk financing tools to support climate resilience.

**<u>LEADING GLOBAL EFFORTS TO KEEP THE 1.5 DEGREE GOAL WITHIN
REACH</u>**

-   **Executing the President’s Plan to Conserve Global Forests** by
    working to help drive progress forward in each of the Plan’s four
    key objectives since President Biden launched the Plan at COP26,
    including building a whole-of-government approach to deliver on this
    ambitious, decade-long plan to support global efforts to halt and
    reverse deforestation by leveraging a range of diplomatic, policy,
    and financing tools.  The United States will continue this
    leadership through Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry’s
    co-Chairing of the Forest Climate Leaders Partnership, working
    alongside over 20 governments who are committed to advancing key
    actions and initiatives and acting to halt and reverse global
    deforestation by 2030.  
-   **Rapidly innovating and deploying clean energy solutions** by
    bringing together the global community for the first-ever Global
    Clean Energy Action Forum in Pittsburgh last September, anchored by
    the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) and Mission Innovation (MI).
     Together, 34 countries and stakeholders from the entire energy
    ecosystem of government, businesses, innovators, civil society, and
    youth around the world gathered to take action on the clean energy
    transition and enhance investment including the launch of the
    Zero-Emissions Government Fleet Declaration, regional hydrogen hubs,
    and new funding in carbon management programs.  
-   **Scaling up climate finance** by advancing President Biden’s
    commitment at the 2021 UN General Assembly to work with Congress to
    increase U.S. international climate finance to over $11 billion a
    year by requesting the funds and authorities necessary to achieve
    this goal in his Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request.  Recognizing that
    catalyzing private investment will be critical to reaching the scale
    of resources that will be required, the United States is also
    focused on using our finance in innovative ways, including to unlock
    the much larger sums of private finance that will be needed.  These
    efforts are integral to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure
    and Investment, which has climate and energy security as one of its
    central pillars.  For instance, the United States recently made a
    $950 million loan contribution to the Clean Technology Fund which
    will support MDB efforts to help key emerging market countries
    accelerate coal transition, which is expected to catalyze billions
    in private finance.  The multilateral development banks (MDBs) are
    also a key part of our strategy for scaling up climate finance to
    support climate action in developing countries. The United States is
    leading the charge in encouraging the MDBs to both increase their
    climate finance and make it more accessible to recipients.  These
    actions would help the MDBs build on their all-time-high of $66
    billion in climate finance provided in 2020, with $38 billion going
    to low- and middle-income economies. USAID is also engaging directly
    with private sector partners to mobilize finance at scale using our
    grants and technical assistance to provide risk-sharing for
    investment in critical climate solutions, as well as building the
    pipeline for bankable projects.  
-   **Advancing the Global Methane Pledge (GMP)** by building a
    coalition that now includes over 130 countries committed to reduce
    global anthropogenic methane emissions at least 30 percent below
    2020 levels by 2030, as called for in the Global Methane Pledge that
    President Biden and European Commission President Von der Leyen
    launched at COP26.  To achieve the fastest and deepest methane
    reductions, President Biden announced a new GMP Energy Pathway
    focusing on fossil energy methane emissions at the June 2022 Major
    Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF), alongside the European
    Union and 11 other countries.  The Energy Pathway mobilizes new
    policies, projects, technical assistance, and investment resources
    to dramatically reducing flaring, venting, and leakage of methane
    from fossil energy operations.  Achieving the full methane
    mitigation potential in this sector could avoid 0.1°C warming by
    midcentury and would boost global energy security by preventing the
    waste of 260 billion cubic meters of gas per year—equivalent to over
    one-third of Russia’s annual gas production.  
-   **Accelerating Zero-Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) Deployment** by building
    a growing coalition of countries committed to a collective 2030 goal
    of ZEVs comprising 50% of new light-duty vehicle sales by 2030, to
    include battery electric, fuel cell electric, and plug-in hybrid
    vehicles.  In addition to the United States, the coalition includes
    Canada, Chile, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy,
    Mexico, Norway, and the United Kingdom.  
-   **Advancing Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for
    Climate)**, launched at COP26 by the United States and the United
    Arab Emirates. AIM for Climate and its growing network of over 275
    partners seek to drive more rapid and transformative climate action
    by increasing investment and support for climate-smart agriculture
    and food systems innovation. AIM for Climate achieved its goal of
    doubling the total increased investment mobilized by its partners
    from $4 billion announced at COP26 to over $8 billion at COP27,
    which includes over $1 billion from 30 partner-led innovation
    sprints.  The United States has also announced plans to host the AIM
    for Climate Summit on May 8-10, 2023 in Washington, DC.  
-   **Expanding the First Movers Coalition** launched by President Biden
    and the World Economic Forum at COP26. The First Movers Coalition is
    the flagship U.S. public-private partnership to commercialize clean
    technologies through advance purchase commitments. Its corporate
    members have pledged $10 billion, the world’s strongest demand
    signal, for bringing emerging innovations to scale. On its first
    anniversary, the First Movers Coalition has grown to more than 60
    companies, representing more than 10% of the global Fortune 2000 by
    market value, as well as ten governments. Each member company has
    made unprecedented purchasing commitments by the end of this decade
    in order to drive investment in next-generation clean steel,
    aluminum, and cement; near-zero carbon aviation fuels; zero-emission
    trucking and shipping; and carbon dioxide removal.  These
    commitments will drive down the green premium of emerging
    technologies and bring competitive technologies to market this
    decade that are needed to decarbonize so-called “hard-to-abate”
    sectors of the global economy that produce a third of global
    emissions.  
-   **Demonstrating** **Clean Energy Technologies** by rallying sixteen
    partner countries to collectively mobilize $94 billion in public
    funding to build commercial-scale demonstration projects that the
    IEA says are needed this decade to achieve net-zero emissions by
    2050 – meeting a challenge that President Biden issued to other
    world leaders at his June MEF. Partners that joined the President in
    announcing contributions earlier this year included Australia,
    Canada, European Commission, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the
    Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Singapore,
    Sweden, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.  
-   **Bolstering Climate & Food Security**, including through President
    Biden’s September 2022 announcement at UNGA of over $2.9 billion in
    new U.S. assistance to address global food insecurity stemming from
    climate change, COVID-19, and Russia’s unprovoked and ongoing war
    against Ukraine, which builds on the $6.9 billion in U.S. government
    assistance to support global food security already committed this
    year.  The United States is providing additional funding to the
    Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, the African
    Development Bank, and the International Fund for Agricultural
    Development that will promote climate resilient food systems.
    Following President Biden’s call to action at the June 2022 Major
    Economies Forum, at COP27 the United States and partners will
    announce funding commitments to the Global Fertilizer Challenge to
    advance fertilizer efficiency and reduce the impact of shortages on
    food security.
