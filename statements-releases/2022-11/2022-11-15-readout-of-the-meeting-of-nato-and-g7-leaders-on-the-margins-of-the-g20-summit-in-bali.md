*Today, the Leaders of Canada, the European Commission, the European
Council, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the
United Kingdom, and the United States met on the margins of the G20
Summit in Bali and released the following statement:*  
   
We condemn the barbaric missile attacks that Russia perpetrated on
Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure on Tuesday.    
   
We discussed the explosion that took place in the eastern part of Poland
near the border with Ukraine. We offer our full support for and
assistance with Poland’s ongoing investigation. We agree to remain in
close touch to determine appropriate next steps as the investigation
proceeds.   
   
We reaffirm our steadfast support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people
in the face of ongoing Russian aggression, as well as our continued
readiness to hold Russia accountable for its brazen attacks on Ukrainian
communities, even as the G20 meets to deal with the wider impacts of the
war. We all express our condolences to the families of the victims in
Poland and Ukraine.
