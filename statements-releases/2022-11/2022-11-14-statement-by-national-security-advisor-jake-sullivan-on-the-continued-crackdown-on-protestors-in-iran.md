title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Continued Crackdown\
  \ on Protestors in\_Iran"

We are deeply concerned about reports from Iran of mass arrests, sham
trials, and now a death sentence for protesters voicing legitimate
demands against a government that systematically denies basic dignity
and freedom to its people. The reported death sentence comes at the same
time as the political prisoner Hossein Ronaghi was reportedly
transferred from Evin prison to a hospital in Tehran after reports of
torture. The eyes of the world are on Iran. The human rights abuses
inflicted by its government must not go without consequence. The
hundreds of protestors already killed at the hands of Iranian state
authorities deserve justice. The torture and mistreatment of political
prisoners like Mr. Ronaghi must cease. The United States, standing with
our partners and allies around the world, will continue to pursue
accountability for those responsible for these abuses through sanctions
and other means. We welcome the new sanctions adopted today by the
European Union and the United Kingdom against 29 Iranian individuals and
three entities involved in the violent crackdown on protestors. The
United States stands staunchly with the Iranian people and their
demands.
