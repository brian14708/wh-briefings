title: "International Counter Ransomware Initiative 2022 Joint\_Statement"
---
 
The members of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI)—
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech
Republic, Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, India, Ireland,
Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, Singapore,
South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United
Kingdom, United States, and Ukraine, and the European Union—met in
Washington, DC on October 31–November 1, 2022.  Previously participating
states welcome Belgium as a new CRI member.   
   
At the Second CRI Summit, members re-affirmed our joint commitment to
building our collective resilience to ransomware, cooperating to disrupt
ransomware and pursue the actors responsible, countering illicit finance
that underpins the ransomware ecosystem, working with the private sector
to defend against ransomware attacks, and continuing to cooperate
internationally across all elements of the ransomware threat.   
   
The work of the CRI supports the implementation of the endorsed UN
framework for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, specifically the
voluntary norm that States should cooperate “to exchange information,
assist each other, prosecute terrorist and criminal use of ICTs and
implement other cooperative measures to address such threats.”  The
joint efforts of the CRI partners are also directly contributing to the
implementation of the consensus conclusions and recommendations of the
UN Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime.  
   
We are committed to using all appropriate tools of national power to
achieve these goals and jointly committed to the following actions in
support of this endeavor.  We intend to:

-   Hold ransomware actors accountable for their crimes and not provide
    them safe haven;
-   Combat ransomware actors’ ability to profit from illicit proceeds by
    implementing and enforcing anti-money laundering and countering the
    financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures, including “know your
    customer” (KYC) rules, for virtual assets and virtual asset service
    providers; 
-   Disrupt and bring to justice ransomware actors and their enablers,
    to the fullest extent permitted under each partner’s applicable laws
    and relevant authorities; and
-   Collaborate in disrupting ransomware by sharing information, where
    appropriate and in line with applicable laws and regulations, about
    the misuse of infrastructure to launch ransomware attacks to ensure
    national cyber infrastructure is not being used in ransomware
    attacks.

Building our resilience to ransomware attacks requires effective
policies and cooperation with trusted partners.  CRI members are
building a network of trusted partners to share and disseminate
ransomware-related threat information to increase our collective
resilience to ransomware attacks.  To that end, we intend to establish a
voluntary International Counter Ransomware Task Force (ICRTF) to develop
cross-sectoral tools and cyber threat intelligence exchange to increase
early warning capabilities and prevent attacks, as well as consolidate
policy and best practice frameworks.  The ICRTF expects to produce
public reports on tools, tactics, and procedures to improve awareness to
global stakeholders, promote and encourage membership of the CRI, and
improve cyber hygiene across the board.  The ICRTF intends to consider a
model for ongoing collaboration with key private sector partners,
including the establishment of an ancillary industry chapter that would
be actively engaged with the work of the ICRTF.   
   
We commit to establish processes to most effectively share information
and analysis about specific strains of ransomware on an ongoing and
enduring basis to improve our collective awareness and resilience.  
   
CRI members are committed to taking action, in line with national law
and policy, to disrupt and degrade the ransomware ecosystem and hold
accountable criminal ransomware actors based on our collective
knowledge, expertise, authorities, and capabilities.  We intend to
improve our comprehensive and holistic understanding of the strategies
used by these criminal actors and the means by which their malicious
activity can be identified and addressed in respective jurisdictions to
improve our tools, relevant authorities, and capabilities to disrupt. 
We commit to work together to prioritize disruption targets to leverage
the breadth of authorities and tools available to pursue hard and
complex targets more effectively.  We intend to increase the number and
impact of our disruption actions so that ransomware actors are stopped
in their tracks.   
   
The CRI is committed not only to protecting ourselves and each other
from ransomware, but also to helping other countries protect and disrupt
so that ransomware is unable to gain traction worldwide.  To that end,
we intend to share technical and threat information and provide
protection and remediation recommendations as broadly as possible.   
   
Taking decisive steps to counter illicit finance that often enables and
underpins the profitability of ransomware will also be key to our
collective success.  We resolve to work to establish mechanisms for
notifying financial institutions and virtual asset platforms of
ransomware payments so that funds can potentially be seized once they
land in ransomware actors’ accounts.  We commit to working together to
promote AML/CFT controls, including KYC policies and procedures within
the virtual assets ecosystem to prevent its use for ransomware activity,
such as through the implementation and enforcement of the Financial
Action Task Force recommendations.   
   
The private sector has a unique role to play in our counter-ransomware
efforts, as their insights into the whereabouts and actions of
ransomware actors from across the internet can effectively complement
state capabilities in this realm.  Private sector companies are often
the victims of ransomware, and can be strong allies in defense and
disruption.  CRI members are working closely with the private sector to
share information and set goals to prevent, reduce, and respond to
ransomware threats.  To further this collaboration, we have established
a pilot information sharing platform to facilitate the exchange of
information about ransomware actors and tools, tactics, techniques, and
procedures amongst members, and eventually with the private sector.  In
addition, we also intend to develop a capacity-building tool to help
countries utilize public-private partnerships to combat ransomware.  We
are continuing to work together to develop additional ways to
collaborate to combat ransomware with the private sector, taking into
account concerns private sector companies may raise.  
   
Diplomatic engagement continues to be an essential tool for the
international community’s fight against ransomware attacks.  We are
committed to continuing to work together not only as the CRI, but also
with other partners committed to fighting the scourge of ransomware,
which has the power to impact us all, including through the Paris Call
for Trust and Security for CRI members that support the Call.  CRI
members plan to work with the full spectrum of stakeholders to drive
focused regional efforts and advance this agenda in appropriate
multilateral frameworks to ensure the global community’s shared resolve
and preparedness to defeat these threats.  We are also committed to
leveraging capacity building programs in order to strengthen resilience,
improve disruption capabilities, increase law enforcement capacities,
and support the development of legal frameworks to combat ransomware in
both CRI and other countries.  In this regard, we intend to conduct
bi-annual cyber exercises for the CRI Member States, which will also
contribute to living toolkit of the ICRTF.
