title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Transgender Day of\_Remembrance"
---
 
There is no place for violence, hatred, and bigotry in America. Yet,
tragically, as last night’s attack in Colorado Springs reminds us, too
many LGBTQI+ people in the United States—and around the world—continue
to face unconscionable attacks. This is especially true for transgender
Americans. On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the 32
transgender Americans known to have been taken from us this year by
horrific acts of brutality. The true toll is likely much higher, with
Black and brown transgender women disproportionately targeted.  
   
In the face of this ongoing assault, my Administration remains deeply
committed to strengthening the rights of LGBTQI+ Americans, including
transgender Americans. Since taking office, we have made it possible for
transgender service members to once again serve proudly and openly in
our military, improved the travel experience for transgender Americans,
and provided resources to support the mental health of transgender kids
and their families. I’ve directed my team to coordinate across the
federal government to combat violence against transgender people and
advance equality. I continue to urge state leaders to combat the
disturbing wave of discriminatory state laws targeting young transgender
Americans—legislation that hurts young people who aren’t hurting anyone.
With Congress poised to pass the bipartisan Respect For Marriage Act, I
also reiterate my call for them to likewise pass the Equality Act and
provide long overdue protections to transgender and all LGBTQI+
Americans.  
   
This is a matter of safety and basic dignity. As we mourn the lives
we’ve lost, let us resolve to continue building a country where every
American can live free from fear and discrimination.
