title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces New Initiatives at COP27 to Strengthen\
  \ U.S. Leadership in Tackling Climate\_Change"
---
 
Today at the 27<sup>th</sup> U.N. Climate Conference (COP27), President
Biden will announce new initiatives to strengthen U.S. leadership
tackling the climate crisis and galvanize global action and commitments.
President Biden will demonstrate that the United States is following
through on its existing commitments and initiatives while also
accelerating new and expanded domestic and global efforts. As President
Biden said at last year’s COP in Glasgow, this is a decisive decade –
and the United States is acting to lead a clean energy future that
leverages market forces, technological innovation, and investments to
tackle the climate crisis.  The initiatives the President is announcing
today also reflect the global imperative to support vulnerable
developing country partners in building resilience to a changing
climate, helping them cope with a problem they did not create.  
  
In less than 18 months, President Biden has renewed United States
leadership in the fight against climate change.  The President is
delivering on his Day One promises, positioning the United States to
achieve our ambitious climate goals. President Biden has spearheaded the
most significant domestic climate action in U.S. history, including
passing the historic Inflation Reduction Act, signing the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, ratifying the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal
Protocol, spurring a new era of clean American manufacturing, enhancing
energy security at home and abroad, and driving down the costs of clean
energy for consumers in the U.S. and around the world.  
  
These efforts reflect President Biden’s belief that climate security,
energy security, food security, and water security go hand-in-hand. As
Russia’s unjust war in Ukraine disrupts energy markets, strains
economies with rising prices, and threatens vulnerable countries with
severe food shortages, efforts to accelerate climate action, growing
clean energy economies, climate smart agriculture, and global resilience
have become all the more urgent.  
  
The initiatives the President is announcing and that the U.S. delegation
will highlight throughout COP27 include:

-   **<u>Bolstering Global Climate Resilience</u>** – including doubling
    the U.S. pledge to the Adaptation Fund to $100 million and
    announcing over $150 million in new support to accelerate the
    President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE)
    efforts across Africa.  These build on the over $20 million that
    President Biden has announced this year to accelerate PREPARE’s work
    in Small Island Developing States.  
-   **<u>Accelerating Global Climate Action</u>** – including launching
    a new initiative to support Egypt in deploying 10 GW of new wind and
    solar energy while decommissioning five GW of inefficient natural
    gas generation, strengthening proposed domestic methane regulations
    in the oil and gas sector that would reduce U.S. methane from
    covered sources by 87 percent below 2005 levels as well as other
    domestic and international action to tackle methane emissions and
    advance the Global Methane Pledge, and announcing new actions that
    would make the United States the first national government to
    require major suppliers to set Paris Agreement-aligned emissions
    reduction goals – leveraging the Federal Government’s over $630
    billion in annual purchasing power.  
-   **<u>Catalyzing Investment at The Scale Required to Tackle the
    Climate Crisis</u>** – including launching new and innovative
    approaches that strategically use public finance to unlock billions
    in private investment, such as the “Climate Finance +” initiative
    that will support developing countries in issuing green bonds;
    launching the Sustainable Banking Alliance to deepen developing
    countries’ sustainable financial markets; and making strategic
    investments that help to mobilize billions in private finance and
    facilitate the export of U.S. clean technologies.  
-   **<u>Engaging All of Society in Tackling the Climate Crisis</u>** –
    including launching a Climate Gender Equity Fund, an Indigenous
    Peoples Finance Access Facility, and new exchanges to empower youth
    across the world to be leaders on resilience and clean energy in
    their communities.

The comprehensive list of announcements by the U.S. delegation at COP27
includes:  
  
**<u>BOLSTERING GLOBAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE:</u>**  
  
President Biden announced additional efforts to further accelerate the
implementation of his Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience
(PREPARE), which aims to help more than half a billion people in
developing countries adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change
this decade.   These initiatives reflect the fact that a dollar invested
in adaptation can result in $4-10 or more in benefits.  These additional
efforts, as well as those announced by the United States during COP27,
subject to Congressional notification and the completion of domestic
procedures, include:

-   **Doubling Our Pledge to the Adaptation Fund to $100 million** **–**
    In Glasgow, we announced our intent to make our first-ever
    contribution to the Adaptation Fund through an initial pledge of $50
    million.  Today, President Biden announced that the United States
    will double this multi-year pledge to $100 million.  
-   **Accelerating Adaptation in Africa** – President Biden announced
    over $150 million to accelerate PREPARE’s work across the continent,
    in support of the Adaptation in Africa initiative he and President
    El-Sisi announced in June.  This includes U.S. support for:  
    -   ***Expanding access to early-warning systems for all of
        Africa*** – According to the International Federation of Red
        Cross and Red Crescent Societies, better early-warning systems
        and adaptation can cut the number of people who need emergency
        assistance in half by 2030 — and from 200 million to just 10
        million by 2050.  Today, President Biden announced new U.S.
        support to accelerate these efforts, including through a
        $13.6 million contribution to the Systematic Observations
        Financing Facility that will help fill weather, water, and
        climate observation gaps in Africa.  The United States will also
        invest $15 million to support the co-development and
        deployment of early-warning systems in Africa, leveraging the
        U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s
        long-standing relationships with national and regional weather
        services across Africa.  Our scientists and emergency
        preparedness experts will work side by side with
        African partners to bring early warnings to Africa and support
        communities, leaders, businesses, and people in applying this
        information to reduce impacts and save lives.   
    -   ***Building the capacity of African decision makers of today and
        tomorrow to accelerate adaptation across the continent for years
        to come*** – This includes contributing $10 million to support
        the launch of a new adaptation center in Egypt – the Cairo
        Center for Learning and Excellence on Adaptation and Resilience,
        announced by Egypt, which will build adaptation capacity across
        the African continent.  As part of our support for the Cairo
        Center, we are also working with African universities and
        central ministries to raise awareness of climate risk
        and strengthen capacity to apply adaptation solutions to manage
        those risks, especially when it comes to fiscal policy,
        budgeting and planning.  The United States is contributing an
        additional $2 million to the Resilience and Adaptation
        Mainstreaming Program to build the capacity of governments to
        manage climate risks and access finance.  
    -   ***S**upport**ing** locally-led efforts to adapt to climate
        impacts*** – This includes an additional $3.5 million in support
        for the Least Developed Countries Initiative for Effective
        Adaptation & Resilience, which is helping African countries like
        Uganda, Malawi, Gambia, and Burkina Faso to enhance access to
        adaptation finance for the most vulnerable.  
    -   ***Expanding access to risk-based insurance for the most
        vulnerable*** – This includes
        working with multilateral development banks and supporting
        the G7 Global Shield against Climate Risks to protect vulnerable
        people — in Africa as well as the Caribbean, Central
        America, and the Pacific.   In this context, the United States
        is enhancing its support for regional risk insurance pools,
        including contributing $12 million to the Africa Disaster Risk
        Financing Program and $12 million to ARC Ltd, helping countries
        cope with extreme weather events, food insecurity, and other
        issues exacerbated by climate change.  
    -   ***Mobilizing the private sector for adaptation and
        resilience*** – – The United States is contributing an
        additional $25 million to the African Union’s flagship Africa
        Adaptation Initiative (AAI), which is hosted by the Egyptian
        government, to launch the AAI Food Security Accelerator, which
        will dramatically speed- and scale-up private sector investments
        in climate resilient food security in Africa. With U.S. support,
        the Accelerator will help identify, structure and de-risk a
        pipeline of transformative adaptation investments in food
        security, helping to unlock private capital that is already
        standing ready to invest in these innovative solutions, ranging
        from cold storage logistics to climate resilient agriculture and
        post harvesting processes. The United State is also launching a
        Call to Action to the private sector to tap into their ability
        to develop innovative adaptation solutions in ways that the
        public sector cannot, providing an additional $3.8 million to
        CRAFT TA Facility, and $2 million to launch an adaptation window
        of the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance to help develop
        new financial instruments and mechanisms to harness private
        investment in adaptation.  
    -   ***Further supporting climate smart food systems in Africa*** –
        This includes helping countries and communities to adapt their
        food systems to climate impacts, through at least $100 million
        in adaptation funding in FY 2022.  USAID also invested more than
        $300 million in Resilient Food Security Activities in FY 2022
        across Africa that supports agricultural development and food
        security.  This year, Feed the Future expanded to eight
        additional African countries, the new Global Food Security
        Strategy further elevated inclusive and climate-resilient food
        systems, and climate information services work was expanded. 
        These efforts are yielding results.  For example, in 2022 in
        partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the
        Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research, climate-resilient
        maize varieties were planted on seven million hectares across 13
        African countries.  These heat, drought, and flood resistant
        maize varieties provided a 25% yield advantage, benefiting more
        than 44 million people.  
    -   ***Advancing Climate Security Through Sahel-Climate Advocacy and
        Peacebuilding with Pastoralists*** – This initiative aims to
        reduce the risk of farmer-herder climate change-related conflict
        in communities spanning the border of Niger and Benin by
        concurrently increasing herders’ access to political
        participation in local and national government and improving
        herders’ and farmers’ access to climate forecasts of rainfall,
        droughts, and other environmental factors.  
-   **Accelerating Adaptation in SIDS** – The United States has also
    announced over $20 million to accelerate PREPARE’s work in SIDS. 
    This includes:  
    -   ***Expanding early-warning systems in the Pacific*** **SIDS** –
        This includes $15 million to increase the capacity of developing
        countries to understand, anticipate and prepare for climate
        impacts to public health and safety, food security, water
        resources, and coastal areas, which President Biden
        [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/29/fact-sheet-roadmap-for-a-21st-century-u-s-pacific-island-partnership/)
        at the historic U.S.- Pacific Island Leaders Summit.  NOAA will
        also provide university scholarships to five individuals from
        the region to communication increase the pipeline of qualified
        forecasters able to deliver climate-smart decision support.
         Additionally, NOAA will install roughly 20 satellite units
        across the region ensuring these forecasts and products reach
        the last mile.  
    -   ***Supporting climate resilience and sustainable development in
        SIDS through the Local2030 Islands Network*** – This includes
        advancing island-led resilience through engagement and technical
        support through the Network, which currently includes 20 island
        economies representing diverse geographical regions across the
        globe, with the largest concentration of members currently in
        the Pacific and Caribbean.  NOAA will expand its support for the
        Network to foster peer-to-peer learning opportunities, such as
        communities-of-practice, and support capacity-building
        activities, including training, research, extension and
        engagement, leveraging $4.5 million in new funding.  
    -   ***Supporting storm surge mapping*** – Starting with the
        Federated States of Micronesia, NOAA and USAID will develop
        storm surge risk maps to improve understanding of storm surge
        flooding vulnerability from landfalling tropical cyclones,
        providing critical information to save lives and avoid climate
        impacts.  
-   **Supporting Climate Affected Vulnerable Migrants** – The United
    States announced a contribution of $5 million to the Migration
    Multi-Partner Trust Fund to support climate-affected vulnerable
    migrants.  This program underscores our commitment to the vision of
    the Global Compact for Migration, including improving cooperation on
    international migration.  It also advances the Biden
    Administration’s climate strategy, reflected in the 2021 White House
    Report on the Impact of Climate Change on Migration, to address the
    impact of climate change on vulnerable populations across the globe.

**<u>ACCELERATING GLOBAL CLIMATE ACTION:</u>**  
  
President Biden believes that tackling the climate crisis and keeping
the 1.5-degree C temperature goal within reach requires “all hands on
deck” – demanding the mobilization of local, state, and national
governments, the private sector, and philanthropies. At COP27, President
Biden and his Administration announced new initiatives to advance this
objective, including:

-   **Accelerating Egypt’s Clean Energy Economy, Enhancing Climate
    Ambition, and Supporting Energy Security –** Germany and the United
    States announced over $250 million in resources to unlock $10
    billion in commercial investment to support Egypt’s clean energy
    economy.  The program will deploy 10 GW of new wind and solar energy
    while decommissioning five GW of inefficient natural gas
    generation.  This program, coordinated by the European Bank for
    Reconstruction and Development, will support Egypt’s Country
    Platform for the Nexus of Food, Water, and Energy (NWFE).  Egypt
    committed to enhance its Nationally Determined Contribution to
    incorporate a commitment to quadruple its installed renewables
    capacity share to 42% by 2030.  Egypt also committed to adopt an
    ambitious 2050 long-term strategy with a view to explore a net zero
    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target and kick-start the development
    of green hydrogen.  Additionally, Egypt committed to expand the use
    of zero-emission vehicles, sustainable public transport, and other
    solutions for reducing GHG emissions from transport.  The three
    countries committed to cooperate on reducing methane emissions from
    Egypt’s oil and gas sector.  These commitments will yield major
    climate benefits by reducing Egypt’s power sector emissions by about
    one fifth and cutting methane pollution.  They will also enhance
    energy security by freeing up over two billion cubic meters of
    gas.  
-   **Expanding the Global Methane Pledge to Rapidly Reduce Global
    Temperatures While Boosting Energy Security –** Reducing methane
    emissions is the fastest way to lower global temperatures in the
    near term, avoid dangerous climate tipping points, and alleviate
    global adaptation burdens.  Limiting warming to 1.5°C will require
    dramatic reductions in global methane emissions of at least 30% by
    2030 from 2020 levels, as called for in the Global Methane Pledge
    (GMP) launched by the United States and European Union at COP26. 
    The GMP has now been endorsed by over 130 countries representing
    over half of global methane emissions.  
      
    The oil and gas sector represents the fastest and deepest methane
    emissions reductions opportunities to achieve the GMP target.
     Capturing flared and leaked gas in the oil and gas sector is also a
    critical near-term solution to boost global gas supplies and support
    energy security, as 260 billion cubic meters of gas are currently
    wasted every year from flaring and methane emissions within the
    sector.  This is why President Biden launched the GMP Energy Pathway
    at the Major Economies Forum in June 2022, alongside the European
    Union and 11 other countries, to accelerate global reductions in
    fossil energy methane.  
      
    Today, President Biden announced major new U.S. actions and welcomed
    new international actions to rapidly reduce methane emissions,
    particularly in the energy sector, including:  
    -   ***Strengthening proposed domestic methane standards in the oil
        and gas sector that*** ***would reduce wasted energy and harmful
        emissions from covered sources by 87 percent below 2005 levels
        while delivering economic benefits*** **–** Today, the U.S.
        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it is
        strengthening the agency’s proposed standards to cut methane and
        other harmful air pollutants from the oil and natural gas
        industry.  If finalized, these standards will protect workers
        and communities, maintain and create high-quality,
        union-friendly jobs, and promote U.S. innovation and
        manufacturing of critical new, all while delivering significant
        economic benefits through increased recovery of wasted gas.  The
        new proposal also includes a ground-breaking “Super-Emitter
        Response Program” that would require operators to respond to
        credible third-party reports of high-volume methane leaks.   
    -   [***Updating the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action
        Plan***](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/US-Methane-Emissions-Reduction-Action-Plan-Update.pdf)
        – Building upon the first-ever U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction
        Action Plan released at COP26, President Biden today unveiled an
        updated plan showcasing enhanced ambition and progress to
        achieve deep methane reductions in the United States, while
        cutting consumer costs, spurring job creation, and securing
        economic gains. The plan includes more than $20 billion of new
        investments to reduce methane emissions from the Bipartisan
        Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and annual
        appropriations.  The updated plan outlines how the
        Administration is taking over 50 actions to tackle methane
        emissions at home.  
    -   ***Welcoming over 130 countries which have now endorsed the
        Global Methane Pledge*** – The GMP now covers over half of
        global methane emissions and over two-thirds of the global
        economy.  In its first year, the GMP has spurred implementation
        including significant progress on national methane action plans
        and new landmark policies and initiatives across all major
        sectors.  
    -   ***Launching a Joint Declaration from Energy Importers and
        Exporters*** ***on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil
        Fuels*** – Launched alongside the European Union, Japan, Canada,
        Norway, and the United Kingdom, the declaration unites major
        energy importers and exporters to minimize flaring, methane, and
        CO2 emissions across the fossil energy value chain to the
        fullest extent practicable.  These countries will support
        enhanced policy action, cooperation on methane measurement, and
        public and private sector engagement to achieve these goals.  
    -   ***Welcoming the launch of the Methane Alert and Response System
        (MARS*) –** Today, the UN Environment Programs’ International
        Methane Emissions Observatory launched MARS, a new system to
        tackle methane “super-emitters” by providing countries and
        companies with data to enable action on major emissions
        sources.  
    -   ***Welcoming enhanced action on methane mitigation from
        international partners, including Nigeria, Canada, and Mexico***
        **–** All of these countries are among the 20 largest emitters
        of methane in the oil and gas sector.  Nigeria celebrated the
        finalization and publication of its first-ever methane
        regulations in its oil and gas sector.  Canada reaffirmed its
        commitment to reduce oil and gas methane emissions by at least
        75% by 2030 below 2012 levels through strengthened regulatory
        action and industry partnerships.  The U.S. Environmental
        Protection Agency and PEMEX also launched cooperation to reduce
        methane emissions in Mexico’s oil and gas sector, tackling an
        emissions source that rivals the emissions from Mexico’s entire
        power sector.  The U.S Trade and Development Agency is also
        supporting partners in methane abatement by leveraging the
        best-in-class technical expertise of U.S. industry in this area,
        including by funding a series of three reverse trade missions in
        2023 to familiarize partners with the latest U.S. methane
        abatement technologies and services.  
-   **Launching the Green Shipping Challenge** – Following President
    Biden’s call to action at his June 2022 MEF, the United States and
    Norway launched the Green Shipping Challenge at COP27, with more
    than 40 major announcements from countries, ports, and companies on
    the actions they are taking to help align the shipping sector with
    the goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C.  For our
    part, the United States announced initiatives including: three new
    bilateral workstreams focused on facilitating green shipping
    corridors with the Republic of Korea, Canada, and the United
    Kingdom, the development of a U.S. maritime decarbonization
    strategy, and the launch of a Green Shipping Corridors Initiation
    Project with $1.5 million, subject to Congressional notification and
    the completion of domestic procedures, to support feasibility
    studies for green shipping corridors involving developing countries.
    These efforts build on U.S. leadership in zero-emission shipping,
    including $3 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act to support
    zero-emission port equipment, technology, and climate action plans;
    more than $700 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make U.S.
    ports more efficient and resilient; and U.S. efforts at the
    International Maritime Organization (IMO) to advance a goal of
    phasing out greenhouse gas emissions from the international shipping
    sector to zero no later than 2050.  
-   **Accelerating Zero Emissions Solutions in Ukraine and the EU
    Through Advanced Nuclear:**  This announcement launches two projects
    that showcase the use of innovative small modular reactor (SMR)
    technologies for powering global decarbonization efforts and
    providing options to achieve net-zero economies in hard-to-abate
    energy sectors.  These include (i) commencing a 2-year *Ukraine
    Clean Fuels from SMRs Pilot* demonstration project in Ukraine to
    efficiently produce clean hydrogen fuels from SMR and cutting-edge
    electrolysis technologies and to establish new avenues to achieve
    food security through production of clean ammonia for fertilizer
    production, and (ii) launching a new initiative, *Project Phoenix*,
    to move Europe from coal-fired plants to SMRs while retaining and
    retraining local jobs through U.S. support for coal-to-SMR
    feasibility studies and supporting activities.  
-   **Establishing an International Climate Hub for Climate-Smart
    Agriculture** – Modeled after USDA domestic Climate Hubs, USDA
    intends to create an International Climate Hub to further support
    global science-based, climate-informed decision-making.  USDA
    Climate Hubs serve as the premier model for developing and
    delivering science-based, region-specific information and
    technologies to U.S. agricultural and natural resource managers that
    enable climate-informed decision-making.  By creating a new
    International Climate Hub, USDA will help support goals set out in
    PREPARE, the Global Methane Pledge, and the Global Fertilizer
    Challenge.  By sharing the best practices and research on
    climate-smart agriculture and forestry, including those gained from
    international coalitions and research consortia, we can help address
    climate change on a global-scale, build out new and better markets
    for U.S. products and make agriculture production more efficient and
    productive everywhere.   
-   **Announcing New Initiatives for Governments to Lead by Example**
    -   ***Engaging U.S. Federal Government suppliers*** – Today,
        President Biden announced historic new action that would make
        the United States the first national government to require major
        suppliers to set Paris Agreement-aligned emissions reduction
        goals.  This action would reduce GHGs and protect the Federal
        Government’s supply chains from climate-related financial risks.
         As the world’s single largest buyer of goods and services –
        with over $630 billion in spending last year alone, climate
        change poses significant financial risks to the Federal
        Government.  Through the Federal Supplier Climate Risks and
        Resilience Proposed Rule, major Federal Government contractors
        would be required to publicly disclose their GHG emissions and
        climate-related financial risks and set science-based emissions
        reduction targets.  
    -   ***Launching the Net-Zero Government Initiative*** – This
        initiative leverages the catalytic role of national governments
        in accelerating the implementation and achievement of countries’
        climate targets.   Participating countries commit to achieving
        net-zero emissions from national government operations by no
        later than 2050, developing a roadmap and interim targets by
        COP28 that outlines their pathway for getting there, and
        publishing the roadmap upon completion.  Over 15 countries will
        join the United States in this Initiative.  
    -   ***Launching the Subnational Climate Action Leaders’ Exchange***
        – The U.S. State Department and Bloomberg Philanthropies are
        supporting a first-of-its-kind initiative, the Subnational
        Climate Action Leaders Exchange (SCALE), to help cities, states,
        and regions develop and implement net-zero, climate-resilient
        targets and roadmaps.  SCALE will empower subnational champions
        to drive ambition at the national and international level and
        will leverage action and advocacy organized around a set of
        high-level goals needed to keep a 1.5-aligned, climate-resilient
        future within reach.  In its first phase, SCALE will focus on
        accelerating implementation of the Global Methane Pledge and its
        call for a 30 percent reduction in methane emissions by 2030.  
-   **Launching the Net-Zero Game Changers Initiative** – This
    initiative accelerates game-changing climate innovations and
    supercharges the public and private climate innovation ecosystem to
    help the United States meet President Biden’s goal of reaching
    net-zero emissions by no later than 2050.  To launch the initiative,
    the White House Climate Policy Office, Office of Management and
    Budget, and Office of Science and Technology Policy released a new
    report, [*U.S. Innovation to Meet 2050 Climate
    Goals*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-makes-historic-investment-in-americas-national-labs-announces-net-zero-game-changers-initiative/),
    which describes 37 game-changing R&D opportunities identified across
    U.S. Federal agencies. With inclusive and intentional innovation,
    these innovations can help propel the United States and the rest of
    the world towards an affordable, equitable, net-zero energy system.

**<u>CATALYZING INVESTMENT AT THE SCALE REQUIRED TO TACKLE THE CLIMATE
CRISIS</u>**  
  
The United States is committed to not only meeting President Biden’s
ambitious goal to quadruple U.S. climate finance to over $11 billion a
year and working with other countries to meet the goal of mobilizing
$100 billion, but also to using public finance in new and innovative
ways to unlock the much larger pools of capital that will be required to
tackle the climate crisis.  These efforts are in direct support of the
Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.  These efforts
include:

-   **Launching “Climate Finance +”** – The U.S. Millennium Challenge
    Corporation (MCC) and USAID are collaborating to accelerate the use
    of innovative finance mechanisms that aim to leverage billions in
    new public and private investment in low and lower-middle income
    countries.  This Climate Finance + effort will support potential
    green bonds and other climate-related financing through MCC
    technical assistance in Indonesia, Mozambique, and Zambia and USAID
    support for the development of green bonds in at least five
    additional countries via public-private partnerships.  
-   **Investing over $2.3 billion in Innovative Financing for Climate in
    2022 through the U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation** – The U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation (DFC) announced in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 it invested
    more than $2.3 billion to combat the climate crisis through
    mitigation and resilience projects that have a positive
    developmental impact.  Recognizing the urgent need to scale up
    private-investment in adaptation efforts in developing countries,
    DFC has announced a major push to accelerate its investments in this
    area.  In FY 2022, more than $390 million of the agency’s
    investments went to projects that helped to bolster developing
    countries’ resilience, and an additional $200 million went to deals
    that will generate adaptation co-benefits.  Building on this
    momentum, DFC is accepting climate adaptation business proposals for
    financing to support resilience in developing countries, with an
    emphasis on four sectors: agriculture, water, built environment, and
    health.  DFC’s investments also helped support clean energy
    solutions that provide reliable, affordable energy to help
    developing countries meet rising demand and support economic
    development.   
-   **Unlocking Billions in Finance and Facilitating U.S. Clean
    Technology Exports Through Strategic Investments by the U.S. Trade
    and Development Agency and U.S. Export-Import Bank** – In April
    2021, President Biden announced the launch of the U.S. Trade and
    Development Agency’s (USTDA) Global Partnership for Climate-Smart
    Infrastructure to connect U.S. industry to major clean energy and
    transportation infrastructure projects in emerging economies.  At
    COP27, USTDA announced that it has [already funded more than 50
    activities](https://ustda.gov/wp-content/uploads/USTDA-GPCSI-Factsheet.pdf)
    through the Partnership that will help its partners in developing
    and middle-income countries achieve their energy and transportation
    sector climate mitigation and adaptation goals.  These activities
    are designed to help unlock more than $65 billion in climate finance
    and support more than $15 billion in U.S. exports.  Additionally,
    the U.S. Export-Import Bank
    [announced](https://www.exim.gov/news/export-import-bank-united-states-announces-letters-interest-for-nuclear-exports-romania)
    that it has provided over $175 million in financing to support U.S.
    exports of climate friendly technologies, its highest volume of
    authorizations for clean technology exports in years.  
-   **Launching the Sustainable Banking Alliance** –USAID will help
    deepen the sustainable financial sectors in developing countries by
    partnering with community financial institutions and banking
    associations across the globe to develop tools and capacity focused
    on climate financing, climate risk, and carbon accounting and will
    encourage climate finance target-setting for community banks.  The
    activity will be launched with two pilot countries, Colombia and
    Rwanda, with an initial total budget of just over $1 million.  The
    Alliance supports USAID’s Action Plan for Climate and SDG
    Investment.

**<u>ENGAGING ALL OF SOCIETY IN TACKLING THE CLIMATE CRISIS:</u>**  
  
President Biden believes that tackling the climate crisis must take an
inclusive approach, engaging all members of society.  At COP27, the
United States announced new initiatives to advance this objective,
including:

-   **Launching the Climate Gender Equity Fund** – With initial seed
    funding of $6 million, USAID is co-launching a new Climate Gender
    Equity Fund in, partnership with Amazon, which will leverage private
    sector contributions to help provide women climate leaders with
    technical skills, networks, and capital to develop and scale climate
    solutions.  The Fund is enabled by USAID’s commitment to
    gender-responsive climate action, including its allocating more than
    $21 million from the Gender Equity and Equality Action (GEEA) Fund,
    surpassing its $14 million COP26 commitment.  
-   **Investing in Climate Leadership for Egyptian Women** – USAID is
    spurring climate action by investing in education and skills
    building for women and youth.  USAID has made a $23 million initial
    investment in a new nine-year program that aims to build a more
    inclusive Egyptian workforce, with an emphasis on sectors with the
    potential to contribute to climate goals such as environment and
    energy.    
-   **Launching the Indigenous Peoples Finance Access Facility** – This
    Facility will enable the continued climate stewardship by Indigenous
    peoples and local communities improving their access to climate
    finance.  This three-year, $2 million-dollar program, implemented by
    Indigenous peoples within Conservation International, will provide
    trainings, tools, and workshops to build long-term capacity and
    enhance access to climate finance.  
-   **Empowering Youth as Resilience and Clean Energy Leaders** – The
    U.S. State Department is launching two three-week, in-person
    On-Demand Youth Leadership Program exchanges for approximately 40
    high school-aged youth and adult mentors from the United States and
    countries across Africa to develop a deeper understanding among
    young leaders about climate adaptation and clean energy and to
    foster their ability to provide solutions to the climate crisis in
    their home communities. The exchanges are scheduled for spring 2023.
