title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Deadly Shooting in Colorado\_Springs"
---
 
While no motive in this attack is yet clear, we know that the LGBTQI+
community has been subjected to horrific hate violence in recent years.
Gun violence continues to have a devastating and particular impact
on LGBTQI+ communities across our nation and threats of violence are
increasing. We saw it six years ago in Orlando, when our nation suffered
the deadliest attack affecting the LGBTQI+ community in American
history. We continue to see it in the epidemic of violence and murder
against transgender women – especially transgender women of color. And
tragically, we saw it last night in this devastating attack by a gunman
wielding a long rifle at an LGBTQI+ nightclub in Colorado Springs.

Places that are supposed to be safe spaces of acceptance and celebration
should never be turned into places of terror and violence. Yet it
happens far too often. We must drive out the inequities that contribute
to violence against LGBTQI+ people. We cannot and must not tolerate
hate.

Today, yet another community in America has been torn apart by gun
violence. More families left with an empty chair at the table and hole
in their lives that cannot be filled. When will we decide we’ve had
enough? We must address the public health epidemic of gun violence in
all of its forms. Earlier this year, I signed the most significant gun
safety law in nearly three decades, in addition to taking other historic
actions. But we must do more. We need to enact an assault weapons ban to
get weapons of war off America’s streets. 

Today, Jill and I are praying for the families of the five people killed
in Colorado Springs last night, and for those injured in this senseless
attack.
