WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate
Danny Werfel to serve as Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.

Danny Werfel is a public and private sector leader who has served under
both Democratic and Republican administrations. Across more than 15
years of government service, Werfel served President Barack Obama and
President George W. Bush to lead some of the governments’ most complex
management challenges as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Acting
Commissioner and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Controller. In
the wake of an Inspector General report alleging various forms of
mismanagement and bias in the determination of tax-exempt status for
non-profit organizations, President Obama appointed Werfel to serve as
Acting Commissioner of IRS in 2013. Werfel provided immediate stability
to the IRS, effectively responding to numerous Congressional
investigations, successfully launching the Affordable Care Act
technology that IRS was responsible for, and navigated the IRS through a
multi-week government shutdown. At the end of his tenure, both the
majority and minority leaders of the Senate Finance Committee publicly
recognized his contribution and performance. As OMB Controller, Werfel
successfully led a cross-government effort to ensure the $787 billion
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was implemented transparently and
with minimal fraud or error. He also led the government-wide efforts to
prepare for and implement the budget sequester of FY2013. Werfel played
a key role under the Bush Administration in the implementation of the
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, overseeing the efforts of
the Office of Financial Stability to achieve a clean financial statement
audit in its first year of existence.

Werfel has spent the last nine years at Boston Consulting Group where he
helped launch their U.S. public sector practice. He holds a Bachelor of
Science in Industrial and Labor Relations (with honors) from Cornell
University, a Juris Doctor (with honors) from the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill, and a Master of Public Policy from Duke
University. Werfel lives in the District of Columbia with his wife and
two children.
