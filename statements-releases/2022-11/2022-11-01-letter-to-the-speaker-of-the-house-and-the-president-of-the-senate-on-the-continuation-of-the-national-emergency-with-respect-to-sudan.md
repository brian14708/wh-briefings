Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan declared in
Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997, is to continue in effect
beyond November 3, 2022.   
  
Sudan made strides in its transition toward democracy between 2019 and
2021, but the October 2021 military takeover of the government has
reversed those modest gains.  The crisis that led to the declaration of
a national emergency in Executive Order 13067; the expansion of that
emergency in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006; and the taking of
additional steps with respect to that emergency in Executive Order 13412
of October 13, 2006, Executive Order 13761 of January 13, 2017, and
Executive Order 13804 of July 11, 2017, has not been resolved.  The
situation in Darfur continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United
States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, as expanded by
Executive Order 13400, with respect to Sudan.

                               Sincerely,  
  
                                        JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
