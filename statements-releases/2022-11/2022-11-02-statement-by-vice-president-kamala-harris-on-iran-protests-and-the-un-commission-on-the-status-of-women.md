title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Iran Protests and the UN Commission\
  \ on the Status of\_Women"
---
 
The United States continues to stand with the brave women of Iran as
they protest peacefully for their fundamental rights and basic human
dignity. All people in Iran must have the right to freedom of expression
and assembly, and Iran must end its use of violence against its own
citizens simply for exercising their fundamental freedoms.  
  
The United States believes that no nation that systematically abuses the
rights of women and girls should play a role in any international or
United Nations body charged with protecting these very same rights.  The
UN Commission on the Status of Women and its members are charged with
“promoting women’s rights” and addressing “urgent problems requiring
immediate attention in the field of women’s rights.”  Iran has
demonstrated through its denial of women’s rights and brutal crackdown
on its own people that it is unfit to serve on this Commission; Iran’s
very presence discredits the integrity of its membership and the work to
advance its mandate.  This is why today the United States is announcing
our intention to work with our partners to remove Iran from the UN
Commission on the Status of Women.   
  
To all of those protesting I say again, we see you and we hear you. I am
inspired by your bravery, as are people around the world. We will
continue to hold accountable the Iranian officials and entities
responsible for the violence against protestors.
