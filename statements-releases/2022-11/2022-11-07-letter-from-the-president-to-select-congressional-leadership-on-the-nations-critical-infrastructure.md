Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Representative:) (Dear Senator:)  
(Dear Mr. Chairman:)  
  
I am providing this report, consistent with section 9002(b)(3) of the
William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-283) (the “Act”), as part of my efforts
to keep the Congress informed of our work to secure the Nation’s
critical infrastructure.  
  
Pursuant to section 9002(b)(1)(B) of the Act, the Secretary of Homeland
Security (Secretary) submitted to me in November of 2021, and
subsequently provided to the appropriate congressional committees, a
report assessing the current framework for securing the Nation’s
critical infrastructure and providing relevant recommendations.  I
reviewed the Secretary’s report and did not identify any critical
concerns with its findings or recommendations.  The Secretary’s report
incorporated feedback received through reviews led by both Department of
Homeland Security and White House staff.   
  
Recognizing the need to drive implementation of the Secretary’s
recommendations across the Federal Government, my Administration will
launch a process to review and revise, as appropriate, the primary
United States policy for critical infrastructure, Presidential Policy
Directive 21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical Infrastructure Security and
Resilience).  The strategic imperatives of today must address the
increasing digitalization and automation of our infrastructure, efforts
by our adversaries to gain footholds into our infrastructure, and the
existential threat of climate change.  Updated policy would strengthen
the public-private partnership and provide clear guidance to executive
departments and agencies (agencies) on designating certain critical
infrastructure as systemically important.  Moreover, it would clarify
the roles, responsibilities, and services of the Sector Risk Management
Agencies and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
to coordinate a national effort to secure and protect against critical
infrastructure risks.  
  
I therefore accept the recommendations of the Secretary of Homeland
Security and look forward to working with him to oversee the
implementation of these recommendations in close coordination with
relevant agencies and the private sector.  Specifically, the National
Security Council and the Office of the National Cyber Director staff
will closely monitor and provide guidance to CISA, as appropriate, in
the implementation of the action items in the Secretary’s report.  
  
Furthermore, the events of the past 2 years highlight the need for
urgent action to improve the cybersecurity of our critical
infrastructure.  Our Nation lacks a comprehensive way to establish
mandatory minimum cybersecurity requirements across our critical
infrastructure, and current approaches differ by sector.  My
Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to fill gaps
in statutory authorities to ensure our critical infrastructure is
protected from cyber attacks.  
  
My Administration is committed to working closely with the Congress on
these matters to ensure more secure and resilient infrastructure while
creating good-paying jobs, strengthening small businesses, and investing
in the future.

                               Sincerely,   
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
