It is my pleasure to announce that, as part of the United States’ 2023
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Host Year, we will convene the
APEC Leaders Meeting in San Francisco, California, the week of November
12. President Biden and I look forward to welcoming APEC Leaders to San
Francisco next year and to a successful meeting where we will promote
economic growth and prosperity for the American people, and people
throughout the Indo-Pacific region.  
   
As I told APEC Leaders in Bangkok, Thailand, at the 2022 APEC Leaders
Meeting, there is no better place to host APEC 2023 than California, a
state known for economic innovation.  
   
Our host year will demonstrate the enduring economic commitment of the
United States to the Indo-Pacific. As I have made clear throughout my
time in Bangkok: under our Administration, the United States is a strong
partner for the economies and companies of the Indo-Pacific, and we are
working to strengthen our economic relationships throughout the region,
including by increasing two-way trade flows and the free flow of
capital, which supports millions of American jobs.  
   
During our host year, the United States will continue to focus on
sustainable economic growth, building on the strong foundation Thailand
has set in 2022. In particular, we will work with APEC economies to make
new sustainability and decarbonization commitments.
