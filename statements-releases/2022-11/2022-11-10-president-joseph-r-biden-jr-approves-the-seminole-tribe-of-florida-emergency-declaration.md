title: "President\_Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\_Approves\_the Seminole Tribe of Florida\_\
  Emergency\_Declaration"
---
 
Last night, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that an emergency
exists for the Seminole Tribe of Florida and
ordered Federal assistance to supplement the Tribe’s response
efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting
from Tropical Storm Nicole beginning on November 7, 2022, and
continuing.  

The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and
to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe for the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures (Category B),
including direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance
program will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding.  

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas J. McCool as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.
