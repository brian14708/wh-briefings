title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces New U.S. Support for Clean Energy\
  \ in the Mekong\_Region"
---
 
The Vice President’s visit to Thailand is reaffirming United States’
commitment to the stability, peace, prosperity, and sustainable
development of the Mekong sub-region through cooperation with
Mekong-region countries.  
   
In Bangkok, the Vice President is convening civil society leaders
involved in climate action and environmental protection in Northern
Thailand and business leaders involved in the clean energy transition to
advance our work in the Mekong sub-region. The Vice President is
announcing new funding to support clean energy, connectivity, and
sustainable economic development in the Mekong sub-region.  
   
This announcement builds on the announcements the Vice
President [made](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=854c598e70&e=0ca263633c) to
support the Mekong sub-region in protecting the environment and
supporting sustainable use of natural resources, including the
Mekong-Mississippi Sister Rivers Partnership and the Mekong NextGen
Scientists program.

Japan-U.S.-Mekong Power Partnership (JUMPP)</span>  
  
The Vice President is announcing that the Administration intends to
request from Congress up to $20 million in additional funding to JUMPP,
which supports the Mekong sub-region’s pursuit of energy security while
encouraging greater regional power flows, clean energy integration,
decarbonization, and resilience.  Since announcing JUMPP in August 2019
with an initial U.S. investment of $29.5 million, the United States and
Japan have expanded partnerships with Mekong countries to build more
competitive and connected energy markets and infrastructure.  JUMPP
supports Mekong governments in achieving their clean energy transition
and regional interconnection goals.  
  
Mekong countries are rapidly integrating renewable energy projects that
require technical assistance for modernizing regulations, market
mechanisms, and for maintaining stability and reliability. Expanding
renewable energy generation capacity across the Mekong helps diversify
the region’s electricity mix and reduce reliance on hydropower capacity.
JUMPP assists countries with technical assistance supporting strong
energy markets and reliably integrating renewable energy to ensure
citizens have access to reliable, secure, and affordable energy supplies
to support economic growth and prosperity.
