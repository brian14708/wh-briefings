title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Archbishop Chrysostomos\_\
  II"
---
 
I am deeply saddened by the passing of Archbishop Chrysostomos II—a man
of remarkable conviction and courage who led Cyprus’ Greek Orthodox
Christian Church with grace during a pivotal period.  
  
Archbishop Chrysostomos II was a dedicated leader who never shied away
from speaking up for the most vulnerable communities in Cyprus.  He
was also steadfast in his commitment to the peaceful resolution of the
conflict in Cyprus. In 2014, I had the honor
of meeting with the Archbishop in Nicosia. I was touched by his
compassion—he was a leader dedicated to interfaith
dialogue and committed to unity among all religious communities in
Cyprus.  
  
Jill and I offer our deepest condolences to Cyprus’ Greek Orthodox
Christian Church, the Republic of Cyprus, and all those who followed or
were positively impacted by the Archbishop’s spiritual guidance.
