title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Launches New Initiatives to Strengthen U.S.-Philippines\_\
  Alliance"
---
 
The United States and the Philippines enjoy an alliance and partnership
based on deep historical, economic, and cultural ties, and our shared
democratic values.  The United States and the Philippines stand together
as friends, partners, and allies.  Now and always, the U.S. commitment
to the defense of the Philippines is ironclad, and we are committed to
strengthening our economic and investment relationship.  
   
The Vice President’s travel to the Philippines reaffirms the bilateral
alliance and will spur cooperation on a range of issues, including: 
advancing clean energy, addressing the climate crisis, promoting
inclusive growth and innovation, increasing access to quality education
and health resources, combating trafficking in persons, facing common
security challenges, supporting freedom of the seas, and deepening
people-to-people ties.  
   
The Vice President is launching the following initiatives.  
   
**CLIMATE ACTION, ENERGY SECURITY, AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE**

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Energy Policy Dialogue:
    </span>The U.S Department of Energy, U.S. Department of State, and
    Philippine Department of Energy will establish an Energy Policy
    Dialogue, a high-level platform for the two nations to develop new
    forms of energy cooperation, including on short and long-term energy
    planning, offshore wind development, and grid stability and power
    transmission.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Launching 123 Agreement
    Negotiations for Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation:</span> The Vice
    President announced that the United States and the Philippines are
    initiating negotiations on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement
    (“123 agreement”) to support expanded cooperation on zero-emission
    energy and nonproliferation priorities.  Once in force, this
    agreement will provide the legal basis for U.S. exports of nuclear
    equipment and material to the Philippines. The United States is
    committed to working with the Philippines to increase energy
    security and deploying advanced nuclear reactor technology as
    quickly as safety and security conditions permit to meet the
    Philippines’ dire baseload power needs.  Such a deployment would
    support both energy security and climate goals, as well as support
    workers and businesses in both countries.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Critical Mineral Supply
    Chains: </span>The United States, through the U.S. Trade &
    Development Agency (USTDA), will support the development of a nickel
    and cobalt processing facility in the Philippines, which will expand
    the production of refined nickel and cobalt in the Philippines by
    20,000 metric tons per year. The project will advance the
    sustainable development of critical minerals essential to the
    technologies for the clean energy transition. 

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Construction of a
    Geothermal Power Project in Mindanao:  </span>The United States,
    through USTDA, will partner with Philippine energy company Energy
    Development Corporation (EDC) to develop a geothermal project in
    Mindanao that will expand access to clean energy, reduce emissions,
    diversify the Philippines’ energy mix, and bring down energy costs
    for consumers. 

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Building the Project
    Pipeline:</span> USTDA will open an office in U.S. Embassy Manila to
    help U.S. companies and financiers invest in the Philippine market,
    supporting the energy and infrastructure needs of the Philippines
    and the broader Indo-Pacific region. This office will ensure that
    USTDA’s current pipeline of bankable projects reach financial close
    and that new project opportunities are identified in partnership
    with the Asian Development Bank, U.S. development finance
    institutions, private banks, and other country partners in the
    region. Partnering more strategically with regional financiers will
    ensure high-quality infrastructure projects are financed and
    implemented using U.S. technology and expertise, creating mutual
    benefit among the Philippines, the United States, and the broader
    Indo-Pacific Region.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Indo-Pacific Smart and
    Secure Ports Development:  </span>Through this project, the United
    States will help build partner capacity to identify and mitigate
    cybersecurity risks in critical seaport infrastructure.  It will
    also promote the use of trusted vendors for the installation and
    maintenance of digital and automated port infrastructure, as ports
    modernize and become “smarter” and “greener.” 

   
**ENHANCED DEFENSE COOPERATION AGREEMENT**

-   The 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) builds on the
    1951 Mutual Defense Treaty and 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement,
    providing a legal basis for Philippine and American service members
    to undertake security cooperation exercises, pursue joint and
    combined military training activities, and rapidly respond to
    humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts from agreed
    locations in the Philippines, on a rotational basis. EDCA sites have
    also been used by U.S. and Philippine forces during Kamandag and
    Balikatan military exercises.

<!-- -->

-   The United States has allocated over $82 million towards EDCA
    implementation at all five existing locations. This investment, and
    forthcoming additional allotment, will complete 21 projects,
    enabling the United States and the Philippines to build lasting
    security infrastructure to promote long-term modernization, build a
    credible mutual defense posture, maintain humanitarian assistance
    and disaster relief capabilities, and enhance the strength of the
    alliance.

<!-- -->

-   New EDCA locations have also been identified to enable the United
    States and the Philippines to continue to work together towards
    achieving the agreed objectives under EDCA.

<!-- -->

-   The United States has awarded the vast majority of contracts
    supporting these projects to Philippine companies, generating
    economic growth in local Philippine communities and building lasting
    friendships between the United States and Philippines.

   
**FOOD SECURITY & SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE**

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Food Security Dialogue:
    </span>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, with participation from
    USAID and the U.S. Department of State, will establish a food
    security dialogue with Philippine counterparts. This dialogue will
    enable the two nations to collaborate to create resilient food
    systems and discuss best practices for agricultural innovation and
    sustainability.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Bolstering Organic
    Agriculture in the Philippines: </span>The U.S. International
    Development Finance Corporation (DFC) will issue a $20 million loan
    to enable Agri Exim Global Philippines, Inc., a local processor of
    organic coconuts into derivative products, to grow its processing
    facilities in the Philippines, helping thousands of local farmers
    get organic certification and connect to global supply chains and
    customers.

**UPSKILLING & THE DIGITAL ECONOMY**  
 

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Expanding Access to
    Reliable and Secure 5G Networks:</span> The United States, through
    USTDA, intends to partner with Philippine telecom operator NOW
    Telecom for the deployment of 5G technologies in the Philippines.
    These efforts will provide faster and more reliable digital services
    and increased broadband internet access for Filipinos countrywide. 

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Launching Satellite
    Broadband Service: </span>USAID is supporting the launch of the
    first Low Earth Orbit Satellite Broadband Service in Southeast Asia,
    in partnership with SpaceX Starlink, in the Philippines. Satellite
    broadband service will provide reliable and affordable internet
    access to marginalized populations throughout the Philippines,
    thereby improving access to education, professional training, and
    opportunity.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Providing Digital
    Opportunities to Small Businesses: </span>USAID will launch a new 
    Strengthening Private Enterprises for the Digital Economy (SPEED)
    award, a 5-year project that seeks to expand the participation of
    Philippine small and medium enterprises in the country’s emerging
    e-commerce ecosystem.  The SPEED launch will include the nationwide
    launch of the Philippine eCommerce Alliance that will signal an
    industry-wide commitment to accelerating the rise of the Philippine
    digital economy. This program will promote the use of digital
    technologies to accelerate competitiveness, drive innovation, fuel
    job opportunities, and enhance the market reach of enterprises. 

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Empowering a New Generation
    of Highly Skilled Workers: </span>USAID plans to support the new
    Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development Alliance. Leveraging
    $5.3 million in private sector contributions from seven Philippine
    companies, this public-private partnership will work with
    government, industry, and academia to create a highly skilled and
    adaptive workforce that meets the evolving requirements of the
    high-tech manufacturing sector.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Investing in Women
    Entrepreneurs:</span> DFC will provide a $15.5 million loan guaranty
    through a framework agreement with Citibank to support ASA
    Philippines Foundation, a microfinance institution helping women
    entrepreneurs access capital and contribute to economic growth in
    the Philippines.

   
**HUMAN RIGHTS AND HEALTH SECURITY**

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Philippines-UN Joint
    Programme for Human Rights:</span> The United States plans to
    support the three-year UN Joint Programme for Human Rights (UNJP), 
    a critical initiative for promoting human rights in the
    Philippines.  The United States financial contribution to the UNJP
    underscores our commitment to support the protection of human rights
    in the Philippines and enhancing the ability of the Philippines to
    fulfill its international human rights obligations and commitments.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Elevating the
    U.S.-Philippines Health Security Partnership: </span>Building on the
    United States’ more than $46  million in assistance for the
    Philippines’ response to COVID-19 and our donation of 33.6 million
    safe and effective COVID vaccines, the United States intends to
    invest $5 million to further accelerate vaccine rollout through the
    Global VAX initiative.  The United States will also invest $8
    million, subject to the availability of funds, to strengthen our
    global health security partnership with the Philippine health
    system, which will help prevent avoidable outbreaks, detect health
    threats early, and respond rapidly and effectively when outbreaks
    occur. In addition the U.S. Centers for Disease Control &
    Prevention (CDC) have established a new country office in the
    Philippines. These efforts reflect the United States’ prioritization
    of U.S.-Philippines health partnership under the Global Health
    Security Agenda (GHSA).

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Healthcare for
    Veterans:</span> In August, President Biden signed the PACT Act, a
    historic law that expands health care and benefits for Veterans
    exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances and provides
    generations of Veterans and their families with the care and
    benefits they’ve earned and deserve.  The U.S. Department of
    Veterans Affairs is ensuring Filipino veterans of the U.S. military,
    and their families, can benefit from the PACT Act, including by
    launching a Tagalog-language version of the PACT Act claims portal. 

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Combating Trafficking in
    Persons:</span> The United States is launching a new program with
    World Hope to combat the online sexual exploitation of children
    (OSEC) and support OSEC survivors in the Philippines, reflecting our
    shared commitment to eliminating human trafficking and preventing
    children from being exploited by sex traffickers and online
    predators.
