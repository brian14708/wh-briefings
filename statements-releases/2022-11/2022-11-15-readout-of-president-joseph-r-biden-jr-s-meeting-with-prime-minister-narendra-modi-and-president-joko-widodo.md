President Biden met today with Prime Minister Modi of India and
President Widodo of Indonesia on the margins of the G20 Leaders’ Summit
in Bali to reaffirm their shared commitment to the G20 as the premier
forum for international economic cooperation. Facing significant global
challenges, the Leaders discussed how the G20 continues to demonstrate
its collective capacity to bring together major economies to advance
sustainable and inclusive growth in our economies and beyond, tackle the
ongoing climate, energy, and food crises, strengthen global health
architecture and promote technological transformation.

President Biden congratulated President Widodo for Indonesia’s
leadership to galvanize countries around the world to launch the
Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) for Pandemic PPR hosted by the World
Bank (Pandemic Fund) to address gaps in pandemic prevention,
preparedness, and response. This success has laid the foundation to take
forward substantive health-finance collaborations during India’s G20
presidency.

At the meeting, President Biden said the United States will continue to
support the G20’s global leadership for developing improved and
innovative financing models for multilateral financial institutions to
provide solutions to challenges like climate change, pandemics, economic
fragility, reducing poverty and achieving SDGs, and to support inclusive
development, strengthen economic security and global supply chains.They
also discussed the importance of leveraging public and private financing
to close the infrastructure gap.

President Biden applauded Indonesia’s G20 Presidency for its efforts on
a successful G20 Leaders’ Summit. He looks forward to continuing to
support the G20’s work under India’s Presidency.
