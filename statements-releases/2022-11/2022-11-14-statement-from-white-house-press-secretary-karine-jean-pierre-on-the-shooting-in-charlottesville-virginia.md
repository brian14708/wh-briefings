title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Shooting\
  \ in Charlottesville,\_Virginia"

The President and First Lady are mourning with the University of
Virginia community after yet another deadly shooting in America has
taken the lives of three young people. Our deepest condolences are with
the countless families, friends, and neighbors grieving for those killed
as well as those injured in this senseless shooting.  
   
Administration officials are in close contact with state and local
officials, and we are grateful for those authorities’ swift response to
this attack.  
  
Too many families across America are bearing the awful burden of gun
violence. Earlier this year, President Biden signed the most significant
gun safety law in nearly three decades, in addition to taking other
historic actions. But we must do more. We need to enact an assault
weapons ban to get weapons of war off America’s streets. House Democrats
acted, and the Senate should follow.
