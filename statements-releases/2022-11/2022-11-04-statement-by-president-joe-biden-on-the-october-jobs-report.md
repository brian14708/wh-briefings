title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the October Jobs\_Report"
---
 
Today’s jobs report – adding 261,000 jobs with the unemployment rate
still at a historically low 3.7% — shows that our jobs recovery remains
strong.  With jobs now added every single month of my presidency, a
record setting 10 million job increase, a record 700,000 manufacturing
jobs added which puts us at 137,000 more manufacturing jobs than we had
before the pandemic, historically low Black and Hispanic unemployment
rates, the gross domestic product increasing, and incomes on the way up,
one thing is clear: while comments by Republican leadership sure seem to
indicate they are rooting for a recession, the US economy continues to
grow and add jobs even as gas prices continue to come down.    
  
Inflation is our top economic challenge, and I know that American
families are feeling squeezed. The global inflation that is raging in
other countries is hitting us as well.  I’ve got a plan to bring costs
down, especially for health care, energy, and other everyday expenses.
And we’re already making progress – the cost of gas at the pump is down
over $1.20 a gallon since this summer.  
  
The Republican plan is very different.  They want to increase
prescription drug costs, health insurance costs, and energy costs, while
giving more tax breaks to big corporations and the very wealthy. Here’s
the deal: cutting corporate taxes and allowing big pharma to raise
prices again is the Republican inflation plan and it’s a disaster.  
   
Let me be clear.  We’re going to do what it takes to bring inflation
down.  But as long as I’m president, I’m not going to accept an argument
that the problem is that too many Americans are finding good jobs.  Or
that too many working Americans finally have more dignity in the
workplace.  Or that our largest, most profitable corporations shouldn’t
have to pay their fair share.  I will continue to work for an economy
built from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down as my
Republican friends would have.
