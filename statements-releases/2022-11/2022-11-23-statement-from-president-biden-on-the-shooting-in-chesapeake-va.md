title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Shooting in Chesapeake,\_VA"
---
 
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving, one of our most cherished holidays that brings
us together as Americans and as families, when we hug our loved ones and
count our blessings. But because of yet another horrific and senseless
act of violence, there are now even more tables across the country that
will have empty seats this Thanksgiving. There are now more families who
know the worst kind of loss and pain imaginable.  
   
Jill and I grieve for those families, for the Chesapeake community, and
for the Commonwealth of Virginia, which just suffered a terrible
shooting at the University of Virginia this month. We also mourn for all
those across America who have lost loved ones to these tragic shootings
that we must come together as a nation to stand against.  
   
This year, I signed the most significant gun reform in a generation, but
that is not nearly enough. We must take greater action.  
   
We are grateful to the first responders who mobilized to assist victims,
and I have directed federal officials to provide any support and
assistance needed to the people of Chesapeake.
