title: "Statement By President Joe\_Biden on Senate Cloture of the Respect for Marriage\_\
  Act"
---
 
Love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person
they love.  Today’s bipartisan vote brings the United States one step
closer to protecting that right in law. The Respect for Marriage Act
will ensure that LGBTQI+ couples and interracial couples are respected
and protected equally under federal law, and provide more certainty to
these families since the Supreme Court’s decision in *Dobbs*. I want to
thank the Members of Congress whose leadership has sent a strong message
that Republicans and Democrats can work together to secure the
fundamental right of Americans to marry the person they love. I urge
Congress to quickly send this bill to my desk where I will promptly sign
it into law.
