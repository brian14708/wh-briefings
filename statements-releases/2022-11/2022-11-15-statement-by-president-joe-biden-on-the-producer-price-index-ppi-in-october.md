title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Producer Price Index (PPI) in\_October"
---
 
There’s more good news for our economy this morning, and more
indications that we are starting to see inflation moderate.  Today’s
news—that prices paid by businesses moderated last month—comes a week
after news that prices paid by consumers have also moderated.  And,
today’s report also showed that food inflation slowed—a welcome sign for
family’s grocery bills as we head into the holidays.  
   
The bottom line is this:  my economic plan is showing results, and we
face global economic challenges from a position of strength. As I said
last week, it will take time to get inflation back to normal levels—and
we could see setbacks along the way—but we will keep at it.  And I want
to repeat that I will work with anyone—Democrats or Republicans—who have
ideas on how we can provide more breathing room to middle-class and
working families.
