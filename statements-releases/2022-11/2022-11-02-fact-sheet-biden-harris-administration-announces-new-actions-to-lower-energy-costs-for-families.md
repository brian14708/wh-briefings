title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Lower\
  \ Energy Costs for\_Families"
---
 
Today, Vice President Harris will visit a union hall and training
facility in Boston to highlight new steps the Biden-Harris
Administration is taking to lower energy costs for working families and
support good-paying jobs and manufacturing in America. The Vice
President will underscore how the Administration is continuing to cut
energy costs for families ahead of winter. And, the Vice President will
highlight how President Biden’s economic plan will help households
afford energy efficient equipment when they need to make home repairs,
so they can save money on their utility bills for years to come.  
  
These steps will provide additional support for low- and moderate-income
families, and complement tax credits that families and building owners
can use under the Inflation Reduction Act to install energy-saving
equipment and to make building upgrades. President Biden’s economic plan
focuses on lowering energy costs for American families so they can keep
their homes warm in the winter and cool in the summer, especially as
communities across the country cope with extreme temperatures and
volatile weather fueled by climate change.  
  
New steps to lower energy costs for families include:

-   **New Resources for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program
    (LIHEAP):** The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
    through the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), today
    announced $4.5 billion in assistance to help lower heating costs for
    American families this winter. The LIHEAP funds will go to states,
    territories, and Tribes. In addition to covering home heating costs
    this winter and unpaid utility bills, the program will help families
    make cost-effective home energy repairs to lower their heating and
    cooling bills. This past year, LIHEAP served over 5.3 million
    households with heating, cooling, and weatherization services. This
    support is particularly important during the winter and summer
    months, as millions of Americans deal with extreme weather and
    natural disasters.
    See [here](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/low-income-home-energy-assistance-program-liheap) for
    more information on LIHEAP.  
     
-   **Announcing State Allocations from the Inflation Reduction Act to
    Make Homes More Energy Efficient: **DOE announced nearly $9 billion
    in funding allocations for states and Tribes under new state- and
    Tribe-administered home efficiency programs established by President
    Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. The new rebate program funding
    could support up to 1.6 million households nationwide in upgrading
    homes and apartments to lower energy bills, including by installing
    up to 500,000 heat pumps and conducting deep building retrofits
    through insulation and electrical wiring. When combined with the
    estimated 700,000 homes that will be weatherized with the expanded
    Weatherization Assistance Program under the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law, this puts America on track to achieve President
    Biden’s campaign goal to weatherize 2 million homes. In sum, these
    programs will make these cost-saving upgrades more accessible for
    low- and moderate-income families as states gain momentum toward
    deploying [at least 12 million heat
    pumps](https://rmi.org/millions-of-us-homes-are-installing-heat-pumps-will-it-be-enough/) by 2030.
    With today’s announcement, states can now access information about
    their allocated funding, and can begin planning programs to
    distribute relief to families using these funds.  
     
-   **Manufacturing Heat Pumps to Drive Energy Efficiency:** To support
    the leap forward in heat pump deployment driven by the Inflation
    Reduction Act, DOE also released a Notice of Intent and Request for
    Information on how to make best use of $250 million to enable more
    heat pump manufacturing in America, using Defense Production Act
    authorities invoked by President Biden last summer and funded by the
    President’s Inflation Reduction Act.  Heat pumps are highly
    efficient technology that can heat and cool homes and buildings
    using just half or a third of the energy used by traditional heating
    systems. Heat pumps hold tremendous promise to lower energy costs
    for all American families—saving up to $500 in energy bills every
    year—while supporting good jobs, reinvigorating American
    manufacturing, improving public health, mitigating climate change,
    and bolstering national security by reducing energy reliance on
    foreign adversaries. Families can access detailed information about
    the many programs supporting heat pumps and building upgrades from
    the Inflation Reduction Act
    at [www.cleanenergy.gov](http://www.cleanenergy.gov/).  
     
-   **Supporting Good-Paying Jobs**: DOE is announcing an upcoming
    roundtable with labor, businesses, and other key stakeholders to get
    input on the program design of $260 million in workforce development
    programs to support energy efficiency and building upgrades funded
    by the Inflation Reduction Act and by the President’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. Building on the momentum from these new
    programs, [Elevate](https://www.elevatenp.org/) and the [Relay
    Network](https://relaynetwork.org/), an independent partnership of
    mission-based organizations across from the U.S today committed to
    electrify thousands of affordable housing units and train more than
    100 people of color, women, and Veteran clean energy contractors in
    partnership with heat pump manufacturers.  
     
-   **Catalyzing Private Sector Action:** The private sector is stepping
    up to this huge opportunity. Today, a group of companies led by
    Airbnb, Redfin, Lyft, Duquesne Light Company, Mosaic, Arcadia, and
    Propel are partnering with Rewiring America to launch [an education
    campaign](https://www.rewiringamerica.org/education-coalition) for
    their customers and users to educate at least 10 million American
    households about opportunities to save money with heat pumps and
    other building electrification opportunities, using Rewiring
    America’s [Inflation Reduction Act
    Calculator](https://www.rewiringamerica.org/app/ira-calculator) and
    other tools. In addition, three companies – Mars, Procter & Gamble,
    and Cargill – have stepped up today as part of the [Renewable
    Thermal Collaborative](https://www.renewablethermal.org/), making
    commitments to explore and use heat pumps in their industrial
    facilities to cut costs and reduce pollution. And the Department of
    Energy today announced that Carrier and Trane Technologies have
    become the second and third companies, along with Lennox, to meet
    the Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge requirements for
    higher performance in cold weather – providing high-efficiency
    heating in freezing temperatures.  
     
-   **Mobilizing Community Financing:** The Environmental Protection
    Agency’s new $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund – created by
    President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to mobilize financing for
    greenhouse gas reducing clean energy and climate projects –  will
    host a [National Public Listening Session on Wednesday November 9,
    2022](https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/forms/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-listening-session-november-9-2022) to
    hear stakeholder input on how these catalytic federal resources can
    support the deployment of distributed energy resources, including
    heat pumps, in disadvantaged communities. EPA also published
    a [Request for
    Information](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/EPA-HQ-OA-2022-0859) seeking
    public comment on core design aspects of the Greenhouse Gas
    Reduction Fund.

 In addition to lowering costs, energy-efficient and electric building
and appliance upgrades can reduce indoor and local outdoor air
pollution, improving health in our communities. In addition, they will
cut millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year to help
tackle climate change.  
  
Vice President Harris will be joined by members of the International
Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers, who
are partnering with the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors’
National Association to create [a new online
resource](https://www.betterairinbuildings.org/) for building owners and
operators to find qualified labor to install heat pumps and make other
important building upgrades.
