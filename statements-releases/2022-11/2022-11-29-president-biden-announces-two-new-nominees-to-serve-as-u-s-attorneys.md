title: "President\_Biden Announces Two New Nominees to Serve as U.S.\_Attorneys"
---
 
The President is announcing two new nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys.
These are officials who will be indispensable to upholding the rule of
law as top federal law enforcement officials.  
  
These individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law,
their professionalism, their experience and credentials, their
dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to
the independence of the Department of Justice.

The President has proposed a budget that would significantly increase
funding for law enforcement as part of a comprehensive approach to
tackling the rising crime rate this administration inherited last
year.  
  
The President has also launched a comprehensive effort to take on the
uptick in gun crime that has been taking place since 2020—putting more
cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking
down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys as the chief
federal law enforcement officers in their district is important for
these efforts.

The President has now announced 67 nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys.
