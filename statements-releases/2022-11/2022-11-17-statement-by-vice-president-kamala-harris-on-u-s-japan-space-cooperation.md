title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on U.S.-Japan Space\_Cooperation"
---
 
The alliance between Japan and the United States is a cornerstone of
peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and around
the globe. Space cooperation is a critical component of our alliance.
While I was in Tokyo in September, Prime Minister Kishida and I
discussed our mutual interest in strengthening our cooperation in outer
space across commercial, civil, and security sectors. And today,
building off that and many other discussions between our governments, we
are delivering results.  
   
The United States welcomes Japan’s intention to extend its support of
International Space Station (ISS) operations through 2030, following the
United States’ announcement of our ISS extension one year ago. In
addition, our two countries are taking a step forward by reaching an
agreement on collaboration on the Lunar Gateway orbiting platform, which
will pave the way for the return of humanity to the Moon.  
   
Japan’s contributions will advance scientific knowledge and protect our
brave astronauts exploring the depths of outer space. And this brings us
one step closer to one day having a Japanese astronaut walk on the moon.
Today we celebrate U.S.-Japan cooperation in space, which has never been
stronger.
