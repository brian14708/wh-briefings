title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the District\
  \ Court\u2019s Ruling on the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Student Debt\
  \ Relief\_Program"
---
 
We strongly disagree with the District Court’s ruling on our student
debt relief program and the Department of Justice has filed an appeal.  
   
The President and this Administration are determined to help working and
middle-class Americans get back on their feet, while our opponents –
backed by extreme Republican special interests – sued to block millions
of Americans from getting much-needed relief.  
   
For the 26 million borrowers who have already given the Department of
Education the necessary information to be considered for debt relief –
16 million of whom have already been approved for relief – the
Department will hold onto their information so it can quickly process
their relief once we prevail in court.   
   
We will never stop fighting for hardworking Americans most in need – no
matter how many roadblocks our opponents and special interests try to
put in our way.
