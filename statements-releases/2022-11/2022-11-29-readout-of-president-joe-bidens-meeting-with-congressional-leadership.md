title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with Congressional\_Leadership"
---
 
This morning, President Biden hosted Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell,
Speaker Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy in the Roosevelt Room for a
productive conversation.  
   
The President thanked each of the congressional leaders for coming to
the White House and reiterated that, after signing over 200 bipartisan
bills into law, he is eager to continue working across the aisle in good
faith, as voters signaled they want both parties to do.  
   
The President and the four leaders discussed how Congress can act to
prevent a rail shutdown, which would have devastating consequences for
workers, families, and our economy.  
   
They also discussed how to keep the government funded, continue giving
the American people the resources they need to keep fighting COVID-19
with the best tools available, and continue furthering our national
security interests by standing with the people of Ukraine against
Russia’s illegal invasion.  
   
The President also told his Republican colleagues that whatever
disagreements they may have, he is always interested in finding new
common ground, and that he has an open door to hear their perspectives
about doing so.
