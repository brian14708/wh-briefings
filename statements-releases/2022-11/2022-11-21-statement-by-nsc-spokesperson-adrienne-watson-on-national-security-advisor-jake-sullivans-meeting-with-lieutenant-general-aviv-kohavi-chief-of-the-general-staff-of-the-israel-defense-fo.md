National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today in Washington with
Lieutenant General Aviv Kohavi, Chief of the General Staff of the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF).  Mr. Sullivan underscored the Administration’s
ironclad support for Israel’s security, and the two exchanged views on a
wide array of regional security issues of mutual concern.  They
emphasized their shared determination to address security challenges
impacting the Middle East, including the threats posed by Iran and its
proxies, and Mr. Sullivan affirmed the President’s commitment to
ensuring that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.   The two discussed
the importance of taking steps to de-escalate the security situation in
the West Bank, and Mr. Sullivan reiterated that a negotiated two-state
solution remains the best avenue to achieve a lasting peace.
