title: "FACT SHEET: Biden Administration Announces Six-Week Campaign to Get More Americans\
  \ their Updated COVID-\u206019 Vaccine Before End of the\_Year"
---
 
*Administration to focus efforts on seniors and high-risk communities*

  
Today, the Biden Administration is announcing a six-week campaign
through the end of the year urging Americans to get their updated
COVID-19 vaccine. With winter and holiday gatherings right around the
corner, more Americans getting their updated vaccine will help avoid
thousands of preventable COVID-19 deaths. The six-week campaign will
focus on reaching seniors and the communities that were hardest hit by
COVID-19 by making it even more convenient to get vaccinated and
increasing awareness through paid media.  
   
**<u>Making it even more convenient to get vaccinated – particularly for
seniors and communities most impacted:  
</u>**  
Over 70,000 locations are offering the updated COVID-19 vaccines, and
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken steps this
month to expand to even more locations, including mobile settings and
sites in rural and remote areas, through more flexible ordering options
for providers. HHS will continue direct outreach in communities with
trusted community partners and messengers to provide easy access to
updated COVID-19 vaccines and information on the benefits of
vaccination. HHS is standing up pop-up vaccine clinics and educational
booths at major community gatherings – from libraries to sporting events
to county fairs, and more.  
   
**Additional funding for community health centers and community-based
organizations to increase the pace of vaccinations:**

-   **$350 million for community health centers to expand locally-driven
    efforts to get more Americans their updated COVID-19 vaccines:**
    HHS, through the Health Resources and Services Administration
    (HRSA), will invest $350 million into community health centers,
    which they can use for mobile, drive-up, walk-up, or community-based
    vaccination events, partnerships with community and faith-based
    organizations for vaccination activities, raising awareness of the
    updated shot, and more.
-   **$125 million for efforts to get more older Americans and people
    with disabilities vaccinated, including through accessible
    vaccination clinics, in-home vaccinations, transportation, outreach
    and education:** HHS, through the Administration for Community
    Living will award $125 million in grants to national organizations
    that serve people with disabilities and older adults to support
    community vaccination programs and efforts. Funding will be provided
    to help local aging and disability networks hold vaccination events
    at senior and community centers; build up confidence in the vaccine;
    educate people about the risks of COVID-19 in the weeks ahead and
    how vaccination will help; provide supportive services, such as
    accessible transportation and individual assistance to overcome
    barriers so more Americans can get the vaccine; and connect people
    to the information they need to protect themselves from COVID-19. 

**New enforcement guidance to ensure nursing homes are offering updated
COVID-19 vaccines and timely treatment to their residents and staff:**
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requires nursing
homes to educate their residents on the benefits of lifesaving COVID-19
vaccinations and to offer the vaccines to their residents. CMS will
issue guidance today reminding health care providers of this
requirement. In its guidance, CMS will make clear that nursing homes
with low vaccination rates will be referred to state survey agencies for
close scrutiny, and that facilities that do not comply with the
requirement to offer and educate on the benefit of lifesaving COVID-19
vaccinations will face enforcement actions, including the need to submit
corrective action plans to achieve compliance.  
  
HHS will also ask governors for their assistance and partnership in
increasing COVID vaccination rates for long-term care residents and
highlight for them how their states are performing against their peers.
And, CMS will provide data to states and health plans about the poorest
performing nursing homes to help them encourage action and promote
increased vaccination uptake.  
  
**Hundreds of pop-up vaccination clinics to make it even easier for
people to get their updated COVID-19 vaccines before the end of the
year:** National and local organizations, state and local health
departments, K-12 school districts and higher education institutions,
and pharmacies will continue to host pop-up vaccination clinics in urban
and rural communities. Americans can also get vaccinated at ongoing
events across the country run by schools, colleges, Historically Black
Colleges and Universities, and state, county, research, and health
fairs. And, organizations around the country are answering the call to
host more community-based vaccination clinics in New Orleans, LA,
Albuquerque, NM, Houston, TX, Jackson, MS, Miami, FL, Justin, TX, San
Antonio, TX, Dallas, TX, Atlanta, GA, Berea, OH, and Salisbury, MD, to
name a few. Because of these ongoing efforts, Americans have learned
more about updated COVID-19 vaccines and gotten vaccinated at a
wide-range of events across the country – from sporting events to health
fairs to cultural festivities and trade shows.  
  
**Increasing awareness of the updated COVID-19 vaccine:**  
  
**Activating the health care workforce to highlight vaccinations and
treatments for older Americans:** On Monday, a [coalition of the
nation’s leading medical
societies](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nations-health-care-organizations-urge-covid-19-and-influenza-vaccination-and-treatment-301684245.html)
stepped forward to encourage their members – doctors, nurses, and other
health care workers whom patients know and trust – to use every
interaction with patients as an opportunity to make strong
recommendations to get vaccinated against COVID-19, educate and answer
questions about prevention and treatment options, and where feasible,
provide vaccination. In addition, organizations, such as the Black
Coalition Against COVID, LeadingAge, AARP, and the National Council of
Aging will host town halls with their thousands of members.  
  
**Reaching people with facts and information about the updated COVID-19
vaccines through paid media:** HHS’s *We Can Do This* public education
campaign is airing TV and digital ads during the World Cup, as well as
ads focused on reaching adults 50+ for Black, Latino, Asian Americans,
Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI), American Indian and
Alaska Native (AI/AN) and rural audiences.  
  
**Launching a targeted paid media effort to urge older Americans to talk
with a provider about seeking treatment if they contract COVID-19:** HHS
is launching a new, targeted paid media effort urging Americans age 50
and those with chronic conditions to seek treatment right away if they
get COVID-19. The national TV ad, “Can’t Wait,” began airing on November
21 in English and Spanish, with local TV ads running in 46 markets
across the country, as well as social and digital and social ads.
