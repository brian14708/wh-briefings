  \ Acts in\_Jerusalem"

We condemn unequivocally the acts of terror overnight in Jerusalem. The
United States has offered all appropriate assistance to the Government
of Israel as it investigates the attack and works to bring the
perpetrators to justice. We mourn the reported loss of life and wish a
speedy recovery to the injured. The United States stands with the
Government and people of Israel. As President Biden emphasized during
his visit to Israel in July, our commitment to Israelâ€™s security is
ironclad and unbreakable.
