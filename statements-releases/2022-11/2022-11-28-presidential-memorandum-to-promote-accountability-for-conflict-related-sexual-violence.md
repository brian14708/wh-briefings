title: "Presidential Memorandum to Promote Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual\_\
  Violence"
---
 
Today, President Biden will sign a Presidential Memorandum on Promoting
Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence to strengthen the
U.S. government’s efforts to combat conflict-related sexual violence
(CRSV), a too-often overlooked and underreported crime. For each rape
reported in connection with a conflict, the United Nations estimates
that 10 to 20 cases go undocumented. The United States does not accept
CRSV as an inevitable cost of armed conflict, and is committed to
supporting survivors through all available measures —including legal,
policy, diplomatic, and financial tools—to deter future violence.  
  
President Biden is issuing this Presidential Memorandum on the occasion
of the United Kingdom’s international ministerial conference on
Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, and at a time when CRSV persists
with impunity around the world, including in Russian-occupied Ukraine
and Ethiopia.   
  
Today’s action complements the Administration’s comprehensive efforts to
support survivors of CRSV, including by promoting gender equity and
equality, addressing the root causes of conflict, and advancing Women,
Peace and Security.  In particular, it is aimed at:

-   Leveraging sanctions authorities, assistance restrictions, and other
    tools to promote accountability for perpetrators of CRSV;
-   Ensuring acts of CRSV are given equal consideration alongside other
    serious human rights abuses in developing designations under
    existing sanctions authorities; and
-   Continuing to build a coalition of like-minded nations and
    international organizations to prevent and promote accountability
    for acts of CRSV.

To further demonstrate the Biden-Harris Administration’s unwavering
commitment to supporting survivors of CRSV and all forms of gender-based
violence, the United States has also pledged to:

-   **Strengthen Support to the UN Special Representative to the
    Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict**. In addition to
    our annual contribution of $1.75 million to the Office of the UN
    Special Representative to the Secretary General (SRSG) on Sexual
    Violence in Conflict, the United States announced an additional
    $400,000 during the 77<sup>th</sup> UN General Assembly to support
    the SRSG. These additional resources will advance the SRSG’s work to
    promote justice and accountability for CRSV through consistent and
    effective prosecution; foster greater engagement by governments to
    provide sustainable, survivor-centered responses to CRSV; and
    enhance prevention efforts to address the root causes of this
    violence.
-   **Bolster Civil Society Efforts to Investigate and Document CRSV.**
    The State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor
    (DRL) has provided more than $4.5 million in projects that support
    civil society efforts to investigate and document acts of CRSV to
    aid in the pursuit of justice for victims and survivors. In Burma,
    Ukraine, and Sri Lanka, these programs will contribute to a global
    effort focused on supporting civil society and survivor groups
    pursuing accountability.  Over the next two years, DRL will invest
    nearly $5.5 million in additional funding to support this
    initiative, for a combined investment of $10 million, subject to the
    availability of funds.
-   **Deliver Services and Support for Survivors of Gender-Based
    Violence in Emergency & Conflict Settings.** The State Department
    and USAID will revive and expand their flagship program to provide
    lifesaving services and support to survivors of gender-based
    violence in emergency and conflict settings, including CRSV.
    Originally launched as the Safe from the Start Initiative in 2013,
    *Safe from the Start ReVisioned* will prioritize prevention,
    mitigation, and service provision to address gender-based violence
    in humanitarian responses to global crises, and shift funding,
    influence, and decision-making power in humanitarian systems to
    women and girls, particularly those from marginalized and
    underrepresented communities. From 2013, when the initiative was
    first launched, through fiscal year 2021, the United States invested
    more than $167 million to strengthen support for survivors in
    emergencies.
-   **Increase Access to Justice, Protection, and Services to Survivors
    of Gender-Based Violence, including CRSV. ** The State Department
    will also expand the Voices Against Violence (VAV) Initiative,
    dedicated to ensuring that survivors of gender-based violence and
    harmful practices have increased access to justice, protection, and
    services.  The VAV Initiative has benefited more than 2.3 million
    people across 66 countries and has directly supported more than
    3,000 survivors of gender-based violence, including CRSV survivors. 
    Over the next year, DRL will invest $6 million in additional funding
    to support the VAV Initiative, subject to the availability of funds.

Together with today’s Presidential Memorandum on Promoting
Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, these initiatives
signal President Biden’s ongoing commitment to confront gender-based
violence—in all of its forms—around the world. The Biden-Harris
Administration stands with survivors of sexual violence in conflict, and
invites the international community to join us in strengthening
accountability for CRSV as part of a holistic response that includes
fostering the health, well-being and healing of survivors; expanding
access to justice; enhancing provision of psycho-social support and
other life-saving services; and supporting economic empowerment.
