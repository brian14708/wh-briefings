President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Australian Prime Minister
Anthony Albanese on the margins of the East Asia Summit in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia. The leaders reaffirmed their strong support for ASEAN
centrality and the ASEAN-led regional architecture. Recognizing that
current regional and global challenges require close and strong security
cooperation, the two leaders discussed U.S.-Australia Alliance
priorities and the AUKUS security partnership with the United Kingdom.
President Biden thanked the Prime Minister for standing with the United
States and the world to impose costs on Russia for its unprovoked war on
Ukraine. The leaders recognized the imperative of maintaining peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait. President Biden thanked Prime
Minister Albanese for his leadership in tackling the climate crisis,
highlighting the climate and energy transition partnership as a new
pillar of the U.S.-Australia relationship and emphasizing the importance
of our climate ambitions from the COP 27 this week. Because the future
of the United States, Australia and the Indo-Pacific region are
inextricably linked, the two leaders emphasized the importance of the
new Partners in the Blue Pacific to help address challenges in the
Pacific such as climate change, and bolster maritime domain security,
pandemic preparedness and economic resilience.  Underscoring the
importance of the U.S.-Australia relationship in addressing a host of
critical issues, President Biden told Prime Minister Albanese he looked
forward to a very successful Quad Leaders’ Summit in 2023, when
Australia will host.
