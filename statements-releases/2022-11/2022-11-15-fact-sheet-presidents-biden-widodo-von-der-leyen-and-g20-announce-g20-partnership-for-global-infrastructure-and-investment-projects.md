  \ Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment\_Projects"
---
 
At the 2022 G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, President Biden, Indonesian
President Widodo, and European Commission President Von der Leyen
co-hosted a group of G20 leaders to demonstrate their shared commitment
to deepen engagement under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
Investment (PGII) to accelerate investment in quality infrastructure in
low- and middle-income countries around the world and strengthen the
global economy.  
   
In line with the G20 theme for 2022, “Recover Together, Recover
Stronger,” PGII investments aim to create lasting positive impacts for
partner countries, strengthen the resilience of communities, and support
inclusive, sustainable development, as well as benefit partners’
economic security and global supply chains.  
   
On the margins of the Summit, President Biden, President Widodo, and
President Von der Leyen met with leaders and ministers from Argentina,
Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Senegal,
and the United Kingdom, to highlight PGII collaboration and support
among likeminded partners globally. The leaders showcased the ways in
which PGII partners are coming together to finance transformative
infrastructure and to mobilize the private sector as drivers of quality
global infrastructure and investment. This event comes at the end of a
week of additional PGII project announcements by President Biden,
including
at [COP](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/11/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-initiatives-at-cop27-to-strengthen-u-s-leadership-in-tackling-climate-change/),
the [ASEAN
Summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-asean-leaders-launch-the-u-s-asean-comprehensive-strategic-partnership/),
and in a bilateral meeting with G20
host, [Indonesia](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/13/fact-sheet-strengthening-the-u-s-indonesia-strategic-partnership/).  
   
In his remarks, President Biden delivered an update on PGII’s progress
and impact to date. He announced new projects and followed up on several
announced in June 2022 at PGII’s G7 formal launch, providing concrete
examples of how the United States and its partners are working together
to mobilize capital to deliver quality infrastructure and sustainable
development.  
   
New projects announced include:

-   **Indonesia Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP):** The United
    States and Japan have led the International Partners Group, a
    collection of ten countries, to successfully launch a long-term
    partnership with Indonesia to pursue an accelerated and ambitious
    just energy transition that supports a trajectory that keeps within
    reach a warming limit of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.  The
    partnership is expected to mobilize over $20 billion in financing
    from the public sector (G7 partners and likeminded countries Norway
    and Denmark) and the private sector to support Indonesia’s efforts,
    using a mix of grants, concessional loans, market-rate loans,
    guarantees, and private investments.  The Indonesia JETP includes an
    ambitious power sector emissions reduction pathway based on the
    expansion of renewable energy, the phase out of unabated coal-fired
    electricity, as well as a commitment to a just energy transition for
    workers and communities.  
     
-   **Indonesia Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact: ** The
    United States and Indonesia have successfully concluded negotiations
    to launch a $698 million MCC Compact, supported with $649 million
    from the United States and $49 million from Indonesia. The Compact
    will support the development of high-quality, climate-conscious
    transportation infrastructure in five provinces; mobilize
    international capital in support of Indonesia’s development goals,
    in part by building the capacity of Indonesia’s financial markets;
    support coal plant decommissioning as part of the broader JETP
    program; and increase access to finance for Indonesia’s women-owned
    businesses and micro, small, and medium sized enterprise  
     
-   **Trilateral Support for Digital Infrastructure in the
    Pacific:** The United States, in partnership with Australia and
    Japan, is supporting digital projects that will improve access to
    and security of digital services in the Pacific.  
     
    -   **Acquisition of Telecom Assets for Network Upgrades:** U.S.
        International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is working
        with Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) to each
        provide $50 million to guarantee financing by Export Finance
        Australia (EFA) for Telstra’s acquisition of Digicel Pacific’s
        telecom assets in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific, leading to
        network upgrades that will improve security and performance. The
        project also supports the continued provision of affordable,
        high-quality mobile voice and data services to subscribers in
        these markets. Expansion of the network will further the
        adoption of innovative technologies.  
         
    -   **Blue Dot Network Certification for Palau Spur Cable: **The
        Trilateral-supported Palau Spur subsea cable will be used to
        pilot the “Blue Dot” certification framework of quality
        infrastructure.  A public-private U.S.-, Japan-, and
        Australia-backed initiative, the Blue Dot Network aims to be a
        symbol of quality in infrastructure, certifying projects that
        meet development standards and metrics, including on labor and
        environment  
         
-   **Securing Critical Minerals Supply Chains in Brazil: **Building on
    previous support, the DFC will invest $30 million of equity in
    TechMet Limited for the development of a critical minerals mining
    platform of nickel and cobalt in Brazil, bolstering supply chain
    resilience for the renewable energy transition. TechMet’s Brazilian
    mine produces sustainably sourced nickel through an extraction
    process that is less water- and carbon-intensive than traditional
    methods. This nickel is estimated to be near the lowest quartile of
    carbon intensity for global nickel productio  
     
-   **Solar Development in Honduras: **The Export-Import Bank of the
    United States (EXIM) is providing a $52 million loan guarantee to
    J.P. Morgan, who is financing Banco Atlantida’s purchase of $31
    million of U.S. equipment for a 53.4 MW solar power project in
    Honduras. The transaction is the largest-ever solar project EXIM has
    financed in the Americas. The project will utilize American-made
    equipment from First Solar Nextracker, Shoals Technologies Group,
    and Cambria County Association for the Blind and Handicapped.  
     
-   **Investments in India’s Health Infrastructure:  **The DFC will
    invest over $15 million in India’s health infrastructure, including
    support for the expansion of a chain of eye clinics for conducting
    corrective surgery for underserved individuals and an India-based
    social enterprise that manufactures safe and affordable women’s
    hygiene products for underserved women in non-metro areas.

Project updates included:

-   **Bolstering Care Infrastructure and Economy:** Since the Invest in
    Childcare Initiative was launched as a flagship PGII project at the
    G7 Summit, the World Bank stands to generate at least $180 million
    in funding for the initiative, including $50 million from the United
    States, with additional funds from Germany, Canada, and Australia.
    The Initiative has shortlisted 27 proposals and awarded the first
    grant of $2 million to a project in Somalia that is expected to
    benefit almost 30,000 young women and 3,000 young men and their
    children primarily from marginalized populations.  
     
-   **Expanding Digital Access: **Since Digital Invest was launched by
    USAID and State as a PGII flagship project in June 2022, the blended
    finance program has attracted private sector partners and capital
    and advanced two key projects that will connect currently un- or
    under-served communities to digital access in emerging markets:  
     
    -   **CSquared Liberia Fiber Backbone:** $1.15 million of support
        under Digital Invest is leveraging nearly $2.5 million of
        financing from CSquared to establish a 350-kilometer national
        fiber network backbone in Liberia. The new backbone will extend
        from Monrovia to the Cote d’Ivoire and Guinea borders, provide
        transformative network connectivity capacity to internet service
        providers (ISPs) and mobile network operators, and, as a result,
        serve approximately one million Liberians.  
         
    -   **Microsoft Airband ISP Incentive Fund:** A Digital Invest grant
        of $500,000 will leverage $1.5 million from Microsoft to
        establish an incentive fund for ISPs providing digital access to
        community institutions, such as health clinics, schools, and
        local government facilities. This initiative will include the
        establishment and piloting of an Incentive Fund, managed by
        Resonance, to catalyze investment for and expansion of internet
        networks in hard-to-reach communities.
