title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Respect for Marriage\_Act"
---
 
Today, thanks to the hard work of Majority Leader Schumer, Speaker
Pelosi, and bipartisan colleagues, the Respect for Marriage Act
is finally on its way to becoming law.  
   
I had the honor to perform some of our nation’s first same sex marriages
at San Francisco City Hall in 2004, where couples celebrated not only a
joyful union, but the protection and respect of fundamental human
rights. The right to start a family and raise children. The right to be
who you are, openly and proudly. The right to support the person you
love, whether at a hospital bedside, a military deployment ceremony,
or applying for citizenship.   
   
Our Administration stands for the fundamental right to marry the person
you love and live free from discrimination. The Respect for Marriage Act
ultimately stands for a simple principle: all Americans are equal and
their government should treat them that way. Today, we are one step
closer to achieving that ideal with pride.
