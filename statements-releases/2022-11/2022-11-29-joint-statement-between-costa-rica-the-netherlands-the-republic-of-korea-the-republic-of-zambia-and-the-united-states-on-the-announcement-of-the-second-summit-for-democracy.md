Today, we the governments of Costa Rica, the Netherlands, the Republic
of Korea, the Republic of Zambia, and the United States are pleased to
announce that our leaders will co-host the second Summit for Democracy
on March 29-30, 2023.

Building on the first Summit for Democracy held in December 2021, this
gathering will demonstrate how democracies deliver for their citizens
and are best equipped to address the world’s most pressing challenges.

We are living through an era defined by challenges to accountable and
transparent governance. From wars of aggression to changes in climate,
societal mistrust and technological transformation, it could not be
clearer that all around the world, democracy needs champions at all
levels. Together with other invitees to the second Summit, we look
forward to taking up this call, and demonstrating how transparent,
accountable governance remains the best way to deliver lasting
prosperity, peace, and justice. 

The second Summit for Democracy will assemble world leaders in a
virtual, plenary format, followed by hybrid gatherings in each of our
countries with representatives from government, civil society, and the
private sector. Together, we will showcase progress made by Summit
partners on commitments during the Year of Action, and will reaffirm the
vitality of the democratic model and collective action to meet the
unprecedented challenges of our time.

We look forward to another successful Summit, and accelerating concrete
action toward democratic renewal.
