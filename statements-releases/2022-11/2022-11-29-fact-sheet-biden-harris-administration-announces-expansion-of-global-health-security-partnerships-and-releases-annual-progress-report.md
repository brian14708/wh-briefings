  \ Health Security Partnerships and Releases Annual Progress\_Report"
---
 
As the world continues its fight against COVID-19, other ongoing
outbreaks are stark reminders of the continued and constant threat posed
by infectious diseases. The global Mpox outbreak and an Ebola outbreak
in Uganda are just two of the most recent examples of how the risks and
impact of emerging infectious diseases are increasing daily, and how
global systems remain ill-equipped to identify and contain these
threats.  The Biden-Harris Administration continues to prioritize global
health security as a critical component of national biodefense.  Today,
the Administration announced new actions to advance global health
security that accelerate implementation of the National Biodefense
Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats,
Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security
(Strategy).  With this Strategy, the Administration has charted a bold
and ambitious roadmap to protect American lives and livelihoods, and
protect against infectious disease threats, whether naturally occurring,
accidental, or deliberate.  Partnering with countries to stop infectious
disease threats at their source — by strengthening equitable health
systems in their own regions — is an effective way to protect the health
of Americans and people across the world.   
  
EXPANDING GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY PARTNERSHIPS  
  
The United States is committed to directly supporting at least 50
countries, by 2025, to strengthen and achieve regional, national and
local capacity in five critical areas to prevent, detect, and respond to
infectious disease threats.  Building these capacities will further
accelerate country compliance with the International Health Regulations
(IHR) and help reach the 2024 target of the Global Health Security
Agenda (GHSA). Over the next year, the United States will:

-   Expand and strengthen bilateral partnerships with at least 25
    countries to develop measurable capacity to prevent, detect, and
    rapidly respond to epidemic and pandemic threats. This includes:  
    -   Forging 6 new and enhanced partnerships with *Ghana*,
        *Guatemala*, *Mozambique*, *The* *Philippines*, *Zambia, and
        Ukraine (when the operating environment allows);*  

    <!-- -->

    -   Strengthening longstanding partnerships with *Bangladesh*,
        *Burkina* *Faso*, *Cameroon*, *Cote* *d’Ivoire*, *Democratic*
        *Republic* *of* *Congo*, *Ethiopia*, *Guinea*, *India*,
        *Indonesia*, *Kenya*, *Liberia*, *Mali*, *Nigeria*, *Pakistan*,
        *Senegal*, *Sierra* *Leone*, *Tanzania*, *Uganda*, and
        *Vietnam*.  
-   Build and expand regional partnerships in Africa, Asia, and Latin
    America on infectious disease surveillance and early warning
    systems, biosafety and biosecurity, strengthening emergency
    operations centers, training and supporting health workers,
    investing in community and national leadership for global health
    security, and legal preparedness. These partnerships also include
    the multisectoral African Partner Outbreak Response Alliance (APORA)
    and joint efforts between the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and
    Australian Defense Force.  
-   Leverage bilateral U.S. global health security programs alongside
    investments from the newly established *Pandemic Fund*  (formerly
    known as Financial Intermediary Fund) at the World Bank to achieve
    additional measurable results at the national, regional, and global
    level, and spur new resource mobilization for pandemic preparedness
    and response; and  
-   Support implementation of the third edition of the World Health
    Organization’s Joint External Evaluation (JEE).  The U.S. Centers
    for Disease Control & Prevention will provide technical experts to
    support 10 countries’ JEEs, assisting in gap assessments and
    developing recommendations to address them.

The United States employs a whole-of-government approach assisting
partners to strengthen regional, national and local health systems to
better prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats in a safe and
secure manner, bolstered by programs and appropriations of the U.S.
Department of State, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Agency for
International Development, U.S. Department of Defense, and others.  To
achieve these measurable results and support additional crosscutting
global health security activities, the United States is providing more
than $1.25 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 funds, an increase of over $570
million from Fiscal Year 2021.  The Administration has also reaffirmed
and will continue to utilize the coordinated whole of government effort
outlined in [Executive Order
13747](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/09/2016-27171/advancing-the-global-health-security-agenda-to-achieve-a-world-safe-and-secure-from-infectious),
[Executive Order
13987](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01759/organizing-and-mobilizing-the-united-states-government-to-provide-a-unified-and-effective-response),
and [National Security
Memorandum-15](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/18/national-security-memorandum-on-countering-biological-threats-enhancing-pandemic-preparedness-and-achieving-global-health-security/) to
accelerate progress.

SPURRING OTHER DONORS AND MULTILATERAL PARTNERS TO ACT  
  
Global health security is vital for international security and
solidarity, and cannot be achieved alone.  In addition to expanding
bilateral partnerships, the United States will utilize its unparalleled
catalytic leadership to unlock more commitments from allies, donors, and
other partners to bolster support an additional 50 countries.  To this
end, over the next year, the United States will:

-   Strengthen and support the extension of the multilateral GHSA beyond
    2023, as a forum for working across countries, regions, sectors
    (including non-governmental) to provide technical assistance and
    share best practices and measure and hold global partners
    accountable for progress.  This week, the United States joined other
    multi-sectoral delegations in committing to and calling for new
    actions during the 7<sup>th</sup> GHSA Ministerial in Seoul,
    Republic of Korea;  
-   Strengthen the new *Pandemic Fund* at the World Bank as a founding
    Board Member to deliver early impact for those countries and regions
    most in need, including supporting them to strengthen and achieve
    measurable capacity in critical areas;  
-   Accelerate G7 commitments made by the United States and its close
    allies in 2021 and 2022, including meeting milestones of the G7 Pact
    for Pandemic Readiness towards assisting at least 100 countries, and
    collaborating with Japan’s G7 Presidency to expand health security
    investments, bolster medical countermeasure development and
    delivery, and grow pandemic preparedness and response financing. 
    This G7 commitment matches the United States’ own 50 country target
    commitment, and aligns with the target of the GHSA 2024 initiative;
    and  
-   Support the planned Global Health Security Coordinating Office being
    established by Republic of Korea and expected to launch in 2023,
    including strengthening coordination and collaboration with the U.S.
    Centers for Disease Control & Prevention’s new East Asia regional
    office.

BUILDING PREPAREDNESS AT HOME AND WITH OUR NEIGHBORS

While we build capacity globally, the United States will continue to
invest in pandemic preparedness here at home and in our own region,
working with partners in the Western Hemisphere.  The majority of our
domestic goals and objectives are articulated within the recent
*National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan. *  Building on
this Strategy, the United States will work regionally – in North and
South America — this year – to build additional health security
capacity. Specifically, the United States will:  

-   Commit, working with the World Health Organization and the Pan
    American Health Organization (PAHO), to initiate and conduct a
    renewed external evaluation of U.S. health security and pandemic
    preparedness capacity by the end of 2024, in line with strong U.S.
    commitment to the International Health Regulations and using the new
    Joint External Evaluation (JEE) 3.0 Tool;  
-   As tasked in NSM-15, revise the U.S. Global Health Security Strategy
    to incorporate lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and further
    outline the Administration’s international strategy and support for
    achieving a stronger, more secure global health security
    architecture with equity at the center;  
-   Work collaboratively with Canada and Mexico under the North American
    Leaders’ Summit (NALS) to revise the North American Plan for Animal
    and Pandemic Influenza (NAPAPI) based on lesson learned from
    COVID-19. The three countries plan on developing and launching a new
    NAPAPI at the 11th NALS as a key cross-sectoral, flexible, and
    scalable trilateral framework for strengthening regional
    preparedness and response to a broader range of health security
    threats that includes influenza and beyond;  
-   Strengthen regional engagement, including establishing a new U.S.
    Centers for Disease Control & Prevention regional office in Panama
    City, Panama, serving Central America and the Caribbean; and  
-   Establish and support, in collaboration with PAHO and the
    InterAmerican Development Bank, the Economic and Health Dialogue of
    the Americas (EHA), which aims to convene Ministries of Health,
    Finance, Economy, and Foreign Affairs of countries in the Western
    Hemisphere to jointly address the economic repercussions of COVID-19
    and strengthen regional pandemic preparedness.

DELIVERING RESULTS FROM UNITED STATES INVESTMENTS  
   
**Investing billions of dollars today in global health security can save
trillions of dollars and millions of lives. As requested in the Fiscal
Year 2023 Budget, the Biden-Harris Administration urges Congress to
fully meet this unique moment in history – by providing the additional
resources needed to sustain and accelerate progress for these global
health security partnerships, and solidify steadfast U.S. leadership in
the Pandemic Fund.**  
   
**In order to show Congress and the American people the impact generated
from these life-saving investments, the Administration is also releasing
its annual report, *Progress and Impact of U.S. Government Investments
in Global Health Security,* which details key outcomes from our Fiscal
Year 2021 partner country activities. **  
   
In publishing these significant and measurable results, the United
States continues to model transparency and accountability for its health
security investments with global partners, and calls on countries and
non-governmental organizations to do the same.  The results are clear: 
Investing in preparedness and prevention saves lives and yields tangible
results, including helping to rapidly address outbreaks of Ebola, yellow
fever, Lassa fever, polio, influenza, and many others.
