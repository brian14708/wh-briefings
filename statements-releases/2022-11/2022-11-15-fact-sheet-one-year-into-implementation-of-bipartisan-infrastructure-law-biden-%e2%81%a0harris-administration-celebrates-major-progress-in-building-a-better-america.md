title: "FACT SHEET: One Year into Implementation of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,\
  \ Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Celebrates Major Progress in Building a Better\_\
  America"
---
 
One year ago, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law –
a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s infrastructure and
competitiveness. While “infrastructure week” was a punchline under his
predecessor, President Biden is delivering an “infrastructure decade.”
One year into implementation, the Biden-Harris Administration is already
following through on its promise to deliver results by rebuilding our
roads, bridges, ports, and airports, upgrading public transit and rail
systems, replacing lead pipes to provide clean water, cleaning up
pollution, providing affordable, high-speed internet to every family in
America, delivering cheaper and cleaner energy, and creating good-paying
jobs.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents historic progress, as the
largest and most significant investment in:

-   **Rebuilding our roads and bridges** since President Eisenhower’s
    Interstate Highway System;
-   **Public transit** in American history and an historic investment to
    make public transportation **accessible**;
-   **Passenger rail** since Amtrak’s inception, 50 years ago;
-   **Clean water infrastructure**;
-   **Affordable, high-speed internet**;
-   **Tackling legacy pollution** and **advancing environmental
    justice**;
-   **Upgrading the** **power grid** to transmit **more clean energy**
    and withstand extreme weather;
-   **Increasing our infrastructure’s resilience** against the impacts
    of climate change, extreme weather events, and cyber-attacks;
-   Replacing dirty diesel buses with **clean, electric buses** across
    school bus and transit fleets; and,
-   A national **network of EV chargers** in the United States and
    largest investment in domestic manufacturing of **batteries** and
    the critical minerals that power them.

**<u>ONE YEAR OF DELIVERING RESULTS</u>**  
To date, the Administration has announced over $185 billion in funding
and over 6,900 specific projects, reaching over 4,000 communities across
all 50 states, D.C., and the territories.  The White House
Infrastructure Implementation Team released [new state-by-state fact
sheets](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/state-fact-sheets/) and a [new
map highlighting projects in all 50
states](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/maps-of-progress/). The
President, Vice President, Cabinet, and senior federal leaders, have
taken more than 200 trips to all 50 states, as well as D.C., Puerto
Rico, and the territories, to discuss this once-in-a-generation
opportunity with community members. 

Key highlights include:

-   Launched **2,800 bridge repair and replacement projects** across the
    country. 
-   Awarded funds for **over 5,000 new clean transit and school
    buses**. 
-   Approved state plans for water funding, EV charging networks and
    high-speed internet deployment.

    and local governments including a Guidebook at build.gov, a
    technical assistance resource guide, an [“Infrastructure School”
    webinar
    series](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/briefing-room/2022/05/04/infrastructure-school-webinars/),
    Rural and Tribal playbooks, and a listing of funding opportunities
    to be aware of, all available on build.gov.
-   Launched the Infrastructure [Talent Pipeline
    Challenge](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-celebrates-new-commitments-toward-equitable-workforce-development-for-infrastructure-jobs/),
    securing over [350
    commitments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-celebrates-new-commitments-toward-equitable-workforce-development-for-infrastructure-jobs/)
    from organizations such as International Brotherhood of Electrical
    Workers, AT&T, Corning, Communication Workers of America, United
    Airlines, and ChargePoint to invest in equitable workforce
    development and train a diverse pipeline of  skilled workers to
    build our nation’s infrastructure. Additionally, where permissible
    under applicable law, federal agencies are including workforce
    development as an allowable activity for Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law programs and encouraging the use of local and economic hiring
    preferences to expand the diversity of the talent pool.
-   Engaged Federal agencies and state, local, Tribal, and territorial
    governments to leverage all available resources to quickly deliver
    the necessary technical assistance and capacity to underserved
    communities, ranging from the interagency [Thriving Communities
    initiative](https://www.transportation.gov/grants/thriving-communities)
    to the [Local Infrastructure Hub](https://localinfrastructure.org/)
    established by philanthropy and nongovernmental organizations. The
    Interagency Working Group on Coal & Power Plant Communities &
    Economic Revitalization is engaging stakeholders, identifying key
    policy actions and barriers, and driving significantly more federal
    resources to hard-hit energy communities, with three Rapid Response
    Teams focused on coordinating federal resources delivery in Wyoming,
    the Four Corners region and the Illinois Basin. USDA’s Rural
    Partners Network has [expanded to nine states and Puerto
    Rico](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/11/03/biden-harris-administration-expands-rural-partners-network-four)
    in a whole-of-government effort to partner with rural communities to
    access resources and funding to create local jobs, build
    infrastructure, and support long-term economic stability on their
    own terms.
-   Announced [new
    steps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-equity-and-economic-opportunity-through-federal-procurement-and-state-and-local-infrastructure-contracting/)
    to support small disadvantaged businesses compete for contracting
    opportunities under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These actions
    reflect the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to ensuring
    that federal investments build wealth and opportunity for
    underserved entrepreneurs and small business owners.
-   Leveraged the power of the Build America, Buy America Act provisions
    in the law and set up the first-ever-[Made in America
    Office](https://www.madeinamerica.gov/) to bring back manufacturing
    jobs, onshore supply chains and make the U.S. economy more
    competitive. As a result, we are seeing companies invest in America
    again, build out their manufacturing footprints, and create
    good-paying jobs.
