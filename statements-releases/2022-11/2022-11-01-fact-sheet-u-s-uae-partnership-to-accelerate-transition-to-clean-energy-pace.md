title: "FACT SHEET: U.S.-UAE Partnership to Accelerate Transition to Clean Energy\_\
  (PACE)"
---
 
The United States and the United Arab Emirates signed a major new clean
energy framework on November 1 in Abu Dhabi.  Today President Biden
again demonstrated his deep commitment to ensuring a global clean energy
future and long-term energy security as the United States and United
Arab Emirates announced a robust partnership to ensure the swift and
smooth transition toward clean energy and away from unabated fossil
fuels. The U.S.-UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) is
set to catalyze $100 billion in financing, investment, and other support
and to deploy globally 100 gigawatts of clean energy by 2035 to advance
the energy transition and maximize climate benefits.  

PACE’s ambitious plan is built upon four pillars: 1) Clean Energy
Innovation, Deployment and Supply Chains, 2) Carbon and Methane
Management, 3) Nuclear Energy, and 4) Industrial and Transport
Decarbonization.

The United States and the UAE will set up an expert group to identify
priority projects, remove potential hurdles, and measure PACE’s progress
in achieving its goal of catalyzing $100 billion in financing,
investment, and other support and deploying globally 100 gigawatts of
clean energy.

**Investment in Clean Energy in Emerging Economies**  
In addition to investing in both countries’ clean energy futures, the
two countries intend to elevate climate action by vigorously pursuing
and encouraging investment in clean energy in emerging economies. The
U.S. and UAE are well aware of the need to bridge the gap between
developed and developing countries in the investment in and deployment
of clean energy to ensure global efforts to reduce emissions do not
falter.  To help bridge the gap, the two countries intend to work
together to prioritize commercial projects in developing and low-income
countries as well as provide them technical and financial assistance.

**Spurring Clean Energy Innovation, Deployment and Supply Chains**  
Transitioning away from fossil fuels will depend upon new and emerging
technologies and the scalable development of low-emission energy
sources. Safeguarding the reliability of supply chains necessary for the
new energy technologies to scale up is also essential. To make this
happen, PACE intends to tap available resources and public and private
sector expertise in the U.S. and the UAE and expedite investment in and
deployment of new technologies to drive down cost. In addition, PACE
plans to help facilitate investment in mining, production, and
processing of critical minerals and materials that are vital for clean
energy production.

**Reducing carbon dioxide and methane emissions**  
PACE seeks to encourage existing and new technologies and pathways to
cut harmful emissions from the hydrocarbon sector. The U.S. and UAE will
take leadership in stepping up investment in fossil fuel emissions
abatement technologies, as decarbonized hydrocarbons will be a source
for hydrogen production as well as an input for durable and consumer
goods. The two countries will give momentum to deploying and further
developing new technologies for carbon capture, utilization, and
storage, in addition to measuring and reducing greenhouse gas emissions
across the hydrocarbon value chain. PACE also seeks to make methane
abatement a global “fast mitigation strategy” this decade.

**Promoting advanced nuclear energy as a clean energy solution**  
PACE supports the full-scale implementation of the civil nuclear
cooperation between the U.S. and the UAE. Safety, security, and
regulatory oversight will be priority areas of engagement. Nuclear
energy can drive decarbonization in the power sector as well as
hard-to-abate sectors, such as heavy industry and heavy-duty transport,
because it can be used to produce hydrogen, industrially process heat,
and desalinate water, among other things.

**Tackling Industrial and Transportation Decarbonization**  
Reducing emissions in the industrial, long-haul maritime and aviation
sectors are not easy because clean energy applications are limited in
these sectors. PACE will encourage investment and project-level
collaboration, in addition to spurring demand for net-zero emissions
industrial products and helping to ramp up supply of such products. The
U.S. and UAE intend to work together to scale up production of clean
fuels in long-distance transport sectors such as aviation and shipping.
