The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (DPRK) for its test of an Intercontinental ballistic missile. The
President and his national security team are assessing the situation in
close coordination with our allies and partners. This launch, in
addition to the launch of multiple other ballistic missiles this
week, is a flagrant violation of multiple UN Security Council
resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the
security situation in the region. This action demonstrates that the DPRK
continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people. We urge
all countries to condemn these violations and call on the DPRK to cease
its destabilizing actions and engage in serious dialogue. The United
States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the
American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
