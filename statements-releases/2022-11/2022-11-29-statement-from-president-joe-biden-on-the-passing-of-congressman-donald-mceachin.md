title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Congressman Donald\_\
  McEachin"

Jill and I are saddened by the death of Congressman Don McEachin of
Virginia, following a battle with cancer. We send our deepest
condolences to Don’s wife, Colette, and their three children.  
  
I got to know Don after he was elected to Congress in 2016. I will
always be grateful for his friendship, and his early and fierce support
when I ran for President. Don was a fighter. He fought for justice, for
civil rights, and for communities that are often left behind. Thanks to
Don’s leadership and tireless advocacy, we passed historic legislation
to combat the climate crisis and advance environmental justice.  
  
The son of a school teacher and an Army veteran, public service was in
Don’s DNA. After practicing law, he served honorably in both chambers of
Virginia’s General Assembly, before winning election to the United
States Congress. Through it all, Don always fought for the working
people of Virginia. He never quit in his pursuit of justice.  
  
May God bless Don McEachin, Colette, and the entire McEachin family.
