title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Gun\_Violence"
---
 
Over the last day and a half, more families across our country have been
scarred by the devastating impacts of gun violence in America, including
reports of a shooter today targeting two law enforcement officers from a
rooftop in Newark, New Jersey. Last night in Houston, award-winning
recording artist Kirsnick Khari Ball, also known as Takeoff, lost his
life at 28 years old, and two others were injured. In Chicago, 14 were
injured by gunfire – including three children – and one injured by a
vehicle as she tried to flee last night. In Kansas City, six were
injured and a teenager was killed at a Halloween party. These are only
the shootings that made national headlines. In other cases, we may not
know the names of the victims but we equally mourn with their families
and communities. Our deepest condolences are with the families of each
and every one of the victims.

Enough is enough. Gun violence in this country is an epidemic that will
not end with thoughts and prayers alone. President Biden will continue
to do everything in his power to reduce gun violence, including by
calling on Congress to increase community violence intervention funding,
ensure universal background checks, and send legislation to his desk
banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It’s past time we
turn our pain into purpose.
