title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Celebrates New Commitments toward Equitable Workforce\
  \ Development for Infrastructure\_Jobs"
---
 
*Culmination of Talent Pipeline Challenge brings together hundreds of
partners to train Americans for good jobs building a better America.*

Today, President Biden will recognize the commitments made by more than
350 organizations in 50 states and territories as part of the
Infrastructure Talent Pipeline Challenge. The Challenge, launched by the
Biden-Harris Administration in June, is a nationwide call to action for
employers, unions, education and training providers, states, local
governments, Tribes, territories, philanthropic organizations, and other
stakeholders to make tangible commitments that support equitable
workforce development focused on three critical sectors: <span
style="text-decoration: underline">broadband</span>, <span
style="text-decoration: underline">construction</span>, and <span
style="text-decoration: underline">electrification</span>. 

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—along with the CHIPS and Science Act,
Inflation Reduction Act, and American Rescue Plan—are creating millions
of good-paying union jobs, and the Challenge aimed to ensure that
workers across the country are trained for these jobs. The private,
public, and non-profit sector commitments complement the
Administration’s investments in workforce development and help ensure a
diverse set of workers have a fair shot at the good jobs created.

Commitments made through the Challenge will expand equitable pathways
into good jobs, boost opportunities for union jobs, and meet critical
employer skill needs.

-   Nearly 150 employers, unions, and community-based organizations will
    create or expand pre-apprenticeships, registered apprenticeships,
    and other high-quality training programs.
-   More than 60 organizations will increase recruitment among workers
    who are traditionally underrepresented in infrastructure sectors.
-   Nearly 30 organizations will provide supportive services, such as
    child care and transportation assistance, to help workers overcome
    barriers to participating in apprenticeships and other training
    opportunities.
-   More than 50 institutions of higher education—including over 30
    community colleges and five community and technical college
    systems—will advance equitable workforce development for
    infrastructure jobs.
-   More than $70 million in aligned philanthropic commitments that
    advances the goals of the Talent Pipeline Challenge will impact tens
    of thousands of underrepresented workers.

At today’s event, tradespeople from unions participating in the
Challenge will demonstrate how they train workers in skills critical to
implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These include:

-   **Communications Workers of America (CWA)** will demonstrate fiber
    splicing, an essential task that joins fiber cables together and is
    a key part of expanding access to affordable broadband across the
    country.
-   **International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers (BAC)**
    will demonstrate how to create a brick-and-mortar solid structure
    vital to foundations, dams, walls, and the construction of
    buildings.
-   **United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (UBC)**
    will demonstrate how their members train welders using a virtual
    reality (VR) simulator.
-   **International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT)** will
    use a VR simulator to demonstrate training in professional painting
    techniques.
-   **International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW)** will
    demonstrate how they train members in the Electric Vehicle
    Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP) to install and maintain EV
    chargers and showcase an electronic switchboard station used to
    train apprentice electricians.
-   **Teamsters** aviation mechanics will demonstrate how they train
    members to service, repair, and overhaul aircraft components and
    systems.
-   **United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing
    and Pipefitting Industry (UA)** will showcase a centralized gas
    distribution system found in hospitals and care facilities, where
    gasses are delivered through complex piping systems. 

Notable commitments include:

-   **IBEW** is training more than 12,500 members in the EVITP—exceeding
    its initial commitment of 10,000—preparing them to install EV
    chargers across the country.
-   **AT&T, Corning, and CWA** are partnering to expand training and
    create a good jobs pipeline, including by bringing former broadband
    technicians back into the sector and encouraging companies engaged
    in AT&T and Corning training programs to attend additional safety
    courses, including those led by CWA.
-   **AT&T and CWA** are creating a task force to design broadband
    apprenticeship programs, work with community colleges to expand
    career options for current employees, and streamline tuition
    reimbursement for AT&T’s union employees.

    system, and wrap-around service providers to support
    apprenticeships, childcare assistance, and a ride-share program for
    its diverse workforce.
-   **Lumen Technologies** will invest more than $80 million annually to
    hire nearly 1,000 new employees, many of them in union jobs, to
    support its fiber broadband expansion program and will provide
    hundreds of in-person, hands-on technical training sessions. Lumen
    also provides employees with access to back-up adult care, child
    care, and pet care, as well as tutoring and extended family leave
    programs.

    inclusive workforce.
-   **Exelon** is on track to invest nearly $14 million in 2022 to
    support more than 75 different workforce development programs,
    including infrastructure academies across all Exelon locations that
    prepare workers for jobs in the energy sector, and programs that
    give young women hands-on experience in STEM fields.
-   **Jobs for the Future (JFF)**, a workforce development organization,
    has convened hundreds of partner organizations to join and amplify
    the Challenge since its launch, and is seeking commitments from 400
    employers to adopt diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility
    (DEIA) policies in registered apprenticeship programs.

Intermediary organizations, including Jobs for the Future and National
Skills Coalition, assisted in catalyzing commitments for the
Challenge.  
These commitments will complement new and ongoing federal investments

    other federal programs for equitable workforce development for
    infrastructure jobs.
-   **The Department of Labor (DOL)** will announce an $80 million
    competition to support training in eligible infrastructure
    occupations. DOL will also uplift a new [Training and Employment
    Notice](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/advisories/ten-08-22) to

    Workforce Planning
    Guide](https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/DOC_NTIA_Workforce%20Planning%20Guide_FINAL_100722.pdf),
    which helps states and territories develop a workforce plan as
    required by the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and
    Deployment (BEAD) program. The guide includes strategies to support
    a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive telecommunications
    workforce.
-   **The Department of Energy (DOE)** began implementing its [Battery
    Workforce
    Initiative](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-5-million-launch-lithium-battery-workforce-initiative),
    a collaborative effort between DOE, DOL, industry participants, and
    labor unions to identify shared workforce needs and develop national
    training standards and curricular materials. This initiative will
    support development of a skilled, diverse, and qualified workforce
    for the rapidly expanding U.S. battery manufacturing industry.
