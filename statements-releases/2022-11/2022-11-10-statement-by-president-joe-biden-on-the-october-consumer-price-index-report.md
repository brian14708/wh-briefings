title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the October Consumer Price Index\_Report"
---
 
Today’s report shows that we are making progress on bringing inflation
down, without giving up all of the progress we have made on economic
growth and job creation.  My economic plan is showing results, and the
American people can see that we are facing global economic challenges
from a position of strength.   
   
It will take time to get inflation back to normal levels – and we could
see setbacks along the way – but we will keep at it and help families
with the cost of living.  Americans are already paying around $1.20 less
per gallon of gas than this summer.  Today’s report shows a much-needed
break in inflation at the grocery store as we head into the holidays.
And millions of Americans shopping for health insurance plans are
continuing to save $800 per year, thanks to legislation I’ve signed into
law.  In less than eight weeks, my plan to bring down prescription drug
prices and energy costs goes into effect.  
   
It has been a hard two years to recover from where things were in
January 2021.  But our economy has reopened, new jobs are being created,
new businesses are growing, and now, we are seeing progress in getting
inflation under control – with additional measures taking effect
soon.   
   
I will work with anyone – Democrat or Republican – on ideas to provide
more breathing room to middle-class and working families. And I will
oppose any effort to undo my agenda or to make inflation worse. We are
on the right path – we need to keep moving forward to build an economy
from the bottom up and the middle out.
