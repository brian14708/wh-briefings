title: "FACT SHEET:\_The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Transmission Buildout\
  \ to Deliver Affordable, Clean\_Electricity"
---
 
President Biden is catalyzing development of thousands of miles of new
and upgraded transmission lines that will reduce electricity costs for
families and businesses, prevent power outages in the face of extreme
weather, and create good-paying jobs in the clean energy economy.

Today, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced that first-round
applications are open for competitive grants under the [Grid Resilience
and Innovation Partnership
Programs](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/grid-resilience-innovation-partnership-programs),
which total $10.5 billion in available funding, as well as the $2.5
billion [Transmission Facilitation
Program](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/articles/transmission-facilitation-program).
Funded by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, these programs
together represent the largest single direct federal investment in
critical transmission and distribution infrastructure.

An estimated 70 percent of the nation’s transmission lines are over 25
years old, and this aging infrastructure makes American communities,
critical infrastructure, and economic interests vulnerable. New and
upgraded transmission lines deliver electricity to where it’s needed,
whether that means delivering wind and solar power to towns and cities
across the country or moving power from one region to another that needs
it in the face of storms, heat waves, and other extreme weather. An
expanded transmission system is also critical to cost-effectively
achieving the President’s goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030 and achieving 100% clean electricity by
2035.  
  
Today’s announcement builds on ongoing efforts across the Biden-Harris
Administration to accelerate the buildout of long-distance,
high-capacity transmission lines, including:

-   **Securing historic funding for transmission and grid upgrades:**
    The President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest
    investment ever in upgrading America’s power grid. Additionally, the
    Inflation Reduction Act provides nearly $3 billion in transmission
    funding, including $2 billion that will unlock additional billions
    in federal lending for projects designated by the Secretary of
    Energy to be in the national interest. The Inflation Reduction Act
    also provides significant loan authority for the DOE Loan Programs
    Office and funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)
    [Rural Utilities Service
    programs](https://www.rd.usda.gov/inflation-reduction-act) that can
    support grid modernization.
-   **Approving new interstate transmission lines:** The Administration
    has also jumpstarted permitting for key transmission lines that
    cross Federally managed lands. In 2022, three major transmission
    projects received final approvals for construction from the
    Department of the Interior, including:
    -   The [Energy Gateway South Transmission
        Line](https://www.blm.gov/press-release/biden-harris-administration-approves-construction-energy-gateway-south-transmission)
        across Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah, with potential to unlock up
        to 2,000 MW of clean energy;
    -   The [Ten West Link Transmission
        Line](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-clean-energy-transmission-project-arizona-and)
        from Arizona to California, with potential to unlock up to 3,200
        MW of clean energy;
    -   Two segments of the [Gateway West Transmission Line
        Project](https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-approves-segments-gateway-west-transmission-line-wyoming)
        from Wyoming to Idaho, with potential to unlock up to 765 MW of
        clean energy.
-   **Advancing major project reviews:** The Department of the Interior
    has taken major steps forward on environmental reviews for several
    new transmission lines. [Key
    milestones](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-advances-three-transmission-projects-connect-more-clean)
    include:
    -   Initiating the review for the Greenlink West Transmission
        Project from northern to southern Nevada, with potential to
        unlock up to 5,000 MW of clean energy;
    -   Initiating the review for the Cross-Tie 500-kV Transmission
        Project from Utah to Nevada, with potential to unlock up to
        1,500 MW of clean energy;
    -   Issuing a draft Environmental Impact Statement for the SunZia
        Southwest Transmission Project, a major milestone for two lines
        that could transport up to 4,500 MW of clean energy from New
        Mexico to markets in Arizona and California. 
-   **Improving efficiency of federal permitting:** As part of the
    Administration’s [Permitting Action
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-permitting-action-plan-to-accelerate-and-deliver-infrastructure-projects-on-time-on-task-and-on-budget/)—a
    strategy to strengthen and accelerate federal permitting and
    environmental reviews across a range of infrastructure
    projects—agencies are collaborating to promote sound and timely
    reviews of transmission projects. The Departments of the Interior,
    Agriculture, Defense, and Energy and the Environmental Protection
    Agency signed a [Memorandum of
    Understanding](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/mou-esb46-04208-pub-land-renewable-energy-proj-permit-coord-doi-usda-dod-epa-doe-2022-01-06.pdf)
    to improve coordination and prioritize reviews for renewable energy
    projects on federal lands, as well as the transmission lines needed
    to support these projects.
-   **Launching the Building a Better Grid Initiative:** To mobilize new
    funding and enhance collaboration between all levels of government,
    industry, unions, local communities, environmental justice
    organizations, and other stakeholders, the Administration launched
    the [Building a Better Grid
    Initiative](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/building-better-grid-initiative)
    with a focus on long-distance, high-voltage transmission lines. This
    Initiative is administered by the Department of Energy’s new [Grid
    Deployment
    Office](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/grid-deployment-office), which
    supports development of new transmission lines and a more resilient
    grid through new and modernized distribution facilities to ensure
    all communities have access to reliable, affordable electricity.
-   **Supporting next-generation transmission planning:** The Department
    of Energy is conducting a [National Transmission Planning
    Study](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-transmission-planning-study)
    to help identify pathways for necessary large-scale transmission
    system buildouts that meet regional and national interests. The
    [National Transmission Needs
    Study](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-transmission-needs-study)
    also identifies current and anticipated future capacity constraints
    and congestion on the nation’s electric transmission grid. These
    efforts include robust engagement with industry stakeholders,
    communities, and regional and local governments.
-   **Making federal financing more accessible:** The Department of
    Energy recently launched the [Grid and Transmission Programs
    Conductor](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/grid-and-transmission-program-conductor)
    to help inform state and local governments, Tribes and territories,
    utility and industry partners, and other stakeholders about the
    application process and timelines for a range of federal financing
    opportunities totaling billions of dollars in grants, loans, and
    other forms of financing. Today, the Conductor released a new
    interactive feature for public and private partners to more easily
    identify which financing opportunities are right for them.
-   **Advancing offshore wind transmission:** The Departments of Energy
    and the Interior are developing recommendations, in consultation
    with key stakeholders, on [offshore wind transmission planning and
    development](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/offshore-wind-transmission-federal-planning-support).
    This work includes an Atlantic Offshore Wind Transmission Study and
    an analysis of West Coast offshore wind transmission needs. The
    Inflation Reduction Act provides $100 million to support
    transmission planning, modeling, and analysis, including for
    offshore wind transmission.
-   **Supporting other levels of government:** The Administration is
    taking a wide range of steps to help states, Tribes, territories,
    and local governments advance transmission projects. For example,
    the Department of Transportation [issued
    guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/27/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-expansion-modernization-of-the-electric-grid/)
    to help state agencies host transmission lines along existing
    highway rights-of-way. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act
    provides $760 million in grants available to siting authorities and
    other state, local, or Tribal governmental entities to facilitate
    the siting of interstate transmission projects.
-   **Accelerating innovative solutions:** As part of the
    Administration’s [Net-Zero Game Changers
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-makes-historic-investment-in-americas-national-labs-announces-net-zero-game-changers-initiative/),
    one of five near-term priorities is research and development to
    support a net-zero power grid and electrification—including advanced
    transmission and distribution planning and operations. Efforts
    underway include the Department of Energy’s [Transmission
    Reliability
    Program](https://www.energy.gov/oe/transmission-reliability) and
    [Energy Storage Program](https://www.energy.gov/oe/energy-storage),
    with support from the National Laboratories, to advance research and
    development needed for the electricity delivery system of the
    future.
