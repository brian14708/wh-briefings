title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on the Democratic People\u2019\
  s Republic of Korea\u2019s Ballistic Missile\_Launch"
---
 
The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (DPRK) for its test of a long-range ballistic missile. The
President has been briefed on the situation and he and his national
security team will continue close consultations with Allies and partners
— building on the President’s trilateral meeting on Sunday with Prime
Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan and President Yoon Suk Yeol of the
Republic of Korea, where they resolved to forge still-closer trilateral
links in the security realm. The Vice President is coordinating with our
allies and partners in the region while at the APEC Conference in
Bangkok, Thailand.   
  
This launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council
resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the
security situation in the region. This action demonstrates that the DPRK
continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people.  We urge
all countries to condemn these violations and call on the DPRK to come
to the table for serious negotiations.  The door has not closed on
diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing
actions and instead choose diplomatic engagement.  The United States
will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American
homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
