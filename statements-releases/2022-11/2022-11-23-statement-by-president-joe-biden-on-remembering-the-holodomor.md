title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Remembering the\_Holodomor"
---
 
Even as the brave Ukrainian people continue to defend their democracy
and freedom from Russia’s brutal aggression, we pause to also honor the
victims of past injustices and horrors inflicted on Ukraine. 

This November marks the anniversary of the Holodomor — “death by
hunger.” During his regime, Joseph Stalin imposed harsh and repressive
policies on Ukraine, including creating a deliberate famine in 1932-33
that caused millions of innocent Ukrainian women, men, and children to
perish. We commemorate all the lives lost in this senseless tragedy, and
we pay tribute to the resilience of the Ukrainian people who endured
devastation and tyranny to ultimately create a free and democratic
society. 

This month, we remember the victims of the Holodomor. We reaffirm our
steadfast commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
And we honor the brave Ukrainian people who continue to courageously
resist Russia’s assault on their democracy.
