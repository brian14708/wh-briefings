Weâ€™ve seen the reports out of Poland and are working with the Polish
government to gather more information. Shortly after receiving these
reports, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with Chief of the
National Security Bureau of Poland Jacek Siewiera.

We cannot confirm the reports or any of the details at this time. We
will determine what happened and what the appropriate next steps would
be.
