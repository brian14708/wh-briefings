We have full confidence in the Polish government’s investigation of the
explosion near their border with Ukraine, and we commend them for the
professional and deliberate manner in which they are conducting it. We
will not get ahead of their work and remain in close touch with our
Polish counterparts, as we are still gathering information. We have seen
nothing that contradicts President Duda’s preliminary assessment that
this explosion was most likely the result of a Ukrainian air defense
missile that unfortunately landed in Poland. We will continue to assess
and share any new information transparently as it becomes available. We
will also continue to stay in close touch with the Ukrainians regarding
any information they have to fill out the picture.

That said, whatever the final conclusions may be, it is clear that the
party ultimately responsible for this tragic incident is Russia, which
launched a barrage of missiles on Ukraine specifically intended to
target civilian infrastructure. Ukraine had — and has — every right to
defend itself. 

We again express our solidarity with the people of Ukraine and our
condolences for the losses they suffered in these barbaric airstrikes.
We know that millions more Ukrainians remain without power, water and
basic necessities as a result.  Our thoughts and prayers go out again to
the loved ones of the two Polish citizens tragically killed.
