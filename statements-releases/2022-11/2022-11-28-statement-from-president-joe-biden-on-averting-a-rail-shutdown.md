title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Averting a Rail\_Shutdown"
---
 
I am calling on Congress to pass legislation immediately to adopt the
Tentative Agreement between railroad workers and operators – without any
modifications or delay – to avert a potentially crippling national rail
shutdown.  
   
This agreement was approved by labor and management negotiators in
September. On the day that it was announced, labor leaders, business
leaders, and elected officials all hailed it as a fair resolution of the
dispute between the hard-working men and women of the rail freight
unions and the companies in that industry.  
   
The deal provides a historic 24% pay raise for rail workers. It provides
improved health care benefits. And it provides the ability of operating
craft workers to take unscheduled leave for medical needs.  
   
Since that time, the majority of the unions in the industry have voted
to approve the deal.  
   
During the ratification votes, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture,
and Transportation have been in regular touch with labor leaders and
management. They believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at
the bargaining table and have recommended that we seek Congressional
action.  
   
Let me be clear: a rail shutdown would devastate our economy. Without
freight rail, many U.S. industries would shut down. My economic advisors
report that as many as 765,000 Americans – many union workers themselves
– could be put out of work in the first two weeks alone. Communities
could lose access to chemicals necessary to ensure clean drinking water.
Farms and ranches across the country could be unable to feed their
livestock.  
   
As a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the
ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the
agreement. But in this case – where the economic impact of a shutdown
would hurt millions of other working people and families – I believe
Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal.  
   
Some in Congress want to modify the deal to either improve it for labor
or for management. However well-intentioned, any changes would risk
delay and a debilitating shutdown. The agreement was reached in good
faith by both sides.  
   
I share workers’ concern about the inability to take leave to recover
from illness or care for a sick family member. No one should have to
choose between their job and their health – or the health of their
children. I have pressed legislation and proposals to advance the cause
of paid leave in my two years in office, and will continue to do so.
Every other developed country in the world has such protections for its
workers.   
  
But at this critical moment for our economy, in the holiday season, we
cannot let our strongly held conviction for better outcomes for workers
deny workers the benefits of the bargain they reached, and hurl this
nation into a devastating rail freight shutdown.  
   
Congress has the power to adopt the agreement and prevent a shutdown. It
should set aside politics and partisan division and deliver for the
American people. Congress should get this bill to my desk well in
advance of December 9th so we can avoid disruption.
