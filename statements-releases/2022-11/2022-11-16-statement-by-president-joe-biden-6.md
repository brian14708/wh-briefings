title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden"
---
 
Last week’s elections demonstrated the strength and resilience of
American democracy. There was a strong rejection of election deniers,
political violence, and intimidation. There was an emphatic statement
that, in America, the will of the people prevails.  
   
I congratulate Leader McCarthy on Republicans winning the House
majority, and am ready to work with House Republicans to deliver results
for working families.    
    
In this election, voters spoke clearly about their concerns: the need to
lower costs, protect the right to choose, and preserve our democracy. As
I said last week, the future is too promising to be trapped in political
warfare. The American people want us to get things done for them. They
want us to focus on the issues that matter to them and on making their
lives better. And I will work with anyone – Republican or Democrat –
willing to work with me to deliver results for them.
