title: "FACT SHEET:  Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Makes Historic Investment in\
  \ America\u2019s National Labs, Announces Net-Zero Game Changers\_Initiative"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced $1.5 billion under
President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to build and upgrade America’s
national laboratories and advance American leadership in science,
research, and innovation. Strengthening our national labs will increase
economic growth, create good-paying, local jobs and help attract skilled
workers needed to drive clean energy solutions and other technologies
that will lower costs for families, make people’s lives better, and
address the climate crisis. In addition, the White House announced
a [new
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/U.S.-Innovation-to-Meet-2050-Climate-Goals.pdf) that
identifies five initial priorities that will help enable the United
States to meet the President’s goal of cutting greenhouse gases (GHGs)
by 50-52% in 2030 and get to net-zero emissions by no later than 2050.
To drive innovation of these technologies, the Administration is also
launching the Net-Zero Game Changers Initiative today.  
  
President Biden’s economic plan has secured transformational investments
in American-made clean energy, including in wind, solar, electric
vehicles, batteries, and more. Investing in these American-made
solutions is critical to ensuring that the U.S. remains the world leader
in clean technologies and that American workers and communities reap the
historic economic opportunities and good-paying jobs that come from
building a clean energy economy. America’s investments in scientific
research, including through our world-class system of national labs, is
core to U.S. economic competitiveness and enables innovation across the
economy. Today’s funding announcements will give a long overdue boost to
13 Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories that have been at
the core of major scientific discoveries, and continue to be essential
to advance America’s energy, economic, and national security.  
  
The increased funding for the national laboratories under the Inflation
Reduction Act will support innovative research in clean technologies,
including those identified by the Game Changers Initiative. These
investments will help the United States meet our climate goals while
bringing down energy costs for American families, advancing U.S. energy
security, and creating good-paying jobs.  
  
Today, Senior Advisor for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation
John Podesta, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, Office of Science
and Technology Policy Deputy Director for Energy Sally Benson, and other
senior White House and Administration officials will highlight these
announcements at the Department of Energy’s state-of-the-art Argonne
National Laboratory in Lemont, Illinois.   
  
Today’s announcements include:

**Boosting Infrastructure Funding for National Labs: **The U.S. DOE
announced $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2022 to build and upgrade
scientific facilities, modernize infrastructure, and address deferred
maintenance projects at its Office of Science-managed national
laboratories. This historic investment will help advance the
Biden-Harris Administration’s vision to employ solutions-driven research
and innovation to tackle the nation’s greatest challenges and achieve
the President’s ambitious climate goals. Projects include continuing
construction of everything from cutting-edge electron colliders to the
world’s fastest supercomputers, as well making critical infrastructure
upgrades to electrical, fire safety, and HVAC systems to ensure DOE’s
national laboratories are modern, safe, energy-efficient, and
reliable.

**Advancing the Game Changers Initiative**: The Net-Zero Game Changers
Initiative accelerates game-changing climate innovations helping the
United States meet the President’s goal to reach net-zero emissions by
no later than 2050. To launch the initiative, the White House Climate
Policy Office, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Office of
Management and Budget are jointly releasing a new report, *U.S.
Innovation to Meet 2050 Climate Goals*, which describes 37 game-changing
R&D opportunities identified across Federal agencies. The priorities
include opportunities for near-term wins, investments in underserved
communities through the Justice40 initiative, and long-term
transformation of the energy system. The Administration will jump-start
clean energy innovation with five near-term priorities:

-   **Efficient Building Heating and Cooling: **Building heating,
    ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) is responsible for more
    than half of residential building energy use and nearly a fifth of
    commercial building energy use. While buildings in the United States
    have become more efficient in recent years, most existing heating
    and cooling equipment is still inefficient and uses climate-warming
    refrigerants, which hurts consumers and contributes to climate
    change. Innovative technologies such as highly efficient heat pumps
    and advanced refrigerants could address many issues simultaneously.
    In addition to GHG reductions, the benefits of successful innovation
    for efficient heating and cooling include significantly reducing
    indoor air pollution, tripling or quadrupling energy efficiency,
    bolstering domestic manufacturing, supporting good paying jobs in
    our communities, promoting national and energy security, and
    lowering household energy bills. Further innovation — paired with
    the [financial incentives in President Biden’s Inflation Reduction
    Act](http://www.cleanenergy.gov/) — will help reduce upfront costs
    of these appliances and make the clean option the easiest option.  
-   **Net-Zero Aviation:** Greenhouse gas emissions from air travel are
    expected to grow in the United States and around the world. At the
    same time, aviation — particularly long-distance travel — is one of
    the most difficult sectors for emissions reductions today. There are
    several options for cleaner aviation, including new carbon-neutral
    fuels, advanced biofuels, and electrification (including battery
    electric and fuel cell electric concepts). The U.S. public and
    private sectors are also exploring entirely new concepts for air
    travel, such as small electric vertical takeoff and landing
    aircraft. Innovation will make zero-emission fuels and vehicles
    cost-competitive with today’s aviation, while reducing the aviation
    industry’s dependence on fossil fuels.  
-   **Net-Zero Power Grid and Electrification:** The original U.S.
    electricity grid was not designed for today’s requirements,
    including supporting widespread electrification of vehicles, new
    appliances, and industrial processes; deploying widespread
    renewables; and withstanding the impacts of climate-induced extreme
    weather. To ensure the availability of clean, affordable, and
    reliable electricity while rapidly electrifying new parts of the
    economy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, we need to
    fundamentally transform the planning and operations of distribution
    and transmission grids by 2050. The grid of the future must be able
    to sense and adapt to changing electricity demand and external
    factors in real time, all while we decarbonize and expand the grid’s
    total capacity. Besides enabling electrification and integration of
    clean power sources, these innovations will also reduce the total
    cost of reaching net-zero emissions across the economy and increase
    grid resilience.  
-   **Industrial Products and Fuels for a Net-Zero, Circular
    Economy: ** Industrial processes represent some of the most
    challenging obstacles to reaching net-zero by 2050. This priority
    area focuses on new ways to make materials and fuels that reduce
    GHGs, increase efficiency, and cut waste. It includes solutions for
    reducing GHGs and increasing efficiency of industrial process
    heating, material production (such as metals, cement, plastic, and
    chemicals), and water treatment processes. It also includes pathways
    for producing net-zero electrofuels — synthetic fuels made from
    clean electricity — which could be used as energy-dense
    transportation fuels. Advanced industrial processes also include the
    systems and technological innovations needed for energy-intensive
    water treatment processes such as desalination and wastewater
    treatment. Producing all of these materials and fuels in a net-zero
    economy will require developing innovative chemistries,
    strengthening supply chains, and designing processes and products to
    deliver the same or better services for people with recycling and
    re-use in mind.  
-   **Fusion Energy at Scale: **Fusion, the same process that powers the
    sun and stars, has the potential to transform the energy system. It
    could provide abundant clean, reliable electricity anywhere in the
    United States or around the world, and could create a whole new
    industry and associated workforce. Fusion could potentially meet a
    large fraction of electricity demand and help eliminate GHG
    emissions from energy-intensive industrial processes, synthetic fuel
    production, and desalination. For these reasons, it could have
    impacts far beyond electricity generation. Because it relies on
    abundant, clean fuel sources, it can benefit national security and
    improve air quality in areas historically burdened by fossil
    generation.
