title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces New Initiatives to Strengthen\
  \ U.S.-Thailand Alliance and to Support Mekong\_Sub-Region"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris’s trip to Thailand is strengthening the
U.S.-Thailand strategic partnership and alliance for many years to
come.  The Vice President is expanding our bilateral cooperation on
areas such as the climate crisis and economic development by
accelerating the clean energy transition, building climate resilience,
and promoting sustainable development.  
   
The United States and Thailand reaffirm our shared interest in a
prosperous and resilient Southeast Asia.  We are pursuing sustainable,
climate-focused economic goals via the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and the Bio-Circular-Green Economy
model, and we are strengthening our economic ties, including through the
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).   
   
In a demonstration of the United States’ enduring commitment to
Thailand, the Mekong Region, and Southeast Asia more broadly, the Vice
President is launching the following initiatives.  
   
**<u>Addressing the Climate Crisis and Accelerating Clean Energy
Transition</u>**  
  
The United States and Thailand are committed to continuing to play
leading roles in addressing the climate crisis as we raise our climate
ambitions to reach our net-zero targets and unlock economic growth. 
Together we are working to reduce emissions and enhance climate
adaptation and resilience.  
   
Through IPEF and the Japan-U.S.-Mekong Power Partnership, the United
States and Thailand will expand investment opportunities, spur
innovation, and improve the livelihood of citizens.  The United States
will provide technical assistance on carbon capture, utilization and
storage to support Thailand’s development of  its legal and regulatory
framework, as well as attract private investment.  
 

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Net Zero World
    Initiative: </span> The United States welcomes Thailand joining the
    Net Zero World Initiative, a U.S.-led program launched at COP26 to
    leverage U.S. government expertise, philanthropy, and partner
    countries to accelerate the transition to net zero emission energy
    systems.  Together, we will promote cooperation in electric
    vehicles, solar energy and energy efficiency, to help Thailand meet
