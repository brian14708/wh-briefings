MS. DREYER:  Guys, I think I’m getting a phone call.  You know, I’m not
one to take a phone call during TV.  Oh, but I think — I think I should
answer this one.  

Hello, Mr. President?  I don’t think I can hear you.  Can you hear me,
Mr. President?  (Technical difficulties.)  Hello?  Happy Thanksgiving. 
Mr. President, are you there?

THE PRESIDENT:  We’re here!  (Laughs.)

THE FIRST LADY:  Hi!  Happy Thanksgiving.

MS. DREYER:  Oh!  (Laughs.)  I was so worried this call wasn’t going to
go through.  How are you?

THE PRESIDENT:  We’re fine.  We’re fine.  Watching your parade.  You’re
doing a good job. 

MS. DREYER:  Oh, thank you.  I love that you’re watching, like, the —

THE PRESIDENT:  You’re responsible for the good weather of the parade,
too.  That’s the best part.

MS. DREYER:  I will take credit for that, yes.  Thank you very much.

And just like millions of Americans, you guys watching the parade, what
do you want to say to everyone watching right now?

THE FIRST LADY:  We just want to say we’re so grateful for the people,
for this opportunity, for the health that we have now in America.  And
just Happy Thanksgiving.

Joe, what do you want to say?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I want to say thanks to the firefighters, the
police officers, first responders.  They never take a break.

THE FIRST LADY:  And God bless our troops, for sure.

THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, we’re going to be talking to some of
our troops later today, both here and abroad.  And I hope everybody
remembers we end every single day with “God bless our troops,” for real.

MS. DREYER:  That’s so true.  We are so grateful.  And what are your
plans for Thanksgiving, after the parade?

THE FIRST LADY:  Well, we’re just going to have dinner with the family,
probably take a walk on the beach, and just feel gratitude for our
family.

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ve been coming up to Nantucket for — since we
first got married, the whole family.  And it’s become a tradition.  And
we’re going to go stop at the fire department.  We’re going to make sure
that we spend some time on the island thanking the first responders
here.  And we’re going to go see the Coast Guard, the military.

 MS. DREYER:  Well, that’s wonderful and sounds absolutely lovely. 

Thank you, Mr. President and Dr. Biden, for taking the time to join us
today.  And I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving with your family.

THE PRESIDENT:  You too.  Hope you get a little time to enjoy it.  We’re
going to give Al a call too and see how he’s doing.

MS. DREYER:  Al is doing great.  Thank you so much for asking.

THE PRESIDENT:  All right.

THE FIRST LADY:  Happy Thanksgiving!

MS. DREYER:  Happy Thanksgiving!
