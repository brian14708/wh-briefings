President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. today attended the annual East Asia
Summit (EAS) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. President Biden reaffirmed the
enduring U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific, with ASEAN at its center.
 The President reviewed efforts to deliver on his vision for an
Indo-Pacific region that is free and open, connected, prosperous,
resilient, and secure. President Biden underscored his commitment to
working with allies and partners to strengthen health systems, promote
food security, address climate change, and accelerate the clean energy
transition. He reviewed progress in developing an Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework that provides concrete benefits to all of its fourteen members
and drives enduring and broad-based economic growth throughout the
Indo-Pacific. He also highlighted progress in implementing the
Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, through which
the United States, Australia, Japan, and India are helping ASEAN nations
and other Indo-Pacific partners to undertake marine conservation,
counter illegal fishing, and respond to humanitarian disasters.  
  
President Biden also addressed pressing regional and global challenges.
He underscored that freedom of navigation and overflight must be
respected in the East China Sea and South China Sea, and that all
disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with
international law. He reaffirmed U.S. support for the 2016 UN arbitral
tribunal ruling and noted this ruling is final and legally binding.
President Biden also raised concerns regarding the threats posed by the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and he condemned Russia’s brutal
and unjust war against Ukraine in the strongest terms. He raised concern
regarding the deteriorating crisis in Burma, and highlighted the
importance of taking further action to increase pressure on the Burmese
military regime to implement the Five Point Consensus, release political
prisoners, and provide for a return to the path of democracy.  
  
President Biden also commented on U.S.-PRC relations, underscoring that
the United States will compete vigorously with the PRC and speak out
regarding the PRC’s human rights abuses, while keeping lines of
communication open and ensuring competition does not veer into conflict.
He reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across
the Taiwan Strait.
