---
 
On November 28, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major
disaster exists in the State of West Virginia and ordered Federal aid to
supplement State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides during the period of
July 12 to July 13, 2022.

Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides in McDowell
County.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Jeffrey L. Jones as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional
counties may be designated for assistance after the assessments are
fully completed.
