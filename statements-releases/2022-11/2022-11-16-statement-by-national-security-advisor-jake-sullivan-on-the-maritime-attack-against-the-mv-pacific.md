title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Maritime Attack\
  \ Against the MV\_Pacific"

We condemn in the strongest possible terms the November 15 attack
against a commercial tanker, the MV Pacific Zircon, that was transiting
in international waters off the coast of Oman.  Upon review of the
available information, we are confident that Iran likely conducted this
attack using a UAV, a lethal capability it is increasingly employing
directly and via its proxies throughout the Middle East and
proliferating to Russia for use in Ukraine.  There is no justification
for this attack, which is the latest in a pattern of such actions and
broader destabilizing activities.  This action further threatens freedom
of navigation through this crucial waterway, international shipping and
commerce, and the lives of those on the vessels involved.   As President
Biden emphasized during his visit to the Middle East region, the United
States is committed to supporting the free flow of commerce through its
vital waterways.  The British Royal Navy was the first to respond, and
we express appreciation for the multilateral coordination led by the
UK.  We will work with partners and allies, including as part of the
International Maritime Security Construct, to hold Iran accountable and
respond through appropriate means.
