title: "FACT SHEET: Strengthening the U.S.-Indonesia Strategic\_Partnership"
---
 
The United States and Indonesia share a deep and enduring Strategic
Partnership, anchored in shared values of democracy and pluralism, and
our common commitment to the rules-based international order. The United
States remains focused on supporting Indonesia’s security and
prosperity, while working together to tackle the climate crisis, promote
access to affordable food and energy, strengthen pandemic preparedness
and the global health architecture, expand our important
people-to-people ties, and address the crises in Burma and Afghanistan.
In Fiscal Year 2022 alone, the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency
for International Development are planning to provide Indonesia with
more than $150 million in bilateral development and security
assistance.  
   
On the margins of the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, President Biden and
President Widodo will hold a bilateral meeting, during which the leaders
will review efforts to accelerate U.S.-Indonesian partnership across a
wide range of shared challenges and opportunities, including through the
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). During the G20 Summit, the United
States and Indonesia will join with partners to unveil transformative
new PGII initiatives that will accelerate Indonesia’s clean energy
transition and promote enduring prosperity. And today, President Biden
is announcing the following new initiatives:  
   
**Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact: **The United States
and Indonesia have successfully concluded negotiations to launch
a **$698 million** MCC Compact, supported with $649 million from the
United States and $49 million from Indonesia. The Compact will support
the development of high-quality, climate-conscious transportation
infrastructure in five provinces; mobilize international capital in
support of Indonesia’s development goals, in part by building the
capacity of Indonesia’s financial markets; and increase access to
finance for Indonesia’s women-owned businesses and micro, small, and
medium sized enterprises.  
   
**Sustainable Fishing and Marine Biodiversity: **In partnership with
Indonesia’s Ministry of Marine and Fisheries Affairs, USAID is launching
two new programs that will protect Indonesia’s marine biodiversity and
critical mangrove ecosystems by enhancing the sustainable and equitable
management of fisheries and Marine Protected Areas, and building the
resilience of commercial supply chains and fisheries-dependent
communities to the impacts of climate change.  
   
**Carbon Capture: ** ExxonMobil and Indonesian state-owned energy
company Pertamina have signed a $2.5 billion agreement to further assess
the development of regional Carbon Capture and Sequestration Hub in
Indonesia. This partnership will enable key industry sectors to
decarbonize, including the refining, chemicals, cement, and steel
sectors, thereby lowering carbon emissions while creating economic
opportunities for Indonesian workers, and this agreement will help
Indonesia achieve its net-zero ambitions in 2060 or sooner.  
   
**Coast Guard Capacity-Building: **Building on longstanding cooperation
between the United States and the Indonesian Maritime Security Agency
(BAKAMLA), the United States will now support BAKAMLA’s maritime
surveillance drone program. U.S. support will enable BAKAMLA to procure
drones, pilot training, and maintenance that will significantly enhance
BAKAMLA’s capabilities related to maritime domain awareness, maritime
law enforcement, and countering illegal fishing.    
   
**Investing in Food Security & Critical Supply Chains: **The U.S.
International Development Finance Corporation will invest $20 million in
Indonesia’s Aruna Global Technologies to connect Indonesia’s small-scale
rural fishers to the global market through innovative technology
platforms that empower women and marginalized communities, drive down
food costs, and increase resilience in food supply chains in the
second-largest fishing industry in the world.  
   
**Reducing Plastic Pollution: **USAID will launch a new initiative to
support public-private cooperation to reduce land-based sources of ocean
plastics pollution, in line with circular economy principles. USAID will
partner with local governments, the private sector, and community groups
to promote integrated waste management, thus improving waste collection
and treatment and strengthening the value chain for recycling.** **  
   
**Greening Public Transit: **The U.S. Trade and Development Agency is
launching a new partnership with MRT Jakarta, which manages the
capital’s public rail system, to support the public transit system’s
transition to renewable energy sources.  
   
**Investing in Cutting-Edge Energy Technology: **The U.S. International
Development Finance Corporation will support HDF Energy’s investment in
a portfolio of green hydrogen projects in Indonesia called
“Renewstable,” which combines renewable energy with battery and green
hydrogen backed storage to deliver stable and reliable power to
electricity grids.  
   
**Preserving Biodiversity: **USAID plans to launch a new climate
partnership with Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry in
support of the country’s Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink
2030 on the conservation of orangutans and other species such as
elephants, tigers, and rhinoceroses in Sumatra and Kalimantan. This
partnership will support ongoing conservation efforts and help
strengthen collaboration among relevant stakeholder.  
   
**Supporting Ports and Fisheries in the Pacific: **The United States and
Indonesia committed to partnering to enhance port and fisheries
administration in the Pacific. By leveraging Indonesian expertise in
port and fisheries administration and logistics, and in concert with
Pacific partners, the United States and Indonesia will send technical
experts to the region to support critical Pacific port and fishing
needs.  
   
**Education Cooperation:**  Building on the bilateral Educational
Cooperation MOU signed by the United States and Indonesia in December
2021, the United States has now allocated resources for a 30% increase
in educational advising centers in Indonesia, which will provide new
opportunities for Indonesian students to study in the United States.  In
addition, Peace Corps volunteers and Fulbright scholars and teachers
will return to Indonesia in January of 2023, after a multiyear hiatus
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.    
   
**Piloting Innovative Medical Technologies: ** The U.S. Trade and
Development Agency and GE Healthcare announced plans to co-fund a pilot
project to support the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MoH) develop a
national image and data repository (NIDR), creating a new cloud-based
centralized warehouse for electronic medical records and a hub-and-spoke
network connecting general practitioners in primary care facilities with
cardiologists in a central hospital.  
   
**Supporting Sustainable Development in Indonesia’s New Capital:** USAID
is partnering with the Ibu Kota Nusantara Authority – founded by
President Widodo to oversee the relocation of the Indonesian capital –
to provide project management support and technical assistance on the
new capital’s development, with a focus on smart city and “Forest City”
principles.
