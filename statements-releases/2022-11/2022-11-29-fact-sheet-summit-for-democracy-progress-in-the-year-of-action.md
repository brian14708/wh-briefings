title: "Fact Sheet: Summit for Democracy: Progress in the Year of\_Action"
---
 
During the “Year of Action” following the first Summit for Democracy in
December 2021, the United States and over 100 partner governments around
the world have taken meaningful steps to build more resilient
democracies, combat corruption, and defend human rights. Summit
participants have undertaken important pro-democracy reforms at home,
contributed to impactful multilateral initiatives, and worked together
to resist authoritarian aggression, including Russia’s unprovoked and
unjustified war against Ukraine.   
   
President Biden is pleased to announce that on March 29-30, 2023, he
will [co-host the second Summit for
Democracy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/29/joint-statement-between-costa-rica-the-netherlands-the-republic-of-korea-the-republic-of-zambia-and-the-united-states-on-the-announcement-of-the-second-summit-for-democracy/) with
the leaders of Costa Rica, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, and
the Republic of Zambia. This diverse group of co-hosts underscores the
universal desire for accountable, transparent, and rights-respecting
governance.   
   
At this second Summit, world leaders will showcase progress made on
their commitments to build more resilient democracies; announce new
commitments and initiatives to build on that momentum; reaffirm the
central role of democratic institutions in delivering prosperity and
safeguarding liberty; and underscore the effectiveness of collective
action in tackling the most pressing challenges of our time.  
   
At the first Summit for Democracy, participating governments announced
nearly 750 commitments aimed at strengthening and safeguarding democracy
at home and abroad. During the Year of Action, Summit participants have
supported one another in fulfilling these goals, including through
government-to-government consultations and participation in
multi-stakeholder Democracy Cohorts focused on topics including
technology, media freedom, countering disinformation, youth engagement,
financial transparency and integrity, and gender equality and women’s
political participation, among others.  
   
At home, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to demonstrate that
democracy can still deliver, and helps improve people’s lives and
address the greatest challenges before us. Working together with
Congress, President Biden has signed into law transformative legislation
that will grow the American economy and create more well-paying jobs for
American workers, invest in infrastructure, reduce gun violence, improve
access to health care, and protect our climate.    
   
Select achievements during the Year of Action aligned to the five
pillars of the Summit for Democracy’s *Presidential Initiative for
Democracy Renewal* include:  
  
**Supporting Free and Independent Media**  
Together with partners, the U.S. Government’s investments in press
freedom and independent media are intended to maintain journalists’
ability to inform the public and to improve citizens’ capacity to hold
their governments accountable. Our efforts in the Year of Action have
supported the development, sustainability, and independence of public
interest media, and helped protect journalists physically, digitally,
and legally.  For example:  

-   ***Bolstering Independent Media*. **Through the U.S. Agency for
    International Development (USAID), the U.S. Government has invested
    $20 million in the **International Fund for Public Interest Media
    (IFPIM),** a multi-donor fund to support independent media in low-
    and middle-income countries. Our investment, combined with support
    from a growing list of governments, private companies, and
    foundations, has helped launch the first round of awards, which
    garnered applications from more than 200 media organizations from 17
    countries around the world. Additionally, through USAID’s **Media
    Viability Accelerator**, we are supporting the creation of a data
    platform that will: 1) enable media outlets to better understand the
    markets, audiences, and strategies that will maximize their odds of
    profitability; and 2) provide donors with market data and financial
    strategies to ensure their support to media is sustainable. In
    September, the United States joined the **International Partnership
    for Information and Democracy**, which promotes democratic
    principles in the global information and communications space.  
-   ***Protecting Journalists Physically, Digitally, and Legally*.** As
    part of the Summit for Democracy’s *Presidential Initiative for
    Democratic Renewal*, USAID will soon launch **Reporters Mutual**, an
    innovative insurance vehicle that will cover the cost of defending
    journalists, civil society activists, and their organizations from
    defamation, libel, and other lawsuits meant to silence their
    reporting. Additionally, together with other members of the
    52-country **Media Freedom Coalition**, the United States worked to
    strengthen media freedom and the safety of journalists by issuing
    joint public statements highlighting deteriorating conditions and
    working collaboratively to streamline support for media development
    globally.

**Fighting Corruption**  
Actions undertaken in the Year of Action concurrent with the U.S.
Government’s implementation of its first-ever Strategy on Countering
Corruption reflect the scale of the threat corruption poses to
transparent and accountable governance. Targeted efforts served to close
loopholes and shut down safe havens; enhance partners’ capacity to
prevent corruption and hold corrupt actors accountable; empower civil
society, media, and the private sector; leverage innovation; and respond
quickly and decisively to opportunities and threats. For example:

-   ***Supporting Anti-corruption Change Agents.*** On July 5, the
    Department of State appointed a first-ever **Coordinator on Global
    Anti-Corruption**, who works with civil society, industry, and
    international partners to strengthen coordination on anti-corruption
    issues, advance U.S. anti-corruption priorities, and ensure
    countries are meeting their commitments and international
    obligations. On November 2, USAID launched the **Strengthening
    Transparency and Accountability through Investigative Reporting
    (STAIR)** program, a five-year, $20 million program that will
    support collaborative investigative journalism networks, foster
    investigative outlets’ organizational and financial viability, and
    advance proactive, holistic approaches to safety and security.  
-   ***Innovating and Partnering to Combat Corruption.*** The
    Departments of State and the Treasury, along with the Alliance for
    Innovative Regulation and Accountability Lab, launched the
    **Anti-Corruption Solutions through Emerging Technologies (ASET)**
    program to identify and develop technological responses that prevent
    and address corruption challenges. In June, ASET convened hundreds
    of participants for a Global Anti-corruption “TechSprint,” where
    three winning teams developed solutions for increasing transparency
    in foreign assistance, reducing corruption in disaster relief
    projects, and assessing corruption risks related to maritime
    shipping. USAID awarded the **Countering Transnational Corruption
    Grand Challenge for Development. ** The inaugural activity under the
    Grand Challenge, took place in November 2022, will focus on
    promoting transparency and accountability in the supply chains of
    minerals critical for the transition to a green economy.  
-   ***Curbing Corruption through Strategic and Regulatory Action.*** In
    accordance with the **Corporate Transparency Act (CTA),** the
    Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
    issued a final rule in September to require certain companies formed
    or operating in the United States to report beneficial ownership
    information. These reports will be a vital tool for U.S. national
    security agencies, law enforcement, and federal regulators, as well
    as foreign partners and financial institutions, to prevent illicit
    actors from hiding the proceeds of corruption behind anonymous shell
    companies in the United States. FinCEN is continuing to build the
    infrastructure to further implement the CTA and is also working to
    develop regulations to limit the ability of illicit actors to
    anonymize their **real estate** **purchases**. Additionally, in
    March 2022, the Treasury Department launched the **Kleptocracy Asset
    Recovery Rewards Program,** which pays rewards to qualified
    individuals who provide information leading to the restraint or
    seizure, forfeiture, or repatriation of assets linked to foreign
    government corruption worldwide. Finally, the Departments of the
    Treasury and State continue to utilize accountability tools, such as
    **financial sanctions and visa restrictions**, in line with the
    recommendations of the U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption and
    including those authorized by through the Global Magnitsky Sanctions
    Program, to designate foreign persons engaged in acts of
    corruption.  
-   ***Strategic Multilateral Engagement to Combat Corruption*:** The
    Departments of State, Justice, and the Treasury, along with other
    agencies, have also continued to strengthen **multilateral
    anti-corruption efforts** to raise international standards for
    combatting corruption.  For example, in December the U.S. Government
    will co-host the 2022 **International Anti-Corruption Conference**
    **(IACC)**, the world’s premier opportunity for civil society and
    government officials to collaborate on anti-corruption matters. The
    U.S. Government has also advanced anti-corruption standards and
    measures through the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)**, **G7**,
    and **G20**, as well as through the **United Nations Global
    Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities
    (GlobE Network)**.   
-   ***Strengthening Anti-Corruption Ecosystems.*** The United States,
    through both USAID and the Department of State, continues to
    **provide robust country-level assistance** to counter and mitigate
    corruption around the world, collectively supporting over $258
    million in anti-corruption foreign assistance programming in
    FY 2020. Additionally, on September, 6 USAID rolled out **a
    cutting-edge guide on dekleptification** to support frontline actors
    engaged in uprooting entrenched kleptocratic structures.  
-   ***Holding Russia Accountable.*** In response to Russia’s further
    invasion of Ukraine, the United States, in coordination with allies
    and partners, launched in March the multilateral **Russian Elites,
    Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force** to hold accountable those
    responsible for and benefitting from Russia’s war machine. As of
    June, members of the REPO Task Force have frozen more than $30
    billion worth of assets belonging to sanctioned Russians, including
    their high-value real estate and luxury yachts. In March, U.S.
    Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the launch of **Task
    Force KleptoCapture,** an interagency law enforcement task force
    dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export restrictions,
    and economic countermeasures that the United States has imposed,
    along with allies and partners, in response to Russia’s unprovoked
    war in Ukraine. Since its creation, KleptoCapture has worked with
    international partners to seize a sanctioned Russian oligarch’s $90
    million luxury yacht in Spain, to seize and transport a nearly
    half-billion-dollar yacht belonging to a sanctioned oligarch from
    Fiji to San Diego, and to seize millions of dollars associated with
    sanctioned parties held at multiple U.S. financial institutions.

**Bolstering Democratic Reformers**  
The United States and our partners are committed to bolstering the work
of activists and other reformers working on the front lines of
democratic renewal. In the Year of Action, we have increased support to
these reformers, giving them additional tools to advance governments and
societies that reflect democratic principles, reject corruption, and
respect human rights. For example:

-   ***Empowering Historically Marginalized Groups and Ensuring All Have
    a Say in Democracy.*** Domestically, under the Biden-Harris
    Administration, all U.S. Government Departments and Agencies have
    developed and released plans to **advance racial justice and
    equity**. In June, the State Department announced its first
    **Special Representative for Racial** **Equity** **and**
    **Justice**, who leads efforts to protect and advance the human
    rights of people around the world who belong to marginalized racial
    and ethnic communities, and to combat systemic racism,
    discrimination, and xenophobia.  
-   ***Supporting Activists, Workers, and Reform-Minded Leaders.*** In
    September, USAID launched at the UN General Assembly the **Democracy
    Delivers Initiative**, which brought together leaders from eight
    countries experiencing renewed democratic openings with top
    executives and leaders of major foundations and philanthropies to
    generate investment and other forms of support. USAID is pairing the
    Democracy Delivers Initiative with a new **Partnerships for
    Democratic Development** program, which will support countries
    experiencing democratic openings by facilitating locally-led efforts
    to address key development challenges that can forestall or reverse
    democratic consolidation.  
-   ***Defending Democracy in Europe and Eurasia.*** On March 24, in
    response to Russia’s brutal and unjustified further invasion of
    Ukraine, President Biden announced the **European Democratic
    Resilience Initiative** (EDRI) to bolster democratic resilience,
    enhance anti-corruption defenses, and defend human rights in Ukraine
    and the region. Working with Congress, the U.S. Government will
    harness EDRI to provide at least $320 million in new funding to
    address immediate and medium-term needs in Europe and Eurasia.
    Additionally, the United States has provided $8.5 billion in
    **direct budgetary support** to the Government of Ukraine since
    Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February. These funds,
    provided by the United States through the World Bank, allow the
    Ukrainian government to keep gas and electricity flowing to
    hospitals, schools, and other critical infrastructure; provide
    humanitarian supplies to citizens, and continue to pay the salaries
    of civil servants, healthcare workers and teachers – and ensure that
    democracy continues to deliver for its people.

**  
Advancing Technology for Democracy**  
Together with like-minded partners and allies, the U.S. Government is
investing in efforts to stem the tide of digital authoritarianism,
promote a positive vision for the Internet and emerging technologies,
and connect billions around the world to values-driven,
rights-respecting digital technologies and infrastructure. For example:

-   ***Advancing an Open, Interoperable, Reliable, and Secure
    Internet.*** In April, the United States and 60 partner countries
    joined in the **Declaration for the Future of the Internet**, a
    commitment to advance a positive vision for the Internet and digital
    technologies. In June, the Department of State announced that **the
    United States will chair the Freedom Online Coalition in 2023.** The
    United States and partners also launched the **Global Partnership
    for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse**, where the
    founding partner governments of Australia, Denmark, the Republic of
    Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom agreed upon a roadmap to
    better prioritize, understand, prevent, and address the growing
    scourge of technology-facilitated gender-based violence. Since its
    March launch, the governments of Kenya, New Zealand, Canada, and
    Chile have joined the Global Partnership.  
-   ***Expanding Digital Democracy Programming**.*** Under the new
    **Advancing Digital Democracy Initiative**, USAID has stood up pilot
    activities in Zambia and Serbia that will work to ensure technology
    is used to advance — and not undermine — democracy. In Zambia, USAID
    is seizing new opportunities made possible by the country’s
    democratic opening to build resilience to the misuse of technology
    across legal and regulatory frameworks. In Serbia, the Initiative is
    supporting a network of activists, local technology stakeholders,
    universities, and public officials to advocate for data protection
    and privacy laws and regulations that protect Serbians’ rights.    
             
-   ***Advancing Democracy-Affirming Technologies.*** In July, the
    United States and United Kingdom initiated **Privacy Enhancing
    Technology Prize Challenges** as part of a series of **International
    Grand Challenges on Democracy-Affirming Technologies**, which were
    launched by the United States at the first Summit for Democracy. The
    challenges will spur innovation in privacy technologies that can
    transform financial crime prevention and boost pandemic response
    capabilities, all while safeguarding sensitive data. Additionally,
    in June, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern kicked off the
    first venture day of the **Tech4Democracy Global Entrepreneurship
    Challenge**, which was launched by IE University in Madrid in
    partnership with the Department of State. This challenge focuses on
    identifying entrepreneurs that build and advance democracy-affirming
    technologies in a series of venture days around the world. Finally,
    the United States continues to build out the **Multilateral Surge
    and Sustain Fund for Anti-Censorship Technology** in light of
    surging global demand for technology that can protect users and
    circumvent authoritarian governments’ online censorship efforts.  
-   ***Defending Rights in a Digital Age.*** **In October, the White
    House Office of Science and Technology Policy released the Blueprint
    for an AI Bill of Rights*.* The Blueprint is a set of five
    principles and associated practices to help guide the design, use,
    and deployment of automated systems to protect the rights of the
    American public in the age of artificial intelligence, and**
    includes concrete steps which governments, companies, communities,
    and others can take in order to build these key protections into
    policy, practice, or technological design to ensure automated
    systems **are aligned with democratic values and protect civil
    rights, civil liberties, and privacy.** The United States is also
    taking steps to **counter digital transnational repression and risks
    posed by foreign commercial spyware**.  
-   ***Improving Tech Platform Accountability.*** **In September, the
    White House announced its** **Principles for Enhancing Competition
    and Tech Platform Accountability**, which outline U.S. Government
    priorities concerning promoting competition in the technology
    sector, providing robust protections for Americans’ privacy,
    reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and
    increasing transparency about technology platforms’ algorithms and
    content moderation decisions, among others.

**Defending Free and Fair Elections and Inclusive Political Processes**

Around the world, exercising the right to vote in free and fair
elections faces growing challenges, including electoral manipulation and
violence, cyber-attacks, disinformation, and barriers to political
participation by systematically marginalized populations. During the
Year of Action, the U.S. Government has advanced new approaches to
addressing critical long-standing and emerging threats to electoral
integrity globally. For example:

-   ***Strengthening Electoral Integrity.*** USAID has convened 25
    international organizations, inter-governmental organizations,
    development agencies, and election networks to develop the **Global
    Network for Securing Election Integrity**, which will officially
    launch by the end of 2022. At home, President Biden’s FY 2023 Budget
    proposes the largest-ever investment in our Nation’s **election
    infrastructure**. This includes $10 billion to enable the state and
    local jurisdictions that administer elections to make long-term
    investments in election equipment, systems, and personnel. The
    Budget also proposes $5 billion to fund an expansion of Postal
    Service delivery capacity in underserved areas and support for
    vote-by-mail, including making ballots postage-free and reducing the
    cost of other election-related mail for jurisdictions and voters.  
-   ***Promoting Access to Voting*.** As the Biden-Harris administration
    continues to fight for essential **federal voting rights
    legislation**, including the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement
    Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, federal agencies are implementing
    President Biden’s [Executive
    Order](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=1d4d1ebc06&e=cf669202c8)
    on Promoting Access to Voting, leveraging the resources of the
    federal government to provide information about the election process
    and increased access to voter registration opportunities. In May,
    the Department of the Interior made history as the first National
    Voter Registration Act-designated federal agency when it accepted
    states’ request to help register Americans to vote when they sign up
    for other government services. Subsequently, the Department of
    Veterans Affairs announced a similar partnership with three
    states.  
-   ***Countering Hate-Fueled Violence***: In September, President Biden
    held the **United We Stand Summit** at the White House, where the
    federal government and other sectors of society committed to actions
    to counter the hate-fueled violence that threatens our public safety
    and democracy. Ongoing work under the United We Stand Summit
    includes long-term efforts to address toxic polarization and foster
    unity.
