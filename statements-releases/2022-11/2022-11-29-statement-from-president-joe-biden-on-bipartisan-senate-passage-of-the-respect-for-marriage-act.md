title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Bipartisan Senate Passage of the Respect\
  \ for Marriage\_Act"
---
 
With today’s bipartisan Senate passage of the Respect for Marriage Act,
the United States is on the brink of reaffirming a fundamental truth:
love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person
they love. For millions of Americans, this legislation will safeguard
the rights and protections to which LGBTQI+ and interracial couples and
their children are entitled. It will also ensure that, for generations
to follow, LGBTQI+ youth will grow up knowing that they, too, can lead
full, happy lives and build families of their own.  
   
Importantly, the Senate’s passage of the Respect for Marriage Act is a
bipartisan achievement. I’m grateful to the determined Members of
Congress — especially Senators Baldwin, Collins, Portman, Sinema,
Tillis, and Feinstein — whose leadership has underscored that
Republicans and Democrats together support the essential right of
LGBTQI+ and interracial couples to marry. I look forward to welcoming
them at the White House after the House passes this legislation and
sends it to my desk, where I will promptly and proudly sign it into law.
