title: "United\_States-Australia-Japan Joint Statement on Cooperation on Telecommunications\_\
  Financing"
---
 
We, President Biden, Prime Minister Albanese, and Prime Minister
Kishida, today reaffirmed our commitment to work together with
Indo-Pacific partners to meet their needs for high-quality, sustainable
infrastructure.  
  
At the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) event
at the G20 Summit, we announced that the United States International
Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and Japan Bank for International
Cooperation (JBIC) will, subject to final approvals, provide USD50
million each in credit guarantees for Export Finance Australia’s (EFA)
financing package, which was provided to support Telstra’s acquisition
of Digicel Pacific.   
  
This project reflects our commitment to help build a stronger Pacific
region through investment in infrastructure, in line with the PGII and
the Partners of the Blue Pacific initiative, both established this
year.  
  
Digicel Pacific is the leading telecommunications operator in the
Pacific, with over 2.5 million subscribers in Papua New Guinea, Fiji,
Vanuatu, Samoa, Tonga and Nauru.  
  
Reliable and high-quality telecommunications networks are critical to
support the prosperity of our digital economies. This investment will
improve security and performance and deliver affordable mobile voice and
data services in the Pacific.  
  
Telstra finalised the USD1.6 billion acquisition on 13 July 2022 with
USD1.33 billion in financing provided by the Australian Government
through EFA.  
  
Our support to this project builds on our shared commitment to address
the infrastructure needs of the region through the Trilateral
Infrastructure Partnership (TIP). We have already announced support for
important infrastructure in the region, including the East Micronesia
Cable and an undersea cable for Palau.   
  
The project is a practical demonstration of the G20 Principles for
Quality Infrastructure Investment – including the promotion of socially
inclusive, resilient, and environmentally friendly infrastructure – and
provides a foundation for expanding the development impact of
telecommunications for the Pacific.
