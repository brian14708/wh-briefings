title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Speaker Nancy\_Pelosi"
---
 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not only made history, she has shaped it. She
has not only broken glass ceilings, she has shown the world – and young
women in particular – that there is no ceiling they cannot reach. I have
worked with Speaker Pelosi throughout my career, most recently as a
United States Senator and as Vice President. The magnitude of her impact
and legacy – in California, in Congress, and in countries around the
world – cannot be measured. As the most effective Speaker in our
Nation’s history, her leadership and tireless advocacy has always been
focused on creating an America that truly lives up to the ideals that
our founders envisioned – and our children deserve. As a fierce defender
of democracy, she has stood up for our nation’s most sacred ideals
during some of our darkest moments. The Second Gentleman and I wish
Speaker Pelosi, Paul, and their entire family all the best as she
continues to serve California and build on her unmatched record of
service in Congress.
