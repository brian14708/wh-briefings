title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Earthquake in\_Japan"
---
 
Jill and I are praying for the people of Japan who have been impacted by
the terrible earthquake. My administration is in touch with Japanese
officials, and the United States stands ready to provide any necessary
assistance for the Japanese people. As close Allies, the United States
and Japan share a deep bond of friendship that unites our people. Our
thoughts are with the Japanese people during this difficult time.
