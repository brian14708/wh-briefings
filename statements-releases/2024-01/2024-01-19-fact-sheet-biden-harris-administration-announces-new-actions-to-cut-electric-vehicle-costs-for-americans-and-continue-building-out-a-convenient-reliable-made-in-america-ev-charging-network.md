title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Cut\
  \ Electric Vehicle Costs for Americans and Continue Building Out a Convenient, Reliable,\
  \ Made-in-America EV Charging\_Network"
---
 
***Since President Biden took office, EV sales have more than quadrupled
– with over four and a half million EVs on the road***

As part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda and Bidenomics,
the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to lower the
cost of electric vehicles (EVs) for Americans and build a convenient,
reliable, Made-in-America EV charging network. Thanks to President
Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the Biden-Harris Administration is
already delivering major progress to electrify the great American road
trip. **Since the President took office, EV sales have more than
quadrupled, with more than four and a half million EVs on the road. EV
ownership is more affordable than ever before, with prices down over 20%
from one year ago. The number of publicly available charging ports has
also grown by over 70 percent, with 170,000 publicly available EV
chargers across the country**, putting us on track to deploy 500,000
chargers by 2026 – achieving the President’s goal four years early.

To continue building on this unprecedented progress, today, **the
Department of Treasury and the Department of Energy **are releasing
intended definitions for eligible census tracts that will **confirm
thatthe Inflation Reduction Act’s 30C EV charging tax credit is
available to approximately two-thirds of Americans**. This tax credit
provides up to 30% off the cost of the charger to individuals and
businesses in low-income communities and non-urban areas, making it more
affordable to install EV charging infrastructure and increasing access
to EV charging in underserved communities.

In addition, **the Departments of Transportation and Energy are
announcing $325 million in new investments this week across three
programs to increase the reliability and resilience of publicly
accessible chargers, advance EV technologies, and support workforce
development for EV charging deployment and maintenance**. This new
funding for EV chargers will repair and replace existing,
non-operational chargers across the country; reduce costs for deploying
charging in underserved communities; and cut battery costs. These
investments follow the $623 million in awards announced last week to
deploy public charging in communities and fill gaps in the national
network.

The Administration’s historic investments in EV technologies are also
spurring [private
companies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Private-Sector-EV-Charging-Announcements.pdf) to
invest alongside the federal government in EV charging. **More than $25
billion of investment in the U.S. EV charging network has been announced
to date, including more than $10 billion from the private sector.** And
under President Biden’s leadership, the U.S. EV charging manufacturing
footprint has grown from almost nothing to a robust and thriving
sector. **Just three years ago, there was almost no U.S.-based
production of fast chargers, but since President Biden took
office, **[**at least 40 U.S.-based EV charger
factories**](https://www.energy.gov/invest)** have been announced or
opened**. These facilities now have the capacity to produce [more than a
million
chargers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/12/11/full-charge-the-economics-of-building-a-national-ev-charging-network/) each
year—including 60,000 fast chargers.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is making it easier and cheaper for
Americans to ride and drive electric – and to ensure that the EV future
benefits American workers and families. **But Republicans in Congress
are trying to thwart this progress by passing a measure that would
eliminate the federal government’s strong domestic manufacturing
standards for EV chargers. The President has pledged to veto
this **[**resolution**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SAP-SJRes-38.pdf),
which would hurt American workers, undermine domestic manufacturing, and
benefit competitor nations like the People’s Republic of China.

Announcements made today and recently are the latest proof that while
Republicans in Congress try to undermine historic progress, President
Biden is delivering for Americans and the country. <span

Biden-Harris Administration is building an EV charging network that
benefits communities everywhere:</span>

-   **Lowering Costs for Installing EV Chargers: **Today, the Department
    of Treasury is releasing a notice of intent to propose regulations
    related to the 30C tax credit, re-enacted by the Inflation Reduction
    Act, which plays an important role in lowering costs for EV owners
    and encouraging EV adoption. The tax credit provides up to 30% off
    the cost of the charger to individuals and businesses in eligible
    census tracts. Today’s announcement proposes definitions for
    eligible census tracts that will clarify eligibility of the tax
    credit to approximately two-thirds of the U.S. population – focusing
    on those in low-income communities and non-urban areas. Alongside
    Treasury’s guidance, the Department of Energy (DOE) is releasing a
    mapping tool to help households and businesses quickly identify
    whether they are eligible for the tax credit under the proposed
    regulations.  
-   **Strengthening the Foundation for the EV Charging
    Industry: **Today, the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation
    announced over $46 million in awards through their Ride and Drive
    Electric program to continue building a convenient, affordable,
    reliable, and equitable EV charging network that benefits diverse
    American workers. As part of the awards, for example, Oregon
    Tradeswomen, Inc., is receiving funding to recruit and prepare
    people from all backgrounds – including underrepresented minorities
    and women – for electrical apprenticeships, and train diverse IBEW
    Local 48 electricians with Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training
    Program (EVITP) certification, while the Research Foundation for
    SUNY at the University of Buffalo is receiving funding to develop a
    resiliency plan for New Jersey Transit electrification.  
-   **Increasing EV Charging Reliability and Accessibility:** Yesterday,
    the Department of Transportation announced nearly $149 million in
    grants to repair or replace existing but non-operational EV
    chargers. This announcement is critical to ensure the reliability of
    the existing network of EV chargers, and will put nearly 4,500 EV
    charging ports back online.  
-   **Advancing EV Technologies Through Research and
    Development:** Yesterday, the Department of Energy announced over
    $131 million in funding for research, development, and technology
    integration projects for zero-emission vehicles and mobility; and
    for an advanced battery R&D consortium. This funding builds on the
    $32 million announced by DOE for the same program earlier this
    month. Projects include reducing costs such as permitting and
    utility interconnection to improve EV charging infrastructure in
    underserved communities, providing consumer information on EVs and
    EV charging, and developing batteries that use low-cost, abundant
    materials.   
-   **Opening Federally Funded EV Charging Stations Across the
    Country:** States are accelerating progress on deploying EV chargers
    using federal formula funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law’s NEVI (National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure) program. To
    date, nearly $2.4 billion has been made available through the NEVI
    program. Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania have all [brought
    NEVI-funded chargers
    online](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2023/12/ohio-opens-nations-first-electric-vehicle-charging-station-funded-by-2021-federal-infrastructure-law.html) in
    the last several weeks. States like Maine and Vermont will soon
    follow, having recently broken ground on their own NEVI-funded
    sites.   
-   **Delivering Grants to School Districts to Purchase Clean
    Buses:** Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) [announced $1
    billion](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-1b-awards-clean-school-buses-across) for
    the purchase of over 2,700 clean school buses in 280 school
    districts across 37 states. To date, EPA’s Clean School Bus Program
    has awarded nearly $2 billion and funded approximately 5,000
    electric and low-emission school buses across the country.  
-   **Deploying Chargers in Communities to Fill Gaps in the National
    Network: **Also last week, the Department of
    Transportation [announced $623
    million](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/biden-harris-administration-announces-623-million-grants-continue-building-out-electric) in
    Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grants to help build out an EV
    charging network across the U.S. Half of this funding is going to 36
    projects in communities that will invest in EV charging and hydrogen
    fueling infrastructure in urban and rural communities in convenient
    locations like schools, parks, libraries, multi-family housing, and
    more. These chargers are especially critical for people who live in
    multifamily homes and don’t have access to home charging options.
    The other half is going to 11 projects along corridors to fill gaps
    in the national charging and alternative fueling network.  
-   **Making EVs More Affordable at the Dealer: **On average, EVs are
    now 20 percent cheaper than they were one year ago. As of January
    1<sup>st</sup>, Americans can get up to $7,500 off the sticker price
    of many of the new electric vehicles eligible for the Inflation
    Reduction Act’s 30D New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, and up to $4,000
    off the price of a used EV for vehicles eligible for the 25E Used
    Clean Vehicle Credit. Already, over 9,500 dealers across the country
    have registered with IRS Energy Credits Online, most of which also
    registered to provide this tax credit at the point of sale.

**Additionally, as a result of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
leadership, more than a dozen private companies have announced major
commitments to expand EV charging. See a list of
commitments **[**here**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Private-Sector-EV-Charging-Announcements.pdf)**.**
