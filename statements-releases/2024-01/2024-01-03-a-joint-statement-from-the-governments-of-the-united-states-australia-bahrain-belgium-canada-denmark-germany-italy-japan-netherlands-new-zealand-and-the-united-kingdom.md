Recognizing the broad consensus as expressed by 44 countries around the
world on December 19, 2023, as well as the statement by the UN Security
Council on December 1, 2023, condemning Houthi attacks against
commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea, and in light of ongoing
attacks, including a significant escalation over the past week
targeting commercial vessels, with missiles, small boats, and attempted
hijackings,  
   
We hereby reiterate the following and warn the Houthis against further
attacks:  
   
Ongoing Houthi attacks in the Red Sea are illegal, unacceptable, and
profoundly destabilizing. There is no lawful justification for
intentionally targeting civilian shipping and naval vessels. Attacks
on vessels, including commercial vessels, using unmanned aerial
vehicles, small boats, and missiles, including the first use of
anti-ship ballistic missiles against such vessels, are a direct threat
to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade
in one of the world’s most critical waterways.  
   
These attacks threaten innocent lives from all over the world and
constitute a significant international problem that demands collective
action.  Nearly 15 percent of global seaborne trade passes through the
Red Sea, including 8 percent of global grain trade, 12 percent of
seaborne-traded oil and 8 percent of the world’s liquefied natural gas
trade. International shipping companies continue to reroute their
vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, adding significant cost and weeks
of delay to the delivery of goods, and ultimately jeopardizing the
movement of critical food, fuel, and humanitarian assistance throughout
the world.  
  
Let our message now be clear: we call for the immediate end
of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and
crews.  The Houthis will bear the responsibility of the consequences
should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free
flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways. We remain committed
to the international rules-based order and are determined to hold malign
actors accountable for unlawful seizures and attacks.
