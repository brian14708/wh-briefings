title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Expand\
  \ Small Business Access to Federal\_Contracts"
---
 
*Office of Management and Budget guidance expands access for small
businesses to high value and high use contracts; Small Business
Administration revamps mentoring programs for underserved businesses
interested in doing business with the government and releases new
demographic data on government contracts*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced its latest actions to
expand access for small businesses to the over $700 billion spent
through federal contracts each year, particularly for those owned by
individuals from underrepresented communities. The federal government is
the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world, making federal
contracts a powerful tool to build wealth in underserved communities and
ensure that the federal government is leveraging talent from all corners
of the country. These new initiatives will advance the President’s
Investing in America agenda and bold goal of increasing the share of
federal contracting dollars going to small businesses owned and
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (SDBs)
to 15% by Fiscal Year (FY) 2025, a 50% increase from spending levels
when he first took office. 

In each of the last three fiscal years, the Administration has increased
spending on contracts to small businesses on the way to this goal, with
small businesses receiving nearly $163 billion in federal contracting
dollars in FY 2022, $70 billion of which was earned by SDBs. Supporting
small businesses and giving entrepreneurs the tools to thrive is a key
pillar of Bidenomics. Under President Biden, a record 16 million new
business applications have been filed, while the share of Black
households owning a business has more than doubled, and the share of
Latino households owning a business has increased by 40%.

In 2021, President Biden took the historic step of ordering the public
release of federal contract data broken down by business owner race and
ethnicity to bring increased transparency to federal contracting. New
data for FY22 released today shows that businesses owned by historically
underrepresented groups earned more through federal contracts across
every category.

The Administration continues to stand behind our programs to support
small businesses, and today, the Administration is announcing new
actions to help small businesses access federal contracts, including
issuing new guidance to federal agencies from the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB), providing new technical resources to SDBs to help them
obtain contracts and expand revenue, and sharing data on federal
contracts to traditionally underserved small businesses.  Actions
include:

-   **New OMB guidance to all federal agencies to help more small
    businesses participate in high use federal contracts.** Today, OMB
    issued guidance on strategies federal agencies should adopt so that
    small businesses can participate in multiple-award contracts – a
    contract vehicle that accounts for nearly $160 billion, or over 20%,
    of all federal government contract dollars. Agencies rely on
    multiple-award contracts because they allow agencies to meet mission
    needs with more timely, cost-effective and streamlined competitions.
    To ensure that small businesses have opportunities to participate in
    multiple-award contracts, the guidance encourages earlier engagement
    and planning for multiple-award contracts to maximize opportunities
    for small business contract holders; additional consideration of
    “on-ramps” to allow for businesses to be added during the
    performance period of the multiple-award contract; and the use of
    small business set aside orders for competition among small
    businesses. These changes will help more small businesses
    participate in federal contracts, support a and resilient federal
    marketplace and ensure federal contracts are best delivering for the
    American people.  
-   **Improved technical assistance opportunities for small businesses
    looking to do business with the federal government.** The Small
    Business Administration (SBA) is announcing a slate of major
    improvements to the popular 7(j) technical assistance program – now
    called Empower to Grow (E2G) – which is available to SDBs located in
    areas of high unemployment or low income. The improved E2G program
    will offer customized one-on-one training tailored to small business
    needs and guide them through the process of pursuing government
    contracts, convening networking and matchmaking events between
    government agencies and prime contractors.  In FY 2023, the E2G
    program provided support to 6,000 small businesses and helped 2,000
    small businesses grow their participation in federal contracting.
    Small businesses that received training reported, on average, a 45%
    increase in annual revenue.

Today’s actions build on significant steps the Biden-Harris
Administration has already taken to support small businesses. This
includes:

-   **SBA expanded its lending program focused on underserved
    communities for the first time in 40 years and made critical program
    changes to increase lending to underserved small businesses.** This
    fall, the SBA [issued new
    licenses](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/11/01/biden-harris-administration-takes-historic-step-expanding-access-capital-filling-lending-gaps)
    to lenders in the Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) program [for
    the first time in 40
    years](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/11/01/biden-harris-administration-takes-historic-step-expanding-access-capital-filling-lending-gaps).
    The lenders in this program have a track record of strong lending to
    traditionally underserved communities, and the new lenders each
    specialize in delivering capital to sectors and groups that face
    persistent capital access gaps. SBA also made critical reforms to
    its loan programs in 2023 that supported significant progress in
    addressing barriers to capital facing small business owners. In FY
    2023, SBA made record gains in lending to Black, Latino, Native,
    AAPI, women, and veteran entrepreneurs – including $1.5 billion in
    loans to Black-owned businesses and $3 billion to Latino-owned
    businesses. Total loans and total loan dollars to Black-owned
    businesses more than doubled under the Biden-Harris Administration,
    and total loans to Latino-owned businesses doubled with total loan
    dollars increasing by more than 80%.  
-   **The Department of the Treasury administers $10 billion State Small
    Business Initiative (SSBCI).** Funded by the American Rescue Plan,
    Treasury’s SSBCI program delivers funding to states, territories,
    and tribal governments that spur lending and investing in small
    businesses, and provides critical technical assistance. So far,
    Treasury has approved [$7.7 billion in
    allocations](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/256/SSBCI-QuarterlyReport-Dec23-2.pdf)
    to 54 states and territories and 25 tribal governments. In addition,
    Treasury [announced a $75 million competitive grant
    program](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Competitive-TA-NOFO-FINAL-Oct-25-2023.pdf)
    for states to provide services to help very small and underserved
    businesses access opportunities created by the President’s Investing
    in America agenda – which includes the historic investments made by
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS
    and Science Act, and American Rescue Plan – by offering them
    technical assistance.  
-   **The Minority Business Development Agency’s (MBDA) Capital
    Readiness Program is investing in small business incubators and
    accelerators.** The MBDA’s Capital Readiness Program awarded $125
    million to [43 non-profit community-based
    organizations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/04/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-to-announce-support-to-help-historically-underserved-entrepreneurs-tap-into-bidenomics-fueled-small-business-boom/) to
    help underserved entrepreneurs launch and scale their small
    businesses. This program, funded through the American Rescue Plan,
    is the largest-ever direct federal investment in small business
    incubators and accelerators of its kind.  
-   **SBA’s Community Navigators Program provides critical technical
    assistance. **In December 2023, the SBA released a
    [report](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/2023-December-SBA%20Community%20Navigator%20Q7%20Snapshot-Public%20Facing-FINAL508.pdf)
    that found that its more than 50 American Rescue Plan-funded
    Community Navigators grantees had already helped to secure more than
    $270 million in approved funding for small businesses, trained over
    350,000 business owners, and conducted 175,000 hours of one-on-one
    counseling. With funding set to expire by the end of this year, the
    Biden-Harris Administration [proposed additional
    funding ](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/mar/09/statement-sba-administrator-guzman-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-budget)for
    the program in its FY24 Budget proposal and has called on Congress
    to continue the program.
