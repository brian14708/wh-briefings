  \ Pay Equity on the 15th Anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay\_Act"
---
 
*New Biden-Harris Administration actions will help close wage gaps and
improve pay transparency for workers.*

President Biden and Vice President Harris have long championed equal pay
as a cornerstone of their commitment to ensuring opportunity and
fairness for all workers. Closing gender and racial wage gaps is
essential to ensuring that women and people of color can fully
participate in the labor force. This past year, the gender pay gap was
the lowest on record. Despite the progress we have made, the fight for
equal pay continues. Today, women workers are still paid on average 84
cents for every dollar paid to men, and the disparities are even greater
for many women of color. These inequities can add up to millions of
dollars lost over the course of a lifetime.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to making the federal
government a model employer and closing persistent wage gaps to help
grow and strengthen our economy. That’s why the President has issued two
Executive Orders aimed at advancing pay equity for both the [federal
workforce](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/)
and [employees of federal
contractors](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/15/executive-order-on-advancing-economy-efficiency-and-effectiveness-in-federal-contracting-by-promoting-pay-equity-and-transparency/).
Today, to implement those Executive Orders, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing new actions to:

-   **Advance pay equity for federal workers.** The Office of Personnel
    Management (OPM) is [issuing a final
    rule](https://www.opm.gov/news/releases/2024/01/release-opm-finalizes-regulation-to-prohibit-use-of-non-federal-salary-history/#:~:text=The%20gender%20pay%20gap%20for,from%2024.5%25%20to%205.6%25.)
    ensuring that more than 80 federal agencies will no longer consider
    an individual’s current or past pay when determining the salaries of
    federal employees. Ending the use of salary history in pay-setting
    decisions is a proven way to help curb pay discrimination that can
    follow workers from job to job and ensure that salaries are based on
    applicants’ skills, experience, and expertise.

<!-- -->

-   **Promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in federal
    contracting by advancing pay equity and pay transparency.** The
    Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council is [issuing a
    proposal](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-01343/acquisition-regulation-pay-equity-and-transparency-in-federal-contracting)
    to prohibit federal contractors and subcontractors from seeking and
    considering information about job applicants’ compensation history
    when hiring or setting pay for personnel working on or in connection
    with a government contract. In addition, the proposal would require
    federal contractors and subcontractors to disclose expected salary
    ranges in job postings, a policy that has been shown to reduce pay
    secrecy, help workers negotiate, and reduce pay gaps. These proposed
    policies would help federal contractors recruit, diversify, and
    retain talent; improve job satisfaction and performance; and reduce
    turnover—all factors associated with promoting the economy,
    efficiency, and effectiveness of the federal contractor workforce.

<!-- -->

-   **Affirm equal pay obligations for federal contractors.** The
    Department of Labor’s (DOL’s) Office of Federal Contract Compliance
    Programs is [issuing
    guidance](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/faqs/compensationhistory)
    clarifying existing protections against discrimination in hiring or
    pay decisions. The new guidance will help federal contractors and
    current and prospective contractor employees understand when
    reliance on an individual’s compensation history for hiring or pay
    decisions may result in unlawful discrimination.

Today’s announcements build on previous actions the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken to close wage gaps and strengthen women’s
economic security, which has led to the lowest unemployment rate among
women since 1953. These actions include:

-   **Ensuring women have access to good-paying jobs being created by
    the President’s Investing in America agenda.** Biden-Harris
    Administration investments through the American Rescue Plan (ARP),
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), CHIPS and Science Act, and
    Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have increased access to good-paying
    jobs, including for women, people of color, and members of other
    communities currently underrepresented in the sectors where these
    jobs are being created, such as clean energy, construction, and
    manufacturing. These include:
    -   **Launching the Good Jobs Initiative.** DOL’s [Good Jobs
        Initiative](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs) provides
        critical information to workers, employers, and government to
        improve job quality, empower workers, and ensure workers,
        especially those from underserved communities, can access good
        union jobs free from discrimination and harassment. The
        Initiative is dedicated to advancing the Departments of Labor
        and Commerce’s [Good Jobs
        Principles](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/principles),
        which address recruitment and hiring, diversity, equity,
        inclusion, and accessibility, and pay. The Departments of
        Transportation, Energy, Commerce, and Interior, as well as the
        Environmental Protection Agency and General Services
        Administration, have signed [memoranda of
        understanding](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/about-us)
        with DOL to support the Good Jobs Initiative, promote equitable
        workforce development, and ensure workers have what they need to
        deliver on the once-in-a-generation Investing in America agenda.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Expanding access to good-paying construction jobs.** To ensure
        women can access the almost 200,000 new construction jobs
        expected from the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic
        investments, the Department of Commerce launched the [Million
        Women in
        Construction](https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2022/10/secretary-raimondo-calls-more-women-construction-industry-nabtu-tradeswomen-build)
        initiative, which calls on chip manufacturers, construction
        companies and unions to bring one million women into the
        construction industry over the next decade, roughly doubling
        women’s representation in the industry. DOL’s Office of Federal
        Contract Compliance Programs also launched the [Mega
        Construction Project (Megaproject)
        Program](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/Mega-Construction-Project-Program),
        which fosters equal opportunity on designated BIL- and
        CHIPS-funded construction projects through intensive
        on-the-ground assistance to remove hiring barriers and promote
        consideration of a diverse pool of qualified workers, including
        women, people of color, veterans, and people with disabilities.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Improving access to child care for the semiconductor workforce
        through CHIPS and Science Act implementation requirements.** The
        Department of Commerce’s
        [implementation](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/02/biden-harris-administration-launches-first-chips-america-funding)
        of the CHIPS and Science Act included a historic requirement
        that applicants requesting over $150 million in direct funding
        submit plans to provide accessible, affordable, high-quality
        child care.

<!-- -->

-   **Increasing access to affordable care and supporting caregivers.**
    Access to affordable, high-quality care is essential to ensuring
    parents, especially moms, can participate fully in the workforce.
    From day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has focused on ways to
    lower child care costs for hardworking families and improve wages
    for child care workers. The ARP Child Care Stabilization program
    delivered historic support to over 225,000 child care programs
    serving as many as 10 million children across the country. Over 90%
    of the child care programs that have received assistance are
    women-owned. The Council of Economic Advisors
    [found](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/07/fact-sheet-historic-biden-harris-administration-investments-in-child-care-recovery-lowered-costs-for-millions-of-families-helped-speed-the-return-to-work-of-hundreds-of-thousands-mothers-and-grew-t/)
    that this stabilization funding supported savings for families with
    young children, raised the real wages of child care workers, and
    helped hundreds of thousands of women with young children enter or
    re-enter the workforce.

In addition, in April 2023, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/)
with more than 50 directives to nearly every cabinet-level agency to
increase access to affordable, high-quality care and boost job quality
for early educators and long-term care workers, who are
disproportionately women of color. Among the many actions agencies have
taken, the Department of Health and Human Services has proposed [key
changes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/11/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-actions-to-lower-child-care-costs-and-support-child-care-providers/)
to federal child care assistance to reduce child care payments for
nearly 80,000 working families.

-   **Increasing the minimum wage.** The President issued [Executive
    Orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-issues-an-executive-order-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-15-for-federal-contractors/) directing
    the Administration to work toward ensuring that employees working on
    federal contracts and federal employees earned a $15 per hour
    minimum wage. Those directives went into effect in January 2022,
    raising the wages of about 370,000 federal employees and employees
    of federal contractors. In addition to helping the government do its
    work more efficiently, these directives take a step towards
    narrowing racial and gender disparities in income, as many low-wage
    workers are women and people of color. The order also eliminates the
    subminimum wage for workers with disabilities on federal
    contracts. The President has called on Congress to raise the federal
    minimum wage to $15 an hour, so that American workers can have a job
    that delivers dignity and to make greater strides towards pay
    equity.

-   **Supporting women-owned businesses and entrepreneurs.** Under the
    Biden-Harris Administration, Small Business Administration-backed
    loans to women-owned small businesses are up more than 60 percent,
    totaling $5.1 billion in lending to women-owned businesses in
    FY23.And a new
    [report](https://newsroom.wf.com/English/news-releases/news-release-details/2024/New-Report-Finds-Growth-of-Women-Business-Owners-Outpaces-the-Market/default.aspx#:~:text=From%202019%20to%202023%2C%20women,in%20revenue%20to%20the%20economy.)
    out this month found that from 2019 to 2023, women’s small business
    formation surged, substantially outpacing overall formation. This
    Administration has invested nearly $70 million in the [Women
    Business
    Centers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-resources-to-support-women-small-businesses-owners-continued-commitment-to-supporting-americas-entrepreneurs/)
    (WBC) network, expanding it for the first time into all 50 states
    and tripling the number of WBCs at Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and other
    minority-serving institutions. President Biden also invested $10
    billion through the ARP [State Small Business Credit
    Initiative](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/small-business-programs/state-small-business-credit-initiative-ssbci) (SSBCI)
    to help States, territories, and Tribal governments leverage tens of
    billions more in matching public and private dollars to support
    small businesses across the United States, with a particular focus
    on historically underserved entrepreneurs, including women business
    owners. The ARP Restaurant Revitalization Fund helped over 40,000
    women-owned restaurants and bars—thanks in part to steps taken by
    the Administration to ensure that women-owned and socially and
    economically disadvantaged businesses were able to access
    assistance.
