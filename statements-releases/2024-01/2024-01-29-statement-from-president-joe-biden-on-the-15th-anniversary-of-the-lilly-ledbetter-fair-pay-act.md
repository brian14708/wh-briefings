title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 15th Anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter\
  \ Fair Pay\_Act"
---
 
Fifteen years ago today, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became the law
of the land, in a landmark victory in the fight for equal pay. Lilly
worked hard, with dignity and pride, only to find that for years she had
been paid less than her male coworkers. This needed to change. This law,
the first bill signed during the Obama-Biden Administration, expanded
important protections against pay discrimination, and was named after
her in recognition of her long fight for equal pay.

Despite this progress, the fight for equal pay continues. Women workers
are still paid on average 84 cents for every dollar paid to men, and the
disparities are even greater for many women of color. Today, my
Administration is taking new actions to advance pay equity for the
federal workforce and employees of federal contractors. These new
actions adopt commonsense policies that will help pay millions of
workers fairly, close gender and racial wage gaps, and yield tangible
benefits for the federal government and federal contractors. These
policies are good for workers, our economy, and for families.

In addition, my Administration will continue to call on Congress to pass
the Paycheck Fairness Act, to increase pay transparency and strengthen
our tools to fight sex-based pay discrimination. Today and every day,
Vice President Harris and I remain committed to building on the promise
of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and strengthening the economic
security of women across the country.
