*President Biden to visit East Palestine, Ohio in February*

 One year ago, on February 3, 2023, a Norfolk Southern train carrying
hazardous chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, jeopardizing the
community’s safety and sense of normalcy. Since the derailment, the
Biden-Harris Administration has mobilized a comprehensive,
whole-of-government response to support the people of East Palestine,
Ohio, affected communities in Pennsylvania, and other impacted
communities. **<u>In February, President Biden will travel to East
Palestine, Ohio, to meet with residents impacted by the Norfolk Southern
train derailment</u>**, discuss Federal support to the community, and
hold Norfolk Southern accountable.  
   
Under President Biden’s leadership, within hours of the derailment, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) deployed a team of trained
emergency response personnel to East Palestine to aid state and local
emergency and environmental response efforts. The Department of
Transportation (DOT) also arrived on scene within hours to support the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in their independent
investigation of the derailment. The Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) worked alongside state and local health departments to
conduct public health testing and offer technical assistance. Throughout
the response and recovery process, the Administration has continued to
closely coordinate with the Ohio Governor, the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection and Department of Health and local partners, including the
Village of East Palestine and Columbiana County.  
   
As President Biden has said from the beginning, the Administration will
continue to support the people of East Palestine and other affected
communities for as long as it takes, including by using every available
tool to hold Norfolk Southern accountable. President Biden pledged he
would make Norfolk Southern clean up its mess in East Palestine, and his
Administration is delivering. Last February, EPA ordered Norfolk
Southern to clean up all environmental damage caused by the derailment,
including cleaning or disposing of contaminated soil and water, as well
as reimbursing the Federal government’s response costs. In September,
President Biden issued an [Executive
Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-to-protect-people-in-east-palestine-ohio-and-nearby-communities-and-continue-to-hold-norfolk-southern-accountable/)
directing that Norfolk Southern continue to be held accountable for the
derailment and address any long-term effects on the community, and to
ensure Federal assistance is available to affected communities should
needs develop that are not met by Norfolk Southern.  
   
At the same time, the Administration has taken action to improve rail
safety and continues to call on Congress to do its part by passing the
Bipartisan Railway Safety Act.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to the people of East
Palestine, impacted communities in Pennsylvania, and other affected
communities, and to holding Norfolk Southern accountable, with each
Federal agency playing a critical role in the long-term recovery
effort:  
   
**<u>Environmental Protection Agency</u>**

-   **Holding Norfolk Southern Accountable.** On February 21, 2023, EPA
    issued a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
    Liability Act (CERCLA) unilateral administrative order holding
    Norfolk Southern accountable to clean up the mess it created. Since
    then, EPA has directed and overseen the extensive cleanup activities
    conducted by Norfolk Southern.  
      
    On October 18, 2023, EPA issued an Administrative Order under the
    Clean Water Act to Norfolk Southern requiring the company to remove
    sediments in culverted areas of Sulphur Run stream, and to further
    delineate, characterize, and, as necessary, remove oil and hazardous
    substances from the sediments in Leslie and Sulphur Run streams.
    Sediment and sheen sampling efforts required by the Order are
    complete, and cleanup is complete in four of five culverts.
    Additional cleanup in Sulphur and Leslie Runs will begin in early
    2024.  
-   **Ensuring the Cleanup is Done Right.** The EPA coordinated the
    oversight of Norfolk Southern’s soil remediation of the derailment
    site. The remediation included testing of the soils within and
    immediately surrounding the impacted areas for hazardous materials,
    and ensuring the site is cleaned up to meet Federal and state
    regulations.  
      
    On October 30, 2023, excavation of contaminated soil from the
    derailment site was completed, reaching one of the most significant
    goals of the cleanup. Ultimately, more than 176,000 tons (more than
    350 million pounds) of contaminated soil were excavated and
    transported out of East Palestine for appropriate disposal. The
    final site-wide confirmation soil sampling effort – a final
    doublecheck to ensure that the cleanup has been fully successful,
    and that no contamination has spread due to cleanup activities – is
    underway and will continue through mid-2024.  
      
    Additionally, CERCLA hazardous substances have not impacted water in
    surface streams since mid-May. Weekly drinking water samples from
    the municipal water system and over 1,200 private well samples have
    consistently shown no impacts from the derailment and municipal
    water continues to meet drinking water safety standards.  
-   **Monitoring Air Quality.** Since the derailment, EPA has collected
    more than 115 million air monitoring data points and more than
    45,000 samples (air, water and soil) in and around the community. No
    sustained air monitoring readings or analytical results for the
    contaminants of concern (vinyl chloride, n-butyl acrylate, and over
    70 additional monitored chemicals) have been found above action
    levels established for the site since the evacuation order was
    lifted on February 8, 2023. Air monitoring in the community
    continues as appropriate at site activities to assure protection of
    the community. Ongoing science-based monitoring continues to show
    that residents of East Palestine are not at risk from impacted
    surface water, soil, or air from the derailment.  
-   **Supporting the Local Community.** Engagement with the surrounding
    communities and with State and local leaders continues to be a
    priority for EPA. Representatives from Ohio EPA, the Village of East
    Palestine and Columbiana County are members of the Unified Command
    for the cleanup. In addition, Ohio EPA is actively involved with
    assisting with oversight of the cleanup, primarily with groundwater,
    potable water, streams, on-site wastewater treatment and final soil
    sampling efforts. EPA’s Welcome Center in downtown East Palestine
    remains open and available to answer questions from residents by
    appointment. Residents can still call the information line or send
    an email to talk to a representative during business hours. To
    ensure the affected communities are receiving the most up-to-date
    information as rapidly as possible, the EPA updates its
    [website](https://www.epa.gov/east-palestine-oh-train-derailment) on
    cleanup progress several times each week; hosts recurring community
    stakeholder meetings to communicate and actively listen to community
    concerns; and keeps the community informed through the regular print
    newsletter, now published on a monthly basis, that reaches around
    9,000 homes. EPA remains committed to the people of East Palestine
    and surrounding area, to the successful completion of the cleanup,
    and to the revitalization of the community.  
-   **Prioritizing Chemical Safety.** On December 14, 2023, EPA
    announced it began the process of prioritizing vinyl chloride, one
    of the primary chemicals of concern involved in the derailment, for
    a risk evaluation under the nation’s premier chemical safety law,
    the Toxic Substances Control Act.

**Department of Transportation**

-   **Investigating the Cause of the Derailment.**  The NTSB, which is
    independent of the DOT, is leading the investigation into the cause
    of the derailment. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the
    Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)
    within DOT were on site within hours of the derailment and continue
    to support the NTSB-led investigation.  
-   **Creating a Safer Rail System.** In 2023, DOT deployed a historic
    level of funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law to modernize and upgrade fail infrastructure. Grants through
    programs including the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety
    Improvements (CRISI) program, the new Railroad Crossing Elimination
    (RCE) program, and Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing
    (RRIF) program to support both passenger and freight rail projects,
    including track improvements, bridge replacements and
    rehabilitations, highway-rail grade crossing eliminations, upgrades
    on routes carrying hazardous materials, and more.  In June 2023,
    through the first-ever RCE grants, DOT awarded $570 million to 32
    states to eliminate or improve more than 400 at-grade crossings
    nationwide — making our roads and railways safer, while also helping
    countless Americans save time on their commutes.  In September 2023,
    DOT awarded more than $1.4 billion in Consolidated Rail
    Infrastructure and Safety Improvement (CRISI) grants to 70 projects
    to make passenger and freight rail safer – the largest investment
    ever through the program.  
-   **Ensuring Compliance with Rail Safety Regulations. ** The FRA
    initiated multiple inspection programs in 2023 that were focused on
    tank cars and routes transporting large amounts of hazardous
    materials. FRA completed a focused inspection and investigation of
    over 40,000 freight cars, 76,888 miles of track, and thousands of
    wayside detectors on 28 different railroads. Wayside detectors are
    devices that are fixed near tracks to scan passing trains for
    defects. FRA is taking action based on these findings, and the
    inspections completed are prompting railroads to take corrective
    actions to increase safety. FRA also conducted a safety assessment
    of Norfolk Southern’s safety practices, pressed for improvements,
    and is in the process of conducting comprehensive assessments of the
    safety culture, practices, and regulatory compliance of each Class I
    railroad.  
-   **Protecting First Responders.** PHMSA invested more than $30
    million to support firefighters, and local hazardous materials
    safety planning and response efforts. Thousands of responders
    nationwide have received training thanks to this program, including
    2,500+ responders in 137 different locations in Ohio. PHMSA also
    proposed a new rule to require railroads to always maintain — and
    update in real-time — accurate, electronic information about rail
    hazmat shipments that would be accessible to authorized emergency
    response personnel. Railroads would also be required to proactively
    share that information to authorized local first response personnel
    as soon as the railroad is aware of an accident involving any
    hazardous materials.    
-   **Supporting Rail Workers:** Before the Biden-Harris Administration,
    most workers didn’t have paid sick leave and instead kept working,
    which is a safety issue. The Administration has pressed railroads to
    provide paid sick leave – and now over 88% of Class I freight rail
    workers do. Last week, FRA [issued a Final
    Rule](https://railroads.dot.gov/about-fra/communications/newsroom/press-releases/federal-railroad-administration-issues-final-0)
    requiring railroads to provide emergency escape breathing apparatus
    to train crews and other employees when transporting certain
    hazardous materials. And last year, DOT called on the Class 1
    freight railroads to join the Confidential Close Call System. Since
    that call, Norfolk Southern became the first to participate with
    about 1,000 of its employees, and DOT continues to press all others
    to join the program so all rail workers can report issues without
    fear of reprisal.

**Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)**

-   Following the derailment, FEMA provided immediate technical and
    operational assistance to EPA, Federal partners and the Ohio
    Emergency Management Agency, including providing incident management
    expertise and community outreach support to the multi-agency
    response and recovery effort. At its peak, FEMA had 70 full-time and
    reserve staff on the ground in East Palestine to support the
    effort.  
-   Pursuant to President Biden’s Executive Order, FEMA designated a
    Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator, who arrived on the ground
    within days to oversee the long-term recovery efforts in East
    Palestine.  The Coordinator continues to work with local officials,
    State and Federal partners, and Norfolk Southern to address the
    community’s enduring concerns related to the derailment.  The
    Coordinator will provide a comprehensive Federal assessment
    regarding any needs not met by Norfolk Southern using inputs
    gathered from the community itself and Federal partners. The
    Coordinator meets regularly with representatives from the Village
    Council, County Emergency Management, and Federal partners with the
    intent of delivering on the Biden-Harris Administration’s promise to
    support the full recovery of the East Palestine community and its
    residents.

**Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**  
  
The health and well-being of those impacted by the derailment is an
ongoing priority for the Biden-Harris Administration. As required by
President Biden’s Executive Order, HHS will provide technical assistance
to the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania in the event that either State
considers submitting a proposal for services through the Medicaid
program for individuals affected by the derailment, such as an
experimental, pilot, or demonstration project. In coordination with the
affected States, HHS will continue to monitor the public health
consequences of the derailment, including any long-term health issues in
the affected communities.

-   **Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR)  
    **
    -   ASPR developed detailed recommendations on strategies to address
        the behavioral health impact of the derailment on the East
        Palestine community and provided these written recommendations
        to the Responsible Party at the request of FEMA. In December
        2023, disaster behavioral health (DBH) and disaster recovery
        SME’s from ASPR’s Office of Response met with the FEMA’s Federal
        Coordinator and representatives of the Responsible Party to
        brief on the recommendations, which are evidence-informed based
        on the current state of science about the effects of
        technological disasters on population behavioral health and are
        actionable but require funding from the Responsible Party.  
-   **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / Agency for
    Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)  
    **
    -   CDC/ATSDR deployed a public health team to East Palestine on
        February 20, 2023, to provide additional technical assistance at
        the request of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Health Departments. The
        team provided support in the following areas: the Assessment of
        Chemical Exposure (ACE) investigation for residents and first
        responders; health communications coordination; partner
        coordination; and environmental data technical assistance.
        CDC/ATSDR Region 3 and 5 directors continue to participate in
        bi-weekly Public Health Unit calls with EPA, Ohio Department of
        Health, Pennsylvania Department of Health, and the Columbiana
        County Health Department and continue to provide relevant
        updates to State and local partners as well as answers to health
        questions from regulatory partners and the public.   
-   **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)  
      
    **
    -   CMS, through the Center for Medicaid and the Children’s Health
        Insurance Program (CHIP), has engaged with the States of Ohio
        and Pennsylvania to offer support and assistance following the
        train derailment through the Medicaid program. Following that
        engagement, Ohio submitted, and CMS approved, a State Plan
        Amendment (SPA) to implement a policy to help preserve Medicaid
        eligibility for individuals impacted by the train derailment.
        Specifically, the SPA ensured that, effective April 1, 2023, any
        compensation paid by Norfolk Southern to individuals affected by
        the accident would be disregarded from their income for purposes
        of determining eligibility for Medicaid. CMS remains in regular
        contact with both states regarding the operation of their
        Medicaid programs.  
-   **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
      
    **
    -   Beginning March 13, 2023, the FDA initiated an Incident
        Management Group (IMG) to respond to the train derailment, which
        included representatives from the agency’s human and animal
        foods programs. The IMG cooperated closely with the EPA, U.S.
        Department of Agriculture, the Unified Command Group leading the
        response, state and local entities, academia and regulated
        industry in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The IMG analyzed relevant
        data and information on chemical food safety hazards, including
        the release of vinyl chloride, reviewed results of soil samples,
        and confirmed the disposition or destruction of food products
        involved in the incident. FDA reviewed the results of soil
        samples collected and analyzed by EPA, Norfolk Southern, and the
        State of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for
        semi-volatile organic compounds.  
-   **Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)  
      
    **
    -   In the aftermath of the, train derailment, HRSA took action to
        support two neighboring community health centers, Community
        Action Agency of Columbiana (CAAC), in Lisbon, Ohio, and Primary
        Health Network (PHN), in Sharon, Pennsylvania, as they stepped
        in to deliver primary care services to address unmet need and
        supplement the efforts of local providers. On March 3, 2023,
        HRSA provided CAAC with $250,000 in emergency funding to provide
        screening and supportive services via their mobile unit in
        partnership with a local community partner, First Church of
        Christ. The one-time funding allowed CAAC to conduct outreach,
        purchase medical supplies, and staff the mobile unit with key
        health care personnel, including nurse practitioners, medical
        assistants, and administrative support staff who provided toxic
        chemical screenings, mental health assessments and referrals,
        case management, and housing referrals.  
-   **National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Institute of
    Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)  
    **
    -   In November 2023, NIEHS, with support from CDC/ATSDR,
        commissioned the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
        and Medicine to hold a two-day public workshop on community
        questions and concerns about chemical exposures and health
        impacts in East Palestine. NIEHS also
        [published](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/sites/default/files/research/atniehs/assets/docs/east_palestine_report_508.pdf)
        a [rapid scoping
        review](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/sites/default/files/research/atniehs/assets/docs/east_palestine_report_508.pdf)
        of chemicals of interest to the derailment to assess available
        health effects information.   
-   **Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
    (SAMHSA)**
    -   Following the train derailment, SAMHSA met and coordinated with
        officials in both Ohio and Pennsylvania regarding support for
        impacted residents in both states.  
    -   In particular, with technical assistance from SAMHSA, both
        states applied for and were awarded a SAMHSA Emergency Response
        Grant which will support the immediate and ongoing behavioral
        health needs of the community related to the initial incident
        and subsequent traumatic experiences, help minimize the
        long-term impacts and foster resilience in the community, and
        expand and enhance the capacity of local crisis response systems
        to ensure adequate and effective intervention in situations of
        crisis.  
    -   The Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, in
        partnership with the Columbiana County Mental Health and
        Recovery Services Board, was awarded $1,088,911 to address major
        behavioral health issues identified by the community because of
        the February 3 train derailment.  
    -   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Department of Human Services,
        Beaver County Behavioral Health, and representatives from the
        Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency were awarded $47,488 to
        address major behavioral health issues identified by the
        community because of the February 3 train derailment/chemical
        spill.

**U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)**

-   USDA Rural Development obligated $500,000 in Rural Business
    Development Grant award funding to create a low-interest revolving
    loan fund for businesses in East Palestine, Ohio. USDA also added
    the Village of East Palestine as an eligible community on an
    existing Rural Community Development Initiative (RCDI) award.
