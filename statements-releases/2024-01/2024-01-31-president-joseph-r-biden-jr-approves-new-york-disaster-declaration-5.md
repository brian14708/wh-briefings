exists in the State of New York and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storm and flooding in the counties of
Kings, Nassau, and Westchester.  
   
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.
