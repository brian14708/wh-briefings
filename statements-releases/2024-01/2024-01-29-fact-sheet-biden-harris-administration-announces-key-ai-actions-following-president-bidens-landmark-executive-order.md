title: "Fact Sheet: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Key AI Actions Following\
  \ President\_Biden\u2019s Landmark Executive\_Order"
---
 
Three months ago, President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order to
ensure that America leads the way in seizing the promise and managing
the risks of artificial intelligence (AI). The Order directed sweeping
action to strengthen AI safety and security, protect Americans’ privacy,
advance equity and civil rights, stand up for consumers and workers,
promote innovation and competition, advance American leadership around
the world, and more.

Today, Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed will convene the White House AI
Council, consisting of top officials from a wide range of federal
departments and agencies. Agencies reported that they have completed all
of the 90-day actions tasked by the E.O. and advanced other vital
directives that the Order tasked over a longer timeframe.  

Taken together, these activities mark substantial progress in achieving
the EO’s mandate to protect Americans from the potential risks of AI
systems while catalyzing innovation in AI and beyond. Visit

**<u>Managing Risks to Safety and Security</u>**

**The Executive Order directed a sweeping range of actions within 90
days to address some of AI’s biggest threats to safety and security.**
These included setting key disclosure requirements for developers of the
most powerful systems, assessing AI’s risks for critical infrastructure,
and hindering foreign actors’ efforts to develop AI for harmful
purposes. **To mitigate these and other risks, agencies have:**

-   **Used Defense Production Act authorities to compel developers of
    the most powerful AI systems to report vital information, especially
    AI safety test results, to the Department of Commerce.** These
    companies now must share this information on the most powerful AI
    systems, and they must likewise report large computing clusters able
    to train these systems.

<!-- -->

-   **Proposed a draft rule that proposes to compel U.S. cloud companies
    that provide computing power for foreign AI training to report that
    they are doing so.** The Department of Commerce’s proposal would, if
    finalized as proposed, require cloud providers to alert the
    government when foreign clients train the most powerful models,
    which could be used for malign activity.

<!-- -->

-   **Completed risk assessments covering AI’s use in every critical
    infrastructure sector.** Nine agencies—including the Department of
    Defense, the Department of Transportation, the Department of
    Treasury, and Department of Health and Human Services—submitted
    their risk assessments to the Department of Homeland Security. These
    assessments, which will be the basis for continued federal action,
    ensure that the United States is ahead of the curve in integrating
    AI safely into vital aspects of society, such as the electric grid.

**<u>Innovating AI for Good</u>**

To seize AI’s enormous promise and deepen the U.S. lead in AI
innovation, President Biden’s Executive Order directed increased
investment in AI innovation and new efforts to attract and train workers
with AI expertise. Over the past 90 days, agencies have:

-   **Launched a pilot of the** [**National AI Research
    Resource**](https://nairrpilot.org/)**—catalyzing broad-based
    innovation, competition, and more equitable access to AI research.**
    The pilot, managed by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), is
    the first step toward a national infrastructure for delivering
    computing power, data, software, access to open and proprietary AI
    models, and other AI training resources to researchers and students.
    These resources come from 11 federal-agency partners and more than
    25 private sector, nonprofit, and philanthropic partners.

-   **Launched an AI Talent Surge to accelerate hiring AI professionals
    across the federal government, including through a large-scale
    hiring action for data scientists.** TheAI and Tech Talent Task
    Force created by President Biden’s E.O. has spearheaded this hiring
    action and is coordinating other key initiatives to facilitate
    hiring AI talent. The Office of Personnel Management has granted
    flexible hiring authorities for federal agencies to hire AI talent,
    including [direct hire authorities and excepted service
    authorities](https://chcoc.gov/content/government-wide-hiring-authorities-advancing-federal-government-use-artificial-intelligence).
    Government-wide tech talent programs, including the Presidential
    Innovation Fellows, U.S. Digital Corps, and U.S. Digital Service,
    have scaled up hiring for AI talent in 2024 across high-priority AI
    projects. More information about the AI Talent Surge is available at
    [ai.gov/apply](https://ai.gov/apply/).  
-   **Began the EducateAI initiative to help fund educators creating
    high-quality, inclusive AI educational opportunities at the K-12
    through undergraduate levels.** The initiative’s launch helps
    fulfill the Executive Order’s charge for NSF to prioritize
    AI-related workforce development—essential for advancing future AI
    innovation and ensuring that all Americans can benefit from the
    opportunities that AI creates.

<!-- -->

-   **Announced the funding of new Regional Innovation Engines (NSF
    Engines), including with a focus on advancing AI.** For example,
    with an initial investment of $15 million over two years and up to
    $160 million over the next decade, the Piedmont Triad Regenerative
    Medicine Engine will tap the world’s largest regenerative medicine
    cluster to create and scale breakthrough clinical therapies,
    including by leveraging AI.  The announcement supports the Executive
    Order’s directive for NSF to fund and launch AI-focused NSF Engines
    within 150 days.

<!-- -->

-   **Established an AI Task Force at the Department of Health and Human
    Services to develop policies to provide regulatory clarity and
    catalyze AI innovation in health care.** The Task Force will, for
    example, develop methods of evaluating AI-enabled tools and
    frameworks for AI’s use to advance drug development, bolster public
    health, and improve health care delivery. Already, the Task Force
    coordinated work to publish [guiding
    principles](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/12/15/guiding-principles-help-healthcare-community-address-potential-bias-resulting-from-algorithms.html)
    for addressing racial biases in healthcare algorithms.

The table below summarizes many of the activities federal agencies have
completed in response to the Executive Order.
