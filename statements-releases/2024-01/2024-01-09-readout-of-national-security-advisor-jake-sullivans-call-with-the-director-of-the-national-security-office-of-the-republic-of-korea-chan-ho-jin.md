title: "Readout of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s Call with the Director\
  \ of the National Security Office of the Republic of Korea Chang\_Hojin"
---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan held an introductory call with
Director Chang Hojin, his new counterpart at the Republic of Korea’s
National Security Office, on January 9 to discuss developments related
to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), including its
increasing military cooperation with Russia and the provocative actions
it has taken along the demilitarized zone.

The two officials condemned in the strongest possible terms the DPRK’s
transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia and Russia’s use of these
missiles against Ukraine. They noted that the transfer and use of these
weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, violates
multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, undermines the
global non-proliferation regime, and has significant security
implications for Europe, the Korean Peninsula, and the Indo-Pacific
region.

In light of growing DPRK-Russia cooperation, the two officials committed
to continuing close cooperation in support of Ukraine and the Ukrainian
people. They also committed to maintain close collaboration on shared
security challenges to bolster peace and security across the
Indo-Pacific region and around the globe.
