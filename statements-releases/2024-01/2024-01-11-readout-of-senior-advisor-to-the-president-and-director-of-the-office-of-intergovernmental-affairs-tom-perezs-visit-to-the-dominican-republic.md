Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs Tom Perez travelled to the Dominican Republic
January 8-10 to build on the November 2 discussions between President
Joe Biden and President Luis Abinader on economic cooperation,
combatting climate change, and addressing the humanitarian and security
crisis in Haiti. Senior Advisor Perez was joined by Special Assistant to
the President and Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere at the
National Security Council Juan González.  During their meeting with
President Abinader, Senior Advisor Perez reiterated the United States’
commitment to strengthening regional economic cooperation under the
Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity (APEP) and recognized the
Dominican Republic’s leadership in the initiative. He also briefed
President Abinader on the robust international support for the
Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support Mission to Haiti. During a
separate meeting with Labor Minister Luis Miguel de Camps, Senior
Advisor Perez discussed our collaboration to generate sustainable
economic development and opportunities for the people of the Dominican
Republic.  
   
Senior Advisor Perez also visited one of the forty Dominican clinics
that receive support to respond to HIV through the U.S. President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – in the last 15 years, the
Dominican Republic has received more than US$250 million through PEPFAR.
The Senior Advisor also met with private sector executives to promote
the expansion of the commercial relationship between the United States
and the Dominican Republic, and with civil society members to discuss
issues related to democratic values, human rights, and labor rights.
