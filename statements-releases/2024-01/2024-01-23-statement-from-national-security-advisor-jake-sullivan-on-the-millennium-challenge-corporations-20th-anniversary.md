  \ Corporation\u2019s 20th\_Anniversary"

Today, on the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the creation of the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), I commend the entire MCC team
for the tremendous impact they have had on the lives of millions of
people around the world through their innovative, cost-effective,
data-driven development model. MCC’s novel approach is one based on
partnership, in which it partners with low-income and lower-middle
income countries that share a commitment to good governance, democracy,
and investing in their people, to tackle key constraints to growth. Over
the past 20 years, MCC has made critical investments to support farmers
and strengthen food systems; unlocked critical policy reforms;
strengthened the delivery of essential health services; built
educational facilities and supported training opportunities for
educators, healthcare workers, and nearly half a million students; and
invested billions of dollars in climate-resilient infrastructure,
including roads, water and sanitation, energy, and agriculture-related
infrastructure in countries around the world. With strong bipartisan
support from Congress, MCC has delivered nearly $17 billion in aid to 47
low-income and lower-middle income countries across six continents,
lifted more than 300 million people out of poverty, generated economic
growth in hard-to-reach communities, and strengthened democratic
institutions across five continents. MCC’s projects have left a lasting
and monumental impact on every community they have touched. I look
forward to seeing the positive impact this model of development will
have on millions more people in the years to come.
