title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Stopping Over 500 Illegal Under-21\
  \ Gun Purchases Through the Bipartisan Safer Communities\_Act"
---
 
Today is an important milestone in the fight to end the epidemic of gun
violence tearing the fabric of our nation apart. Thanks to the enhanced
background checks enacted by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the
Justice Department has now successfully denied more than 500 illegal gun
purchases by people under 21 years old who presented a danger to our
communities.  
   
This historic legislation is working to keep guns out of the hands
of young people who shouldn’t have them in the first place, for common
sense reasons like criminal records or because they have been determined
to be a danger to themselves or others. By interrupting these illegal
gun purchases, we are taking action to stop suicides, deadly domestic
violence, and mass shootings. Simply put: this legislation is saving
lives. And it’s part of my broader plan to reduce crime and make our
communities safer, including through my American Rescue Plan, which
enabled cities and states to invest $15 billion to improve public
safety. There’s more work to do, but we’re making real progress: there
was a significant drop in crime in 2023 – including one of the
largest-ever yearly declines in homicides in history.  
   
I am proud to have taken more executive action than any president in
history to combat gun violence in America, and I will never stop
fighting to get even more done.  Congress must enact universal
background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, end
the gun industry’s immunity from liability, and pass a national red flag
law. There are already too many empty seats around family tables. It is
fully within our power to stop this epidemic.
