Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff will travel to Davos, Switzerland, from
January 17 to January 20 to attend the World Economic Forum Annual
Meeting 2024. Throughout his engagements, the Second Gentleman will
highlight the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to countering the
global rise of Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and hate of all kinds. He
will also participate in events focused on promoting gender equity and
protecting women’s rights. Mr. Emhoff will meet with foreign government
officials and private sector leaders to discuss these issues.    
   
This trip builds on the Second Gentleman’s leadership on combating hate,
fostering unity and collaboration, and tackling gender inequality.
