title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on December PCE\_Report"
---
 
We learned this morning that inflation was at the pre-pandemic benchmark
of 2 percent over the last six months of 2023. That’s an important
milestone that means more breathing room for working families.

Our economy grew by more than 3 percent in 2023, while inflation has
been at 2 percent in the second half of the year, and unemployment
remained below 4 percent for a second year. This means significant
progress for American workers—with wages, wealth, and
employment all higher than they were four years ago. As more Americans
are feeling more confident about the economy, I remain laser focused on
doing everything in my power to lower costs for families and fight back
against extreme Republican efforts to hand out massive giveaways to the
wealthy and large corporations, while raising the costs of prescription
drugs and cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
