title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Reported Strikes at UNRWA\
  \ Facility in Southern\_Gaza"
---
 
We are gravely concerned by reports today of strikes hitting a UN Relief
and Works Agency (UNRWA) facility — with subsequent reports of fires in
the building—in a neighborhood in southern Gaza where more than 30,000
displaced Palestinians had reportedly been sheltering. While we don’t
yet have all the details on what happened and will continue to seek
further information regarding today’s incidents, the loss of every
innocent life is a tragedy. This conflict has already resulted in the
devastating deaths and injuries of tens of thousands of Palestinian
civilians, and we mourn every single civilian life that has been lost.
It’s heartbreaking to see children killed, injured, and orphaned. The
United States is unwavering in our support for Israel’s right to defend
itself, consistent with international humanitarian law, against Hamas
terrorists who hide among the civilian population and want to annihilate
the State of Israel. But Israel retains a responsibility to protect
civilians, including, humanitarian personnel and sites. And, as
President Biden has been clear from the earliest days of this crisis,
the United States will also continue working to increase life-saving
humanitarian assistance into Gaza and to bring home all of the hostages
held there.
