title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Historic 20 Million Enrollees in Affordable\
  \ Care Act Health\_Care"
---
 
Today, we hit a major milestone in lowering costs and ensuring all
Americans have access to quality, affordable health care: a
record-breaking 20 million Americans have enrolled in health care
coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. With six days
left to still get covered, 8 million more Americans have signed up for
ACA coverage than when I took office.  
   
The Affordable Care Act is more popular than ever, and Affordable Care
Act coverage is more affordable than ever. Thanks to efforts by my
Administration, millions of Americans are saving hundreds or thousands
of dollars each year on health insurance premiums, and most people who
shop for coverage at HealthCare.gov can find a plan for $10 a month or
less.  
   
We must build upon this progress and make these lower health care
premiums permanent. But extreme Republicans have blocked these efforts
at every turn. Their plan would raise costs for millions of people,
especially older Americans and small business owners who rely on the
marketplace for their coverage, by repealing the improvements I signed
into law. In fact, they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, just as
my predecessor tried and failed to do, which would strip these 20
million people of their coverage, end Medicaid coverage for millions
more, and return to the days when insurance companies had free reign to
deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions and charge women more
than men.   
   
That would be a catastrophe for families who would face skyrocketing
health care costs. I won’t let it happen on my watch. As too many
Americans know: access to quality, affordable health care can mean the
difference between life and death, and hope and fear. That’s why I will
continue fighting to bring down health care and prescription drug costs.
I encourage Americans to visit HealthCare.gov before January 16th to
sign up for health coverage this year.
