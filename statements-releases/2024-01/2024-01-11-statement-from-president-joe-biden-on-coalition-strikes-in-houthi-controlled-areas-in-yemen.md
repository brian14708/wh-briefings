title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Coalition Strikes in Houthi-Controlled\
  \ Areas in\_Yemen"

Today, at my direction, U.S. military forces—together with the United
Kingdom and with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the
Netherlands—successfully conducted strikes against a number of targets
in Yemen used by Houthi rebels to endanger freedom of navigation in one
of the world’s most vital waterways.  
   
These strikes are in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks
against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea—including the use
of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history. These
attacks have endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners, and our
partners, jeopardized trade, and threatened freedom of navigation. More
than 50 nations have been affected in 27 attacks on international
commercial shipping. Crews from more than 20 countries have been
threatened or taken hostage in acts of piracy.  More than 2,000 ships
have been forced to divert thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea—which
can cause weeks of delays in product shipping times. And on January 9,
Houthis launched their largest attack to date—directly targeting
American ships.  
   
The response of the international community to these reckless attacks
has been united and resolute. Last month, the United States launched
Operation Prosperity Guardian—a coalition of more than 20 nations
committed to defending international shipping and deterring Houthi
attacks in the Red Sea.  We also joined more than 40 nations in
condemning Houthi threats. Last week, together with 13 allies and
partners, we issued an unequivocal warning that Houthi rebels would bear
the consequences if their attacks did not cease. And yesterday, the
United Nations Security Council passed a resolution demanding the
Houthis end attacks on merchant and commercial vessels.  
   
Today’s defensive action follows this extensive diplomatic campaign and
Houthi rebels’ escalating attacks against commercial vessels. These
targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our
partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile
actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most
critical commercial routes. I will not hesitate to direct further
measures to protect our people and the free flow of international
commerce as necessary.
