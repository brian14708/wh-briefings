title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 51st Anniversary of Roe v.\_Wade"
---
 
Fifty-one years ago today, the Supreme Court recognized a woman’s
constitutional right to make deeply personal decisions with her
doctor—free from the interference of politicians. Then, a year and a
half ago, the Court made the extreme decision to overturn *Roe *and take
away a constitutional right. As a result, tens of millions of women now
live in states with extreme and dangerous abortion bans. Because of
Republican elected officials, women’s health and lives are at risk. In
states across the country, women are being turned away from emergency
rooms, forced to go to court to seek permission for the medical
attention they need, and made to travel hundreds of miles for health
care.

Even as Americans—from Ohio to Kentucky to Michigan to Kansas to
California—have resoundingly rejected attempts to limit reproductive
freedom, Republican elected officials continue to push for a national
ban and devastating new restrictions across the country. 

On this day and every day, Vice President Harris and I are fighting to
protect women’s reproductive freedom against Republicans officials’
dangerous, extreme, and out-of-touch agenda. We stand with the vast
majority of Americans who support a woman’s right to choose, and
continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of *Roe* in
federal law once and for all.
