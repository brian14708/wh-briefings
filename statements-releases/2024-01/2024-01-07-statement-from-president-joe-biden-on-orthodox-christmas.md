Jill and I wish Orthodox Christians in the United States and around the
world a blessed Christmas. During this sacred season, we remember the
miracle of Jesus Christ’s birth and the transformational love He
brought to our world. 

This year, we are keeping the many Orthodox Christian communities in
war-torn regions of our globe close to our hearts. Every human being is
created in the image of God and deserves to be treated with dignity and
respect. We mourn every innocent life lost and continue
to counter persecution and discrimination against any group because
of who they are, what they believe, or how they practice their faith.

We are grateful for the invaluable contributions that the Orthodox
Christian community makes to our own country and to nations around the
world, and we join together in praying for peace in the year ahead.
