President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin
Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar. The two leaders discussed the ongoing war in
Gaza and their efforts to secure the immediate release of all remaining
hostages held by Hamas. Both leaders affirmed that a hostage deal is
central to establishing a prolonged humanitarian pause
in the fighting and ensure additional life-saving
humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout Gaza. They
underscored the urgency of the situation, and welcomed the close
cooperation among their teams to advance recent discussions.  Both
leaders committed to staying engaged until all hostages are reunited
with their families and reaffirmed their shared vision of a peaceful,
secure, and integrated Middle East region.
