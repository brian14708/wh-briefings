  \ Overdraft\_Fees"

When companies sneak hidden junk fees into families’ bills, it can take
hundreds of dollars a month out of their pockets and make it harder to
make ends meet. That might not matter to the wealthy, but it’s real
money to hardworking families—and it’s just plain wrong. This is about
the companies that rip off hardworking Americans simply because they
can.  
   
That’s why today, my Administration took new actions to tackle these
hidden fees by proposing a rule that would end excessive overdraft fees.
For too long, some banks have charged exorbitant overdraft
fees—sometimes $30 or more—that often hit the most vulnerable Americans
the hardest, all while banks pad their bottom lines. Banks call it a
service—I call it exploitation. Today’s proposal would cut the average
overdraft fee by more than half, saving the typical American family that
pays these fees $150 a year. That would add up to save families $3.5
billion every year. Unfortunately, some Republicans in Congress continue
to defend these exploitative fees.  
   
This is just one part of my Administration’s broader plan to lower costs
for hardworking families. We’re going to continue doing everything in
our power to bring down costs and grow our economy from the middle out
and bottom up, while standing up to extreme Republican attempts to
provide more giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations and undermine
competition.
