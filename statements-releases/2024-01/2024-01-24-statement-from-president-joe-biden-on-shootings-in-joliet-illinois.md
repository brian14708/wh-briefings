title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Shootings in Joliet,\_Illinois"
---
 
Jill and I are praying for the family members of the eight victims
killed in Joliet, Illinois, and for the broader community devastated by
these tragic shootings.   
  
Federal law enforcement agencies assisted local law enforcement with the
investigation.  
  
This tragedy underscores why I am doing everything in my power to keep
guns off our streets and out of the hands of those who seek to harm
themselves or others. It’s why my administration is strengthening the
gun background check system and cracking down on gun trafficking through
the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. It’s why I’ve taken dozens of
executive actions to strengthen gun safety and end the gun violence
epidemic. And it’s why I continue to call on Congress to pass universal
background checks and a national red flag law, in addition to other
commonsense gun safety measures.  
  
It is within our power to stop the epidemic of gun violence tearing our
communities apart. Congress must act now.
