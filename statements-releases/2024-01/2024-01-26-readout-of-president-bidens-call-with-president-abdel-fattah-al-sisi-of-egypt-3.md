President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Abdel Fattah

their efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages held by
Hamas. The President thanked President Al-Sisi for Egypt’s important
role in this process, and they affirmed that all efforts must now be
made to conclude a deal that would result in the release of all hostages
together with a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting. They also
discussed intensifying efforts to further increase the delivery of
life-saving humanitarian assistance into and throughout Gaza. They
agreed to continue their close coordination to increase humanitarian
assistance to Gaza and set the conditions for a durable and sustainable
peace in the Middle East, to include the establishment of a Palestinian
state and equal measures of dignity and security for Palestinians and
Israelis alike.
