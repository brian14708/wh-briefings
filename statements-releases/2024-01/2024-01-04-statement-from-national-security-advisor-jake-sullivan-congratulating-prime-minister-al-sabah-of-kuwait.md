I send my congratulations to Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah
of Kuwait for his appointment as Prime Minister by His Highness the Amir
Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.  The U.S.-Kuwait relationship
has been forged over decades to enhance peace and security in the Middle
East.  Kuwait is a Major Non-NATO Ally of the United States, we look
forward to continuing our work to deepen economic, cultural, political,
security, and people-to-people ties.  Our historic partnership is
essential to addressing shared challenges and building a more prosperous
future for our peoples.
