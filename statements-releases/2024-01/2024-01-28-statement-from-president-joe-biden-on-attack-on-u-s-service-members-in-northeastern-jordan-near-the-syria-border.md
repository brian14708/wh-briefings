title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Attack on U.S. Service Members in Northeastern\
  \ Jordan Near the Syria\_Border"
---
 
Today, America’s heart is heavy. Last night, three U.S. service members
were killed—and many wounded—during an unmanned aerial drone attack on
our forces stationed in northeast Jordan near the Syria border.  While
we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried
out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq.

Jill and I join the families and friends of our fallen—and Americans
across the country—in grieving the loss of these warriors in this
despicable and wholly unjust attack. These service members embodied the
very best of our nation: Unwavering in their bravery. Unflinching in
their duty. Unbending in their commitment to our country— risking their
own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans, and our allies and
partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism.  It is a
fight we will not cease. 

The three American service members we lost were patriots in the highest
sense. And their ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten by our
nation. Together, we will keep the sacred obligation we bear to their
families. We will strive to be worthy of their honor and valor. We will
carry on their commitment to fight terrorism. And have no doubt — we
will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner our
choosing.
