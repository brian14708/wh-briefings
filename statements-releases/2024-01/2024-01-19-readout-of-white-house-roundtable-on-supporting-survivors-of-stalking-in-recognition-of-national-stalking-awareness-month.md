title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable on Supporting Survivors of Stalking in\
  \ Recognition of National Stalking Awareness\_Month"
---
 
Yesterday, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy
Council Jennifer Klein, Senior Advisor for Gender-Based Violence
Catherine Powell, and Director of the Department of Justice’s Office on
Violence Against Women Rosie Hidalgo met with survivors of stalking to
hear their experiences and recommendations for ways the Biden-Harris
Administration can continue to support survivors of gender-based
violence, including stalking. The roundtable was held during National
Stalking Awareness Month, which was galvanized by the murder of Peggy
Klinke twenty years ago yesterday.

In their lifetimes, one in three women and one in six men will be
affected by stalking. Stalking is increasingly facilitated by technology
and takes place both online and offline. It can disrupt victims’ lives,
forcing them to miss work or move from their homes, and it can severely
impact physical and mental health.

Participants discussed the Administration’s commitment to ending and
addressing gender-based violence and stalking wherever it occurs,
including through implementation of the first U.S. National Plan to End
Gender-Based Violence and the ongoing work of the White House Task Force
to Address Online Harassment and Abuse. Biden-Harris Administration
leaders emphasized the courageous leadership of survivors and advocates
in the anti-stalking field. Survivors, advocates, and Administration
officials discussed current needs in the anti-stalking field and
strategies to improve support for survivors of stalking, including
methods to increase access to training, resources, justice, and safety.
