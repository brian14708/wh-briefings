title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Deaths of Two U.S. Navy\_SEALs"
---
 
Jill and I are mourning the tragic deaths of two of America’s
finest—Navy SEALs who were lost at sea while executing a mission off the
coast of East Africa last week.  Over ten days, the United States
military conducted an extensive search and rescue mission. Recovery
efforts are still continuing as we grieve this profound loss for our
country. These SEALs represented the very best of our country,
pledging their lives to protect their fellow Americans.  Our hearts go
out to the family members, loved ones, friends, and shipmates who
are grieving for these two brave Americans. Our entire country stands
with you. We will never fail to honor their service, their legacy,
and their sacrifice.
