title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on John\_Podesta"
---
 
From Day One, President Biden defined the climate crisis as the
existential threat of our time that required a global effort to put the
world on a safer climate trajectory.  In his time as Special
Presidential Envoy for Climate, Secretary Kerry  — with characteristic
passion, diplomatic acumen, and tireless focus — ensured that the United
States not only rejoined that effort but once again led it.

President Biden’s appointment of John Podesta to continue to lead our
global climate efforts demonstrates the President’s steadfast commitment
to tackling the climate crisis – and reflects his belief that we have
not a moment to lose.  John has played–and will continue to play—a lead
role in restoring U.S. domestic leadership on climate, including leading
the Administration’s implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, the
single largest investment to tackle climate change in history.  John is
a key architect of turning President Biden’s bold vision – that tackling
the climate crisis also represents the single biggest economic
opportunity of our time – into a reality here at home.  These efforts
have not only put the United States in a strong position to achieve our
climate goals, but have also unleashed a clean manufacturing boom that
has inspired a domestic and global resurgence in clean energy investment
and good-paying jobs.  As he assumes his new role, John will bring both
a deep understanding – and a proven model – for how countries around the
world can enhance their ambition while unlocking a new era of clean,
inclusive, and resilient economic growth.  John’s efforts and experience
will be critical as countries around the world develop their next round
of enhanced emissions targets, which are due early next year, as well as
work to build out the global clean energy supply chains necessary for
achieving our shared climate goals.
