title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Record-Setting Small Business\_Applications"
---
 
Every time someone starts a new small business, it’s an act of hope and
confidence in our economy. Today, we learned that Americans filed 16
million new business applications during the first three years of my
Administration—16 million acts of hope, the strongest stretch on record.
That’s three years in a row with more applications filed than in any
other year on record, including any year of the prior Administration.
And we know that small business growth has been particularly strong
among Black and Hispanic entrepreneurs, with Black business ownership
doubling and Hispanic business ownership up 40% since 2019. This small
business boom hasn’t been an accident—it’s a result of my
Administration’s strategy to support entrepreneurs, help small
businesses access the resources they need to thrive, and promote
competition to level the playing field.  
   
This is all part of a broader story of progress growing our economy from
the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Our economy has
added more than 14 million new jobs since I took office—including many
from small businesses—while the unemployment rate has been below 4% for
the longest stretch in more than 50 years, American workers’ wages and
wealth are higher now than before the pandemic, and inflation is down by
nearly two-thirds from its peak. I’m going to continue doing everything
in my power to build on this progress and grow our economy—with a strong
middle class, lower costs, and more opportunity for all Americans—while
standing up to extreme Republican attempts to provide more giveaways to
big corporations and undermine competition at the expense of small
businesses.
