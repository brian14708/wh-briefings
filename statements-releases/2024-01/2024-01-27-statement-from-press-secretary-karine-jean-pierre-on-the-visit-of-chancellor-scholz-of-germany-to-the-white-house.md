President Biden will welcome German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to the White
House on February 9.  The two leaders will reaffirm their
resolute support for Ukraine’s defense of its land and its people
against Russia’s war of aggression.  They will discuss efforts to
prevent regional escalation in the Middle East, their steadfast support
for Israel’s right to self-defense, and the imperative of increasing
life-saving assistance and protection of civilians from harm in Gaza. 
President Biden and Chancellor Scholz will also coordinate in advance of
the NATO Summit in Washington.
