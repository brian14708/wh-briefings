Today, President Biden will travel to the Raleigh-Durham area to
announce $82 million in new investments from the American Rescue Plan’s
(ARP) Capital Projects Fund to connect an additional 16,000 North
Carolina homes and businesses to high-speed internet as part of the
Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda. Overall, the
Biden-Harris Administration is investing over $3 billion in North
Carolina to lower costs for families and connect everyone in the state
to affordable, reliable high-speed internet through the American Rescue
Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These investments are creating
thousands of good-paying manufacturing and construction jobs in places
like North Carolina to produce Made-in-America fiber-optic cable that
will build out internet infrastructure across the country. And, because
of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Affordable Connectivity Program,
885,000 households in North Carolina are saving money on their internet
bills every month.

High-speed internet is no longer a luxury—it is necessary for Americans
to participate equally in school, access health care, do their jobs, and
stay connected with family and friends. Yet more than 7 million
households and small businesses across the country are in areas where
there is no high-speed internet infrastructure, and millions more
struggle with limited, unreliable, or unaffordable internet options.
With $90 billion from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan and
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, President Biden and Vice President Harris
are closing that digital divide. Through the Affordable Connectivity
Program, the Biden-Harris Administration has helped over 22 million
Americans save $30-$75 per month on their internet bills. The
Administration has called on Congress to extend funding for this
bipartisan program, so that millions of families can continue to access
affordable high-speed internet.

In North Carolina, President Biden will highlight how the over $3
billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan
funding is helping North Carolina:

-   **Connect well over 300,000 more homes and businesses to high-speed
    internet by the end of 2026** through $1 billion in American Rescue
    Plan funding. Construction on these American Rescue Plan funded
    projects is beginning or has begun in 90% of North Carolina
    counties. This includes over $700 million that North Carolina
    invested in high-speed internet and connectivity through the
    American Rescue Plan’s State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund. 
-   **Finish the job by connecting all remaining homes, small
    businesses, schools, healthcare facilities, and libraries to
    high-speed internet by the end of 2029** using $1.5 billion in
    funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s BEAD Program.
-   **Help 885,000 North Carolina households—about 1 in 5 households in
    the state—save up to $30/month on their monthly internet bills**
    through the Affordable Connectivity Program. Already, North Carolina
    families have saved a total of $442 million on their internet bills.
-   **Spur private sector investment in fiber manufacturing:** Thanks to
    the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic high-speed internet
    [investments](https://www.wcnc.com/article/money/business/hickory-catawba-county-fiber-optic-expansion-business/275-0230d0cd-6d35-4158-80e5-134dda8d9030)
    and Made-in-America policies that require fiber-optic cable to be
    manufactured in the United States, CommScope and Corning are
    investing nearly $550 million combined to build American-made
    fiber-optic cable, adding hundreds of new jobs in Catawba County.
    North Carolina is home to two of the largest fiber plants in the
    world, and is known as the Fiber Capital of America. As a result of
    these and other investments, Hickory, North Carolina is now
    producing 40% of the country’s fiber-optic cable.

President Biden will also discuss key progress his Administration has
made to meet his goal of connecting every American to high-speed
internet by 2030, including:

-   Thanks to the Administration’s historic high-speed internet
    investments and Made-in-America policies, **network equipment
    manufacturers have invested nearly $1 billion across 11 states to
    expand manufacturing facilities capacity** so that fiber optic cable
    and network electronics get made here in the United States by
    American workers.
-   By the end of December 2023**, every state and territory had
    developed a roadmap for how they will use their share of the $42
    billion Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program
    funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law** to connect every
    home and business in their state or territory to affordable,
    reliable high-speed internet access.
-   Through the Affordable Connectivity Program, enacted under the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, over **22 million households are
    saving over $600 million each month on their internet bills.**
