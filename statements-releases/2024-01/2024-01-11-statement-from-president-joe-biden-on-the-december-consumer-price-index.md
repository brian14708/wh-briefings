title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the December Consumer Price\_Index"
---
 
Today’s report shows that we ended 2023 with inflation down nearly
two-thirds from its peak and core inflation at its lowest level since
May 2021. We saw prices go down over the course of the year for goods
and services that are important for American households like a gallon of
gas, a gallon of milk, a dozen eggs, toys, appliances, car rentals, and
airline fares. Despite what many forecasters were predicting a year ago,
inflation is down while growth and the job market have remained strong.
The economy has created more than 14 million jobs since I took office,
and wealth, wages, and employment are higher now than under my
predecessor.  
   
But there is much more work to do to lower costs for American families
and American workers. That’s why I’m taking action to bring down the
price of insulin, prescription drugs, and energy, eliminating hidden
junk fees companies use to rip you off, and calling on large
corporations to pass on savings to consumers as their costs moderate.  
   
Make no mistake: extreme Republicans have no plan to lower costs for
families—none. Their only plan is to hand out massive giveaways to the
super wealthy and big corporations. They’ve locked arms with Big Pharma
and Big Oil to try to stop us from lowering prescription drug costs and
utility bills. They’re doing everything in their power to allow Big
Banks to keep charging you steep hidden fees. And they still haven’t
given up their fight to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. I
will not let them.
