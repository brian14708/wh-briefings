title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Regarding the Abdication of Her Majesty\
  \ Queen Margrethe II of the Kingdom of Denmark and the Succession of King Frederik\_\
  X"
---
 
On behalf of the United States, I congratulate Her Majesty Queen
Margrethe II of the Kingdom of Denmark as she concludes her tenure
and offer thanks for her enduring commitment to deepening the
partnership between our two nations.  Queen Margrethe’s 52-year reign
spanned ten U.S. presidents, an era during which the Kingdom of Denmark
and the United States moved closer together as security and trade
partners, while the bonds of friendship between our people grew ever
stronger.  Queen Margrethe’s commitment to her duty, her nation, and all
the people of Denmark through the past five decades has set an
incredible example of selfless, principled service.  The United States
congratulates King Frederik X on his succession to the throne and looks
forward to continuing our more than 200-year history of partnership and
cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark.
