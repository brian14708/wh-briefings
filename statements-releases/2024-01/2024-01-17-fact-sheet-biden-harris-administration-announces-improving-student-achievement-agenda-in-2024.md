title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Improving Student\
  \ Achievement Agenda in\_2024"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing today its Improving
Student Achievement Agenda for 2024, which is focused on proven
strategies that will accelerate academic performance for every child in
school. There is nothing more important to our future than ensuring
children are equipped to compete in the 21st century. That’s why the
Administration is laying out an agenda for academic achievement for
every school in the country, using all of its tools—including
accountability, reporting, grants, and technical assistance—to intensify
its drive for adoption of three evidence-based strategies that improve
student learning: (1) increasing student attendance; (2) providing
high-dosage tutoring; and (3) increasing summer learning and extended or
afterschool learning time.  
  
School closures launched during the previous administration set students
back. President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, the largest one-time
education investment in our history, helped schools reopen and regain
ground faster. From the start, this Administration has been laser
focused on working with school districts to invest these funds to help
students recover from the effects of the pandemic through proven
strategies like high-dosage tutoring and expanded summer learning.
 Through the new announcements today, the Department is using every tool
in its toolbox so that States and districts achieve greater adoption of
these three proven strategies and accelerate academic progress
nationwide. These strategies complement the Administration’s continued
focus on improving mental health in schools, supporting America’s
teachers and other school staff, and strengthening core instruction
through the Raise the Bar: Lead the World initiative.  
  
**<u>The Strategies and the
Evidence</u>**<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>**:**  
  
The Administration is urging States, districts, and schools to adopt
three strategies that work to increase effective time on task, based on
the evidence:  
  
**Increasing attendance**: Following the school closures that began in
2020 during the previous administration, chronic absenteeism emerged as
a serious challenge. Across the country, the rate of chronic absenteeism
reached about 31% in 2021-2022 because of COVID-19. We cannot and will
not accept that as a new normal. Students who are chronically absent are
[much less
likely](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chronic-absenteeism-an-old-problem-in-search-of-new-answers/)
to read at grade level and to graduate high school. [According to the
Council of Economic
Advisers](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/09/13/chronic-absenteeism-and-disrupted-learning-require-an-all-hands-on-deck-approach/),
absenteeism can account for up to 27% and 45% of the test score declines
in math and reading, respectively. Low-cost informational interventions,
like sending texts to parents about their children’s missed school, can
[reduce](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/2020006/pdf/2020006.pdf)
absenteeism by up to 17%.
[Research](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/new-research-finds-a-crucial-factor-in-reducing-chronic-absenteeism/2023/10)
also shows that targeted parent and family engagement—such as home
visits, the adoption of early warning intervention systems, and the
effective use of data and family engagement to identify why a student is
absent and what tailored strategy will address the cause—can
significantly increase student attendance. Reducing absenteeism can have
a major impact on student performance.  
  
**Providing high-dosage tutoring**: Well-designed and well-implemented
tutoring programs can significantly
[accelerate](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27476/w27476.pdf)
student learning, including enabling a child to gain as much as [1.5
years](https://www.economicstrategygroup.org/publication/coming-soon-overcoming-pandemic-induced-learning-loss/)
of achievement in math.
[Research](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mkraft/files/kraft_falken_2021_blueprint_for_scaling_tutoring.pdf)
shows that to achieve [these
results](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mkraft/files/kraft_falken_2021_blueprint_for_scaling_tutoring.pdf),
tutoring programs should: (1) provide at least three 30-minute sessions
per week; (2) occur in small groups (e.g., 1-4 students); (3) occur
during the school day, which helps support consistent participation; (4)
use well-trained tutors (e.g., paraprofessionals, teaching candidates,
retired teachers, AmeriCorps members, teachers, and others); and (5)
aligned with an evidence-based, structured curriculum. School systems
across the country, including in
[Chicago](https://www.chalkbeat.org/chicago/2022/10/25/23420920/illinois-high-impact-tutoring-learning-federal-funding-recovery-covid/),
[Baltimore](https://news.maryland.gov/msde/md-tutoring-corps-grant-awards/),
and
[Greensboro](https://studentsupportaccelerator.com/news/greensboro-tutoring-collaborative-aims-reverse-pandemic-learning-losses),
have leveraged American Rescue Plan funding to scale strategies with
promising evidence of positive impact as the Department of Education has
[long](https://bestpracticesclearinghouse.ed.gov/events.aspx)
[promoted](https://www.partnershipstudentsuccess.org/a-year-in-review-the-national-partnership-for-student-success/).
When implemented well, high-dosage tutoring can reduce burdens on
teachers and complement other school-based activities such as building
educator capacity through the use of math and literacy coaches, which
[research](https://www.montana.edu/emc/documents/NCSM.Coaching.Knowledge.Fall2011.pdf)
shows can improve student achievement, and [professional
development](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/WWC/PracticeGuide/12) to support
data-driven instruction.  
  
**Increasing summer learning and extended or afterschool learning
time**: One
[study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1557.html) found
that when students consistently participate in high-quality afterschool
enrichment programs, it adds about four months of student learning to
the academic year. Another [analysis of 30
schools](https://www.deseret.com/2014/5/25/20541981/longer-school-days-mean-better-grades-studies-say#:~:text=Underperforming%20schools%20are%20raising%20student-performance%20levels%20by%20lengthening,scores%20improve%20between%2011%20and%2024%20percent.%20)
found that when the school day’s instructional time is extended from 6 ½
to 8 hours for students in low-income areas, test scores improve between
11 to 24%. Summer programs lasting five weeks with at least three hours
of academic instruction per day add about two months of learning in math
and one month of learning in reading, according to a
[meta-analysis](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1557.html).
The use of data on student participation and program quality helps these
programs succeed, and their success enables teachers to deliver
instruction more effectively during the regular school day. Close to
half of school districts have invested American Rescue Plan funds in
expanded summer learning, which has been shown to improve students’ math
scores.  
  
**<u>Today, we are announcing the following Administration actions and
commitments</u>:**

1.  **Publishing States’ specific actions to increase student
    attendance, expand high-dosage tutoring, and provide summer and
    extended or afterschool learning time.** The pandemic caused
    significant declines in student achievement—across the country and
    around the world. Since then, leaders at the State, local, and
    school levels have undertaken historic efforts to get students back
    on track, fueled by landmark investments in the American Rescue Plan
    (ARP). Meeting and exceeding pre-pandemic achievement levels will
    require additional bold actions by States, districts, and
    communities. The Administration urges States and districts to make
    specific, quantifiable commitments to double down on their
    investments in these evidence-based strategies, such as the model
    commitments in the table below. This Spring, the Administration will
    highlight actions from States, districts, education non-profit and
    philanthropic organizations, , and others on:

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

2\. **Using Data and School Improvement Requirements under the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to Advance the Improving
Student Success Agenda.** To complement these State and local actions,
the Department of Education will work with States to improve school
performance by:

-   **Conducting additional monitoring so that States more effectively
    implement evidence-based responses to challenges.** Under ESEA, as
    amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act, States must use a portion
    of Title I funds to support schools designated for improvement
    through evidence-based strategies that address specific, identified
    needs of each school. The Department will engage States to
    strengthen implementation of these key ESEA requirements. For
    example, where States are implementing tutoring, the Department will
    examine whether they are doing so in the most effective form and
    provide guidance to support improvements.

**Tracking progress in closing pandemic gaps.** The Department is urging
States to identify the local educational agencies (LEAs) with the
greatest gaps between latest achievement levels and achievement levels
before the pandemic, including gaps at the student group level. States
should direct additional school improvement resources to those LEAs and
prioritize them for support in order to eliminate gaps as quickly as
possible, targeting acceleration efforts like high-dosage tutoring and
summer, extended, and afterschool learning time in LEAs and schools with
the greatest need.

-   **Encouraging States to** **strengthen accountability for addressing
    chronic absenteeism.** To improve student achievement, States and
    schools need to improve student attendance. The Department will call
    on States to:
    -   Adopt chronic absenteeism as an indicator in their Statewide
        accountability and improvement system under ESSA, if they have
        not done so already. States can use data from this indicator to
        drive improvement for student attendance, engagement, and
        persistence.
    -   Adopt a strong, consistent definition of chronic absenteeism
        (e.g., missing at least 10 percent of school days) that captures
        all students struggling with attendance and better enables
        comparisons across schools, student groups, and States.
    -   Apply the chronic absenteeism indicator to all school types:
        elementary, middle, and high schools with K-12 grade
        configurations.
    -   Ensure schools are looking at all student groups who are
        chronically absent to receive supports that are specifically
        tailored to meet those students’ needs (e.g., outreach in
        appropriate languages to families of chronically absent English
        learners).
    -   Increase parental engagement and adopt early warning
        intervention systems and other evidence-based practices to
        increase attendance.  
-   **Issuing new school improvement guidance focused on evidence-based
    practices to accelerate academic achievement.** To further support
    States and schools, the Department will issue guidance on
    implementing ESEA’s school improvement requirements, focused on
    evidence-based approaches to drive student achievement like
    addressing chronic absenteeism, and providing high-dosage tutoring,
    and summer, and extended or afterschool learning. The Department is
    asking educators, researchers, policymakers, community-based
    organizations, and others to share evidence-based strategies and
    resources by submitting them to the Department’s [Best Practices
    Clearinghouse](https://bestpracticesclearinghouse.ed.gov/). The
    Clearinghouse already includes examples of effective approaches to
    improving student achievement that States, districts, and schools
    can adopt. The Department will also seek public comment on the
    school improvement guidance before finalizing.  
-   **Providing technical assistance to States on academic achievement
    through the Department’s Comprehensive Centers, Regional Education
    Labs, and other partners**. While ESEA focuses on schools with the
    greatest challenges, all schools have areas for improvement. The
    Department will use all the tools at its disposal to support school
    improvement; for example, by working with States to pair schools and
    districts with faster rates of recovery with schools and districts
    struggling more as part of a professional learning community.

2\. **Enabling States to Continue Spending Pandemic Relief Funds on
Academic Achievement into the 2024-25 School Year and Directing
Resources to Support Stronger Outcomes.** The Department has issued a
[letter](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2024/01/ARP-Liquidation-Extension-Letter-1.9.24-final-for-signature-v3.pdf),
[Frequently Asked
Questions](https://oese.ed.gov/files/2024/01/Updated-Technical-FAQs-for-Liquidation-Extensions-1.9.24-v-2-for-posting.pdf),
and
[template](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Foese.ed.gov%2Ffiles%2F2024%2F01%2FARP-ESSER-EANS-Liquidation-Extension-Request-1.10.24-v3.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)
to support States and provide **a critical pathway to continue to use
ARP dollars in the 2024-2025 school year on academic supports like
high-dosage tutoring.** Additionally, the Department is:

-   Advising States to use other Federal funding, including Title I and
    Title IV funding under ESEA, to support tutoring, afterschool and
    summer programs, and activities to increase student attendance –
    including through valuable programs like 21st Century Community
    Learning Centers; and  
-   Fully enforcing the maintenance of effort and maintenance of equity
    provisions in ARP to ensure that States and districts maintain their
    own levels of education spending, including in schools and districts
    with high rates of poverty. To date, under the Department’s robust
    implementation of these provisions, **43 States increased education
    spending, post-pandemic compared to pre-pandemic, and 47 States
    safeguarded funding in high-poverty communities and drove
    approximately $600 million to high-needs schools.**

1.  **Using Grant Programs to Support the Student Achievement Agenda.**
    Pending appropriations, the Department plans to run several
    competitions in 2024 that support academic achievement through
    priorities for evidence-based instructional approaches and supports
    to increase student attendance, engagement, and academic
    achievement. Across several grant programs, funds may be used to
    support academic success strategies including high-dosage tutoring;
    extended, afterschool and summer learning time; ongoing support for
    educators, such as math and literacy coaching; increased access to
    rigorous coursework and content across K–12; identifying student and
    family needs and the community resources and partnerships available
    to meet those needs; strategies to reengage and support students who
    have become disengaged from learning; and other evidence-based
    strategies. While notices inviting applications are still under
    development, and while appropriations for 2024 are not yet settled,
    grants such as the Education Innovation and Research program, the
    Comprehensive Literacy State Development program, and the
    Comprehensive Centers program could provide hundreds of millions of
    dollars to further support academic achievement efforts in the years
    ahead.  
2.  **Releasing an Additional Academic Success Resource.** To support
    these action items and state and district planning, today the
    Department is releasing [this
    resource](https://www.ed.gov/raisethebar/academic-success) to
    support further implementation of academic achievement strategies
    including evidence for these strategies, components necessary for
    effective implementation, specific next steps that State and
    district leaders can take, and examples of States and districts
    already doing this work.  
3.  **Building on the National Partnership for Student Success (NPSS),
    including calling on** **colleges and universities to use at least
    15% of their federal work study funds for college students employed
    in NPSS roles**. The Administration’s NPSS initiative has expanded
    collaboration and helped get additional caring adults in student
    support roles. Last year alone, an additional 187,000 people
    provided tutoring, mentoring, and other supports in public schools
    compared to the previous school year, according to estimates by the
    Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University. The
    Administration is encouraging States, universities, and colleges to
    start their own initiatives or scale up existing efforts. Colleges
    and universities should set a goal to use at least 15 percent of
    their federal work study funds to compensate college students
    employed in NPSS roles. College students can work in schools and
    directly with students to provide critical supports while also
    learning more about education as a future profession. For schools
    and districts looking for more people-powered supports, the NPSS
    Support Hub based at the Johns Hopkins Everyone Graduates Center
    released today [this
    list](https://www.partnershipstudentsuccess.org/key-resources-for-schools-districts-to-increase-capacity-in-student-support-roles)
    of key resources to help accelerate learning, reduce chronic
    absenteeism, and improve student well-being and mental health.

**Today, several philanthropic and national organizations are announcing
commitments to support academic achievement. The Administration will
continue to work with these kinds of organizations to further build on
these commitments. [Read about the commitments from the organizations
below
here:](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/R-Philanthropic-Commitments-FINAL.pdf)**

-   Afterschool Alliance
-   Attendance Works
-   AT&T
-   Boys & Girls Clubs of America
-   Charles Stewart Mott Foundation
-   National PTA  
-   National Summer Learning Association
-   Overdeck Family Foundation
-   Parent Teacher Home Visits
-   Wallace Foundation
-   YMCA
-   Zearn

**This agenda builds on the actions of the Administration to promote
school success. The Administration has made historic investments to
reopen schools and help students gain ground since the pandemic. These
investments include:**

-   Securing $130 billion for the largest-ever investment in public
    education in history through direct State and district funding in
    the American Rescue Plan. COVID-19 created unprecedented challenges
    for kids. To support the immediate response and the long-term
    recovery work our students need, the President secured $130 billion
    through the American Rescue Plan to help schools safely reopen, stay
    open, and address the academic and mental health needs of students.
    American Rescue Plan funding has put more teachers in our classrooms
    and more counselors, social workers, and other staff in our schools;
    is providing high-dosage tutoring; supporting record expansion of
    summer and after-school programming; supporting HVAC improvements
    within school buildings to address air quality and environmental and
    safety needs in aging school buildings; and providing a wide range
    of student supports.  
-   Increased funding and targeting of federal grants to better support
    academic recovery including:  
    -   $90 million in new awards in 2023 to strengthen math, literacy,
        and science instruction through the Education Innovation and
        Research program;
    -   An additional $120 million in Full-Service Community Schools
        grants since coming into office to improve students’ mental
        health and well-being and their academic success;
    -   $48 million in 2023 in new funding for evidence-based literacy
        interventions through the Comprehensive Literacy State
        Development grants and Innovative Approaches to Literacy grants;
    -   More than $1 billion each year in funding for extended-day
        programming and enriching afterschool programming through 21st
        Century Community Learning Centers; and
    -   More than $2 billion in funding for school-based mental health
        professionals and services, including through the Bipartisan
        Safer Communities Act.
    -   $18.4 billion for Title I, $1.9 billion more than when the
        Administration took office, to help schools in low-income
        communities provide their students with the academic
        opportunities and support they need to succeed. 
    -   $14.2 billion for IDEA State Grants, $1.3 billion more than when
        the Administration took office, to provide special education
        services to over 7 million students with disabilities and
        support their academic success.  
-   Through the [Engage Every Student
    Initiative](https://engageeverystudent.org/), nearly 500 entities
    (including State networks, school districts, cities, and
    community-based organizations) have committed to expanding access to
    afterschool and summer learning programs for all students and we
    encourage other entities to build on these commitments.
