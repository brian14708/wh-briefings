title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Today\u2019s Justice Department Report\
  \ on the Uvalde School Shooting\_Response"
---
 
In May 2022, Jill and I traveled to Uvalde to grieve 21 students and
educators senselessly and tragically gunned down at Robb Elementary
School.  Twenty-one souls stolen from us in a place where they are
supposed to feel safe—their classroom.  
  
Following this tragedy, my administration conducted a review to
determine lessons learned from the response that day and best practices
to ensure a swifter and more effective response to future active shooter
incidents. Today’s report makes clear several things: that there was a
failure to establish a clear command and control structure, that law
enforcement should have quickly deemed this incident an active shooter
situation and responded accordingly, and that clearer and more detailed
plans in the school district were required to prepare for the
possibility that this could occur. There were multiple points of failure
that hold lessons for the future, and my team will work with the Justice
Department and Department of Education to implement policy changes
necessary to help communities respond more effectively in the future.  
  
No community should ever have to go through what the Uvalde community
suffered. After the Uvalde shooting, the families of the victims turned
their pain into purpose and pushed for the passage of the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety legislation in
nearly 30 years, which I signed into law. And I continue to take
historic executive action, including the establishment of the first-ever
White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.  
  
Congress must now pass commonsense gun safety laws to ensure that mass
shootings like this one don’t happen in the first place.  We need
universal background checks, we need a national red flag law, and we
must ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The families of
Uvalde – and all American communities — deserve nothing less.  
  
The longer we wait to take action, the more communities like Uvalde will
continue to suffer due to this epidemic of gun violence.
