title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Highlights New Commitments Toward\
  \ Equitable Workforce Development in Advanced Manufacturing"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will announce new commitments to
workforce development from the Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint.
The Sprint, which First Lady Jill Biden
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strategies-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
in May and the Administration [kicked
off](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/06/fact-sheet-to-launch-investing-in-america-tour-the-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-kicks-off-sprint-to-catalyze-workforce-development-efforts-for-advanced-manufacturing-jobs-and-careers/)
in October, is an intensive drive to build a diverse, skilled pipeline
of workers for good advanced manufacturing jobs, including union jobs,
many of which do not require a four-year college degree. This comes as
President Biden’s historic Investing in America agenda—including the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation
Reduction Act, and American Rescue Plan—is creating strong demand for
skilled advanced manufacturing workers in clean energy, biotechnology,
semiconductors, and more.

Today, Neera Tanden, Director of the White House Domestic Policy
Council, in partnership with the National Economic Council, will
highlight some of the many new commitments in remarks to 850 community
college and other labor and workforce leaders in New Orleans, Louisiana.
More than 160 organizations are participating in the Sprint—including
community colleges, employers, unions, education and training providers,
community-based groups, philanthropic organizations, and state and local
governments—by taking tangible steps to help more Americans train for
and succeed in good advanced manufacturing jobs and careers.

In the three months since the Administration kicked off the Advanced
Manufacturing Workforce Sprint:

-   Over 160 organizations have made new commitments to workforce
    development and job quality in advanced manufacturing.
-   Over 150 new advanced manufacturing-related Registered
    Apprenticeship programs and occupations have been created or are
    newly under development.
-   Over 4,700 new apprentices have been hired in advanced manufacturing
    occupations.
-   The Administration is announcing new investments—including more than
    $50 million in January alone—to grow and diversify America’s
    advanced manufacturing workforce.
-   The AFL-CIO Working for America Institute, in partnership with labor
    and industry, will lead development of a universal pathway
    curriculum for advanced manufacturing to provide students and
    workers an onramp to good advanced manufacturing careers.

The Biden-Harris Administration continues to encourage and support
expansion of high-quality pathways into advanced manufacturing, and
invites additional interested organizations to join the Sprint by
