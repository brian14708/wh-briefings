title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Terrorist Designation\
  \ of the\_Houthis"

Over the past months, Yemen-based Houthi militants have engaged in
unprecedented attacks against United States military forces and
international maritime vessels operating in the Red Sea and Gulf of
Aden. These attacks fit the textbook definition of terrorism.  They have
endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners,
jeopardized global trade, and threatened freedom of navigation. The
United States and the international community have been united in our
response and in condemning these attacks in the strongest terms.  
   
Today, in response to these continuing threats and attacks, the United
States announced the designation of Ansarallah, also known as the
Houthis, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.  This designation
is an important tool to impede terrorist funding to the Houthis, further
restrict their access to financial markets, and hold them accountable
for their actions.  If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea
and Gulf of Aden, the United States will immediately reevaluate this
designation.  
   
The designation will take effect 30 days from now, to allow us to ensure
robust humanitarian carve outs are in place so our action targets the
Houthis and not the people of Yemen. We are rolling out unprecedented
carve outs and licenses to help prevent adverse impacts on the Yemeni
people.  The people of Yemen should not pay the price for the actions of
the Houthis.   We are sending a clear message: commercial shipments into
Yemeni ports on which the Yemeni people rely for food, medicine and fuel
should continue and are not covered by our sanctions.  This is in
addition to the carveouts we include in all sanctions programs for food,
medicine, and humanitarian assistance.  
   
As President Biden has said, the United States will not hesitate to take
further actions to protect our people and the free flow of international
commerce.
