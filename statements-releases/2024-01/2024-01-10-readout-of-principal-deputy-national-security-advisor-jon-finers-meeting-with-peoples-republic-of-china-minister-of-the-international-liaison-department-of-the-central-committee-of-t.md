Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer met today with
People’s Republic of China Minister of the International Liaison
Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Liu
Jianchao in Washington, D.C.  This meeting was part of ongoing efforts
to maintain open lines of communication and responsibly manage
competition. The two sides had candid and constructive discussions,
building on the Summit between President Biden and President Xi in
Woodside, California in November 2023.  The two sides discussed the
ongoing implementation of key outcomes from the Summit, including the
resumption of military-to-military communication and cooperation to
combat illicit drug manufacturing and trafficking.  The two sides also
discussed global and regional security issues, including challenges in
the Middle East, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and cross-Strait issues. 
Mr. Finer stressed the importance of peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea.  Mr. Finer and Minister Liu
reaffirmed support for continued high-level diplomacy and interactions
between the United States and the People’s Republic of China.
