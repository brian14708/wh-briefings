title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Marking One Year Since Shootings in Monterey\
  \ Park and Half Moon\_Bay"
---
 
One year ago today, during Lunar New Year celebrations in Monterey Park,
California, 11 innocent people were killed in a heinous act of gun
violence that struck at the heart and soul of one of the largest Asian
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities in our
nation. In mere moments, friends and families gathering together in joy
and hope were devastated by a senseless, horrific mass shooting. Two
days later, this tragedy was compounded by another. As we mourned with
the community of Monterey Park, we learned a gunman killed seven people
in Half Moon Bay, California. Jill and I continue to pray for the
families of the victims and many others traumatized by these attacks.  
  
These shootings shocked the conscience of our nation. In the weeks that
followed at my State of the Union address, Jill and I were honored to
host Brandon Tsay, who heroically disarmed the Monterey Park shooter and
prevented further bloodshed. I also traveled to Monterey Park, where I
spent hours meeting with families who lost loved ones, and announced an
Executive Order containing new actions to crack down on the epidemic of
gun violence tearing our country apart. We launched the first-ever White
House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and my administration is
implementing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the most meaningful
gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years—which strengthens background
checks, expands the use of red flag laws, improves access to mental
health services for students dealing with the trauma of gun violence,
and more.   
  
In the wake of the tragic shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay,
California has also taken action, passing more than 20 new gun safety
laws and investing in proven solutions like gun violence intervention
programs. Other states should follow their lead.  
  
Importantly, we also need Congress to do its part. It’s long past time
we banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, ended immunity
from liability for gun manufacturers, passed a national red flag law,
enacted universal background checks, and required safe storage of guns.
We cannot tackle the gun violence epidemic in America while Republicans
in Congress sit on their hands.
