Today, Vice President Kamala
Harris [convened](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/01/09/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-before-roundtable-discussion-on-voting-rights-and-protections-with-advocates-and-leaders-atlanta-ga/) leaders
in Atlanta, Georgia who are on the frontlines of registering and
protecting voting rights at the national, state, and local level to
discuss ongoing threats to ballot access, the actions being taken to
counter those threats, and the fight ahead for fundamental freedoms.   
  
During the discussion, the Vice President called out extremists in
Georgia and across the country for their full-on assault on the freedom
to vote, noting more than 300 anti-voter bills were introduced last
year. She also outlined steps that the Biden-Harris Administration is
taking to protect voting rights and our democracy, including by ensuring
voter registration information is available
on [vote.gov](http://vote.gov/) in 17 languages. And, she once again
called on Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis
Voting Rights Advancement Act.  
  
The voting rights leaders in attendance shared their concerns about
threats to voting rights taking place across the country, including the
issues of mis- and disinformation, voter intimidation, harassment of
poll and election workers, and mass ballot challenges. Leaders also
shared the work they are doing nationally and, in their communities, to
advance protections for voters, including engaging young people and
rural communities, recruiting election and poll workers, and helping all
voters know their rights. Vice President Harris thanked them for their
work, and affirmed that she and President Biden continue to stand with
them in their efforts. She also announced that the next convening would
be in February with these organizations and others.  
  
Since being sworn in, the President and Vice President have worked to
ensure that the voting rights of all Americans are protected and
advanced. In addition to her work on pushing for federal legislation,
the Vice President has convened a broad coalition of voting rights
champions to strategize about what must be done to ensure that Americans
have access to the ballot. Vice President Harris has brought together
leaders from a variety of different communities, including the Black
community, Hispanic community, Asian American and Pacific Islander
community, Native American and Tribal community, voters with
disabilities, youth, poll workers and election officials, and other
groups that are working to safeguard our democracy.
