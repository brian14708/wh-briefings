National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg.  They welcomed Turkiye’s recent approval of
Sweden’s NATO membership and expressed a shared desire to see Sweden
join the Alliance as soon as possible.  Secretary General Stoltenberg
noted NATO’s Allies’ unflinching support for Ukraine as it continues to
defend itself against Russian aggression.  Mr. Sullivan and the
Secretary General discussed planning for the July 2024 NATO Summit in
Washington and NATO’s improved military readiness as a record number of
Allies are on track to meet the two percent defense spending pledge in
2024. They exchanged views on Allied progress in ramping up defense
production and expressed concern over the DPRK’s export and Russia’s
procurement of DPRK military equipment, as well as Russia’s use of this
equipment against Ukraine.  They also underscored Allies’ shared
commitment to military readiness and to defending every inch of NATO
territory.
