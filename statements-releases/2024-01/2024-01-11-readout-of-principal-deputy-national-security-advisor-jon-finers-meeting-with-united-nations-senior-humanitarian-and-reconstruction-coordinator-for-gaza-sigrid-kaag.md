Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer met today with
United Nations Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for
Gaza Sigrid Kaag. Mr. Finer underscored strong U.S. support for Ms. Kaag
in her new role. Mr. Finer and Ms. Kaag discussed mutual efforts to
increase the amount of humanitarian assistance reaching civilians in
Gaza, as well as steps that can more sustainably meet the needs of Gazan
civilians in the longer term. Mr. Finer met earlier this week, on
January 9, with UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and
Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo to discuss U.S.-UN coordination
on Gaza, including supporting Ms. Kaagâ€™s efforts and the next steps
ahead.
