National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with European Commission
Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis
today to discuss ongoing cooperation between the United States and the
European Union, including at the most recent U.S.-EU Trade and
Technology Council (TTC) meeting on January 30.  They highlighted the
continued importance of the TTC as a primary forum to advance key shared
priorities, including quantum information science, artificial
intelligence, standards, and ongoing efforts to promote high-standard
transatlantic trade, and bolster mutual economic security and resilient
supply chains.  They also reaffirmed our shared commitment to continue
to support Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s aggression.
