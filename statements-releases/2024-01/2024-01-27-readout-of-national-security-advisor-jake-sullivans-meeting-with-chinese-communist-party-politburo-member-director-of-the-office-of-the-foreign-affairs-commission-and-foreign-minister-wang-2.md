National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met on January 26-27 with
Chinese Communist Party Politburo Member, Director of the Office of the
Foreign Affairs Commission, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bangkok to
follow up on the Woodside Summit between President Biden and President
Xi last November.  This meeting was part of the effort to maintain open
lines of communication and responsibly manage competition in the
relationship as directed by the leaders.  Mr. Sullivan stressed that
although the United States and China are in competition, both countries
need to prevent it from veering into conflict or confrontation. The two
sides discussed next steps on a range of areas of cooperation discussed
at Woodside.  Mr. Sullivan and Director Wang Yi recognized recent
progress in resuming military-to-military communication and noted the
importance of maintaining these channels.  They also discussed next
steps towards holding a U.S.-China dialogue on AI in the spring.  Mr.
Sullivan and Director Wang welcomed advances in cooperation on
counternarcotics issues, including the launch of the U.S.-China
Counternarcotics Working Group on January 30.  The two sides held
candid, substantive and constructive discussions on global and regional
issues, including those related to Russia’s war against Ukraine, the
Middle East, DPRK, the South China Sea, and Burma.  They discussed
cross-Strait issues, and Mr. Sullivan underscored the importance of
maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.  The two sides
committed to maintain this strategic channel of communication and to
pursue additional high-level diplomacy and consultations in key areas
between the United States and the People’s Republic of China, including
through a call between President Biden and President Xi.
