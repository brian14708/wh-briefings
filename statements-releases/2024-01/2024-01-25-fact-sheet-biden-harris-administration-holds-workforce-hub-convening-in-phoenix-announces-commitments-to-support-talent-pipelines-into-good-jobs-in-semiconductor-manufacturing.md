  \ Semiconductor Manufacturing"

*Phoenix launches one of the first Registered Apprenticeship programs in
support of booming semiconductor and advanced manufacturing ecosystems
with state, local, and philanthropic investments*  
 

Today, Senior Biden-Harris Administration officials will travel to
Phoenix, Arizona for a Workforce Hub convening announcing commitments to
equitable workforce development from Hub collaborators. In 2023, First
Lady Jill Biden announced Phoenix as one of five [Workforce
Hubs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strategies-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/) where
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda—including the American
Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and
Inflation Reduction Act—is driving historic private and public
investments while creating pathways into good jobs.  In Phoenix, these
investments demonstrate how Bidenomics is growing the economy from the
middle out and bottom up.

Today’s announcements include: a $5 million private sector commitment to
establish a new semiconductor technician Registered Apprenticeship
program, a $5 million commitment from philanthropic organizations to
provide 1,500 Arizonans with supportive services to enter in-demand jobs
of the future, new partnerships between unions and community colleges to
expand access to apprenticeship and credentialing programs, and more.

Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, Arizona has seen
over $77 billion in private investment in semiconductor, battery,
electric vehicle, clean energy, and biomanufacturing sectors. In
response, the state is rapidly expanding equitable workforce pathways
into advanced manufacturing to meet demand for talent in these critical
sectors.  In November, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs and the Arizona
Commerce Authority announced $4 million from the President’s American
Rescue Plan to fund wraparound support services such as child care,
transportation tuition, and supplies for apprentices in
semiconductor-related Registered Apprenticeships.

Building on that investment, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, with support
from Governor Katie Hobbs, established a series of critical new
partnerships to build talent pipelines in partnership with the Workforce
Hub’s two anchor institutions, Maricopa Community College and Arizona
State University.  By launching new collaborative efforts with
employers, unions, community colleges, and other institutions, Phoenix
will support a diverse range of workers to enter and succeed in careers
in advanced manufacturing. As a result of this work, the Phoenix region
is now home to the Arizona’s first semiconductor Registered
Apprenticeship programs and the city’s workforce board is the first-ever
to sponsor a Registered Apprenticeship program in this industry.

The Hub’s work also supports the Administration’s [Advanced
Manufacturing Workforce
Sprint](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-new-commitments-toward-equitable-workforce-development-in-advanced-manufacturing/) —an
intensive nationwide drive to build a diverse, skilled pipeline of
workers for good advanced manufacturing jobs.

Major advancements expanding pathways into good jobs from Phoenix Hub
collaborators are below.

-   **TSMC Arizona (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) **is
    investing $5 million and establishing a new semiconductor technician
    Registered Apprenticeship program. TSMC Arizona intends to train 80
    facility technician apprentices over five years, with support from
    the City of Phoenix and the Arizona State Apprenticeship Office, and
    will scale over time and expand its curriculum to additional roles. 
    As a part of this effort, TSMC Arizona will also recruit technician
    apprentices from local communities.  
     
-   **Arizona Community Foundation **will drive the creation of a $5
    million philanthropic fund in partnership with other community-based
    organizations for equitable workforce development initiatives. The
    fund is designed to support 1,500 non-traditional talent and
    underserved residents with training to enter in-demand jobs of the
    future. Recognizing that individuals from underserved communities
    often need support to successfully complete training, the fund will
    provide grants to organizations that provide wrap-around services
    for workforce training and attainment.  
     
-   **South Mountain campus of the Maricopa Community College System and
    the Arizona Building Trades Council (AZBTC) **will signa Memorandum
    of Understanding (MOU) that details their shared commitment to work
    together to expand enrollment in construction trades Registered
    Apprenticeship programs. As a part of this MOU, South Mountain will
    provide the AZBTC access to students and facilities and both
    partners will engage in joint recruitment. These efforts will
    support pre-apprenticeship and Registered Apprenticeship programs
    and will serve individuals from underserved communities (primarily
    Latino, Indigenous, and first-generation students). Since the
    inception of South Mountain Community College’s Construction Trades
    Institute, 126 students have earned certificates: 50 in carpentry,
    56 in plumbing, and 20 in electrical.  
     
-   **Phoenix Union School District and the Western Maricopa Education
    Center** working in collaboration will enable high school students
    to access in-demand advanced manufacturing credentials. This effort
    will support a program in which high school students earn
    certifications that will make them competitive for jobs in advanced
    manufacturing. All participants will have tuition covered by the
    State. This program is set to launch Fall 2024.  
     
-   **Phoenix is investing $10 million in American Rescue Plan
    funds** in additional wrap-around services training efforts at
    Maricopa Community Colleges.These funds are providing monthly
    stipends of $1,000 to eligible participants to assist with
    transportation and other personal expenses which support individuals
    while completing an at one of the Maricopa Community Colleges.
    Individuals with young children (13 years old and under) receive an
    additional $500 per month to cover childcare expenses.  
     
-   **Arizona Commerce Authority is investing over $80 million from the
    President’s American Rescue Plan **to expand university partnerships
    focused on infrastructure and workforce, including—  
    -   $30 million for a Materials-to-Fab Center located at the Arizona
        State University (ASU) that will power shared research,
        development, and prototyping, accelerating semiconductor
        innovation;  
         
    -   $17.5 million to enhance Arizona’s research, development, and
        workforce training capabilities at ASU to create a GaN (gallium
        nitride) manufacturing and research ecosystem, developing 6G
        (sixth generation technology for wireless communications) in
        partnership with an employer partner, NXP Semiconductors;  
         
    -   $35.5 million supporting the University of Arizona’s Micro/Nano
        Fabrication Center in Tucson that will drive manufacturing and
        research efforts involving semiconductors, computer chips,
        optical devices, and quantum computing systems; and  
         
-   **BuilditAZ Apprenticeship **is leading a statewide initiative to
    double the number of construction and trades registered apprentices
    by 2026 to almost 8,000. This program is expanding access to
    pre-apprenticeships, creating pathways, especially for women and
    other individuals from underrepresented communities, and increasing
    postsecondary attainment.  
     
-   **Future48 Workforce Accelerator** is establishing a new
    semiconductor-focused collaboration led by the Arizona Commerce
    Authority with Maricopa Community College that will further build
    the pipeline of talent for semiconductor and advanced manufacturing
    industries.  
     
-   **Governor Katie Hobbs in collaboration with the Arizona Commerce
    Authority, Department of Economic Security, **and other
    organizations are conducting a child care needs study. This
    partnership is working to meet the child care needs across
    industries, including semiconductors, to ensure that Arizona
    supports successful CHIPS implementation.
