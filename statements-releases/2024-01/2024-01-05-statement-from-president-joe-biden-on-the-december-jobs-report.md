title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the December Jobs\_Report"
---
 
This morning’s report confirms that 2023 was a great year for American
workers. The economy created 2.7 million new jobs in 2023—a year when
the unemployment rate was consistently below 4 percent—more jobs than
during any year of the prior Administration.  
   
The strong job creation continued even as inflation fell to the
pre-pandemic level of 2 percent over the last six months, and key prices
have fallen over the last year—for a gallon of gas, a gallon of milk,
toys, appliances, car rentals, and airline fares. American workers’
wages and wealth are higher now than before the pandemic began,
adjusting for inflation.  
   
I won’t stop fighting for American workers and American families. I know
that some prices are still too high for too many Americans, and I am
doing everything in my power to lower everyday costs for hard-working
Americans—from bringing down the price of insulin, prescription drugs,
and energy, to addressing hidden junk fees companies use to rip you off,
to calling on large corporations to pass on savings to consumers as
their costs moderate. And I will continue opposing efforts by
Congressional Republicans to shower massive giveaways on the wealthy and
big corporations, cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and block
us from lowering costs for American families.
