National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with National Security
Advisor Henrik Landerholm of Sweden.  Mr. Sullivan underscored the
United States’ strong support for Sweden joining NATO as soon as
possible and applauded the Turkish parliament’s ratification of Sweden’s
NATO accession today. They welcomed the recent signing of the
U.S.-Sweden Defense Cooperation Agreement.  Mr. Sullivan and Mr.
Landerholm emphasized their commitment to continue supporting Ukraine as
it defends itself from Russia’s invasion.  They discussed the ongoing
Iranian-backed Houthi attacks against merchant and naval vessels
transiting the Red Sea, as well as the importance of increasing
humanitarian aid and civilian protections for people in Gaza as Israel
defends itself from Hamas.  They also discussed our growing bilateral
cooperation on emerging technologies and the close partnership on a
range of shared global challenges.
