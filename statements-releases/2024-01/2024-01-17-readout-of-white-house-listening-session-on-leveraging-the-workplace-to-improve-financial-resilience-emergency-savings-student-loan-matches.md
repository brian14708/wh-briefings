title: "Readout of White\_House Listening Session on Leveraging the Workplace to Improve\
  \ Financial Resilience: Emergency Savings & Student Loan\_Matches"
---
 
On Wednesday, January 17, Biden-Harris Administration officials convened
a listening session on workplace emergency savings programs and employer
matches for employee student loan payments, two initiatives that the
Administration has championed following the December 2022 passage of
SECURE 2.0 as part of its larger efforts to improve the financial
resilience of American workers and their families.

Representatives from public policy groups and the business community
reviewed these programs’ demonstrated benefits for workers. Public
policy groups that have pioneered emergency savings programs observed
how emergency savings improve financial resilience and wealth
accumulation in vulnerable communities, while providing a vital lifeline
for the many Americans each year experiencing a financial emergency.
Several large employers that have been earlier adopters of these
programs shared their positive experiences. These workplace benefits,
the companies reported, enjoy high rates of enrollment and retention
among young and old workers alike. They have also helped employers
retain their workforces and increase productivity.

Representatives of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and Department of Labor (DOL) reported
on their efforts to provide interpretative guidance for SECURE 2.0
provisions authorizing new tax-advantaged programs for both kinds of
benefits programs. Within the past week, the IRS issued [new
guidance](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-initial-guidance-to-employers-setting-up-emergency-savings-accounts-for-their-employees)
for employers on setting up pension-linked emergency savings accounts
within a tax-qualified retirement plan, while DOL released [Frequently
Asked
Questions](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/pension-linked-emergency-savings-accounts)
addressing these types of accounts. Officials discussed forthcoming
guidance on both emergency savings and student loan matching
contribution programs and solicited input from participants on needed
clarifications and how future guidance could help reduce the complexity
and administrative burden of establishing and maintaining these
programs, while ensuring they have adequate consumer protections.

Representatives from a number of financial services firms – providing
recordkeeping, asset management, and consulting services – discussed
their plans for developing and supporting new benefit programs for
small, medium, and large employers. Generally, participants noted rising
levels of employer interest in offering these programs. Several
commented on how partnering with FinTech firms can facilitate offering
these benefits, the importance of providing different benefit packages
that serve workers and employers’ diverse needs, and how regulatory
clarity is vital for small businesses establishing these programs.
Participants agreed that SECURE 2.0 offered valuable new options for
employers and greatly increased market awareness of the importance of
emergency savings and student loan matching contribution programs. 

The Listening Session is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
larger efforts to improve the financial resilience of American families.
The Administration has strengthened protections for retirement savers by
proposing to close loopholes and ensure that the financial advice
retirement savers receive is in their best interest. It has provided
historic relief to protect the hard-earned [pension

of millions of union workers and retirees. The Administration has also
provided historic student loan relief, including by fulfilling the
promise of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and establishing
the most affordable income-based repayment plan ever, SAVE. And the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has cracked down on junk
fees in banking and credit cards, which cost Americans tens of billions
of dollars each year.
