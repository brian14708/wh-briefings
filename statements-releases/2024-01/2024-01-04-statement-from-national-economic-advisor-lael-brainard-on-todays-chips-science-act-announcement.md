title: "Statement from National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard on Today\u2019s CHIPS\
  \ & Science Act\_Announcement"
---
 
President Biden signed the CHIPS & Science Act to restore America’s
leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and ensure America’s
consumers, businesses, and military maintain reliable access to the
chips that underpin nearly every aspect of our economy. We all
experienced the impacts of global supply chain stress and semiconductor
shortages during the pandemic, and the CHIPS and Science Act provides
critical investments to build a robust, resilient American supply chain
of semiconductors that power everything from home goods to electric
vehicles to satellites. Already as a result of President Biden’s
policies and actions in partnership with the private sector, supply
chain stress has fallen from near record highs to record lows, and
inflation has closely followed.

Today, the Department of Commerce announced the second preliminary
memorandum of terms (PMT) for approximately $162 million dollars to be
awarded to Microchip Technology. The chips and microcontroller units
(MCUs) that Microchip fabricates are essential components in a wide
range of consumer and defense products that are critical to American
manufacturing, including electric vehicles, smart devices you wear and
use in your home, computers, internet routers, and lifesaving medical
devices. This manufacturing investment in Oregon and Colorado will
advance the President’s goal of making semiconductors in America again
and reducing reliance on global supply chains that led to price spikes
and long wait lines during the pandemic. This funding, which is only a
fraction of the additional private investment that Microchip is making
in these projects, will boost Microchip’s production nearly three-fold
and create over 700 jobs. By making this investment, the Biden-Harris
administration is addressing a vital link in our technology supply chain
that impacts millions of American consumers and businesses.

As the Department of Commerce continues to make award announcements in
the coming months, President Biden’s Investing in America agenda will
continue to demonstrate how it is delivering for hardworking Americans,
creating good jobs, strengthening American supply chains, and protecting
our national security.
