Today we learned that the U.S. economy grew 3.1 percent over the past
year while adding another 2.7 million jobs, and with core inflation
moving back down towards the pre-pandemic benchmark. As a result, wages,
wealth, and employment are higher now than they were before the
pandemic. That’s good news for American families and American workers.
That is three years in a row of growing the economy from the middle out
and the bottom up on my watch.  
   
But our work is not done. I will continue to fight to lower costs — from
implementing historic legislation to lower prescription drugs costs,
health insurance premiums, and clean energy costs, to taking on hidden
junk fees that companies use to rip off consumers, to calling on large
corporations to pass on to consumers the savings they have been seeing
for months now. And I won’t allow extreme Republicans to hand out
massive giveaways to the wealthy and large corporations, while raising
your costs and cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That’s
not how we give American families more breathing room.
