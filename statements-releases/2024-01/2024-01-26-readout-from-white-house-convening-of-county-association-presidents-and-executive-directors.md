The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, in partnership with
the National Association of Counties (NACO), hosted a Convening of
County Association Presidents and Executive Directors to highlight

communities across the country.

Senior Administration officials and county executives explored
opportunities to continue to partner on implementation of the agenda’s
programs, including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. County leaders
discussed key issues of concern for local governments, including access
to broadband infrastructure, housing, and mental health care.

Administration officials included Secretary of Transportation Pete
Buttigieg, Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves, Senior Advisor and
White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Tom Perez,
Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and
Implementation John Podesta, and Deputy Homeland Security Advisor for
Resilience and Response Caitlin Durkovich.
