Today, the White House announced 10 U.S. regions that are emerging as
innovation ecosystems and receiving over $530 million of investment
catalyzed by the U.S. National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Regional
Innovation Engines program. The Biden-Harris Administration is awarding
the 10 NSF Regional Innovation Engines $150 million ($15 million each)
in federal investment, with over $365 million in matched contributions
from non-federal partners. Over the next decade, these 10 NSF Regional
Innovation Engines will be eligible to receive upwards of $2 billion,
with a goal of stimulating economic growth across a range of sectors,
including semiconductor manufacturing, clean energy, sustainable
textiles, climate-resilient agriculture, regenerative medicine, and
more. The NSF Regional Innovation Engines program was authorized by the
bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act – signed into law by President Biden in
August 2022 – and is part of the President’s Bidenomics agenda to grow
the economy from the middle out and bottom up.  
   
On Friday, First Lady Jill Biden and Director of the U.S. National
Science Foundation Sethuraman Panchanathan visited Forsyth Technical
Community College to announce two NSF Regional Innovation Engine
awardees in North Carolina, focused on driving innovation in textile
manufacturing and regenerative medicine.  
   
The 10 NSF Regional Innovation Engines will build on regions’ scientific
and technological strengths to build new industries and workforces,
creating more possibilities for Americans to participate in the
21<sup>st</sup>-century economy without having to leave their
communities. The NSF Regional Innovation Engines bring together private
industry, venture capital, state and local governments, institutions of
higher education including community colleges and technical schools,
labor unions, Tribal communities and nonprofit organizations to
transform their communities and regions over the next decade. This
program is critical to the President’s economic vision of supporting
regional economies, bringing communities together to tackle economic and
science challenges, and bolstering industries of the future.  
   
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has leveraged public
investment to catalyze private sector investment and job creation in key
areas driving American competitiveness. Since President Biden took
office, private companies have announced more than $640 billion in clean
energy and manufacturing investments, including over $230 billion in
semiconductor manufacturing, $150 billion in electric vehicle and
battery manufacturing, $75 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and
$20 billion in biomanufacturing; all of these sectors are represented by
the NSF Regional Innovation Engines announced today. These investments
will further position U.S. businesses and workers to outcompete the
world in the economy of tomorrow and strengthen our national and
economic security.
