title: "Readout from Communities in Action: Building a Better Rhode Island and\_Connecticut"
---
 
On January 10, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and
the Office of Public Engagement hosted nearly 70 local elected officials
and community leaders from Rhode Island and Connecticut as part of their
“Communities in Action” event series.

During the half-day forum, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials
highlighted the impacts of the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act on communities across
both states. Attendees included local elected officials, labor leaders,
businesses owners, community advocates, and health care professionals
who work to leverage the historic investments from the President’s
Investing in America agenda to create and expand opportunities for
working families.

Administration officials included Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo,
Director of the Office of Public Engagement Steve Benjamin, American
Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, and Deputy Director of the Office
of Gun Violence Prevention Greg Wilcox.  Senator Chris Murphy (CT) and
Congressman Gabe Amo (RI-01) also participated in the event.

The forum was the twenty-fifth in a series of “Communities in Action”
events that the White House hosts with state and local leaders to
demonstrate how the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering critical
progress for the American people.
