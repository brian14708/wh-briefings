*New data shows Biden-Harris Administration has three strongest years on
record for new business applications, as Bidenomics and the President’s
Investing in America agenda support good jobs and spur investments in
Allentown*

Today, President Biden will visit small businesses in the Allentown area
of Pennsylvania that are at the heart of his plan to support communities
too often left behind. Allentown, a historic steel town, was hollowed
out by failed trickle-down economics. Under President Biden, Allentown
is experiencing an economic comeback.  
  
Driven by President Biden’s agenda to grow the economy from the middle
out and the bottom up, communities like Allentown are creating jobs,
attracting investments in manufacturing and infrastructure, and
revitalizing Main Streets.  
  
**<u>Record Small Business Filings</u>**  
The Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda has
delivered a small business boom. New Census Bureau data shows that the
first three years of the Biden-Harris Administration are the strongest
years on record for new business applications, with nearly 16 million
applications filed. [Analysis by the Council of Economic
Advisers ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/01/11/new-business-surge-unveiling-the-business-application-boom-through-an-analysis-of-administrative-data/)finds
that this level of record applications also reflects higher levels of
new business formation that would lead to job growth – the highest in
the last quarter century.
[Evidence](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4_Decker-Haltiwanger_unembargoed.pdf)
suggests that supports from the Biden-Harris Administration helped shape
the landscape for this small business boom. In addition, Black business
ownership has grown at its fastest rate in over 30 years, and Hispanic
business ownership is up nearly 40% compared to 2019.   
  
**<u>Allentown’s Comeback Story</u>**  
Allentown’s factories once made iron products that reportedly went into
the construction of West Point and the White House. But because of
failed trickle-down economics, manufacturing left Allentown, and with
it, good jobs — many of them unionized. Pennsylvania *lost* 23,000
manufacturing jobs under the previous Administration.  
  
Thanks to Bidenomics, Allentown is finally making a comeback driven by
local leaders, small business owners, and workers. Since President Biden
took office, Allentown has experienced historic employment growth, small
business creation, and investments. The Allentown unemployment rate is
down to 3.9% — a 20-year low. A greater share of Allentown residents are
employed today than before the pandemic. Nearly 32,000 more workers in
the Allentown area have jobs under President Biden. Workers are taking
home more pay as well, with personal income in Allentown up over 3%
after adjusting for inflation compared to before the pandemic.  
  
Companies are making new investments — including a $500 million
investment by Pratt Industries in two sustainable corrugated packaging
facilities and a $7.5 million investment by Schless Bottles in a bottle
factory. Under President Biden, real investment in factory construction
has increased by more than 100%, while increasing just 2% in the four
years under his predecessor. These investments have a ripple effect —
creating good-paying jobs, raising community incomes, and bringing more
customers to small businesses in the region.

**<u>Investing in Pennsylvania</u>**  
President Biden is keeping his promise to leave no community behind. The
Biden-Harris Administration has announced $14.2 billion in public
infrastructure and clean energy investments in Pennsylvania and spurred
$3 billion in private sector investments in related sectors. Through his
American Rescue Plan, President Biden provided emergency relief funding
to 3,500 restaurants and bars and 6,850 child care programs in
Pennsylvania to help keep their doors open during the pandemic, plus an
additional $268 million through the State Small Business Credit
Initiative to help them access capital. Last year, the Small Business
Administration set records in loans delivered to small businesses,
including nearly $910 million to small businesses in Pennsylvania,
including significant increases in support to underserved and
minority-owned businesses. And across the federal government, $2.8
billion in federal contracting opportunities went to Pennsylvania small
businesses.  
  
In the Allentown area alone:

-   The Department of Transportation awarded $5 million to the Lehigh
    Valley International Airport for needed renovations.
-   The Department of Transportation awarded $22.5 million to fix the
    Cementon Bridge and $2.8 million to fix the Indian Trail Road
    Bridge.
-   The Department of Energy awarded $3.75 million to the Mid-Atlantic
    Center of Excellence at Lehigh University, which will expand the
    center’s engagement with unions, trade schools, and community
    colleges, and develop new ways to build workforce pipelines to jobs
    at small manufacturers in the region.
-   The American Rescue Plan enabled Allentown to invest over $2.3
    million in a new fire training facility and emergency operations
    center.
-   The Environmental Protection Agency awarded $1 million to the Lehigh
    Valley Planning Commission to help create a climate action plan
    focused on industrial decarbonization.
-   The Department of Transportation awarded $200,000 to the Lehigh
    Carbon Community College for scholarships for former and current
    military service members and families to pursue training to become
    commercial truck drivers.
-   The National Science Foundation awarded a $1 million Engines
    Development Award to Vytal Plant Science Research, which is
    partnering with the Northeast Ben Franklin Technology Partners to
    create an industrial bio-products hub in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
-   Over 17,000 households in Lehigh County now have access to
    affordable internet through the Affordable Connectivity Program and
    are saving up to $30/month.
-   The Department of Commerce designated Allentown a “Recompete area,”
    making it eligible to compete for an award of up to $50 million to
    support small manufacturers and workers in the region.

President Biden is keeping his promise and helping the hard-working
people of Allentown, Pennsylvania, and communities across the country
mount the economic comeback they deserve.
