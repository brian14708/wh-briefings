title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting on Competition Policy and Artificial\_Intelligence"
---
 
Yesterday, Lael Brainard, Assistant to the President and National
Economic Advisor convened a meeting with stakeholders to discuss the
Administration’s support for AI policy that promotes fair, open, and
competitive markets and that creates opportunities for small businesses
and new entrants.  

In the meeting, participants discussed the risks of concentration across
the AI ecosystem and ways to support competition as AI systems continue
to develop and become more widely used across the economy. This included
a focus on the challenges participants raised about the high levels of
concentration in the production of critical inputs including
semiconductors, computing power, cloud storage, talent, and data.
Participants also covered how open-source models and more tailored AI
applications may shape the competitive landscape. Participants raised
concerns about the risks of collusive behavior and highlighted the need
to scrutinize partnerships and investments across the industry.

Participants also addressed the possible harms from lack of competition
in AI including with respect to prices, quality, innovation, privacy.
They also addressed how the rise of AI will affect competition law and
policy in the coming years, including ways in which it may exacerbate
existing challenges such as price-fixing and self-preferencing. Finally,
the discussion turned to steps the Administration and others can take to
promote competition and ensure that the benefits of AI are more broadly
available. This includes support for publicly-funded research
initiatives, effective use of procurement tools, and other steps.

The Biden-Harris Administration has made clear that promoting
competition and innovation is a central part of AI policy. President
Biden’s [Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy
Development and Use of Artificial
Intelligence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/)
calls on agencies “to promote competition in AI and related
technologies, as well as in other markets” as they develop policies and
regulations. The President’s Executive Order also supports small
businesses commercializing AI products and directs a pilot of the
National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) to provide federally-supported
computing power, data, and other resources to AI researchers and smaller
companies. The Administration is also committed to a whole-of-government
approach to promote competition and protect consumers as laid out in
President Biden’s [Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the
American
Economy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/).
This includes the application of competition policy and antitrust laws
“to meet the challenges posed by new industries and technologies” as
they develop.

Representatives from the White House National Economic Council, National
Security Council, Domestic Policy Council, Office of Science and
Technology Policy, Council of Economic Advisers and from the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice attended the listening
