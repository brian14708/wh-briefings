title: U.S., Japan, and Republic of Korea Launch Cutting-edge Quantum Collaboration
---
 
We, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor
Akiba Takeo, and Director of National Security Hojin Chang, congratulate
the University of Tokyo, Seoul National University, and the University
of Chicago for signing a new trilateral quantum partnership that will
train a quantum workforce and strengthen our collective competitiveness
in the new global economy.  

At Camp David, the leaders of the United States, Japan, and the Republic
of Korea committed to demonstrate to the people of our respective
nations the tangible benefits of trilateral cooperation. Today’s signing
is one more step towards fulfilling this collective commitment.  It also
follows the December signing of a Trilateral Framework encouraging
scientific cooperation among our national laboratories.  United by
common purpose, we will harness the power of our leading academic
institutions to light a new way forward.

The United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea are global leaders
in research and development investment.  Innovative partnerships like
this one position our three countries to embrace a transitional moment
where cutting-edge scientific research and technology are yielding new
industries and modernizing old ones.  We wish these universities great
success in this new quantum endeavor.
