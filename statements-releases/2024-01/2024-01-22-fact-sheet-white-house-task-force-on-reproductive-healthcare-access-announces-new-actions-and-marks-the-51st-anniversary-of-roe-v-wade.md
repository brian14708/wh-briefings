title: "FACT SHEET: White\_House Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access Announces\
  \ New Actions and Marks the 51st Anniversary of Roe v.\_Wade"
---
 
*Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Help Strengthen
Access to Contraception, Protect Access to Medication Abortion, and
Ensure Patients Receive Emergency Medical Care*

Today, on what would have been the 51st anniversary of *Roe v. Wade*,
women’s health and lives hang in the balance due to extreme state
abortion bans. These dangerous state laws have caused chaos and
confusion, as women are being turned away from emergency rooms, forced
to travel hundreds of miles, or required to go to court to seek
permission for the health care they need. In the face of the continued
threats to reproductive freedom, President Biden will convene the fourth
meeting of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, where
agencies will announce new actions to protect access to reproductive
health care. The Task Force will also hear directly from physicians who
are on the frontlines of the fallout from the overturning of *Roe v.
Wade*. Also today, the Vice President is launching her nationwide Fight
for Reproductive Freedoms tour to continue fighting back against extreme
attacks throughout America.  
  
During the Task Force meeting, members will report on ongoing
implementation of the President’s three Executive Orders and a
Presidential Memorandum on access to reproductive health care and
announce new steps to:

-   **Strengthen Contraception Access and Affordability for Women with
    Private Health Insurance.** The Administration is committed to
    ensuring that women have access to contraception—an essential
    component of reproductive health care that has only become more
    important in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn
    *Roe v. Wade*—and reducing barriers that women face in accessing
    contraception prescribed by their provider. The Departments of the
    Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services (HHS) are issuing
    [new guidance](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/faqs-part-64.pdf)
    to clarify standards and support expanded coverage of a broader
    range of FDA-approved contraceptives at no cost under the Affordable
    Care Act. This action builds on the progress already made by the
    Affordable Care Act to expand access to affordable contraception for
    millions of women nationwide.  
      
    In addition, the Office of Personnel Management will strengthen
    access to contraception for federal workers, retirees, and family
    members by issuing guidance to insurers participating in the Federal
    Employee Health Benefits Program that incorporates the Departments’
    guidance. OPM will also newly require insurers that participate in
    the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program to take additional
    steps to educate enrollees about their contraception benefits.  
-   **Reinforce Obligations to Cover Affordable Contraception.** The
    Secretary of HHS is [issuing a
    letter](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/01/22/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-announces-new-actions-increase-contraceptive-care-coverage-51st-anniversary-roe-v-wade.html)
    to private health insurers, state Medicaid and Children’s Health
    Insurance Programs, and Medicare plans about their obligations to
    cover contraception for those they serve. The letter targets a wide
    range of payers to advance compliance with existing standards and
    underscore the Administration’s commitment to ensuring that women
    across the country can access affordable contraception. The letter
    also highlights recent HHS action to expand coverage and improve
    payment for contraceptives for Medicare beneficiaries, improving
    access for women with disabilities.  
-   **Educate Patients and Health Care Providers on Their Rights and
    Obligations for Emergency Medical Care.** The Administration is
    committed to helping ensure all patients, including women who are
    experiencing pregnancy loss and other pregnancy-related emergencies,
    have access to emergency medical care required under the Emergency
    Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The Administration has
    long taken the position that the required emergency care can, in
    some circumstances, include abortion care. The Department of Justice
    (DOJ) is defending that interpretation of the law before the Supreme
    Court, which is expected to rule by June.   
      
    To increase awareness of EMTALA and improve the procedures for
    ensuring that patients facing all types of medical emergencies
    receive the care to which they are entitled, HHS is announcing today
    [a comprehensive
    plan](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-new-actions-help-hospitals-meet-obligations-under-emtala)
    to educate all patients about their rights and to help ensure
    hospitals meet their obligations under federal law. This effort will
    include the launch of [new accessible and understandable
    resources](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/your-patient-rights/emergency-room-rights)
    about rights and protections for patients under EMTALA and the
    process for submitting a complaint. HHS will also disseminate
    training materials for health care providers and establish a
    dedicated team of experts who will increase the Department’s
    capacity to support hospitals and providers across the country in
    complying with federal requirements—to help ensure that every
    patient receives the emergency medical care required under federal
    law.  
-   **Protect Access to Safe and Legal Medication Abortion.** One year
    ago today, President Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum
    directing further efforts to support patients, providers, and
    pharmacies who wish to legally access, prescribe, or provide
    medication abortion—including by taking steps to safeguard their
    safety and security. Today, the Department of Health and Human
    Services, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland
    Security will report on their implementation of this Presidential
    Memorandum, including the resources they have disseminated to health
    care providers, including pharmacies, to support safe access to
    legal medication abortion.

Today’s announcements build on the Administration’s [strong
record](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-commitment-to-defending-reproductive-rights-and-actions-to-protect-access-to-reproductive-health-care-one-year-after-overturning-of-roe-v-wade/)
of taking action since the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn *Roe v.
Wade*. These ongoing efforts to defend reproductive rights include:  
  
**Protecting Access to Abortion, including Medication Abortion**

-   **Defend FDA Approval of Medication Abortion in Court.**  The Food
    and Drug Administration (FDA) and DOJ are defending access to
    mifepristone—a safe and effective drug used in medication abortion
    that FDA first approved more than twenty years ago—and FDA’s
    independent, expert judgment in court, including in a lawsuit before
    the Supreme Court that attempts to curtail access nationwide. The
    Administration will [continue to stand
    by](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/21/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-in-alliance-for-hippocratic-medicine-v-fda/) FDA’s
    decades-old approval and regulation of the medication and by FDA’s
    ability to review, approve, and regulate a wide range of
    prescription medications. Efforts to impose outdated restrictions on
    mifepristone would limit access to reproductive health care in every
    state in the country.  
-   **Protect Access to Safe and Legal Medication Abortion.**  On what
    would have been the 50th anniversary of *Roe v. Wade*, President
    Biden issued a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-presidential-memorandum-on-ensuring-safe-access-to-medication-abortion/#:~:text=The%20Presidential%20Memorandum%20directs%20the,or%20provide%20mifepristone%E2%80%94no%20matter) directing
    agencies to consider further efforts to protect access to medication
    abortion. This Presidential Memorandum was issued in the face of
    attacks by state officials to prevent women from accessing
    mifepristone and discourage pharmacies from becoming certified to
    dispense the medication. These attacks followed
    independent, [evidence-based
    action](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/information-about-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation) taken
    by FDA to allow mifepristone to continue to be prescribed by
    telehealth and sent by mail as well as to enable interested
    pharmacies to become certified.  
-   **Partner with State Leaders on the Frontlines of Abortion Access.**
     The White House continues to
    [partner](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dobbs-Anniversary-States-Report-6.22.23.pdf)
    with leaders on the frontlines of protecting access to abortion—both
    those fighting extreme state legislation and those advancing
    proactive policies to protect access to reproductive health care,
    including for patients who are forced to travel out of state for
    care. The Vice President has led these efforts, traveling to 20
    states and meeting with more than 250 state legislators, health care
    providers, and advocates in the past year. Today, she is kicking off
    her nationwide Fight for Reproductive Freedoms tour in Wisconsin.  
-   **Ensure Access to Emergency Medical Care.**  Republican elected
    officials in states across the country have put women’s lives at
    risk by banning abortion even when her doctor determines that an
    abortion is necessary to prevent serious health consequences. The
    Administration is committed to ensuring all patients, including
    women who are experiencing pregnancy loss and other
    pregnancy-related emergencies, have access to the full rights and
    protections for emergency medical care afforded under federal
    law—including abortion care when that is the stabilizing treatment
    required. HHS [issued
    guidance](https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-certificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/reinforcement-emtala-obligations-specific-patients-who-are-pregnant-or-are-experiencing-pregnancy-0) and
    Secretary
    Becerra [sent](https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUQs-2BN3jQcVLX1PF2KeT0WHpjKuEGg9HmpTkm0U662e5MZPUxFHTPmAUcFbW4j1MvV724tEggkjCEA2ZX3gi-2FNyPGJFj8gYazBcTjCojRcpqq8BsK2ApNp1RFmFOQsiu6fA-3D-3DCFjw_gatHLOXVnjS-2Fys-2B7qAyVd81zv1Wap8yT25fZboq0-2BiJx32YthI2zl6rLINVJW-2BIntQ2xHKXC9-2BG6LAj91HsUVwh1AxFPJdA27CeTtZ70weukMTYQr8WctKfx-2BmGuVXIt7NBdKdc5BSZ0vWWNOejTWPEy2AgckfSiYxFle46ealnje2B4V4C0QYRTkcLdfsRU56JahbxdQ2uRxCBEsIaevThQ0x69QHjdNvp4laljWEcd4M0qNQNSgcwU24FhZ1w96ALZQHFywHGvRhge-2F9zNwNaJPGFGZQxR7GEUSGFO-2FX9y-2B1RcBuCXkeyu-2BDztuqiWbfnn1up39qkzdr48HwOg9C6DCFMqDsFLHFH4tFzwcYk-3D) [letters](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/01/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-statement-on-emtala-enforcement.html) to
    providers affirming the Administration’s view that EMTALA preempts
    conflicting state law restricting access to abortion in emergency
    situations. The Department of Justice has taken action defend and
    enforce these protections in court, including in a case currently
    before the Supreme Court.  
-   **Provide Access to Reproductive Health Care for Veterans.  **The
    Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) [issued an interim final
    rule](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-will-offer-abortion-counseling-and-in-certain-cases-abortions-to-pregnant-veterans-and-va-beneficiaries/) to
    allow VA to provide abortion counseling and, in certain
    circumstances, abortion care to veterans and VA beneficiaries. VA
    provides abortion services when the health or life of the patient
    would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term or when
    the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. When working within the
    scope of their federal employment, VA employees [may
    provide](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2022-11/2022-09-21-va_immunity_for_abortion_services.pdf) abortion
    services as authorized by federal law regardless of state
    restrictions. DOJ will support and provide representation to any VA
    providers whom states attempt to prosecute for violations of state
    abortion laws where those providers were appropriately carrying out
    their duties under VA’s interim final rule.   
-   **Support Access to Care for Service Members.**  The Department of
    Defense (DoD) has [taken
    action](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3195298/dod-looks-to-ensure-access-to-reproductive-health-care/) to
    ensure that Service members and their families can access
    reproductive health care and that DoD health care providers can
    operate effectively. DoD has [released
    policies](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3301006/dod-releases-policies-to-ensure-access-to-non-covered-reproductive-health-care/) to
    support Service members and their families’ ability to travel for
    lawful non-covered reproductive health care and to bolster Service
    members’ privacy and afford them the time and space needed to make
    personal health care decisions.  
-   **Defend Reproductive Rights in
    Court. **DOJ [created ](https://www.justice.gov/reproductive-rights)a
    Reproductive Rights Task Force, which monitors and evaluates state
    and local actions that threaten to infringe on federal protections
    relating to the provision or pursuit of reproductive health care,
    impair women’s ability to seek abortion care where it is legal,
    impair individuals’ ability to inform and counsel each other about
    the care that is available in other states, ban mifepristone based
    on disagreement with FDA’s expert judgment about its safety and
    efficacy, or impose criminal or civil liability on federal employees
    who provide legal reproductive health services in a manner
    authorized by federal law.

**Supporting Women’s Ability to Travel for Medical Care**

-   **Defend the Right to Travel.**  On the day of the Supreme Court’s
    decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade*, President
    Biden [reaffirmed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-court-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/) the
    Attorney
    General’s [statement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s) that
    women must remain free to travel safely to another state to seek the
    care they need. In November 2023, DOJ filed a statement of interest
    in two lawsuits challenging the Alabama Attorney General’s threat to
    prosecute people who provide assistance to women seeking lawful
    out-of-state abortions. DOJ explained that the threatened Alabama
    prosecutions infringe the constitutional right to travel and made
    clear that states may not punish third parties for assisting women
    in exercising that right. DOJ continues to monitor states’ efforts
    to restrict the constitutional right to travel across state lines to
    receive lawful health care.  
-   **Support Patients Traveling Out of State for Medical Care.**  HHS
    [issued](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/hhs-letter-to-governors-reproductive-health-care.pdf) a
    letter to U.S. governors inviting them to apply for Section 1115
    waivers to expand access to care under the Medicaid program for
    women traveling from a state where reproductive rights are under
    attack and women may be denied medical care. HHS continues to
    encourage state leaders to consider and develop new waiver proposals
    that would support access to reproductive health care services.

**Safeguarding Access to Contraception**

-   **Strengthen Access to Affordable, High-Quality Contraception.**
     Ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision
    to overturn *Roe v. Wade*, the President [issued an Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-strengthening-access-to-contraception/) directing
    agencies to consider actions to improve access and affordability for
    women with private health insurance; promote increased access to
    over-the-counter contraception; support access to affordable
    contraception through Medicaid and Medicare; ensure Service members,
    veterans, and Federal employees are able to access contraception;
    bolster contraception access across Federal health programs; and
    support access for college students and employees. These are just
    some of the recent actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration
    to implement this Executive Order:
    -   Following FDA’s approval of the first daily oral contraceptive
        in the United States without a prescription, the Departments of
        the Treasury, Labor, and HHS [issued a Request for
        Information](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/09/29/hhs-requests-public-input-coverage-over-the-counter-preventive-services-including-contraception-tobacco-cessation-breastfeeding-supplies.html)
        to solicit public input on how to best ensure coverage and
        access to over-the-counter preventive services, including
        contraception, at no cost and without a prescription from a
        health care provider.
    -   Vice President Harris and the Department of Education
        [convened](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/05/readout-of-vice-president-kamala-harriss-participation-at-the-department-of-educations-convening-on-access-to-contraception-for-college-students/)
        representatives from 68 college and university leaders in 32
        states to hear promising strategies from leaders of
        postsecondary institutions for protecting and expanding access
        to contraception for their students and on campus.
    -   The Gender Policy Council, Domestic Policy Council, and leaders
        from the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS
        [convened](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/27/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-increasing-contraception-access-and-affordability/)
        private sector leaders to stress the need to continue to build
        on the significant progress already made under the Affordable
        Care Act in expanding access to contraception and call on
        participants to take robust additional actions to improve
        access.
    -   The Health Resources and Services Administration [proposed new
        data
        measures](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/data-reporting/uds-training-and-technical-assistance/uniform-data-system-uds-program-assistance-letters)
        for federally funded health centers that, once finalized, will
        help ensure that patients are screened for contraception needs.
        Screening and data measures will help enhance the overall
        delivery of voluntary family planning and related services,
        which is a required primary health care service under federal
        law.
    -   The Office of Personnel Management launched a public education
        campaign to highlight contraception benefits available to
        federal employees and their family members.
    -   HHS is continuing its public-private partnership to expand
        access to contraception with Upstream, a national nonprofit
        organization that provides health centers with free
        patient-centered, evidence-based training and technical
        assistance to eliminate provider-level barriers to offering the
        full range of contraceptive options. To date, HHS has connected
        Upstream to nearly 100 health care clinics, resulting in
        partnerships that will help Upstream accelerate their national
        expansion to reach 5 million women of reproductive age every
        year.

-   **Clarify Protections for Women with Private Health
    Insurance.** Under the Affordable Care Act, most private health
    plans must provide coverage for contraception and family planning
    counseling with no out-of-pocket costs. The Departments of the
    Treasury, Labor, and HHS
    [convened](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/06/27/secretaries-becerra-walsh-and-yellen-underscore-contraceptive-coverage-requirements-for-private-insurance.html)
    a meeting with health insurers and employee benefit plans. These
    agencies called on the industry to meet their obligations to cover
    contraception as required under the law. Following this
    conversation, these agencies [issued
    guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/28/hhs-dol-treasury-issue-guidance-regarding-birth-control-coverage.html)
    to clarify protections for contraceptive coverage under the
    Affordable Care Act.  
-   **Expand Access Under the Affordable Care Act. ** The Departments of
    the Treasury, Labor, and HHS [proposed a
    rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/30/biden-harris-administration-proposes-new-rules-expand-access-birth-control-coverage-under-affordable-care-act.html) to
    strengthen access to contraception under the Affordable Care Act so
    all women with private health coverage who need and want
    contraception can obtain it without cost sharing. Millions of women
    have already benefited from this coverage, which has helped them
    save billions of dollars on contraception.  
-   **Support Title X Clinics.**  Last year, HHS provided $263 million
    to over 4,000 Title X clinics across the country to provide a wide
    range of voluntary, client-centered family planning and related
    preventive services. The Title X Family Planning Program remains a
    critical part of the nation’s safety net, providing free or low-cost
    services for 2.6 million clients in 2022.  
-   **Promote Access to Contraception for Service Members and Their
    Families and Certain Dependents of Veterans.**  To improve access to
    contraception at military hospitals and clinics, DoD
    [expanded](https://tricare.mil/WalkinContraceptiveServices) walk-in
    contraceptive care services for active-duty Service members and
    other Military Health System beneficiaries, and
    [eliminated](https://newsroom.tricare.mil/News/TRICARE-News/Article/3174941/tricare-offers-contraceptive-care-to-support-you-your-family-and-your-readiness#:~:text=Yes.,many%20retailers%20at%20no%20cost.)
    TRICARE copays for certain contraceptive services. And VA proposed
    [a
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/10/24/2022-22905/champva-coverage-of-audio-only-telehealth-mental-health-services-and-cost-sharing-for-certain)
    to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for certain types of contraception
    through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of
    Veterans Affairs.

**Promoting Safety and Security of Patients, Providers, and Clinics**

-   **Promote Safety and Security of Patients, Providers and
    Clinics.** DOJ [continues ](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-convening-reproductive-rights-task)to
    robustly enforce the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act,
    which protects the right to access and provide reproductive health
    services.

**Safeguarding Privacy and Sensitive Health Information**

-   **Strengthen Reproductive Health Privacy under HIPAA.**  HHS [issued
    a proposed
    rule ](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/regulatory-initiatives/hipaa-reproductive-health-fact-sheet/index.html)to
    strengthen privacy protections under the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). As proposed, this rule
    would prevent an individual’s information from being disclosed to
    investigate, sue, or prosecute an individual, a health care
    provider, or a loved one simply because that person sought,
    obtained, provided, or facilitated legal reproductive health care,
    including abortion. By safeguarding sensitive information related to
    reproductive health care, the rule will strengthen patient-provider
    confidentiality and help health care providers give complete and
    accurate information to patients. Prior to the proposed
    rule*, *HHS [issued
    guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/phi-reproductive-health/index.html) reaffirming
    HIPAA’s existing protections for the privacy of individuals’
    protected health information.  
-   **Take Action Against Illegal Use and Sharing of Sensitive Health
    Information.**  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
    has [committed](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/07/location-health-and-other-sensitive-information-ftc-committed-fully-enforcing-law-against-illegal) to
    enforcing the law against illegal use and sharing of highly
    sensitive data, including information related to reproductive health
    care. Consistent with this commitment, the FTC has taken several
    [enforcement
    actions](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-order-prohibits-data-broker-x-mode-social-outlogic-selling-sensitive-location-data)
    against companies for disclosing consumers’ personal health
    information, including [highly sensitive reproductive health
    data](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/05/ftc-says-premom-shared-users-highly-sensitive-reproductive-health-data-can-it-get-more-personal),
    without permission.  
-   **Help Consumers Protect Their Personal Data.**  The Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC) [launched a new guide for
    consumers](https://www.fcc.gov/protecting-your-personal-data) on
    best practices for protecting their personal data, including
    geolocation data, on mobile phones. The guide follows a [Notice of
    Proposed
    Rulemaking](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-22-102A1.pdf) issued
    by FCC that would strengthen data breach rules to provide greater
    protections to personal data. Separately, HHS issued [a how-to
    guide](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/cell-phone-hipaa/index.html) for
    consumers on steps they can take to better protect their data on
    personal cell phones or tablets and when using mobile health apps,
    like period trackers, which are generally not protected by HIPAA.  
-   **Protect Students’ Health Information.**  ED [issued guidance to
    over 20,000 school
    officials](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-guidance-school-officials-student-health-records)
    to remind them of their obligations to protect student privacy under
    the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The guidance
    helps ensure that school officials—at federally funded school
    districts, colleges, and universities—know that, with certain
    exceptions, they must obtain written consent from eligible students
    or parents before disclosing personally identifiable information
    from students’ educational records, which may include student health
    information. The guidance encourages school officials to consider
    the importance of student privacy, including health privacy, with
    respect to disclosing student records. ED also [issued a
    know-your-rights
    resource](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/know-your-rights-ferpa-protections-student-health-records) to
    help students understand their privacy rights for health records at
    school.   
-   **Safeguard Patients’ Electronic Health Information.**  HHS [issued
    guidance](https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/information-blocking/information-blocking-regulations-work-in-concert-with-hipaa-rules-and-other-privacy-laws-to-support-health-information-privacy) affirming
    that doctors and other medical providers can take steps to protect
    patients’ electronic health information, including their information
    related to reproductive health care. HHS makes clear that patients
    have the right to ask that their electronic health information
    generally not be disclosed by a physician, hospital, or other health
    care provider. The guidance also reminds health care providers that
    HIPAA’s privacy protections apply to patients’ electronic health
    information.

**Reinforcing Nondiscrimination Protections under Federal Law**

-   **Protect Students from Discrimination Based on Pregnancy.  **The
    Department of Education (ED) released
    a [resource](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-pregnancy-resource.pdf?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=) for
    universities reiterating their responsibilities not to discriminate
    on the basis of pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions, including
    termination of pregnancy. This guidance reminds schools of their
    existing and long-standing obligations under Title IX.  
-   **Strengthen Nondiscrimination in
    Healthcare.**  HHS [issued](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/25/hhs-announces-proposed-rule-to-strengthen-nondiscrimination-in-health-care.html) a
    proposed rule to strengthen nondiscrimination in health care. The
    proposed rule would implement Section 1557 of the Affordable Care
    Act and affirms protections consistent with President Biden’s
    Executive Orders on nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation
    and gender identity.

**Providing Access to Accurate Information and Legal Resources**

-   **Ensure Easy Access to Reliable Information.**  HHS launched and
    maintains [ReproductiveRights.gov](https://reproductiverights.gov/),
    which provides timely and accurate information on people’s right to
    access reproductive health care, including contraception, abortion
    services, and health insurance coverage, as well as [how to file a
    patient privacy or nondiscrimination
    complaint](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints/index.html). DOJ also
    launched justice.gov/reproductive-rights,
    a [webpage](https://www.justice.gov/reproductive-rights?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) that
    provides a centralized online resource on the Department’s ongoing
    work to protect access to reproductive health care services under
    federal law.  
-   **Hosted a Convening of Lawyers in Defense of Reproductive
    Rights.**  DOJ and the Office of White House
    Counsel [convened](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/01/readout-of-first-convening-of-lawyers-in-defense-of-reproductive-rights-and-justice/) more
    than 200 lawyers and advocates from private firms, bar associations,
    legal aid organizations, reproductive rights groups, and law schools
    across the country for a convening of pro-bono attorneys, as
    directed in the first Executive Order. Following this convening,
    reproductive rights
    organizations [launched](https://lawyeringproject.org/our-work/adn_press_20230222/) the
    Abortion Defense Network to offer abortion-related legal defense
    services, including legal advice and representation.

**Promote Research and Data Collection**

-   **Use Data to Track Impacts on Access to Care.**  HHS
    [convened](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/11/08/readout-hhs-secretary-becerras-roundtable-contraception-access.html)
    leading experts to discuss the state of existing reproductive health
    research and what the data tells us about the impact of the
    overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, as well as the future of research on
    reproductive health care access. These convenings helped identify
    research gaps, opportunities for collaboration, and ways to bolster
    research efforts for both Federal agencies and external partners.
