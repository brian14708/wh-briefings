title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Inauguration of President\
  \ Ar\xE9valo of\_Guatemala"

I congratulate President Bernardo Arévalo and Vice President Karin
Herrera of Guatemala on their inauguration and commend the people of
Guatemala for making their voices heard and this important transition.
The United States will continue to support our shared democratic
values.  
  
I look forward to hosting President Arévalo in Washington in the coming
months to strengthen the U.S.-Guatemala relationship and to make further
progress addressing the root causes of migration. As our Administration
continues to implement the Root Causes Strategy, I look forward to
working with President Arévalo on civilian security, good governance,
human rights and labor protections, gender-based violence, and economic
opportunity. Governments must work together to manage irregular
migration in our Hemisphere, including through the Los Angeles
Declaration on Migration and Protection.   
  
In addition, I look forward to working with President Arévalo on
expanding private sector investments in Guatemala through Central
America Forward, the public-private partnership that has generated more
than $4.2 billion in investments in northern Central America. Our
nations, working with the private sector and civil society, can
build a more inclusive, stable, and prosperous future for the people of
Guatemala in Guatemala.   These are long-term development efforts, but
together we can and will make progress.
