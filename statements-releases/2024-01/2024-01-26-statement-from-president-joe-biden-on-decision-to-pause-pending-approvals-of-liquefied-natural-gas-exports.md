title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Decision to Pause Pending Approvals\
  \ of Liquefied Natural Gas\_Exports"

In every corner of the country and the world, people are suffering the
devastating toll of climate change. Historic hurricanes and floods
wiping out homes, businesses, and houses of worship. Wildfires
destroying whole neighborhoods and forcing families to leave their
communities behind. Record temperatures affecting the lives and
livelihoods of millions of Americans, especially the most vulnerable.  
  
From Day One, my Administration has set the United States on an
unprecedented course to tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad –
securing the largest climate investment in the history of the world,
unlocking clean energy breakthroughs that will power a clean economy and
create thousands of jobs, advancing environmental justice for all, and
rallying world leaders to transition away from the fossil fuels that
jeopardize our planet and our people.  
  
But more action is needed.  
  
My Administration is announcing today a temporary pause on pending
decisions of Liquefied Natural Gas exports – with the exception of
unanticipated and immediate national security emergencies. During this
period, we will take a hard look at the impacts of LNG exports on energy
costs, America’s energy security, and our environment. This pause on new
LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential
threat of our time.  
  
While MAGA Republicans willfully deny the urgency of the climate crisis,
condemning the American people to a dangerous future, my Administration
will not be complacent. We will not cede to special interests.  
  
We will heed the calls of young people and frontline communities who are
using their voices to demand action from those with the power to act.
And as America has always done, we will turn crisis into opportunity –
creating clean energy jobs, improving quality of life, and building a
more hopeful future for our children.
