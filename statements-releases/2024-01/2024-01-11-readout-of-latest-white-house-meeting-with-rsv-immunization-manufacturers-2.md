title: "Readout of Latest White\_House Meeting with RSV Immunization Manufacturers"
---
 
Yesterday, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials convened a
meeting with manufacturers of RSV immunizations for infants, including
Sanofi and AstraZeneca, to receive an update on supply, and to
underscore the need for manufacturers to continue efforts to meet
current and projected demand through the commercial market. This meeting
follows several in-person and virtual meetings, including [last
month](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/14/readout-of-latest-white-house-meeting-with-rsv-immunization-manufacturers/#:~:text=On%20Wednesday%2C%20senior%20Biden-Harris,commercial%20market%20this%20viral%20season.)
when manufacturers announced the availability of hundreds of thousands
of additional doses at the urging of the administration, including
230,000 additional doses, which providers and states will begin to be
able to order starting next week. Parents of infants under eight months
can speak with their health care provider about how to obtain an RSV
immunization to protect their infant. Additionally, expectant mothers
can talk to their doctors about the maternal RSV vaccine.  
   
Senior Administration officials and manufacturers also pledged to
continue conversations on the importance of proactively planning to
increase availability, and to take steps now to meet projected demand
for the 2024-25 viral season. The Administration will continue this work
to ensure every family that needs an RSV immunization can access it.
