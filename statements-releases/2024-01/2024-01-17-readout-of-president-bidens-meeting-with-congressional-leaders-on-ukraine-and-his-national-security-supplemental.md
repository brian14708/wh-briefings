title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with Congressional Leaders on Ukraine\
  \ and His National Security\_Supplemental"
---
 
Today, President Biden convened Congressional Leadership and the Chairs
and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Intelligence, Armed
Services, and Appropriations Committees, and the Senate Foreign
Relations and House Foreign Affairs Committees to discuss the urgent
need for Congress to continue supporting Ukraine as part of the global
coalition we have built. In the meeting, President Biden underscored the
importance of Congress ensuring Ukraine has the resources it
needs—including air defense and artillery capabilities—to defend itself
against Russia’s brutal invasion. The President discussed the strategic
consequences of inaction for Ukraine, the United States, and the world.
He was clear: Congress’s continued failure to act endangers the United
States’ national security, the NATO Alliance, and the rest of the free
world. The President called on Congress to quickly provide additional
funding to support Ukraine and send a strong signal of U.S. resolve. The
President also made clear that we must act now to address the challenges
at the border. He said he is encouraged by the progress being made in
the bipartisan negotiations happening in the Senate. He expressed his
commitment to reaching a bipartisan agreement on border policy and the
need for additional resources at the border. The President called on
Congress to swiftly pass his full national security supplemental.
