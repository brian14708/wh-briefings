In response to continued illegal and reckless Houthi attacks against
vessels transiting the Red Sea and surrounding waterways, the armed
forces of the United States and United Kingdom, with support from
Australia, Bahrain, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, conducted
additional strikes against eight targets in Houthi-controlled areas of
Yemen in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective
self-defense, consistent with the UN Charter.  These strikes were
designed to disrupt and degrade the capability of the Houthis to
continue their attacks on global trade and innocent mariners from around
the world, while avoiding escalation.   
  
The thirty-plus attacks that the Houthis have launched on commercial and
naval vessels since mid-November constitute a threat to all countries
that rely on international maritime shipping.  We condemn these attacks,
and demand an end to them.  We also underscore that those who supply the
Houthis with the weapons to conduct these attacks are violating UN
Security Council Resolution 2216 and international law.  The January 22
international response to the continuing Houthi attacks demonstrated
shared resolve to uphold navigational rights and freedoms, and to defend
the lives of mariners from illegal and unjustifiable attacks.
