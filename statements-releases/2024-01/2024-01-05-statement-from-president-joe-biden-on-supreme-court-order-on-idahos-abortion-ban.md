title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Supreme Court Order on Idaho\u2019\
  s Abortion\_Ban"
---
 
Today’s Supreme Court order allows Idaho’s extreme abortion ban to go
back into effect and denies women critical emergency abortion care
required by federal law. The overturning of *Roe v. Wade* has enabled
Republican elected officials to pursue dangerous abortion bans like this
one that continue to jeopardize women’s health, force them to travel out
of state for care, and make it harder for doctors to provide care,
including in an emergency. These bans are also forcing doctors to leave
Idaho and other states because of laws that interfere with their ability
to care for their patients. This should never happen in America.

The Vice President and I believe that health care decisions should be
made by women and their doctors, not politicians. We will continue to
defend a woman’s ability to access emergency care under federal law. As
this case continues, the stakes could not be higher for women across
America. Congress must immediately restore the protections of *Roe v.
Wade* so that women in every state can access the health care they need.
