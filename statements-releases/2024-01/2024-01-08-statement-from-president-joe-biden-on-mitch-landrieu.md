title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Mitch\_Landrieu"
---
 
When I passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I knew I needed someone
by my side who would help deliver real results for the American people.
I knew that Mitch Landrieu, a former Mayor and Lieutenant Governor who
spent over a decade helping rebuild New Orleans, was the man to help me
rebuild the country. Mitch has always known that the real measure of
success is not about scoring partisan points – it’s about building
bridges, and fixing the problem at hand.  
   
As my Senior Advisor, Mitch has helped oversee the most transformational
investment in American infrastructure in generations. In two years, our
Administration has announced over 40,000 infrastructure projects spread
across 4,500 communities in every state, territory, and Washington D.C.
We’ve expanded affordable high-speed internet access to over 22 million
people, and started improvements on over 135,000 miles of roads in
America.  
   
Mitch has traveled over 119,000 miles to nearly 150 cities across the
country to hear directly from communities and partner with Governors,
Mayors, members of Congress, labor, and private sector companies to help
rebuild America. Mitch has consistently demonstrated that when we work
together, we can do big things.   
   
I offer my deepest gratitude to Mitch for his leadership and for his
decades of service to the American people. I will miss his counsel
greatly.  
   
I also want to thank his wife Cheryl, his children Grace, Emily,
Matthew, Benjamin, and William, and his mother Verna, for sharing him
with us.
