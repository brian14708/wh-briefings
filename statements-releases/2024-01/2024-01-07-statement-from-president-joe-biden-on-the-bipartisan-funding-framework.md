title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Bipartisan Funding\_Framework"
---
 
The bipartisan funding framework congressional leaders have reached
moves us one step closer to preventing a needless government shutdown
and protecting important national priorities. It reflects the funding
levels that I negotiated with both parties and signed into law last
spring. It rejects deep cuts to programs hardworking families count on,
and provides a path to passing full-year funding bills that deliver for
the American people and are free of any extreme policies. I want to
thank Leaders Schumer and Jeffries for their leadership in reaching this
framework. Now, congressional Republicans must do their job, stop
threatening to shut down the government, and fulfill their basic
responsibility to fund critical domestic and national security
priorities, including my supplemental request. It’s time for them to
act.
