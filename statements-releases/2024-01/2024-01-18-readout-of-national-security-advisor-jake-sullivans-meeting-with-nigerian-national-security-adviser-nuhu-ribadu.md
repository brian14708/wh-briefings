National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Nigerian National
Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu about bilateral security cooperation,
efforts to counter terrorism in West Africa, and the importance of
respect for human rights, strengthening democratic institutions, and
good governance across the continent.  Mr. Sullivan reiterated President
Biden’s commitment to Africa and underscored the strength of the
U.S.-Nigerian relationship, including welcoming Nigeria’s strong
leadership of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). 
Mr. Sullivan also raised areas where the United States and Nigeria share
interests, particularly in supporting peace and stability in countries
that have recently experienced political transitions. Both decided to
maintain close coordination and continue to deepen our partnership to
advance shared interests.
