Recognizing the broad consensus as expressed by 44 countries around the
world on December 19, 2023, as well as the statement by the UN Security
Council on December 1, 2023, condemning Houthi attacks against merchant
and commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea, our governments issued a
joint statement on January 3, 2024, which called for the immediate end
of illegal attacks and warned that malign actors would be held
accountable should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy,
and the free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.
Despite this strong warning, attacks in the Red Sea have continued,
including the launch of numerous missiles and one-way attack aerial
vehicles against ships in the Red Sea on January 9, 2024, including U.S.
and UK vessels.  On January 10, 2024, the UN Security Council passed
UNSCR 2722, which also condemned these attacks and demanded that they
cease.  
   
In response to continued illegal, dangerous, and destabilizing Houthi
attacks against vessels, including commercial shipping, transiting the
Red Sea, the armed forces of the United States and United Kingdom, with
support from the Netherlands, Canada, Bahrain, and Australia, conducted
joint strikes in accordance with the inherent right of individual and
collective self-defense, consistent with the UN Charter, against a
number of targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.  These precision
strikes were intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities the
Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of international
mariners in one of the world’s most critical waterways.  
   
The Houthis’ more than two dozen attacks on commercial vessels since
mid-November constitute an international challenge. Today’s action
demonstrated a shared commitment to freedom of navigation, international
commerce, and defending the lives of mariners from illegal and
unjustifiable attacks.  
   
Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red
Sea, but let our message be clear: we will not hesitate to defend lives
and protect the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most
critical waterways in the face of continued threats.
