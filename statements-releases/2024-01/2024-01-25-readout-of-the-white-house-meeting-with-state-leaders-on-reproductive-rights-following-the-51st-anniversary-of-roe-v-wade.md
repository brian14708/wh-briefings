title: "Readout of the White\_House Meeting with State Leaders on Reproductive Rights\
  \ following the 51st Anniversary of Roe v.\_Wade"
---
 
Following the 51<sup>st</sup> anniversary of the Supreme Court’s
decision in *Roe v. Wade*, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President
and Director of the Gender Policy Council, and Tom Perez, Senior Advisor
to the President and Director of the White House Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs, convened state leaders who have been on the
front lines of the fight to defend reproductive rights. Today, state
legislators tuned in to hear from Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey,
Pennsylvania Speaker Joanna McClinton, Florida Leader Fentrice Driskell,
and Texas Leader Carol Alvarado on the impact of dangerous abortion bans
and their respective efforts to protect access to reproductive health
care.

President Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the vast majority
of Americans who believe that the right to choose is fundamental.
Directors Klein and Perez emphasized that state leaders are invaluable
allies in the Administration’s fight to defend reproductive freedom.

This meeting builds on more than two dozen White House-led [working
discussions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dobbs-Anniversary-States-Report-6.22.23.pdf)
with state legislators in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to
overturn *Roe v. Wade*, including an
in-person [convening](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/15/readout-of-the-white-house-state-legislative-convening-on-reproductive-rights/#:~:text=During%20the%20convening%2C%20senior%20White,work%20of%20the%20Interagency%20Task) of
more than 80 state legislators from 41 states in June 2023, as well as
ongoing collaboration with governors, who President Biden convened for a
discussion on reproductive rights in the wake of the *Dobbs* decision.
The convening comes the same week that the Vice President kicked off her
nationwide Fight for Reproductive Freedoms tour in Wisconsin, building
on her travel to 20 states and meetings with more than 250 state
legislators, health care providers, and advocates in the past year.
