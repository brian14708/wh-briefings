President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke this morning with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.  The President and Prime Minister
discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all remaining
hostages held by Hamas.  The President and the Prime Minister reviewed
the situation in Gaza and the shift to targeted operations that will
enable the flow of increasing amounts of humanitarian assistance while
keeping the military pressure on Hamas and its leaders.  The President
welcomed the decision from the Government of Israel to permit the
shipment of flour for the Palestinian people directly through Ashdod
port while our teams separately work on options for more direct maritime
delivery of assistance into Gaza.  The President also discussed the
recent progress in ensuring the Palestinian Authority’s revenues are
available to pay salaries, including for the Palestinian Security Forces
in the West Bank.  The President discussed Israel’s responsibility even
as it maintains military pressure on Hamas and its leaders to reduce
civilian harm and protect the innocent.  The President also discussed
his vision for a more durable peace and security for Israel fully
integrated within the region and a two state-solution with Israel’s
security guaranteed.
