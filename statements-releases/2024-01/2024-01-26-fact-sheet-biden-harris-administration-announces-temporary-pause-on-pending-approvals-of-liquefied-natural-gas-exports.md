title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Temporary Pause on\
  \ Pending Approvals of Liquefied Natural Gas\_Exports"
---
 
President Biden has been clear that climate change is the existential
threat of our time – and we must act with the urgency it demands to
protect the future for generations to come. That’s why, since Day One,
President Biden has led and delivered on the most ambitious climate
agenda in history, which is lowering energy costs for hardworking
Americans, creating millions of good-paying jobs, safeguarding the
health of our communities, and ensuring America leads the clean energy
future.  
   
Today, the **Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a temporary pause
on pending decisions on exports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to
non-FTA countries until the Department of Energy can update the
underlying analyses for authorizations.** The current economic and
environmental analyses DOE uses to underpin its LNG export
authorizations are roughly five years old and no longer adequately
account for considerations like potential energy cost increases for
American consumers and manufacturers beyond current authorizations or
the latest assessment of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Today,
we have an evolving understanding of the market need for LNG, the
long-term supply of LNG, and the perilous impacts of methane on our
planet. We also must adequately guard against risks to the health of our
communities, especially frontline communities in the United States who
disproportionately shoulder the burden of pollution from new export
facilities. The pause, which is subject to exception for unanticipated
and immediate national security emergencies, will provide the time to
integrate these critical considerations.  
   
The U.S. is already the number one exporter of LNG worldwide – with U.S.
LNG exports expected to double by the end of this decade. At the same
time, the U.S. remains unwavering in our commitment to supporting our
allies around the world. Today’s announcement will not impact our
ability to continue supplying LNG to our allies in the near-term. Last
year, roughly half of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe, and the U.S. has
worked with the E.U. to successfully economize consumption and manage
its storage to ensure that unprovoked acts of aggression cannot threaten
its supply. Furthermore, in 2022, the E.U and U.S. pledged to work
toward the goal of ensuring additional LNG volumes for the E.U. market –
with the U.S. exceeding our annual delivery targets to the E.U. in each
of the past two years. Through existing LNG production and export
infrastructure, the U.S. has – and will continue – to deliver for our
allies.  
   
As Republicans in Congress continue to deny the very existence of
climate change while attempting to strip their constituents of the
economic, environmental and health benefits of the President’s historic
climate investments, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to
lead the way in ambitious climate action while ensuring the American
economy remains the envy of the world.  
   
**<u>Biden-Harris Administration’s Top Climate Accomplishments:</u>**

1.  [**Signed into law the largest climate investment in history, the
    Inflation Reduction Act**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/)**,**
    which has already created 210,000 new jobs across nearly every state
    and attracted more than $200 billion in private clean energy
    investments ($365 billion since President Biden took office), while
    putting the U.S. on a path to meet our climate goals and reach 80%
    clean energy by 2030 – in addition to securing the American Rescue
    Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS and Science Act  
2.  [**Established a whole-of-government strategy to tackle methane
    emissions**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Methane-Action-Plan-2023-Topper.pdf)
    – from plugging wells and leaks in the oil and gas sector, to
    reclaiming abandoned coal mines, to reducing food waste and
    agricultural emissions, and [**finalized a historic rule to reduce
    methane
    emissions**](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-standards-slash-methane-pollution-combat-climate)
    from oil and gas operations by nearly 80%, delivering billions of

    to mobilize a new, diverse generation of Americans – putting them to
    work conserving and restoring our lands and waters, bolstering
    community resilience, deploying clean energy, implementing energy
    efficient technologies, and advancing environmental justice, all
    while creating pathways to high-quality, good-paying jobs
