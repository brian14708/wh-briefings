  \ on Pending Decisions of Liquefied Natural Gas\_Exports"
---
 
This week, the Biden-Harris Administration [announced a temporary
pause](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-temporary-pause-on-pending-approvals-of-liquefied-natural-gas-exports/)
on pending decisions for exports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). During
this period, the Department of Energy will evaluate the impacts of LNG
exports on energy costs, America‚Äôs energy security, and climate change ‚Äì
the existential threat of our time.

Since day one, President Biden has led and delivered on the most
ambitious climate agenda in history. The Biden-Harris Administration
will continue to lead the way on unprecedented climate action while
ensuring the American economy remains the envy of the world.

*Leaders from across the country praised the announcement. Here is what
they are saying:*  
  
**<u>Climate and Environmental Justice Leaders</u>**

**Ben Jealous, Executive Director, Sierra Club**: ‚ÄúPresident Biden and
Secretary Granholm‚Äôs bold step today continues this administration‚Äôs
historic efforts to meet the global commitment to phase out fossil fuels
and confront the climate crisis head on. This decision is a major win
for communities and advocates that have long spoken out about the
dangers of LNG, and makes it clear that the Biden administration is
listening to the calls to break America‚Äôs reliance on dirty fossil fuels
and secure a livable future for us all. Strong leadership, that rejects
fossil fuel industry fear mongering, is our best bet to protect
communities and ensure energy is affordable. It‚Äôs undeniable that LNG
export projects are simply not in the public interest and we are
confident that if this review is done right, that would end the
rubber-stamping of these projects. The Biden administration is making
the right choice on behalf of the planet, our communities, and our
national security.‚Äù

**Margie Alt, Director, Climate Action Campaign:** ‚ÄúPresident Biden met
this moment on climate, delivering on his promise to slash climate
pollution and take measurable steps to protect our environment and
future. If the reports are true, this decision to pause the permitting
for a massive extracted gas export facility to require the consideration
of its climate impacts is exactly the kind of leadership we need from
President Biden. Burning more extracted gas makes climate change worse
and intensifies extreme weather disasters. Standing up to big polluters
and putting people before profits, is what the president promised and
what the president is delivering.‚Äù
\[[Statement](https://www.actonclimate.com/post/cacs-margie-alt-on-delay-of-gas-export-terminal-approval/),

**Former Vice President Al Gore, Founder, The Climate Reality Project:**
‚ÄúWorld leaders agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at the COP28
climate negotiations last year and President Biden‚Äôs decision today to
pause new permits for LNG exports shows that he is taking that pledge
seriously. If we want to enhance energy security, create jobs, and
prevent environmental injustice, we should be making investments in
cheaper, readily available renewable energy, not dirty and damaging
fossil fuels.‚Äù

**Manish Bapna, President and CEO, Natural Resources Defense Council:**
‚ÄúThis is the right call. The stakes could not be higher ‚Äì for the
climate, U.S. leadership and our future. The administration needs to
pause and get the facts. These are dangerous projects that would lock in
decades more dependence on the fossil fuels driving us toward climate
catastrophe.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be clear about the public interest. It‚Äôs time to phase out fossil
fuels. That‚Äôs what the United States and 197 other countries agreed to
do last month in Dubai. That‚Äôs what the science demands. Vast industrial
projects to export these dirty and dangerous fuels far into the future
have no place in a climate-safe world \[‚Ä¶\] What‚Äôs needed is a pause, so
the administration can sharpen its tools. We need an open and
transparent process for determining how best to assess these critical
concerns. The public deserves to be heard on how our government decides
whether projects are in the public interest.‚Äù

1/26/24\]

**Natural Resources Defense Council:** ‚ÄúAs the Biden administration
decides the future of massive new projects that would expand future
exports of liquified natural gas, it is pausing a huge swath of new
export permits. It‚Äôs a key step toward phasing out the fossil fuels
powering climate change + polluting communities.‚Äù
\[[Tweet](https://x.com/NRDC/status/1750929866696876353?s=20), 1/26/24\]

**Gene Karpinski, President, League of Conservation Voters:** ‚ÄúThis is
huge. The Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs decision to take a deeper look
at all the impacts of LNG exports is a major step forward towards
protecting our families, our communities, and our climate,‚Äù said LCV
President Gene Karpinski. ‚ÄúThis decision sends a clear signal that the
administration is taking the global commitment reached in December to
transition away from fossil fuels seriously. No president has done more
on climate, from day one executive orders to the historic investments in
the Inflation Reduction Act to today‚Äôs announcement, President Biden is
slashing climate pollution, increasing affordable, renewable energy, and
transitioning away from fossil fuels.

Exporting LNG is harmful to our environment, our economy, and our
communities. Continuing to allow the massive expansion of this industry
would mean even more toxic pollution and higher energy bills for
communities across the country who are already overburdened by pollution
and energy costs, and would make it nearly impossible for the world to
reach its climate goals. Meanwhile Big Oil is willing to say and spend
anything to pad their already record profits. Our future must be powered
by clean energy, not the polluting, volatile, and unreliable fossil
fuels of the past.‚Äù \[[Press

**Elida Castillo, Program Director, Chispa Texas:** ‚ÄúWe thank the
Biden-Harris administration for listening to our communities
experiencing the devastating impacts of massive oil and gas exports
firsthand. This is a hopeful and critical step forward to prioritize
people over polluters for our future generations and our communities
along the Gulf coast. After record-breaking heat across the country last
year, this major action is crucial to combat the climate crisis and
environmental injustice, especially for our communities most harmed by
toxic pollution from oil and gas extraction. For too long, Big Polluters
have been allowed to export more fossil fuels year after year regardless
of the cost to communities who are living with even more consequences
from toxic pollution, consumers across the country already facing higher
costs and unreliable energy sources, and more impacted communities by
our reliance on fossil fuels. Despite what Big Oil wants us to believe,
renewables are bringing down the energy costs for everyone. This is the
path to a more sustainable and equitable clean energy future that
stabilizes our economy and supports our domestic energy security.‚Äù

**Abigail Dillen, President, Earthjustice:** ‚ÄúWe applaud the Biden
administration for taking this tremendously important step to align its
decision-making on gas exports with U.S. climate goals. As communities
across the country face the devastating impacts of the climate crisis
and fossil fuel pollution, it‚Äôs never been clearer that rubber-stamping
LNG exports is not in the public interest. We look forward to working
with the Department of Energy to make sure that the environmental and
economic risks of LNG exports are fully accounted for when it makes
public interest determinations.‚Äù

**Laura Jay, North America Regional Director, C40 Cities:** ‚ÄúThe
devastating impacts of climate breakdown are here. Urban residents, and
particularly frontline communities, are experiencing the harmful
consequences of fossil fuel pollution, from extreme heat and storms to
rising energy costs, every day. At COP28, C40 mayors called on national
governments to rapidly phase out the use of fossil fuels. In the final
agreement, countries agreed to ‚Äòtransition away‚Äô from fossil fuels.
Today‚Äôs action gives life to that promise.

The decision by the Biden Administration today to pause new LNG export
facilities is a welcome and necessary recognition of the urgent need to
protect the health, safety, and economic well-being of our communities
by shifting to a clean energy future. It is a critical step in the
global phase-out of fossil fuels and will accelerate the clean energy
market both in the United States and around the world.‚Äù

**Lori Lodes, Executive Director, Climate Power:** ‚ÄúPresident Biden has
done more to protect our planet and build a booming clean energy economy
that ends our reliance on dirty fossil fuels than any other president in
history. The president‚Äôs action today is a historic move to protect the
health and economic security of our nation from corporate polluters and
address the global threat of a very real climate crisis. Make no
mistake, if it were up to Donald Trump, these dangerous oil and gas
projects would be rushed forward ‚Äî exporting fossil fuels overseas,
increasing our energy costs, and spewing toxic pollution. At every turn,
MAGA Republicans are working to tie America‚Äôs future to costly,

**Wenonah Hauter, Executive Director, Food & Water Watch:** ‚ÄúGiven the
massive volume of LNG currently being exported, and the numerous

**WeAct for Environmental Justice:** ‚ÄúThis necessary and crucial
reevaluation on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals with a focus on
DOE‚Äôs public interest determination is a step in the right direction,
and we hope that this gives the Administration the space to partner with
advocates to fully analyze the impact of the U.S. LNG policy on
communities that are burdened with fossil fuel infrastructure and
pollution. WE ACT was one of the first environmental justice groups to
call for a pause on LNG projects and for the Administration to broaden
the scope of the public interest reviews to address cumulative impacts.
We have been strong on this front sharing our concerns and expertise
with federal agencies, submitting comments, and standing with frontline

**Roishetta Ozane, Director and Founder, The Vessel Project
(Louisiana):** ‚ÄúThis announcement from the Biden Administration is truly
monumental for our communities. As someone who has witnessed the
devastating impacts of fossil fuel extractive industries, I am filled
with hope and gratitude for this important step towards justice. Halting
permits for these industries is a clear acknowledgment of the urgent
need to protect the well-being and rights of those of us who have been
disproportionately affected. It is a powerful statement that we can no
longer allow these industries to continue operating without considering
the health and safety of the people living in these areas. However, it
is crucial to remember that this is just the beginning of a long
journey.

While this decision is a significant victory, we must not become
complacent. The fight for environmental justice and the elimination of
fossil fuel extractive industries must continue. We must remain vigilant
and continue to advocate for sustainable alternatives. We cannot afford
to let up in our efforts to hold decision-makers accountable and ensure
that frontline communities are no longer subjected to the harmful
effects of these industries. This announcement is a reason to celebrate,

under the Paris agreement, this pause needs to become permanent. Global
climate bodies have long been warning us that if we want to achieve net
zero by 2050 and secure a peaceful and livable planet we must stop new
oil and gas. Despite what the industry might have you believe, LNG is
dirty polluting fossil fuel that is contributing to the climate
emergency ‚Äì our biggest existential threat ‚Äì and it needs to be stopped.
LNG is not a transition fuel, and the US does not need new gas
production facilities, LNG terminals and exports, and importing
geographies like the EU don‚Äôt need its gas. The best way to secure a
safe global energy system, and avert the climate crisis, is to
supercharge the rollout of renewables like solar and wind and increase

platforms larger than football fields. What used to be the headquarters
of our nation‚Äôs seafood industry has all but been destroyed by gas
export terminals, for which the fossil fuel industry has dredged large
stretches of the Gulf and turned our rivers into shipping channels for

‚ÄúIt is long past time for the federal government to modernize how it
determines whether the climate, environmental justice, and consumer cost
impacts of LNG exports are in everyday Americans‚Äô best interest. Since
low-income and communities of color are impacted first and hardest by
the effects of climate chaos, it is important that frontline communities
are meaningfully and proactively engaged throughout environmental
reviews. The administration‚Äôs pause included a much-needed public
comment period, and it‚Äôs critical that communities directly affected by
the proposed LNG terminals and other fossil gas infrastructure are given
the opportunity to meaningfully engage in this process.

‚ÄúThis is also about American leadership globally. If we want to avoid
catastrophic warming, we need to stop expanding fossil fuel
infrastructure now. Exporting fossil gas cannot be part of U.S. climate
policy‚Äîit obliterates our climate goals and undermines our international
climate leadership. The National Climate Assessment not only highlighted
the damage climate chaos has already done to our communities, it
reaffirmed that things will get worse in the future, if we don‚Äôt act

‚ÄúThis is a great step in the right direction. But we can‚Äôt underestimate

best interest of our country and national security. Amid the oil and gas
industry‚Äôs ongoing push to keep raking in record profits, LNG exports
have devolved from an asset for our allies to a serious national
security vulnerability. Europe‚Äôs need for gas has been met and is
declining, but greedy CEOs are pushing to keep their cash cow going by
selling US LNG to our adversaries in record numbers. Before it has even
been built, LNG from the CP2 facility is already contracted to go to
Chinese companies. To put it plainly, letting China buy up huge
quantities of American LNG and leverage it to expand their influence
over the global energy market is a serious risk to our national
security; one that could harm our ability to sufficiently respond in
moments of crisis. Coupled with the fact that they greatly exacerbate
climate change and the challenges it poses to the safety and security of
our nation‚Äôs military personnel around the globe, LNG exports must be
assessed for their risks across the board. The Biden Administration is
making the prudent move for our national security and our nation by
pausing new approvals and looking closely at the risks involved with the
ongoing LNG buildout.‚Äù

**Tyson Slocum, Energy Program Director, Public Citizen:** ‚ÄúFor far too
long, Big Oil executives have pursued an ‚ÄòAmerica Last‚Äô policy, price
gouging consumers, pushing harmful export policies, in a myopic and
ham-fisted vision that puts profit above everything. Reconsidering the
impact fossil fuel exports have on our economy and climate is a vital
step toward protecting American households from the impact LNG exports
have on higher utility bills. Eighty-five years ago, Congress mandated
that natural gas exports must be ‚Äòconsistent with the public interest,‚Äô
and the federal government‚Äôs current approval process ignores the
overwhelming evidence that LNG exports expose American families to
higher energy costs, pollute communities of color, and spew greenhouse
gas emissions that imperil our climate.‚Äù \[Statement, 1/26/24\]

**Public Citizen:** ‚ÄúBREAKING: Biden paused all pending LNG export
projects! Big Oil‚Äôs exports have raised energy bills for tens of
millions of American families. Pausing export reviews will ensure we
don‚Äôt bear the brunt of Big Oil‚Äôs profiteering. This is huge.‚Äù
