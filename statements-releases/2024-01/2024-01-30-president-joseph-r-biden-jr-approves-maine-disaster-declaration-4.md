title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Maine Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Maine and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by a severe storm and flooding from December 17 to December 21,
2023.  
   
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Androscoggin, Franklin, Kennebec, Oxford,
and Somerset.  
   
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
   
Federal funding also is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storm and flooding in the counties of
Androscoggin, Franklin, Hancock, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis,
Somerset, Waldo, and Washington.  
   
Finally, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
   
Mr. William F. Roy of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.   
   
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional
counties may be designated for assistance after the assessments are
fully completed.  
   
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at www.DisasterAssistance.gov,
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
