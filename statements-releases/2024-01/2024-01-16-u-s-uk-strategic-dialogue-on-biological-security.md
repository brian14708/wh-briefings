title: "U.S. \u2013 UK Strategic Dialogue on Biological\_Security"
---
 
Building on the June 10, 2021 New Atlantic Charter and the June 8, 2023
Atlantic Declaration on Economic Security, the U.S. National Security
Council and the UK Cabinet Office announced a new Strategic Dialogue on
Biological Security during a launch event today.  

Underpinned by the [UK Biological Security
Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-biological-security-strategy)
and the [U.S. National Biodefense
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/National-Biodefense-Strategy-and-Implementation-Plan-Final.pdf),
this Strategic Dialogue reflects a shared ambition to bolster future
heath and economic resilience against a growing and diverse spectrum of
biological threats.

The Strategic Dialogue reaffirms both nations’ commitment to increase
collaboration in the following ways:

-   Develop a shared understanding of research and development (R&D)
    needs at the onset of new disease outbreaks, allowing for improved
    responsiveness by shaping global R&D efforts and supporting early
    technology assessments.
-   Adopt a One Health approach to biosurveillance and biological threat
    detection, in support of international efforts to develop stronger
    and more interconnected global surveillance capabilities.
-   Pursue the development of new tools and methodologies for microbial
    forensics and attribution.
-   Promote responsible innovation in the biotechnology, health, and
    life sciences sectors, shaping global norms and standards on
    biosafety and biosecurity while simultaneously protecting burgeoning
    bio-economies.
-   Facilitate the development of next-generation vaccines and
    therapeutics, in line with the 100-Days Mission vision supported by
    G7 leaders in Carbis Bay in 2021 and reaffirmed at the 2023 G7
    Summit in Hiroshima.
-   Strengthen coordination of efforts to counter biological threats,
    including developing joint measures to address Biological and Toxin
    Weapons Convention compliance.
