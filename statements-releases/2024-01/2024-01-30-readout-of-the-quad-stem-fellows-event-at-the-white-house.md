title: "Readout of the Quad STEM Fellows Event at the White\_House"
---
 
On Tuesday, Quad STEM fellows gathered at the White House for an event
to welcome a successful first year of the fellowship and mark the launch
of applications for the second class of Quad Fellows. The
first-of-its-kind fellowship was launched by Quad Leaders to bring
together exceptional masters and doctoral students in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics to study in the United States.

Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer gave keynote
remarks, and other senior administration officials addressed the group
of fellows, in addition to senior representatives from the embassies of
Quad countries and supporters of the program. During the event, they
discussed the Quad and geopolitical landscape; the Administration’s tech
agenda for the Indo-Pacific; and the importance of public service.

The International Institute for Education (IIE), a global non-profit
with decades-long experience managing international fellowship programs
including the U.S. Department of State Fulbright program, is serving as
the new implementing partner of the Quad Fellowship program. Today, IIE
announced an expansion of eligibility for the Fellowship to include
students from ASEAN countries, further demonstrating the Quad’s
commitment to deliver concrete benefits for the Indo-Pacific region.

Launched at the Quad Leaders’ Summit in 2021, the Quad Fellowship
provides a scholarship to STEM graduate students from Quad countries
studying in the U.S. and remains a priority for the Quad leaders as we
grow our ties among our next generation of innovators.
