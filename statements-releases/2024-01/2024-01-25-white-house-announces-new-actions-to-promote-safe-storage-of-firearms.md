Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new executive
actions to help promote safe storage of firearms that implement
President Biden’s [Executive
Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence-and-make-our-communities-safer/) on
promoting safe gun storage in order to reduce gun violence and make our
communities safer.

Gun violence is the [leading
cause](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/2022-05/2020-gun-deaths-in-the-us-4-28-2022-b.pdf) of
death of children in America. That is why the Biden-Harris
Administration is taking comprehensive action to prevent gun violence
affecting children. Approximately [4.6 million
children](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789269) live
in homes with unsecured firearms. Studies show that safe storage can
dramatically reduce children’s risk of [self-inflicted
harm](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200330) and [unintentional
shootings](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2733158).  
  
Safe storage of firearms can physically prevent youth from accessing
firearms, helping to keep youth, schools, and communities safe from gun
violence. Unsecured guns are also closely associated with school
shootings, youth suicide, unintentional shootings, and theft of
firearms.

-   **76 percent** of [school
    shootings](https://www.secretservice.gov/data/protection/ntac/usss-analysis-of-targeted-school-violence.pdf) are
    committed with guns from the home. The Department of Homeland
    Security’s National Threat Assessment Center reviewed targeted
    school violence over the past 40 years and found
    that [three-quarters of school
    shooters](https://www.secretservice.gov/data/protection/ntac/usss-analysis-of-targeted-school-violence.pdf) acquired
    their firearm from the home of a parent or close relative.
-   **80 percent** of firearm suicides by children (age 18 or younger)
    involved a [gun belonging to a family
    member](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21198329/). The firearm
    suicide rate among children and teens
    has [increased](https://everytownresearch.org/stat/the-firearm-suicide-rate-among-children-and-teens-has-increased-by-59-percent/) by
    66 percent over the past decade.
-   **76 percent **of unintentional shootings of children were committed
    with [unsecured guns from the
    home](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/pdfs/mm7250a1-H.pdf),
    most often stored in nightstands or other sleeping areas. From 2003
    to 2021, 1,262 children (0-17 years) were killed by fatal
    unintentional firearm injury, with approximately half caused by
    another person.
-   **Over 1 million stolen firearms. **The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
    Firearms, and Explosives
    (ATF) [reported](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/nfcta-volume-ii-part-v-firearm-thefts/download) that
    from 2017 to 2021, local law enforcement reported 770,642 private
    theft incidents involving 1,026,538 firearms. A [rising
    trend](https://everytownresearch.org/gun-thefts-from-cars-the-largest-source-of-stolen-guns/) has
    been firearms stolen from unattended motor vehicles.

**New Actions to Reduce Gun Violence and Save Lives**  
  
Local leaders, like school officials, community and faith leaders, and
law enforcement can be trusted, credible messengers when it comes to
providing guidance on gun violence prevention and safe firearm storage
options. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing three
actions to help further promote safe storage and protect children:

-   The U.S. Department of Education will take new action on safe
    firearm storage by sending [a letter to school
    principals](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/secletter/012524.html) across
    the country explaining the importance of safe storage and
    encouraging them to communicate with parents, families, caregivers,
    and the broader community about how safe storage can protect
    students in school and in their communities.
-   The U.S. Department of Education will also issue a [new
    communications
    template](https://rems.ed.gov/docs/Safe-Firearm-Storage) that
    principals and school leaders can use to engage with parents and
    families about the importance of safe firearm storage, and encourage
    more people to take preventive action by safely storing firearms.
-   The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will release [a guide to safe
    storage of
    firearms](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DOJ-Safe-Firearm-Storage-Guide.pdf) in
    order to provide subject matter expertise on different types of
    storage devices and best practices for safely storing firearms. This
    is the most comprehensive guide on safe storage ever released by the
    federal government.

To highlight these new actions, First Lady Jill Biden, White House
Office of Gun Violence Prevention Director Stefanie Feldman and U.S.
Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will join a town hall with school
principals at the White House. The town hall will elevate the importance
of safe firearms storage and emphasize the role that principals and
education leaders can play in helping prevent gun violence. A livestream
of the town hall is available here: [School Principals Town Hall with
the Office of Gun Violence Prevention & the Department of Education –

**Building on a Record of Action to Promote Safe Storage of Firearms**  
  
These new actions build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment
to promoting safe storage of firearms, including:

-   The Administration’s [launch of an unprecedented
    focus](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/02/fact-sheet-biden-administration-takes-steps-to-prevent-suicide-including-by-promoting-safe-storage-of-firearms/) on
    lethal means safety in the White House strategy to reduce military
    and veteran suicide, with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
    also launching the first of its kind paid media
    campaign, [KeepItSecure.net](https://www.va.gov/reach/lethal-means/)
    to highlight the importance of firearm safe storage in preventing
    veteran suicide. The Department of Defense (DoD)
    also [released](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2998717/dod-safe-handling-storage-of-lethal-means-key-to-suicide-prevention/) new
    evidence-informed communication tools, including a public service
    announcement, to encourage safe storage among military service
    members and their families.
-   The issuing of a [new ATF final
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/04/2021-28398/secure-gun-storage-and-definition-of-antique-firearm#:~:text=This%20rule%20amends%20ATF%27s%20regulations%20to%20account%20for,are%20sold%20under%20the%20license%20to%20nonlicensed%20individuals.) clarifying
    firearms dealers’ statutory obligations to make available for
    purchase gun storage or safety devices compatible with the dealer’s
    firearm inventory.
-   The publishing by ATF of [an open
    letter](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/open-letter/all-ffls-july-2023-open-letter-safe-storage/download) to
    all federal firearms licensees on their legal obligations if they
    choose to provide temporary storage options on their premise.
-   The DOJ announcement of new grant funds available through its [STOP
    School Violence
    Program](https://bja.ojp.gov/funding/O-BJA-2023-171666.pdf) for
    schools to promote awareness of safe storage.  The DOJ’s Byrne State
    Crisis Intervention Program [made grant funds
    available](https://bja.ojp.gov/funding/O-BJA-2023-171458.pdf) for
    law enforcement to acquire gun locks and storage devices that can be
    distributed to individuals and businesses.
-   The release of a [statement by the Assistant
    Secretary](https://www.samhsa.gov/blog/lethal-means-safety-suicide-prevention) of
    the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration bringing
    attention to lethal means safety, and particularly safe storage of
    firearms, as a critical component of comprehensive suicide
    prevention efforts.
-   The publishing of a [Vital Signs Report on Firearm
    Safety](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/firearm-deaths/index.html) by
    the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) highlighting the growing
    disparities in firearm violence, including firearm-related suicide
    and emphasized the importance of lethal mean safety. CDC also
    published a [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
    Report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7250a1.htm) examining
    unintentional injury among children and teens that emphasized the
    role of unsecured firearms and how safe storage can prevent harm.

The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to take action to promote
safe storage and calls on Congress to assist these efforts by passing a
national safe storage law to create accountability for those who leave
firearms unsecured. In addition, the Administration is working with
state and local leaders on safe storage efforts.  
  
In December, Vice President Harris, the Office of Gun Violence
Prevention and the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs convened 100
state legislators to announce the Biden-Harris Administration’s [Safer
States
Initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/13/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-the-biden-harris-administration-safer-states-initiative-highlights-new-executive-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence/) to
reduce gun violence and save lives. The Administration urged states to
enact and implement strong laws requiring firearms owners to safely
store their firearms in their homes and vehicles. The laws should impose
a clear standard to penalize those who do not safely store their weapons
and whose weapons end up being used for violence.

-   States were also encouraged to invest in efforts that raise
    awareness of the range of safe storage options available to keep
    guns out of the hands of children and unauthorized individuals, and
    fund individuals’ access to effective storage options through tax
    incentives and other programs.
-   In addition, the Department of Justice [published model safe storage
    legislation](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-12/Safe%20Storage%20Model%20Legislation.pdf) to
    help states craft appropriate requirements for securing firearms
    kept in residences and vehicles and to ensure that those firearms do
    not fall into the hands of children, teens, and prohibited persons.

While safe gun storage is an important factor in curtailing death and
injuries among children, the Biden-Harris Administration, through the
American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and other
grant programs, has also provided unprecedented funding to establish
safe, healthy, and supportive learning opportunities and environments;
to increase access to school-based mental health services; and to
strengthen the pipeline of mental health professionals in high-need
communities. These historic investments provide greater access to the
services and supports that help keep students safe and healthy. These
investments help advance the President’s Mental Health Strategy, which
directly implements his Unity Agenda for the nation by helping to tackle
the mental health crisis.
