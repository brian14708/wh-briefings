title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Today\u2019s Justice Department\
  \ Report on the Uvalde School Shooting\_Response"
---
 
We will never forget the 19 children and two teachers who were killed in
their classrooms during a senseless mass shooting carried out with a
weapon of war. In the days and months since they lost their lives and 17
others were injured, the families in Uvalde have channeled their anguish
into advocacy – demanding accountability, justice, and action to change
the unacceptable fact that gun violence is the leading cause of death
for children in our nation.  
  
With their help, President Biden and I fought to pass the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30
years. Working with gun safety organizers and advocates including young
leaders across the country, we have also taken more executive action to
reduce gun violence than any other Administration in history. This
includes establishing the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence
Prevention. But we know more must be done.  
  
Today’s devastating report by the Justice Department makes it clear that
there were multiple failures in Uvalde that hold urgent lessons for our
nation, and our Administration remains committed to ensuring that
communities have the resources and support they need to respond more
effectively.  
  
As we do so, I am continuing to call on Congress and state legislators
throughout America to have the courage to act by banning assault weapons
and high-capacity magazines, passing red flag laws, and making
background checks universal. These commonsense solutions will save lives
and ensure that fewer children, families, and communities experience the
trauma and pain that Uvalde has suffered.
