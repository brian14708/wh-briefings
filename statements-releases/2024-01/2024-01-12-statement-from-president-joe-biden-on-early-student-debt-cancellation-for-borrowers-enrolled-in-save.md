title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Early Student Debt Cancellation for\
  \ Borrowers Enrolled in\_SAVE"

From Day One of my Administration, I vowed to fix the student loan
system and make sure higher education is a pathway to the middle class –
not a barrier to opportunity. Already, my Administration has cancelled
student debt for 3.6 million Americans through various actions –
delivering lifechanging relief to students and families, and we created
the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever: the SAVE plan.

I am proud that my Administration is implementing one of the most
impactful provisions of the SAVE plan nearly six months ahead of
schedule. Starting next month, borrowers enrolled in SAVE who took out
less than $12,000 in loans and have been in repayment for 10 years will
get their remaining student debt cancelled immediately. This action will
particularly help community college borrowers, low-income borrowers, and
those struggling to repay their loans. And, it’s part of our ongoing
efforts to act as quickly as possible to give more borrowers breathing
room so they can get out from under the burden of student loan debt,
move on with their lives and pursue their dreams.

I encourage all borrowers who may be eligible for early debt
cancellation to sign up for the SAVE plan at studentaid.gov. Already,
6.9 million borrowers are enrolled in the plan, and 3.9 million have a
$0 monthly payment.

Today’s announcement builds on all we’ve been able to achieve for
students and student loan borrowers in the past few years.  This
includes: fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that
borrowers who go into public service get the debt relief they’re
entitled to under the law; achieving the largest increases in Pell
Grants in over a decade to help families who earn less than roughly
$60,000 a year; and holding colleges accountable for leaving students
with unaffordable debts. And, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s
decision on our student debt relief plan, we are continuing to pursue an
alternative path to deliver student debt relief to as many borrowers as
possible as quickly as possible. I won’t back down from using every tool
at our disposal to get student loan borrowers the relief they need to
reach their dreams.
