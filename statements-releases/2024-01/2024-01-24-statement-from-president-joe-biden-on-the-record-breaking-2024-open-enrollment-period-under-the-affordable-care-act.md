title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Record-Breaking 2024 Open Enrollment\
  \ Period Under the Affordable Care\_Act"

Today, we broke another record when it comes to lowering costs and
ensuring Americans have access to quality, affordable healthcare: 21.3
million Americans have signed up for health coverage through Affordable
Care Act marketplaces. That means 9 million more people have gained
coverage under the law – and peace of mind – since I took office. It’s
no accident. My actions to protect the Affordable Care Act and lower
premiums continue to make a big difference. And the American people have
made it clear: they don’t want the Affordable Care Act weakened and
repealed – they want it strengthened and protected.

We need to build on the progress we’ve made by making lower premiums
permanent.  But Republicans in Congress have a different vision. Their
recent budget would get rid of the improvements I signed into law,
raising costs for millions of people. Over the last decade, extreme
Republicans in Congress have blocked efforts to lower health care costs,
and they’re still trying to end the Affordable Care Act, just as my
predecessor tried and failed to do. Repealing the Affordable Care Act
would throw these 21 million people off their coverage, and end Medicaid
coverage for millions more. It would return to the days when insurance
companies could rip Americans off by denying coverage based on
pre-existing conditions, charge women more than men, and make older
adults pay astronomical health care premiums based on their age. We must
not and will not go back.

If the extreme Republicans in Congress get their way, millions of
families would face skyrocketing health care costs or lose their health
care altogether. I won’t let it happen on my watch, and I’ll keep
fighting to bring down health care and prescription drug costs.
