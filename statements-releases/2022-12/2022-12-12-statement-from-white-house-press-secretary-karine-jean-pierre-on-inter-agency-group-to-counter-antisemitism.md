title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Inter-Agency\
  \ Group to Counter\_Antisemitism"
---
 
As President Biden has made clear: antisemitism has no place in America.
All Americans should forcefully reject antisemitism – including
Holocaust denial – wherever it exists.

The President is establishing an inter-agency group led by Domestic
Policy Council staff and National Security Council staff to increase and
better coordinate U.S. Government efforts to counter antisemitism,
Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination within the
United States. The President has tasked the inter-agency group, as its
first order of business, to develop a national strategy to counter
antisemitism. This strategy will raise understanding about antisemitism
and the threat it poses to the Jewish community and all Americans,
address antisemitic harassment and abuse both online and offline, seek
to prevent antisemitic attacks and incidents, and encourage
whole-of-society efforts to counter antisemitism and build a more
inclusive nation.

We look forward to working with advocates, civil rights leaders, civil
society, and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to continue
countering the scourge of antisemitism.
