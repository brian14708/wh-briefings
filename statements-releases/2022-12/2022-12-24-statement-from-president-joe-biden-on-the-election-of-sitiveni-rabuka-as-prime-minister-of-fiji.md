title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Election of Sitiveni Rabuka as\
  \ Prime Minister of\_Fiji"

I congratulate Sitiveni Rabuka on becoming the new Prime Minister of
Fiji. As close partners, Fiji and the United States work together to
advance an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, prosperous, and secure.
Together, we have also made progress on key challengesâ€”including
promoting sustainable economic recovery, tackling climate change, and
curbing illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. In the years
ahead, I look forward to continuing to strengthen the bonds between our
people and advance our shared vision for a peaceful and prosperous
Indo-Pacific.
