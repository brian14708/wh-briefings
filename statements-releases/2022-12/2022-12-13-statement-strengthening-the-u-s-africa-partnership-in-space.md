---
 
On December 13, 2022, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit featured the
first-ever U.S.-Africa Space Forum.  The Forum reaffirmed the United
States’ commitment to collaborating with African partners on the
peaceful use and exploration of outer space to meet shared priorities
for here on Earth.  The Forum highlighted the U.S.-Africa space
partnership and cooperation to address 21st century challenges and
opportunities, including responding to the climate, biodiversity, and
global food crises; promoting responsible behavior in outer space; and
reinforcing U.S.-African scientific and commercial space cooperation. 
Participants in the Forum committed to deepening the U.S.-Africa space
partnership across all sectors.  
   
The Forum celebrated the signing of the Artemis Accords by Nigeria and
Rwanda, making them the first African signatories.  The Artemis Accords
are a set of principles to guide the next phase in space exploration,
reinforcing and providing for important operational implementation of
key obligations in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.  The Accords affirm the
importance of implementing best practices and norms of responsible
behavior as well as compliance with the Registration Convention and the
Rescue and Return Agreement.  
   
Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim, Minister of Communications and Digital
Economy, signed the Artemis Accords on behalf of Nigeria, while Francis
Ngabo, CEO of Rwanda Space Agency, signed the Accords on behalf of
Rwanda.  They were joined on the U.S. side by Assistant Secretary of
State Monica Medina, Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), Bill Nelson, and Executive Secretary of the
National Space Council, Chirag Parikh.  With their signatures, 23
nations have signed the Artemis Accords.  
   
The Forum also discussed the role of the private sector in supporting
U.S.-Africa space partnership.  A number of U.S. companies have recently
announced new investments in the U.S.-Africa partnership, including: 

-   The Rwanda Space Agency and ATLAS Space Operations have partnered to
    bring a teleport and large satellite antenna to the global space
    community.
-   Planet Labs PBC is investing across Africa with a range of
    stakeholders to deliver daily satellite imagery and geospatial
    solutions that help meet sustainability, economic, and resource
    management priorities, including supporting decision making on
    drought risk protection, forest management, and renewable energy. 
    Kenyan company ZEP-RE just announced that it will use Planet’s
    satellite imagery as it works with the World Bank on drought risk
    protection in the Horn of Africa. In furtherance of Nigeria’s goal
    of providing all of its citizens broadband access by 2025, Nigeria
    announced that SpaceX’s high-speed, low latency broadband service
    Starlink is now available in the country, making Nigeria the first
    country in Africa where Starlink is available.
-   Zipline is drawing upon space data to expand its aerial logistics
    services to more government sectors in Rwanda, including the health,
    agriculture, finance, e-commerce and tourism divisions, and will
    conduct nearly two million instant deliveries across Rwanda by 2029.
