title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Four Year Anniversary\
  \ of Paul Whelan\u2019s Wrongful\_Detention"
---
 
Today marks four years of wrongful detention in Russia for American Paul
Whelan and, as the President and I have told the Whelan family, we will
not stop, we will not relent, we will not cease until all Americans can
celebrate Paul’s return. Paul and the Whelan family recently showed the
entire country the meaning of generosity of spirit in celebrating a
fellow American’s return while Russia continues its deplorable treatment
of Paul as a bargaining chip. I am grateful for the partnership of the
Whelan family as we work to reunite them with Paul. And I am thinking
about them, and about Paul, on this day, especially.
