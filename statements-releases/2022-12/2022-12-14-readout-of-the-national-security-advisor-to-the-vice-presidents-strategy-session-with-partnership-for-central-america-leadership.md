title: "Readout of the National Security Advisor to the Vice President\u2019s Strategy\
  \ Session with Partnership for Central America Leadership"
---
 
National Security Advisor to the Vice President Dr. Phil Gordon hosted a
strategy session today with Partnership for Central America (PCA)
leaders, CEOs from companies that have responded to the Vice President’s
Call to Action for Northern Central America, and a team of senior U.S.
government officials. Building off the more than $3.2 billion in
investments mobilized during the first year of the Vice President’s Call
to Action initiative, the participants discussed an updated framework
for driving progress under our collaborative partnership. Meeting
participants discussed next steps in the Call to Action, including
efforts to advance good governance, anti-corruption, and labor
priorities under the broader U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of
Migration. They also explored ways the U.S. government could further
support private sector investments in response to the Call to Action.
