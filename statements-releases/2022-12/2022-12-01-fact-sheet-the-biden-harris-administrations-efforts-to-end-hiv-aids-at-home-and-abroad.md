On World AIDS Day, we reflect on all those lost globally and in the U.S.
from AIDS-related illnesses, honor the more than 38 million individuals
living with HIV, and celebrate the remarkable gains we have made
battling this disease. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed
to implementing the updated [National HIV/AIDS
Strategy](https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/national-hiv-aids-strategy/national-hiv-aids-strategy-2022-2025) (NHAS)
announced last year and achieving the bipartisan goal of ending the HIV
epidemic at home and abroad. The Administration is also releasing a [new
strategy](https://www.state.gov/pepfar-five-year-strategy-2022) to guide
the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) globally. Over
the past year, the Administration has taken action to:  
  
**Accelerate our Domestic HIV Efforts**

-   **Launching the NHAS Federal Implementation Plan.** In August 2022,
    the White House Office of National AIDS Policy (ONAP) released
    the [NHAS Federal Implementation
    Plan](https://files.hiv.gov/s3fs-public/2022-09/NHAS_Federal_Implementation_Plan.pdf),
    detailing more than 380 actions agencies are implementing to meet
    NHAS goals.
-   **Implementing the *Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) in the
    U.S.* initiative.** The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS)
    initiated [EHE](https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/overview) in
    2019 to provide a targeted infusion of funds and resources to
    populations and regions with the greatest need. EHE advances
    innovative, community-driven solutions that leverage scientific
    advances in HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and outbreak. It
    also works to address racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities. As
    part of EHE implementation, federal agencies have been awarded
    funding to support equitable access to HIV services for people with
    and at risk of HIV.
-   **Requesting unprecedented investments to end the HIV epidemic.** In
    his FY2023 budget proposal, President Biden requested $850 million
    to aggressively reduce new HIV cases by increasing access to HIV
    prevention and care programs and ensuring equitable access to
    support services. The budget also proposed the creation of a 10-year
    $9.8 billion National PrEP Program to guarantee PrEP at no cost for
    all uninsured and underinsured individuals, provide essential
    wrap-around services through states and localities, and establish a
    network of community providers to reach underserved areas and
    populations.

**Respond to HIV/AIDS Globally**  
  
Over the last 20 years, PEPFAR has saved 25 million lives and helped
pave a brighter future for people living with HIV/AIDS. The
Administration has taken action over the past year to build on that
impact, including:

-   **Releasing a new five-year strategy.** Ahead of its
    20<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2023, PEPFAR is releasing a new
    five-year strategy to reinvigorate the U.S. global HIV/AIDS
    response. The strategy, *[Fulfilling America’s Promise to End the
    HIV/AIDS Pandemic by
    2030](https://www.state.gov/pepfar-five-year-strategy-2022)*, will
    focus on enhancing collaboration and partnership to confront the
    challenge of fighting HIV/AIDS as a security threat in the wake of
    other emerging health threats.
-   **Leading the largest ever Global Fund Replenishment. **President
    Biden led an historic seventh replenishment for the Global Fund to
    Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, raising $15.7 billion in donor
    pledges to date. Those resources will be used to get the world back
    on track toward ending HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria by 2030 and
    building more resilient health systems around the world.
-   **Leveraging PEPFAR to support public health and fight COVID-19 and
    mpox.** PEPFAR platforms are helping countries and communities
    protect and advance global HIV/AIDS gains while building more
    resilient health systems and supporting the global COVID-19 and mpox
    responses. These investments have: supported more
    than 70,000 facilities and community health clinics, including 3,000
    laboratories; trained nearly 340,000 healthcare workers; enhanced
    disease surveillance, supply chain, health and laboratory
    information systems; built community capabilities; and applied
    routine and rapid analysis of data for decision making.

**Address HIV Stigma and Discrimination**

-   **Affirming the U=U message.** At the 2022 International AIDS
    Conference, the Administration joined global partners in affirming
    the evidence-based message that “undetectable=untransmittable”
    (U=U), meaning that people with HIV who take HIV medicine as
    prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load will not
    transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex. In
    addition, HHS launched “I am A Work of ART,” a community-informed
    campaign to encourage people with HIV to seek care, stay in care,
    and achieve viral suppression through anti-retroviral therapy (ART).
-   **Hosting a White House forum on HIV criminalization.** In 2022,
    ONAP brought prosecutors, public health officials, and legal and
    infectious disease experts to the White House to discuss the need to
    modernize HIV-specific criminal laws and their prosecution, ensuring
    they are supported by the latest scientific evidence.
-   **Safeguarding the rights of people with HIV.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration has strengthened protections against discrimination
    based on HIV status. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice
    (DOJ) continues to vigorously enforce the Americans with
    Disabilities Act (ADA) to combat HIV discrimination, and the
    Department of Defense (DoD) has updated its policies on HIV-positive
    personnel serving within the military in light of significant
    advances in HIV diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. In addition,
    the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has supported the Assessing
    Donor Variability And New Concepts in Eligibility (ADVANCE) study to
    evaluate alternatives to the FDA’s blood donor deferral policy for
    men who have sex with men (MSM), ensuring any potential future
    policy is based in science, not stigma.

**Ensure Equity**

-   **Diversifying PACHA membership.** President Biden added
    new [members](https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/pacha/members-staff) to
    the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA), representing
    the full diversity of the HIV epidemic, to share their knowledge and
    help further inform our HIV response.
-   **Engaging with the HIV community.** PACHA held numerous
    “[PACHA-to-the-People](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/pacha-members-want-hear-community-members-monday-march-14)”
    community engagement sessions to hear from local communities.
    Federal leaders
    also [visited](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/pacha-meeting-focuses-community-efforts-end-epidemic-los-angeles-county-more) EHE
    jurisdictions and participated in virtual town halls and discussions
    with people with lived experience of HIV, community-based
    organizations, state and local health departments, HIV advocates,
    and others.
-   **Advancing equity for marginalized and underserved Americans.** On
    his first day in office, President Biden signed an [executive
    order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/) on
    advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities, and
    in February 2021, he signed
    a [memorandum](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/memorandum-advancing-the-human-rights-of-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-persons-around-the-world/) on
    advancing the human rights of LGBTQI+ individuals around the world.
    To mark Pride Month 2022, the President signed the most
    significant [executive
    order](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/fact-sheet-president-biden-sign-historic-executive-order-advancing-lgbtqi-equality-during-pride) on
    LGBTQI+ civil rights in history. Among other actions, this order
    strengthened federal coordination to improve health equity by
    protecting LGBTQI+ individuals’ access to health services,
    addressing the risks of so-called conversion therapy, and driving
    better data collection on individuals’ sexual orientation and gender
    identity (SOGI) to increase visibility of LGBTQI+ populations and
    better serve their needs.
-   **Promoting access to gender-affirming care. **In June 2022, the
    Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) released
    a [letter](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/hrsa-promotes-access-gender-affirming-care-and-treatment-ryan-white-hivaids-program) encouraging
    Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) service providers to leverage
    their infrastructure to provide access to gender-affirming care and
    treatment services for transgender and gender-diverse people with
    HIV.
-   **Addressing violence against transgender women of color. **The
    Administration launched the first-ever White House Interagency
    Working Group on Violence Against Transgender Americans, which
    released a federal report and blueprint of actions agencies are
    taking to address the root causes of violence against transgender
    women of color.

**Support and Treat People At-risk for “Syndemic” Illnesses**

-   Supporting people affected by HIV during COVID-19 and mpox public
    health emergencies.Recognizing that infectious diseases don’t exist
    in isolation, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant
    action to support and treat individuals affected by HIV and other
    interacting epidemics, or “syndemic” infections, such as COVID-19
    and mpox. The Administration is: providing funding to prevent,
    prepare for, and respond to COVID-19, including resources
    specifically for organizations that serve people with HIV; updating
    CDC guidance regarding the use of HIV self-tests and PrEP;
    publishing new clinical guidelines on COVID-19 and people with HIV;
    and providing consumer information on COVID-19 and mpox for people
    with HIV. Led by the White House Mpox Response Team, the
    Administration has worked to make mpox tests, vaccines, and
    treatments equitably available to communities at-risk, including
    people with HIV. This work has included creating resource
    flexibilities so organizations that serve people affected by the HIV
    and mpox syndemic can test, treat, and vaccinate against mpox while
    they address HIV and sexually transmitted infections and support
    housing and mental health. 

**Advance New Research**

-   **Releasing a multiyear HIV research plan. **The National Institutes
    of Health’s (NIH) Office on AIDS Research issued its five-year [NIH
    Strategic
    Plan](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/fiscal-year-2021-2025-nih-strategic-plan-hiv-and-hiv-related-research),
    which serves as the guiding framework to allocate funds that advance
    the NIH-wide HIV research agenda and ensures investment of resources
    in the highest priority areas of scientific opportunity.
-   **Using new technologies to develop an HIV vaccine.** NIH’s National
    Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) launched a
    Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating three experimental HIV vaccines
    based on a messenger RNA (mRNA) platform—a technology used in
    several approved COVID-19 vaccines.
