title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Political Prisoners in\_Cuba"
---
 
As we look forward to honoring Human Rights Day thisÂ Saturday, December
10<sup>th</sup>, I once again call for the release of the hundreds of
political prisoners in Cuba who remain in detention following the July
11, 2021 protests. In the face of oppression, these protestors bravely
exercised their fundamental freedoms, including the rights to freedom of
expression and peaceful assembly. The United States stands with the
Cuban people as they stand up for their human rights and a say in the
future of Cuba. We will continue to advocate for the release of all who
were imprisoned in this brutal crackdown, and continue holding
accountable Cuban officials responsible for violence against peaceful
protests.
