title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Taliban Restrictions on Women\u2019\
  s Education and\_Rights"
---
 
The United States condemns the Taliban’s indefensible decision to
prevent Afghan women from receiving a university-level education. This
deplorable decision is the latest effort by Taliban leadership to impose
additional restrictions on women and girls in Afghanistan and prevent
them from exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms. As a
result of this unacceptable stance to hold back half of the population
of Afghanistan, the Taliban will be further alienated from the
international community and denied the legitimacy they desire.  
   
The United States is in touch with our partners and allies on this
issue. We will continue to take steps to advance our shared efforts to
support Afghan women and girls and provide robust humanitarian support
to the people of Afghanistan.
