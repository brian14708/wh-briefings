  Plan"
---
 
*Administration to focus efforts on making vaccinations, testing, and
treatments even more widely available and accessible as COVID-19 cases
increase*

Today, the Biden Administration is announcing a plan to stay ahead of an
increase in COVID-19 cases this winter. While COVID-19 is not the
disruptive force it once was, the virus continues to evolve, and cases
are on the rise again as families are spending more time indoors and
gathering for the holidays. Throughout the COVID-19 response, this
Administration has been prepared for whatever the virus throws our way –
and this moment is no different.  
  
The Administration’s COVID-19 Winter Preparedness Plan includes:  
  
**<u>Expanding easy access to free COVID-19 testing options in the
winter.</u>** COVID-19 testing is an important tool to help mitigate and
slow the spread of the virus. The Administration is encouraging
Americans to use at-home COVID-19 tests when they have symptoms of
COVID-19, before and after traveling for the holidays, or visiting
indoors with immunocompromised or vulnerable individuals. The
Administration has made free COVID-19 testing widely available and
easily accessible. This includes providing over 15,000 free community
testing sites nationwide, covering over-the-counter tests under
Medicare, and requiring all health insurance plans to cover eight free
at-home tests per month per individual, which can be easily accessed at
local pharmacies and online. Ahead of continued increases in cases, the
Administration is taking new action to ensure that all Americans have
easy and free access to COVID-19 tests in the winter months.

-   **Making free at-home, rapid COVID-19 tests available through
    COVIDTests.gov.** The Administration is announcing that
    COVIDTests.gov is open for a limited round of ordering this winter.
    Starting today, all U.S. households can order a total of four
    at-home COVID-19 tests that will be mailed directly to them for
    free. In the absence of Congress providing additional funding for
    the nation’s COVID-19 response, the Administration has acted with
    its limited existing funding to add more at-home COVID-19 tests to
    the nation’s stockpile and support this round of ordering ahead of
    continued increases in COVID-19 cases. Orders for this round of
    testing will begin to ship starting the week of December
    19<sup>th</sup> and continue in the weeks ahead. The Administration
    will also make tests available to individuals who are blind or have
    low-vision through this program. People who have difficulty
    accessing the internet or need additional support placing an order
    can call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489) to get help in English,
    Spanish, and more than 150 other languages – 8:00 a.m. to midnight
    E.T., seven days a week. For more information, people can visit
    [www.COVIDTests.gov](http://www.COVIDTests.gov).    
-   **Distributing more free tests to Americans at trusted locations.**
    In addition to continuing to support access to free COVID-19 tests
    in schools, community health centers, rural health clinics,
    long-term care facilities, and other convenient locations, the
    Administration is announcing additional distribution programs to
    reach people with free, at-home tests. This includes distributing
    free at-home tests at more than 6,500 Department of Housing and
    Urban Development-assisted rental housing properties serving
    seniors; and expanding a program to distribute free at-home tests to
    as many as 500 major food banks for them to distribute to people in
    their communities.

**<u>Making vaccinations and treatments readily available to all
Americans as cases rise</u>****<u>.</u>** As we have throughout the
pandemic, the federal government continues to leverage all capabilities
to support state, local, territorial, and Tribal communities to prepare
for, prevent, and respond to increased incidence of COVID-19. That
includes working with states, medical providers, businesses, and other
groups to expand awareness about updated COVID-19 vaccines, highly
effective treatments, and resources to stand up additional vaccination
sites and other delivery options to make it easier and more convenient
to get vaccinations and treatments.

-   **Offering resources and assistance to increase vaccinations and
    respond to a possible surge.** Today, U.S. Health and Human Services
    Secretary Xavier Becerra is sending a letter to all governors
    outlining key actions that he would like state leaders to take as
    they prepare for increased cases and hospitalizations this winter,
    and reminding them of federal supports that are available for their
    COVID-19 responses. This includes setting up additional mobile and
    pop-up vaccination sites, surge testing sites, as well as Test to
    Treat sites where Americans can not only get tested for free, but
    also can get prescribed and dispensed safe, effective COVID-19
    treatments right on site if they test positive and treatment is
    appropriate for them.  
-   **Collaborating with communities to open pop-up and/or mobile
    vaccination sites. **Communities across the nation are answering the
    call to expand vaccine access through the increased presence of
    mobile and pop-up vaccination clinics. This includes efforts in Los
    Angeles County to open up to 800 pop-up clinics per week; expanded
    use of mobile vaccination, testing, and treatment units, as well as
    outbound vaccine and treatment calls to people age 65 and older,
    at-home administration of vaccines and free home delivery of
    treatments in New York City; and an increase in Chicago’s at-home
    vaccine administration program, which provides vaccines for up to 10
    people per visit in their place of residence. The Administration has
    been engaging jurisdictions on the availability of federal resources
    to continue and increase these efforts, including through use of
    flexible single-dose vials, and will continue to engage state,
    local, Tribal, and territorial leaders in the weeks ahead.  
-   **Getting additional resources to community health centers and aging
    and disability networks to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts.**
    The Administration for Community Living is awarding $125 million to
    support community-based organizations in the aging and disability
    networks to hold accessible vaccine clinics and provide in-home
    vaccinations, transportation, and other supportive services to
    increase COVID-19 vaccinations for older adults and people with
    disabilities.

**<u>Preparing personnel and resources.</u>** Together with states, we
will monitor the impacts of variants, cases, and hospitalizations on our
communities and – should it become necessary – escalate our support to
states and communities. The Administration stands ready with federal
capabilities to support urgent needs as they present, including through
clinical staffing, personal protective equipment and supplies, and
technical assistance.   
  
**Readying clinical personnel for deployment as needed to support
jurisdictions.** The Administration continues to make federal teams and
medical personnel available to alleviate strains on hospitals and health
care systems through the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS’)
Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the U.S.
Public Health Services Corps, and the Department of Defense. Federal
agencies can also help offer support for states to take actions, such as
providing more flexibility to hospitals balancing patients and staffing,
exercising telemedicine options, pursuing staffing options such as
contracts, and employing the National Guard to help alleviate strains on
health and medical facilities.  

-   **Pre-positioning critical supplies from the Strategic National
    Stockpile.** Tanks to the President’s leadership, the U.S.
    government has hundreds of millions of N-95 masks, billions of
    gloves, tens of millions of gowns, and over 100,000 ventilators
    stored in the Strategic National Stockpile—all ready to ship out if
    and when states need them. The Administration has pre-positioned
    these supplies in strategic locations across the country so that we
    can send them to states that need them immediately.  
-   **Closely monitoring emerging variants and assessing their potential
    impacts on testing, treatments and vaccines.** This winter, federal
    agencies will continue to monitor Omicron subvariants and the spread
    of any other emerging variants of the virus in the United States.
    This includes genomic surveillance of specimens from representative
    populations to detect new variants and to monitor trends in
    currently circulating variants. The Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) tracks and reports on genomic sequencing results
    from a variety of sources, including public health and commercial
    laboratories.  CDC also recently expanded variant reporting from
    additional sources, including wastewater and through international
    air travel. The Traveler-Based Genomic Surveillance Program
    currently collects samples from international air travelers arriving
    from more than 25 countries at several major U.S. airports. This
    data, which provides an early warning system for detection of
    variants and trends over time, is publicly shared on the CDC
    COVID-19 Data Tracker.

**<u>  
Focusing on protecting the highest-risk Americans.</u>** As we have done
since the beginning of the Administration, we remain focused on meeting
the needs and protecting Americans at highest risk of severe illness
from COVID-19. This includes residents of nursing homes and other
congregate care facilities, where we know vaccination rates remain too
low. This also includes older Americans, individuals who are
immunocompromised, disabled individuals, and others who face a higher
risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.   

-   **Releasing a winter playbook for nursing homes and long-term care
    facilities.** The Administration will release a winter playbook for
    administrators of nursing homes and long-term care facilities that
    summarizes the actions these facilities should take to reduce
    serious illness, prevent hospitalizations and deaths, and minimize
    disruptions in their communities. Nursing homes often serve
    residents at great risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19,
    and congregate care settings have an increased risk of spread of
    respiratory infections. All facilities should take concrete actions
    to ensure that every resident is educated on and offered an updated
    COVID-19 shot; that every resident who tests positive for COVID-19
    is evaluated and offered treatment; and that every facility is
    taking steps to improve its indoor air quality.  
-   **Expanding the pool of providers that may administer COVID-19
    vaccinations.** In addition to working with their partners, staff at
    nursing homes will now be able to administer COVID-19 vaccines to
    all residents. HHS will work with states to launch teams and use
    partner with their Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), home
    health agencies, and Emergency Medical Technicians to deliver
    vaccines to residents of long-term care facilities. On December 1,
    2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also added
    COVID-19 vaccination rates of health care staff and the residents at
    these facilities to the “Measures under Consideration” list, the
    list of measures it will potentially consider for certain Medicare
    quality payment programs, reinforcing its commitment to increased
    vaccination and improving outcomes for patients.  
-   **Reaching out to governors on nursing home vaccinations.** In
    Secretary Becerra’s letter to governors reminding them of available
    federal COVID-19 supports, he also highlighted how their states are
    performing as compared to their peers on vaccinating residents of
    long-term care facilities, and asked governors for their assistance
    and partnership in increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates for
    long-term care residents and staff. CMS leadership will also be
    reaching out to the jurisdictions with the lowest vaccination rates
    at these long-term care facilities to remind them of what additional
    steps they can take to increase vaccination rates among seniors and
    long-term care facility residents.  
-   **Encouraging hospitals to offer COVID-19 vaccinations to patients
    before discharge. **HHS leadership, including Secretary Becerra, has
    called upon hospitals through direct outreach to vaccinate their
    unvaccinated patients or make sure they are up-to-date on COVID-19
    vaccinations before they are discharged, especially if they are
    heading to a nursing home.  
-   **Expanding access to high-quality masks in communities.** In
    January 2022, HHS made up to 400 million N-95 respirators from the
    Strategic National Stockpile available through tens of thousands of
    locations including pharmacies and grocery stores, so Americans
    could have convenient, free access to high-quality masks. About 270
    million masks were sent out as part of this initiative, with many
    still available in stores nationwide. To expand access to these
    high-quality masks, HHS will offer guidance to participating
    pharmacies and grocery stores on how they can to work with local
    health clinics, aging and disability networks, community-based
    organizations, and health departments to distribute these masks more
    widely, so that any spare inventory can be utilized through
    distribution to even more locations.  
-   **Ensuring that every individual has a plan for COVID-19 this
    winter**. With updated COVID-19 vaccines, at-home tests, and
    effective oral antiviral treatments widely available, the
    Administration encourages every individual American to have a plan
    for how to prevent and respond to COVID-19 this winter. CDC has
    launched a COVID-19 Personal Action Plan, an easy-to-use guide for
    individuals, caregivers, and clinicians that helps guide individuals
    through making a plan for where to access free tests, the location
    of their closest Test to Treat site, and what to ask their provider
    on treatments if they test positive. The Personal Action Plan helps
    lay these steps out in an easy-to-use template so that all Americans
    – especially those at highest risk for severe illness – can decrease
    the risk of COVID-19 and, if they become infected, have a plan to
    quickly seek out treatment and avoid its worst outcomes.
