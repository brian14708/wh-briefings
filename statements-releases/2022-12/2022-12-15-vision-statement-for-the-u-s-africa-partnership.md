title: "Vision Statement for the U.S.-Africa\_Partnership"
---
 
On the occasion of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C.,
the United States and the African Union, under the leadership of
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of Senegal and Chair of the
African Union Macky Sall, and African Union Commission Chair Moussa Faki
Mahamat, affirm our commitment to reinforce longstanding areas of
cooperation and expand our partnership to better meet the shared
challenges – and opportunities – of our dynamic era.  The United States
and African nations recognize that our world is quickly changing, and
this Summit reflected how our relationship is evolving with it.  We will
deepen our collaboration to solve global problems and shape the rules of
the road for technology, space, cybersecurity, trade, environmental
protection, and economics.  
   
Our partnership is based on a conviction that Africa’s governments and
peoples will help define the future of the international order to
address our world’s most pressing challenges.  The United States, for
its part, will support and work to realize greater – and long overdue –
African representation in international institutions, including those
that shape global governance.  The United States has announced a plan to
reform the United Nations Security Council, including support for
permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the
Caribbean, and voiced support for the African Union to join the G20 as a
permanent member.  We will continue to lead with our shared values,
including a commitment to the United Nations Charter and to defending
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states.   
   
At the Summit, we announced new investments and initiatives that will
equip American and African institutions and citizens to respond to
emerging opportunities and challenges in an increasingly urban and
connected world.  Our renewed and expanded partnership is critical to
tackling the food security and climate crises, strengthening health
systems and preparing for the next pandemic, building a strong and
inclusive global economy, supporting good governance and respect for
human rights, and advancing peace and security.    
   
We are dedicated to responding to the current food security crisis and
bolstering resilient and sustainable food systems.  Recognizing today’s
acute food security needs, which have been heightened by the war in
Ukraine, we plan to continue to partner to supply humanitarian
assistance to vulnerable communities.  But responding to emergencies is
not enough; we announced a new strategic partnership that seeks to
deepen our collaboration to increase food production capacity and
diversify and strengthen the resilience of food supply chains.  
   
We recognize that many of the world’s countries that are most vulnerable
to the impacts of climate change are in Africa.  Building on the
progress made at COP27, we jointly stress the urgency and importance of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pursuing a just energy transition,
while partnering to build resilience to climate hazards.  We are
committed to supporting climate adaptation and resilience efforts and
will work to facilitate enhanced collaboration among our respective
governments, other international partners, education and research
institutions, and private sectors to do so.  
   
We reaffirm our shared commitment to prevent, detect, and respond to
infectious disease threats.  As part of this effort, we will expand our
support to strengthen the region’s health workforce, regional
manufacturing capacity, and health infrastructure.  We have deepened the
partnership between the United States and Africa CDC to achieve our
shared global health goals.   
  
We are resolved to enhance our collaboration to promote inclusive growth
and sustainable development.  We will bring together business and
government leaders to advance two-way trade and accelerate investment in
quality infrastructure.  We will leverage our institutions and programs,
in addition to strengthening enabling environments, to realize this
shared aspiration.  This will include expanded engagement and
cooperation between the United States and African countries to support
the aims of the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free
Trade Area (AfCFTA).  
  
We are increasing our cooperation to tackle insecurity, criminality, and
terrorism.  We affirm that locally led approaches are essential to
advancing our mutual interest in a peaceful and secure Africa.  We
understand that economic inequality, political marginalization, and
abuse of power are drivers of conflict.  We will adopt a more holistic
approach to address insecurity, and promote transparency,
accountability, and respect for human rights.   
   
We will reinforce our commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and
human rights.  Importantly, we will focus on restoring civilian rule in
countries currently in transition and demonstrate that democracy
delivers across the region.    
   
Like all partners, we will sometimes disagree.  Rather than allow these
differences to divide or define the partnership, we will include areas
of divergence on the agenda and welcome respectful debate as a sign of
the strength and maturity of our relationships.  
   
Through our partnership, we will harness the dynamism of the African and
American peoples to enhance prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Our vibrant business, civil society, and people-to-people ties are
sources of strength that we will leverage with greater purpose than
before.  We will prioritize engagement with members of the African
Diaspora, whose voices are critical in the United States and around the
world.  
   
More work remains to realize our shared aspirations.  Recognizing the
importance of implementing the commitments discussed at the Summit, we
intend to accelerate high-level exchanges and dedicate senior diplomats
to carry out our joint vision for a 21<sup>st</sup> century
partnership.  The future of Africa and the United States depends on what
we can achieve together.  We will redouble our efforts to ensure our
partnership delivers results for our peoples and the world.
