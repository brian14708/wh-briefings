title: "Readout of the White\_House Convening with State Legislative\_Leaders"
---
 
On December 6 and 7, 2022, the White House hosted a series of meetings
with more than 50 state legislative leaders from 31 states ahead of the
2023 state legislative session. The meetings were chaired by Senior
Administration Officials and focused on how state legislators can
advance critical policies in their upcoming legislative sessions –
including lowering costs and expanding access to health care and
housing; building a cleaner, more sustainable America; preventing gun
violence and supporting criminal justice reform; strengthening our
democracy; and pursuing freedom for all, including civil rights,
reproductive rights, gender equity, and LGBTQI+ equality.

The participants also discussed the onslaught of unprecedented,
backwards policies being propagated by state Republican elected
officials, including attacks against women’s reproductive rights,
attempts to restrict access to the polls, and attacks on LGBTQI+
Americans. The Administration looks forward to supporting state leaders
in accomplishing our shared priorities in the legislative session and
years ahead.
