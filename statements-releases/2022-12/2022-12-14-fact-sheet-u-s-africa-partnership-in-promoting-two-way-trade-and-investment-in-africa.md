title: "FACT SHEET:  U.S.- Africa Partnership in Promoting Two-Way Trade and Investment\
  \ in\_Africa"
---
 
Africa’s integration into global markets, demographic boom, and
continent-wide spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation present an
extraordinary opportunity for the United States to invest in Africa’s
future.  The United States will support and facilitate mobilizing
private capital to fuel economic growth, job creation, and greater U.S.
participation in Africa’s future.  Together, business and government
leaders will strengthen trade- and investment-enabling environments,
including fostering the development and implementation of effective
policies and practices across all sectors, and identify and promote new
opportunities for Africans and Americans.  Through initiatives such as
the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and
Prosper Africa, the United States will provide timely, coordinated
support that meets the needs of businesses and investors, including
micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises and diaspora- and
women-owned businesses, to advance infrastructure priorities and boost
two-way trade and investment.  
  
**Since 2021, the U.S. Government has helped close more than 800 two-way
trade and investment deals across 47 African countries for a total
estimated value of over $18 billion, and the U.S. private sector has
closed investment deals in Africa valued at $8.6 billion.  **U.S. goods
and services traded with Africa totaled $83.6 billion in 2021.  These
investments and programs are in support of the umbrella initiatives
PGII, Prosper Africa, and Power Africa.  
  
**At today’s U.S.-Africa Business Forum, President Biden announced over
$15 billion in two-way trade and investment commitments, deals, and
partnerships** that advance key priorities, including sustainable
energy, health systems, agribusiness, digital connectivity,
infrastructure, and finance.  **Since January 2021, the Biden-Harris
Administration has invested and plans to invest more than $1 billion in
trade, investment, and economic development in Africa.**  
  
Departments and Agencies across the U.S. Government announced new
initiatives and investments to promote two-way trade and investment:

-   **The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR),** on behalf of the United
    States Government, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the
    African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat to support
    institutions to accelerate sustainable economic growth across the
    continent.  Once fully implemented, the Agreement Establishing the
    AfCFTA will create a combined continent-wide market of 1.3 billion
    people and $3.4 trillion, which would be the fifth-largest economy
    in the world.
-   **The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC**) and the Governments
    of Benin and Niger are signing the first regional compacts totaling
    $504 million, with additional contributions of $15 million from
    Benin and Niger, to support regional economic integration, trade,
    and cross-border collaboration.  Since the start of this
    Administration, MCC also signed agreements with the Governments of
    The Gambia, Lesotho and Malawi for an additional $675 million.
     These agreements include over $150 million to support climate
    adaptation.  The agency is currently working in 14 African countries
    with more than $3 billion in active compact and threshold programs
    and approximately $2.5 billion in the pipeline.  Yesterday, MCC
    announced that The Gambia and Togo are eligible to develop their
    first compacts, Senegal is eligible to develop a concurrent regional
    compact, and Mauritania is eligible for a threshold program.
-   President Biden launched the [**Digital Transformation with
    Africa**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/14/fact-sheet-new-initiative-on-digital-transformation-with-africa-dta/)
    **(DTA)**, a new initiative to expand digital access and literacy
    across the continent.  Working with Congress, this new initiative
    intends to invest over $350 million and mobilize over $450 million
    in financing commitments for Africa, in line with the African
    Union’s Digital Transformation Strategy.
-   **U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)**
    announced $369 million in new investments across Africa across food
    security, renewable energy infrastructure, and [health
    projects](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/13/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-health-cooperation/),
    including a $100 million transaction with Mirova SunFunder for the
    Mirova Gigaton Fund to support clean energy across the continent. 
-   **The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM)** currently has
    over $7 billion in exposure throughout Africa, including new
    authorizations such as $42 million in financing to the Republic of
    Angola for the purchase of GatesAir FM transmitters and $7.4 million
    in financing to Sapele Power Plc (Sapele) in Nigeria for the
    purchase of American-manufactured energy storage systems from ESS
    Tech, Inc (ESS).  At the Forum, EXIM signed several new Memorandums
    of Understanding (MoU), including: $500 million MoU with the African
    Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) to support diaspora engagement and
    strengthen EXIM’s commercial ties to the continent by increasing
    access to and awareness of EXIM financial products; a $300 million
    MoU with Africa 50 to facilitate up to $300 million in EXIM
    financing for the export of U.S. goods and services to buyers
    throughout Africa, particularly in support of infrastructure,
    transportation, digital technology and renewable energy projects;
    and a $500 million MoU with the Africa Finance Corporation to
    facilitate U.S. goods and services exports, promote U.S.-Africa
    trade, and support financing of trade-enabling projects.
-   **Power Africa,** which has helped close 145 power generation
    investments valued at more than $24 billion, in collaboration with
    Prosper Africa, announced the launch of the [Clean Tech Energy
    Network
    (CTEN)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/13/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-supporting-conservation-climate-adaptation-and-a-just-energy-transition/). 
    CTEN is a collaboration between the U.S. Government, U.S. clean tech
    energy companies, and African energy stakeholders that is expected
    to mobilize $350 million in deals.  In addition, Power Africa
    operationalized a $150 million public-private partnership to
    electrify 10,000 health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa, bolstering
    sector resources to advance pandemic resilience and digital
    connectivity and decarbonize the health sector footprint.
-   **U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)** announced over 15 new
    activities that are designed to help unlock close to $1 billion in
    financing for Africa’s clean energy, digital, and healthcare
    infrastructure priorities and create more than $500 million in
    export opportunities for U.S. firms.  These new commitments build
    upon USTDA’s 30-year history of partnering with Africa’s public and
    private sectors and financiers to shape infrastructure development
    across the continent.  In 2022 alone, USTDA’s program helped unlock
    more than $500 million in financing for 10 priority infrastructure
    projects across the continent.
-   **Prosper Africa**, working with Congress, has invested and plans to
    provide at least $170 million to increase two-way trade and
    investment between the United States and African countries.  Through
    catalytic investments and partnerships, Prosper Africa expects to
    boost African exports to the United States by $1 billion and
    mobilize an additional $1 billion in U.S. investment in Africa.  For
    example, Prosper Africa is launching five new partnerships with
    African investors that will leverage $200 million in private
    investment and generate millions of dollars in revenue for
    businesses, all while advancing African solutions to global
    challenges like climate change, food insecurity, and women’s
    empowerment.  Prosper Africa is also establishing a new Prosper
    Africa Coordinator position, which will streamline efforts across
    the U.S. Government and private sector to advance the
    Administration’s economic engagement with Africa. 
-   **The Department of Commerce** has supported over 330 transactions
    and commercial cases between the United States and Africa under the
    Biden-Harris Administration, with a total value of over $11.9
    billion.
-   **The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)** announced
    a range of commitments and newly-leveraged private investments
    across sectors, including in health, food security, and climate, and
    that promote gender equality, women’s economic empowerment, and
    social inclusion.  This includes $100 million to accelerate
    last-mile delivery of agricultural innovations and a pledge to
    unlock $300 million in private financing by increasing investment in
    infrastructure and manufacturing, as well as digital solutions to
    drive an effective African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).
     USAID also launched its [Climate Action Infrastructure
    Facility](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/13/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-supporting-conservation-climate-adaptation-and-a-just-energy-transition/)
    that aims to leverage $100 million in private investment toward
    financing climate solutions.
-   **U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF)** announced three
    Off-Grid Energy Challenges (healthcare, agriculture, and women in
    energy) through which the agency will provide grants to African
    enterprises to promote market-based solutions that connect
    businesses to electricity and impact marginalized communities.
     USADF since 2021 has invested a total of $48.26 million of grant
    capital in African enterprises and leveraged $3 million from the
    private sector.  Working with Congress, in 2023, USADF plans to
    implement new projects that will invest $56.84 million, of which $18
    million is expected to be leveraged from the private sector and
    other donors.
-   **U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA**) supported agricultural
    exports of approximately $264 million to Africa from July 2021 to
    August 2022 through the backing of the Export Credit Guarantee
    Program, including corn, soybeans, and wheat.  USDA will continue to
    encourage financing of commercial exports of U.S. agricultural
    products through the Export Credit Guarantee Program by reducing
    financial risk to lenders and facilitating trade.
