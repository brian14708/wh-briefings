title: "Statement By President Joe\_Biden on Bipartisan House Passage of the Respect\
  \ for Marriage\_Act"
---
 
Today, Congress took a critical step to ensure that Americans have the
right to marry the person they love. The House’s bipartisan passage of
the Respect for Marriage Act—by a significant margin—will give peace of
mind to millions of LGBTQI+ and interracial couples who are now
guaranteed the rights and protections to which they and their children
are entitled.

After the uncertainty caused by the Supreme Court’s *Dobbs* decision,
Congress has restored a measure of security to millions of marriages and
families. They have also provided hope and dignity to millions of young
people across this country who can grow up knowing that their government
will recognize and respect the families they build.

I want to once again thank the unwavering champions of this legislation
in Congress—Representatives Nadler, Cicilline, and Davids in the House,
and Senators Baldwin, Collins, Portman, Sinema, Tillis, and Feinstein in
the Senate—who refused to be deterred and brought this vital bill over
the finish line. Together, we showed that it’s possible for Democrats
and Republicans to come together to safeguard our most fundamental
rights.

On this day, Jill and I are thinking of the courageous couples and
fiercely committed advocates who have fought for decades to secure
nationwide marriage equality at the Supreme Court and in Congress. While
we are one step closer on our long journey to build a more perfect
union, we must never stop fighting for full equality for LGBTQI+
Americans and all Americans.
