title: "FACT SHEET:\_U.S-Africa Partnership in Health\_Cooperation"
---
 
The United States Government is proud to work in partnership with
governments and institutions in Africa, including the African Union (AU)
and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), to
advance shared public health goals.  As we continue to work to end the
acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to
strengthening health systems and institutions; advancing global health
security; combatting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; advancing
sexual and reproductive health and rights, and maternal, neonatal, and
child health; closing gaps in nutrition and non-communicable diseases;
and accelerating efforts to achieve universal health coverage and the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  Advancing health equity,
including gender equity and equality, are priorities for the
Biden-Harris Administration, and are integrated throughout our global
health programs, including through direct provision of health services
to women, girls, and LGBTQI+ populations.

Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United
States has invested and committed to provide **nearly $20 billionin
health programs in the Africa region**.  This includes nearly $11.5
billion to address HIV/AIDS; more than $2 billion to combat malaria;
more than $2 billion in support of family planning and reproductive
health as well as maternal and child health; and more than $2 billion to
address the health, humanitarian, and economic impacts of COVID-19.
 These bilateral programs complement significant U.S. investments in
multilateral organizations that provide substantial support to improving
health outcomes in Africa, such as the World Health Organization; Gavi,
the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and
Malaria; the United Nations Population Fund, and the Joint United
Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, among others.

U.S. investments and partnerships on health in Africa have saved
millions of lives, strengthened health systems, and made Africa and the
world better prepared for current and future health security threats.
 Thanks to sustained partnership and investment, maternal and child
mortality and malaria mortality across the continent have declined
dramatically.  U.S. investments in Fiscal Year 2021 alone enabled the
provision of family planning and reproductive health services to 15.4
million African women, averting 4.7 million unintended pregnancies and
preventing 10,780 maternal deaths.  In the last twenty years, PEPFAR has
saved more than 25 million lives, prevented millions of HIV infections,
and helped countries build a strong foundation to prevent, detect, and
respond to other health threats.

U.S. intensive health security investments and partnership across
fourteen countries on the continent have yielded progress in biosafety
and biosecurity capacity, zoonotic disease capacity, surveillance
systems, national laboratory systems, emergency preparedness, and
emergency response operations.  In 2021 alone, the United States and
African nations tackled multiple outbreaks on the continent together,
including COVID-19 and Ebola, effectively using the critical global
health security improvements that these partnerships have advanced.

***Investing in the health workforce to build more resilient health
systems******  
***  
In May 2022, the White House launched the [Global Health Worker
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-global-health-worker-initiative/)
(GHWI), recognizing that a health workforce that is supported, equipped
and protected to provide essential public health functions is integral
to reclaiming lost ground from the COVID-19 pandemic and preparing for
future health threats.  In order to achieve the Sustainable Development
Goals by 2030, Africa will need 5.3 million additional health workers,
the majority of whom will be women.  Recognizing this gap, African
institutions have established health workforce goals for the continent
that reflect the whole spectrum of health, including preventive
services, health care services, and pandemic preparedness and
response.  
  
As part of the GHWI, **the Administration plans to work with Congress to
invest$1.33 billionannually from 2022 to 2024 in health workforce in the
Africa region, for a total of at least $4 billion by Fiscal Year 2025,**
to help our African partners close the gap in health workers, including
clinicians, community health and care workers, and public health
professionals. U.S. federal agencies will work together with regional
partners to align and maximize investments with country needs, and will
report on standardized metrics that capture our whole of government
investments in health workforce in Africa.  
  
Initiatives in support of this regional health workforce commitment
include:

-   USAID recently launched its **Accelerating Primary Health Care
    Collaborative** (APHC-C), which aims to work with partner countries
    in Africa to accelerate primary health care to reclaim lost ground
    on global health and to foster resilience and preparedness against
    future threats.  These efforts will focus on an initial set of five
    partner countries, **Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi,** and
    **Nigeria**, harnessing the USAID and PMI health footprint,
    supported by **an average of over $415 million annually** in USAID
    funds in 2022 and 2023.  
-   **Strengthening HIV/AIDS Health Worker Leadership in Global Health
    through PEPFAR.** To advance Africa’s commitment to increase and
    retain health care workers, PEPFAR is committed to investing
    approximately **$1.1 billion annually** to support the more than
    325,000 health workers in the region who enable the delivery of
    HIV/AIDS programs.  The support for this health workforce will not
    only protect and scale HIV gains, but can also be leveraged to fight
    outbreaks and other disease threats.

<!-- -->

-   The **U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI)** is working across
    the health system in 24 countries in Africa to deepen our support
    for the health workforce, including by enacting a **policy change in
    2021 to catalyze long-term investment in community health workers**
    with access to the hardest-to-reach areas affected by malaria.
     Under this new policy, partner countries throughout Africa are
    paying community health workers with PMI funds.  
-   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is continuing
    to invest in health workforce programs throughout the region,
    including through:
    -   Support for Africa CDC through the **National Public Health
        Institute (NPHI) Program,** which offers ongoing trainings and
        directs technical assistance that strengthen the capacity of
        Africa CDC staff in surveillance methodologies and disease
        prevention and control.  Since the beginning of the
        Administration, with current and planned investments of at least
        **$9.7 million,** CDC is supporting Africa CDC to build out an
        online platform for supporting Africa CDC’s goals of building
        workforce capacity within African Union Member States.
    -   The **Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP),** with **$47
        million** in invested and planned CDC funding since Fiscal Year
        2021, strengthens countries’ capacity to prevent, detect, and
        respond to public health threats.  FETP graduates were mobilized
        during recent outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever and Crimean-Congo
        hemorrhagic fever in Mauritania, Sudan Ebolavirus in Uganda, and
        the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, as well as the COVID-19
        response in multiple countries.
    -   The **Global Laboratory Leadership Program (GLLP), with $5.2
        million in invested and planned CDC support since Fiscal Year
        2021,** mentors current and emerging laboratory leaders to
        build, strengthen, and sustain national laboratory systems with
        a One Health focus.

***Partnering to build stronger health systems and strengthen global
health security******  
***  
The United States continues to strengthen global, regional, and national
capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease
threats.  As part of the U.S. commitment to expand [global health
security
partnerships](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-expansion-of-global-health-security-partnerships-and-releases-annual-progress-report/),
the United States announced it has invested and committed to provide
**$782 million inglobal health security programs in Africa since the
beginning of the Administration** through USAID and CDC, alongside other
federal agencies, to work with partner countries to address capacity
gaps and support their National Action Plans for Health Security.  In
addition to its current intensive partnership with fourteen countries
across the continent, the United States welcomes the addition of Ghana,
Mozambique, and Zambia as new partners in this effort.The United States
further announced **$215 million** – new funding to address the
**COVID-19 pandemic in Africa**, which will focus on accelerating
widespread and equitable access to and delivery of safe and effective
COVID-19 vaccinations; reducing morbidity and mortality from COVID-19;
mitigating transmission; and strengthening health systems.  Additional
actions to advance pandemic preparedness and response include:

-   **Partnership to accelerate regional manufacturing.  **PEPFAR and
    PMI continue to leverage their platforms in the region to accelerate
    regional manufacturing capacity:
    -   PEPFAR currently spends roughly $750 million in the purchase of
        HIV-related commodities every year, but less than 1 percent of
        that total is used to procure commodities from African
        manufacturers.  PEPFAR is actively exploring opportunities to
        shift its procurement practices to spur growth in the regional
        manufacturing ecosystem. Building on existing capabilities and
        an analysis of future expansion potential: for HIV rapid
        diagnostics, by 2025, PEPFAR aims to **procure 15 million tests
        produced by African manufacturers** at an estimated cost of $20
        million.  For ARVs, by 2030, PEPFAR aims to work alongside other
        partners and buyers to **shift at least two million patients on
        first-line ARV treatments to use African-made products**.  DFC
        also seeks to finance eligible private sector projects that
        build regional manufacturing capacity for therapeutics,
        diagnostics, and ancillary supplies in developing countries,
        with a focus on Africa.
    -   PMI is committed to building a more resilient supply chain and
        is leveraging its procurement volume to accelerate the growth in
        regional manufacturing.  The inclusion of evaluation criteria in
        recent tenders related to manufacturing on the continent led to
        an estimated **30 percent of PMI’s 2023 standard mosquito net
        procurement being sourced from African-based manufacturers**.
-   **[Senegal Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD) Flexible Vaccine
    Manufacturing
    Facility.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/14/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-promoting-two-way-trade-and-investment-in-africa/)** The
    U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), along with
    International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other like-minded
    development finance institutions, is continuing to support IPD in
    Senegal to become a key hub in the African Union’s vaccine
    production network.  DFC previously provided a $3.3 million
    technical assistance grant for early-stage project development and
    is evaluating additional financing for expansion of the
    industrial-scale facility. 
-   **Harnessing Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in
    Africa (DS-I Africa)** was established in 2021, and since the
    beginning of the Administration NIH has invested $49 million since
    the beginning of the Administration to leverage data science
    technologies to develop solutions to the continent’s most pressing
    public health problems.  NIH is expanding DS-I Africa through new
    educational activities that enhance workforce training to meet the
    biomedical, behavioral and clinical needs.
-   **The STOP Program (STOP),** which has been active in nearly every
    African country over the life of the program, is a collaboration
    between CDC, WHO, and UNICEF to strengthen national immunization
    surveillance programs, support supplemental immunization activities,
    respond to disease outbreaks, and help support polio eradication.
     Since the beginning of the Administration, CDC has committed and
    aims to invest at least **$32.1 million**.

***Investing in Health Infrastructure******  
***  
G7 leaders launched the [Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
Investment (PGII) in June
2022](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/26/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-g7-leaders-formally-launch-the-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment/),
with a goal of mobilizing hundreds of billions of dollars and delivering
quality, sustainable infrastructure, including developing and upgrading
the infrastructure of health systems and contributing to global health
security.  In support of PGII, and as part of DFC’s Global Health and
Prosperity Initiative, **DFC has committed more than $253 million** to
projects focused on improving pandemic preparedness and health system
resilience in Africa since January 2021.  These include investments in
health services and infrastructure, health commodity manufacturing and
supply chain, and digital health as well as water, sanitation, and
nutrition. In addition to investments in the health workforce and
vaccine manufacturing, programs in support of PGII include:

-   DFC and USAID announced their collaboration with the **Transform
    Health Fund**, an innovative blended-finance fund focused on
    locally-led health supply chain, care delivery, and digital
    solutions in Africa. DFC and USAID will finalize **$10 million** in
    equity financing and **$1 million** in catalytic grant funding,
    respectively.  With these investments, the Fund announced approved
    commitments of $50 million.  The majority women-led fund is a
    collaborative effort bringing together government, donor, and
    commercial investments under the leadership of AfricInvest and the
    Health Finance Coalition to finance enterprises that improve health
    system resilience and pandemic preparedness across the continent.
     The Fund will also promote women in leadership positions across its
    pipeline and target female consumers while ensuring that at least
    30% of its portfolio is aligned with 2X criteria, DFCs flagship
    program to support women’s economic empowerment in emerging markets.
-   Power Africa announced the **[Healthcare Electrification and
    Telecommunication
    Alliance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/13/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-supporting-conservation-climate-adaptation-and-a-just-energy-transition/)**
    (HETA), with $10 million in funding, a $150 million partnership
    program to power up and digitally connect thousands of health
    facilities in sub-Saharan Africa, transforming them into hubs of
    clean energy development.

<!-- -->

-   DFC committed a **$10 million** equity investment equivalent to the
    **Water Access Acceleration Fund** (W2AF).  W2AF is a €50 million
    blended finance fund, accompanied by a €2.5 million technical
    assistance facility.  The fund will invest in approximately 10 small
    and medium-sized enterprises in the water, sanitation, and hygiene
    sector to scale access to potable and affordable water in
    sub-Saharan Africa and other emerging markets.  W2AF also has strong
    support from USAID with their commitment of $1.1 million for
    technical assistance and first loss.  
-   USTDA has announced a series of **health system investments in
    Nigeria** totaling **$3 million**, including a feasibility study for
    the Nigerian private healthcare network Lily Hospitals Limited to
    support the acquisition, refurbishment, and operation of ten
    healthcare facilities in Nigeria; a feasibility study for the
    expansion of healthcare and related-sector logistics using unmanned
    aerial vehicles; and a feasibility study for Cedarcrest Hospitals
    Limited, a Nigerian private health operator, to support the
    development of a comprehensive cancer treatment center in Abuja,
    Nigeria.

***Partnering on Cancer Prevention, Detection, Treatment and
Research******  
***  
The United States is committed to working together with African
governments to reduce the rising burden of cancer, as we collectively
work towards the President’s vision of ending cancer as we know it.
 With this shared responsibility, U.S. agencies drive and support
impactful initiatives with African partners, including the design and
implementation of pragmatic technological interventions, support for
research centers, providing access to cancer prevention, early detection
and treatment, clinical trial development and strengthening
institutional capacity for global cancer research in Africa with a goal
to diversify the global cancer research workforce.  Africa is a critical
partner as we work together to develop new and innovative solutions to
prevent, detect and treat cancer.  Efforts to strengthen health systems
and public health infrastructure, as well as investments by the private
sector, will also help end cancer as we know it.
