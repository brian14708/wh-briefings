I promised to lower costs for families and ensure that all Americans
have access to quality affordable health care. In recent days, we
received further proof that our efforts are delivering record
results and bringing families the peace of mind that comes with health
insurance.  
   
From November 1<sup>st</sup> to December 15<sup>th</sup>, nearly 11.5
million Americans signed up for insurance on HealthCare.gov—about 1.8
million more people, an 18 percent increase, over the same period last
year. That’s an all-time record, with enrollment still open and not
counting people who have signed up for coverage through their state
marketplaces. Gains like these helped us drive down the uninsured rate
to eight percent earlier this year, its lowest level in history.  
   
Right now, four out of five people who sign up for health insurance
through the Affordable Care Act can find health care coverage for $10 a
month or less. These lower rates were set to expire at the end of this
year, but thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we were able to extend
them and save millions of Americans on Obamacare an average of $800 a
year.  
   
Because of this landmark legislation, on January 1<sup>st</sup>,
Americans will start to see the benefits of additional cost-saving
measures in the Inflation Reduction Act. That includes seniors seeing a
month’s supply of insulin capped at $35, Medicare beneficiaries paying
$0 out of pocket for recommended adult vaccines covered by their Part D
plan, and prescription drug companies needing to pay Medicare a rebate
if they try to raise their prices faster than inflation for drugs
administered at a doctor’s office.  
   
We’re not finished working to make health care a right, not a
privilege. Visit [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) by
January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2023 to take advantage of those lower rates and
sign up for health care for the coming year.
