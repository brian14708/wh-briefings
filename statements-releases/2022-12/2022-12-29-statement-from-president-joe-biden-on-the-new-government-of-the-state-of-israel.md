  Israel"

Today, Israel’s Knesset voted to ratify a new Israeli government under
the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I look forward to
working with Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has been my friend for
decades, to jointly address the many challenges and opportunities facing
Israel and the Middle East region, including threats from Iran. The
United States is working to promote a region that’s increasingly
integrated, prosperous, and secure, with benefits for all of its people.
From the start of my Administration, we have worked with partners to
promote this more hopeful vision of a region at peace, including between
Israelis and Palestinians. We aim to continue this important work with
Israel’s new government under Prime Minister Netanyahu’s
leadership.  And as we have throughout my Administration, the United
States will continue to support the two state solution and to oppose
policies that endanger its viability or contradict our mutual interests
and values.
