  \ Pensions of Hundreds of Thousands of Union Workers and\_Retirees"

*American Rescue Plan prevents pension benefit cuts of roughly 60% in
the next few years for over 350,000 Central States Pension Fund workers
and retiree*s

Today, joined by Teamster President Sean O’Brien, AFL-CIO President Liz
Shuler, Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, and Teamster workers and
retirees with multiemployer pensions, President Biden announced $36
billion for the Central States Pension Fund, preventing drastic cuts to
the hard-earned pensions of over 350,000 union workers and retirees.
These workers paid into the fund for years or even decades, and faced
cuts through no fault of their own. Approved by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, this is the largest ever award of federal
financial support for worker and retiree pension security and the
largest award from the American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial
Assistance Program. Known as the “Butch Lewis Act” – named after the
heroic Ohio union leader and pension advocate – this program provides
security for more than 200 distressed multiemployer pension plans,
helping to ensure 2 to 3 million workers’ pension plans remain solvent
and pay full benefits through at least 2051. 

Ensuring that workers and their families enjoy the retirement security
they earned through a lifetime of work is a central part of President
Biden’s economic plan. President Biden is building the economy from the
bottom up and middle out, including helping to ensure a dignified
retirement for all American workers and their families.  
**<u>  
Today’s Announcement Protects the Earned Pensions of more than 350,000
Union Workers and Retirees from 60% cuts:</u>** Prior to passage of the
American Rescue Plan, the Central States Pension Fund, which is largely
made up of Teamster workers and retirees, was the largest financially
distressed multiemployer pension plan in the nation. Workers in this
plan include truck drivers, warehouse workers, construction workers, and
food processors.

Without the historic Special Financial Assistance program included in
President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, these workers and retirees – who
have already earned these benefits – would have faced estimated benefit
reductions of roughly 60% in the next few years. The Central States
Pension Fund estimates that it will now be able to pay full benefits to
workers and retirees through 2051. Today’s announcement is
[estimated](https://www.voicesforpensionsecurity.com/ecom-impact-districts)
to benefit thousands of workers and retirees in individual states across
the US, including: 

-   Michigan – 40,000 workers and retirees
-   Ohio – 40,000 workers and retirees
-   Missouri – 28,000 workers and retirees
-   Illinois – 25,000 workers and retirees
-   Texas – 22,000 workers and retirees
-   Wisconsin – 22,000 workers and retirees
-   Indiana – 20,000 workers and retirees
-   Minnesota –19,000 workers and retirees
-   Florida – 19,000 workers and retirees
-   Tennessee – 14,000 workers and retirees

**President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Included Historic Support to
Protect  Pension Benefits**

The American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance program is
providing financial relief to struggling multiemployer pension plans and
ensuring that millions of families facing benefit cuts will receive the
full benefits they earned.

Multiemployer plans are created through agreements between employers and
a union, with plans typically involving multiple employers in a single
industry or related industries. A typical worker whose multiemployer
plan became insolvent would see their expected pension benefits slashed
substantially. Before the American Rescue Plan, workers and retirees
participating in more than 200 multiemployer pension plans faced the
prospect of not receiving the full benefits they earned and need to
support them and their families in retirement.

These plans are insured by a federal agency – the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) – which provides partial protection of the
benefits of approximately 11.2 million workers and retirees in
approximately 1,400 private-sector multiemployer, union-connected plans.
**Prior to the America Rescue Plan, the PBGC’s multiemployer pension
insurance program was projected to become insolvent in 2026**. Under the
Special Financial Assistance program, financially struggling
multiemployer pension plans can apply to the PBGC for assistance.  
  
**<u>The American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance Program
Will Have Historic Impacts</u>:**

-   **Positions multiemployer plans that receive assistance to remain
    solvent through at least 2051 – with no cuts to earned benefits:**
    -   Before American Rescue Plan: over 200 multiemployer plans were
        on pace to become insolvent in the near term.
    -   Now: Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, **every multiemployer
        pension plan that faced near-term insolvency and benefit cuts
        that receives Special Financial Assistance is projected to
        remain solvent through *at least* 2051**.  
-   **Protect benefits for millions of workers who faced cuts:**
    -   Before the American Rescue Plan: a wave of multiemployer pension
        plan insolvencies was projected to leave two to three million
        union workers, retirees, and their families without the full
        benefits they had earned.
    -   Now: **Two to three million workers and retirees in plans that
        receive assistance are expected to have their full pension
        benefits for the next three decades.  
        **
-   **Harsh Pension Cuts Reversed for over 80,000 Workers and Retirees
    in 18 Multiemployer Plans:**
    -   Before the American Rescue Plan: The Multiemployer Pension
        Reform Act (MPRA) allowed plans to, for the first time, cut
        workers’ and retirees’ benefits in order to remain indefinitely
        solvent. Eighteen multiemployer “MPRA plans” were approved to
        utilize this program.
    -   Now: More than 80,000 workers and retirees in MPRA plans who,
        through no fault of their own, had their pension benefits cut,
        are eligible to have those benefits fully reinstated. **The
        Special Financial Assistance program ensures all MPRA plans that
        were forced to cut benefits are able to restore those cuts in
        full, maintain full benefits into the foreseeable future, and be
        projected to remain indefinitely solvent.   
        **
-   **Most significant effort to protect the solvency of the
    multiemployer pension system in almost 50 years**: 
    -   Before the American Rescue Plan: Before the American Rescue
        Plan, because of the anticipated financial pressures from the
        need to guarantee minimum (partial) benefits for insolvent
        plans, PBGC’s Multiemployer Pension Insurance Program was
        projected to become insolvent in 2026. 
    -   Now: The American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial Assistance
        program extended the solvency of the PBGC multiemployer
        insurance program from 2026 to 2055. This relief is **the most
        substantial policy to strengthen the solvency of our nation’s
        multiemployer pensions since the enactment of the Employee
        Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974.**
