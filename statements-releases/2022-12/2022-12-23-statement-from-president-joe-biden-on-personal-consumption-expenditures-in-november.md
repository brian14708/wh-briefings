  November"

Once again, we are seeing signs of our economy recovering and remaining
resilient. Today’s report shows that incomes are up and inflation is
coming down – while our job market remains strong. Christmas arrives
with gas prices down and grocery store prices showing the lowest
increase in a year. Coming the day after we saw unemployment claims
remain low and estimates of economic growth revised upward, it is a
winning streak for America’s families, businesses, and farmers. There
will be more ups and downs in the year ahead, but we are making progress
building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out and I’m
optimistic for the year ahead.
