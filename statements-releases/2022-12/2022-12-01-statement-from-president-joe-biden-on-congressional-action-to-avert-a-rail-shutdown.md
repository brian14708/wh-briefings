title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Congressional Action to Avert a Rail\_\
  Shutdown"
---
 
On Tuesday, I met with Congressional leaders from both parties and told
them that Congress needed to move quickly to avert a rail shutdown and
economic catastrophe for our nation. Now, I want to thank Congressional
leadership who supported the bill and the overwhelming majority of
Senators and Representatives in both parties who voted to avert a rail
shutdown. Congress’ decisive action ensures that we will avoid the
impending, devastating economic consequences for workers, families, and
communities across the country. Communities will maintain access to
clean drinking water. Farmers and ranchers will continue to be able to
bring food to market and feed their livestock. And hundreds of thousands
of Americans in a number of industries will keep their jobs. I will sign
the bill into law as soon as Congress sends it to my desk.

Working together, we have spared this country a Christmas catastrophe in
our grocery stores, in our workplaces, and in our communities.

I know that many in Congress shared my reluctance to override the union
ratification procedures. But in this case, the consequences of a
shutdown were just too great for working families all across the
country. And, the agreement will raise workers’ wages by 24%, increase
health care benefits, and preserve two person crews.

I have long been a supporter of paid sick leave for workers in all
industries – not just the rail industry – and my fight for that critical
benefit continues.

This week’s bipartisan action pulls our economy back from the brink of a
devastating shutdown that would have hurt millions of families and union
workers in countless industries. Our economy is growing and inflation is
moderating, and this rail agreement will continue our progress to build
an economy from the bottom up and middle out.
