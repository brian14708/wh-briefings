title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Franco\_Harris"
---
 
Say the name Franco Harris and most everyone talks about the catch, the
Super Bowls, and the glory he brought to the game of football. But in
the fifty years we bonded as friends, I always talked about his
character and compassion.  
   
Fifty years ago, the Pittsburgh Steelers had just finished a dominant
regular season with their first division title. They celebrated
Christmas just days after beating the Oakland Raiders on one of the most
famous plays in NFL history – the last-second Immaculate Reception by
their rookie running back, Franco Harris. While the Steelers would
barely lose the conference championship game to the undefeated Miami
Dolphins, Franco went on to a Hall of Fame career that led the Steelers
to four Super Bowl titles in six years as the dominant team of the
1970’s.  
   
But that’s not why the Pittsburgh Steelers – and Franco – are close to
my heart.  
   
It was this week fifty years ago when my first wife and infant daughter
were killed and my two young sons were badly injured in a car accident
while they were out getting a Christmas tree. I had just been elected to
the U.S. Senate and I was in Washington when I got the call and rushed
home to Delaware.  
   
I rarely left my boys’ bedside until they got better. But one day I did
to go shopping for them. When I returned, they were smiling for the
first time since the accident. Art Rooney, the generous and honorable
owner of the Steelers, had flown out with a couple of players, including
Franco, and the tough as nails Rocky Bleier. Busy with their own lives,
they took the time to be with my boys, sign footballs, and then left
with no publicity. A small act of kindness that meant the world to us.  
   
Sports have a powerful way of bringing people together. As families
gather for Christmas this weekend, there will be countless Pittsburgh
Steeler and Penn State fans sharing stories of Franco with their
children and grandchildren who will discover his greatness on the field.
But I know there will also be countless families like mine that will
remember him for all that he did to lift our spirits when we needed it –
in the most quiet, personal, and American of ways. We don’t have to ask.
We show up. We reach out. We share a compassion that is a source of our
enduring strength as a nation.  
   
The last few times I saw Franco were in September and November of 2020
on the campaign trail in Latrobe and Pittsburgh. This week of all weeks,
my family remembers him and keeps him close to our hearts.  
   
May God bless, Franco Harris – a dear friend, a good man, and a great
American.  
   
May God bless the love of his life Dana, their family, and all of
Steeler Nation.
