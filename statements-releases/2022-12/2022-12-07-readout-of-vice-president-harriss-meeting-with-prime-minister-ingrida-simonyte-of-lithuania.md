Vice President Kamala Harris today met with Prime Minister Ingrida
Simonyte of Lithuania.  The Vice President commemorated the 100 years of
diplomatic relations between the United States and Lithuania and
reaffirmed our ironclad commitment to NATO’s Article 5.  The Vice
President thanked Lithuania for hosting U.S. forces and reiterated the
U.S. commitment to maintain a persistent rotational U.S. military
presence in Lithuania and its other Baltic neighbors.  The two leaders
condemned Russia’s continued brutal aggression against Ukraine and
discussed our shared unwavering support for the Ukrainian people.  The
Vice President also assured Prime Minister Simonyte that the United
States would continue to stand up for the international rules-based
order in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, and thanked Lithuania for its
principled stance.  The Vice President congratulated the Prime Minister
for receiving the Madeleine K. Albright Democracy Award yesterday.
