Senator Sinema has been a key partner on some of the historic
legislation President Biden has championed over the last 20 months, from
the American Rescue Plan to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, from the
Inflation Reduction Act to the CHIPS and Science Act, from the PACT Act
to the Gun Safety Act to the Respect for Marriage Act, and more.Â  We
understand that her decision to register as an independent in Arizona
does not change the new Democratic majority control of the Senate, and
we have every reason to expect that we will continue to work
successfully with her.
