title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Supreme Court\
  \ Title 42\_Order"

The Supreme Court’s order today keeps the current Title 42 policy in
place while the Court reviews the matter in 2023.  We will, of course,
comply with the order and prepare for the Court’s review.  
   
At the same time, we are advancing our preparations to manage the border
in a secure, orderly, and humane way when Title 42 eventually lifts and
will continue expanding legal pathways for immigration.  Title 42 is a
public health measure, not an immigration enforcement measure, and it
should not be extended indefinitely.  To truly fix our broken
immigration system, we need Congress to pass comprehensive immigration
reform measures like the ones President Biden proposed on his first day
in office. Today’s order gives Republicans in Congress plenty of time to
move past political finger-pointing and join their Democratic colleagues
in solving the challenge at our border by passing the comprehensive
reform measures and delivering the additional funds for border security
that President Biden has requested.
