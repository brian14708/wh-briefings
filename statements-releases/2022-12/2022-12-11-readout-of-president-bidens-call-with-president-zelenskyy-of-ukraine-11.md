President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., spoke today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine to underscore ongoing U.S. support for Ukraine’s
defense as Russia continues its assaults on Ukraine’s critical
infrastructure.  President Biden highlighted how the U.S. is
prioritizing efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s air defense through our
security assistance, including the December 9 announcement of $275
million in additional ammunition and equipment that included systems to
counter the Russian use of unmanned aerial vehicles. President Biden
also highlighted the November 29 announcement of $53 million to support
energy infrastructure to strengthen the stability of Ukraine’s energy
grid in the wake of Russia’s targeted attacks.  President Biden welcomed
President Zelenskyy’s stated openness to a just peace based on
fundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  He
reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to continue providing Ukraine with
security, economic, and humanitarian assistance, holding Russia
accountable for its war crimes and atrocities, and imposing costs on
Russia for its aggression.
