title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Marking 10 Years Since the Sandy Hook\_\
  Shooting"
---
 
Ten years ago today at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,
Connecticut, our nation watched as the unthinkable happened. Twenty
young children with their whole lives ahead of them. Six educators who
gave their lives protecting their students. And countless survivors who
still carry the wounds of that day.

We should have societal guilt for taking too long to deal with this
problem. We have a moral obligation to pass and enforce laws that can
prevent these things from happening again. We owe it to the courageous,
young survivors and to the families who lost part of their soul ten
years ago to turn their pain into purpose.

A few months ago, I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into
law. We’ve reined in so-called ghost guns which have no serial numbers
and are harder to trace. We’ve cracked down on gun trafficking and
increased resources for violence prevention.

Still, we must do more. I am determined to ban assault weapons and
high-capacity magazines like those used at Sandy Hook and countless
other mass shootings in America. Enough is enough. Our obligation is
clear. We must eliminate these weapons that have no purpose other than
to kill people in large numbers. It is within our power to do this – for
the sake of not only the lives of the innocents lost, but for the
survivors who still hope.

Jill and I are praying today for the Sandy Hook families and the
innocent lives lost that day.

May God bless them all.
