White House Officials from the National Economic Council, Domestic
Policy Council, and Office of Intergovernmental Affairs convened a
meeting on housing affordability with state legislative leaders from ten
states.

Lowering costs for working families is a top priority for President
Biden. In October 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration [announced key
progress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/07/biden-harris-administration-announces-progress-in-implementing-its-housing-supply-action-plan/)
on implementing its Housing Supply Action Plan, including finalizing
regulations that make it easier to build mixed-income housing, extending
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) deadlines, streamlining a Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac financing program, and promoting more housing
options near transit. In the meeting, White House Officials shared that
the Administration looks forward to partnering with state and local
governments on expanding housing supply, strengthening tenant
protections, reducing homelessness, and promoting equity in housing.

During the meeting, legislative leaders from California, Oregon, and
Maine shared how their states successfully passed comprehensive land-use
reform policies to increase housing affordability. Legislative leaders
from other states shared their plans for advancing land-use reform
legislation in the 2023 legislative session. State leaders also
discussed actions to reduce regulatory barriers for affordable housing,
increase funding for affordable housing, protect tenant rights, ensure
fair housing access, and address homelessness.
