During the U.S.-African Leaders Summit, held December 13-15 in
Washington DC, the United States affirmed and expanded its enduring
partnerships with African governments, the private sector, civil
society, and philanthropic actors in recognition of the pivotal role
African governments, institutions, and peoples will play in addressing
one of the greatest global challenges of our time – climate change.
 Many of the most vulnerable countries to climate change are in Africa,
and the partnerships highlighted at the Summit will be essential to
bolstering their resilience.   
  
At the United Nations Climate Meeting (COP27) in November 2022,
President Biden announced U.S. plans to provide over $150 million in new
funding to accelerate the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and
Resilience (PREPARE) (see [Fact Sheet: President Biden Announces New
