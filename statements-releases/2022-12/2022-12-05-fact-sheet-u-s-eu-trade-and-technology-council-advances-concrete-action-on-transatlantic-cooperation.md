title: "FACT SHEET: U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council Advances Concrete Action\
  \ on Transatlantic\_Cooperation"
---
 
The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) held its third
ministerial meeting on December 5 at the University of Maryland in
College Park. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of
Commerce Gina Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative Katherine
Tai co-chaired the meeting with European Commission Executive Vice
Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis to discuss progress
and advance concrete action on transatlantic cooperation that
demonstrate our approach to trade, technology, and innovation in line
with democratic principles and universal human rights. As the largest
trade and investment relationship in the world, the United States and
the European Union are advancing projects that align with our shared
values and promote a rules-based economic system.

In conjunction with the TTC, Ambassador Tai, EVP Dombrovskis, and U.S.
Department of Labor Under Secretary Lee convened a meeting of the Trade
and Labor Dialogue to hear from labor and business leaders about how
trade can promote labor rights and create good-paying jobs on both sides
of the Atlantic and globally. The U.S. and EU Co-Chairs welcomed
virtually senior leaders from Kenya and Jamaica to launch new
cooperation with both countries on digital connectivity and discuss how
the United States and the EU can better engage third countries to
promote secure digital infrastructure. They also engaged with U.S. and
EU stakeholders to hear views on advancing the development of resilient
supply chains and opportunities for cooperation on digital policy and
technology standards.

Geostrategic challenges, including Russia’s full-scale invasion of
Ukraine and increased assertiveness of autocratic regimes, have
reinforced the importance of our shared democratic values, commitment to
universal human rights, and leadership role in upholding an
international rules-based order, including in the areas of trade,
technology and innovation. The U.S. and the EU continue to coordinate
efforts to address the spread of Russian information manipulation and
interference, particularly in the context of Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine, and its impact on third countries, notably in Africa and
Latin-America.

At this ministerial, the United States and the European Union launched a
number of new, concrete initiatives that will deepen our cooperation
bilaterally and in partnership with third countries, including:

**Supporting Secure and Resilient Digital Connectivity in Third
Countries:**

-   Launching new cooperation on inclusive information and communication
    technology and services (ICTS) projects in Jamaica and Kenya and in
    cooperation with their respective governments.
    -   In Jamaica, we will connect over 1,000 public schools and
        children’s homes to secure internet services, strengthen digital
        competencies of teachers, and support the use of digital
        technologies by all types of enterprises, and expand Wi-Fi
        infrastructure. We also intend to support secure and resilient
        rural broadband connectivity provided by trusted vendors in the
        country.

    -   In Kenya, we will expand school connectivity and provide
        technical assistance to help Kenya update its Information and
        Communications Act and 5G Strategy in line with the principles
        set for high-quality global infrastructure projects.
-   Expanding coordination on financing digital infrastructure projects
    in third countries, including through a MOU between the U.S.
    Development Finance Corporation and the European Investment Bank.
