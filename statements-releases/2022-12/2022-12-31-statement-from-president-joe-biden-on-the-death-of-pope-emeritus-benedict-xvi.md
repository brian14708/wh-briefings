title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Death of Pope Emeritus Benedict\_\
  XVI"

Jill and I join Catholics around the world, and so many others, in
mourning the passing of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. I had the privilege
of spending time with Pope Benedict at the Vatican in 2011 and will
always remember his generosity and welcome as well as our meaningful
conversation. He will be remembered as a renowned theologian, with a
lifetime of devotion to the Church, guided by his principles and faith.
As he remarked during his 2008 visit to the White House, “the need for
global solidarity is as urgent as ever, if all people are to live in a
way worthy of their dignity.” May his focus on the ministry of charity
continue to be an inspiration to us all.
