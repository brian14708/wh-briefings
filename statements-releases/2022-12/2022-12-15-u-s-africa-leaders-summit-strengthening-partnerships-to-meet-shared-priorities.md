title: "U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit: Strengthening Partnerships to Meet Shared\_Priorities"
---
 
The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, from December 13-15 in Washington DC,
highlighted the U.S. commitment to expanding and deepening our
partnership with African countries, institutions, and people.  Our world
is quickly changing, and U.S. engagement in Africa must evolve
accordingly.  African leadership and contributions are essential to
addressing today’s pressing challenges and achieving shared priorities. 
The Biden-Harris Administration is deepening longstanding areas of
cooperation while revitalizing and expanding our partnership to better
meet the shared challenges and opportunities of our era.  On December
15, the U.S. and African Union delegations released a **[Vision
Statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/15/vision-statement-for-the-u-s-africa-partnership/)**
outlining the contours of this strengthened partnership.  
  
At the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, President Biden and Vice President
Harris announced new initiatives that will empower African institutions
and citizens.  We reaffirmed our resolve to work collaboratively with
African governments, businesses, and publics to strengthen
people-to-people ties, ensure more inclusive and responsive global
institutions, build a strong and sustainable global economy, foster new
technology and innovation, strengthen health systems and prepare for the
next pandemic, tackle the food security and climate crises, support
democracy and human rights, and advance peace and security.  
  
**<u>The Biden-Harris Administration</u>** **<u>plans to invest at least
$55 billion in Africa over the next three years, working closely with
Congress</u>**.    
We are dedicated to following through on these commitments and are
establishing a new **Special Presidential Representative for U.S.-Africa
Leaders Summit Implementation** to coordinate these efforts.  President
Biden announced his intent to name for this role Ambassador Johnnie
Carson, former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs and
Ambassador to Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.   
  
New investments and policy initiatives highlighted at the Summit
include:  
  
**<u>People-to-People Ties</u>**

-   [**Establishment of a New Diaspora
    Council**:](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/13/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-elevating-diaspora-engagement/)
    The President issued an [executive
    order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/12/13/executive-order-on-establishing-the-presidents-advisory-council-on-african-diaspora-engagement-in-the-united-states/)
    (EO) directing the Secretary of State to establish the President’s
    Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in the United States
    (PAC-ADE).  The PAC-ADE will deepen the dialogue between U.S.
    officials and the African Diaspora in the United States, as
    described in the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa.  The EO
    encourages efforts to advance equity and opportunity for the African
    Diaspora in the United States and strengthen cultural, social,
    political, and economic ties between African communities, the global
    African Diaspora, and the United States.  
-   **Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) Expansion:** Vice
    President Harris announced that the Administration plans to work
    with Congress to [provide over $100 million toward
    YALI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/13/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-elevating-diaspora-engagement/)
    over multiple years to support innovative, diverse young African
    women and men to excel in a 21<sup>st</sup> century economy and
    catalyze transformational change in their communities, countries,
    and continent.  The YALI expansion seeks to harness the support of
    the private sector, the Diaspora, and bilateral partners to
    facilitate networking, expand digital literacy, accelerate gender
    equality and women’s leadership, advance transparent governance,
    foster a vibrant civil society, and increase economic opportunities.

-   **Support for G20 Membership**: The United States will support and
    work to realize greater and long overdue African representation in
    international institutions, including supporting the African Union
    to join the G20 as a permanent member.  Home to over a billion
    people, Africa must have a more prominent voice in global
    conversations.  This builds upon President Biden’s September
    announcement of support for permanent seats in the United Nations
    Security Council for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the
    Caribbean.  
-   **Travel to Africa:** President Biden announced that he, Vice
    President Harris, the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and several

-   **Supporting African Resilience and Recovery**: President Biden
    highlighted that his Administration is committed to working closely
    with Congress to lend up to $21 billion through the International
    Monetary Fund for low and middle-income countries, which will
    support African resilience and recovery efforts.  The Biden-Harris
    Administration is also calling for all bilateral and relevant
    private creditors to provide meaningful debt relief so countries can
    regain their footing after years of extreme stress.  
-   **Memorandum of Understanding between the** **United States
    Government and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)
    Secretariat:** The United States Government and the AfCFTA

    Understanding](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/14/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-promoting-two-way-trade-and-investment-in-africa/)
    to expand engagement to promote equitable, sustainable, and
    inclusive trade; boost competitiveness; and attract investment to
    the continent.  Once fully implemented, the Agreement Establishing
    the African Continental Free Trade Area will create a combined
    continent-wide market of 1.3 billion people and $3.4 trillion, which
    would be the fifth-largest economy in the world.
