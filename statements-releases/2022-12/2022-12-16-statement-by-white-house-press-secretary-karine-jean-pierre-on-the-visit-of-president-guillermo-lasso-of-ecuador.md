President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Guillermo Lasso of
Ecuador to the White House on December 19, 2022. Special Presidential
Advisor Chris Dodd recently met with President Lasso and delivered
President Biden’s invitation to meet at the White House. The visit
provides an opportunity for the Presidents to consult on a range of
regional and global issues, including Russia’s unprovoked and
unjustified war in Ukraine. During the meeting, the leaders also plan to
underscore the importance of strengthening democratic institutions and
discuss regional economic integration initiatives, including the
Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, economic and security
cooperation, and Ecuador’s leadership on regional migration.
