title: "U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit: Joint Statement on Food\_Security"
---
 
The African Union and the United States reaffirm their shared commitment
to realizing African food security by establishing a strategic
partnership to guide and accelerate their work.  
  
This strategic framework will reference and build on existing bilateral,
regional, multilateral, non-governmental, and philanthropic efforts to
advance food security and will leverage the public and private sectors
to address immediate and acute food and fertilizer needs in the
short-term– including by addressing food supplies that have been
disrupted – and promote transformational investments in medium-to long-
term sustainable and resilient food systems.  
  
We seek to make concrete progress on the short-term goals and to develop
a plan of action for the longer-term goals by the African Union’s Summit
in February 2023.  
  
***An Urgent Imperative      
                                                                 ***  
The compounding impact of the global pandemic, the climate crisis, high
energy and fertilizer prices, as well as protracted conflicts, including
Russia’s war in Ukraine, have spurred U.S. and African leaders to
refocus and scale public and private sector investments to help solve
the root causes of the food crisis that has had a disproportionate
impact on African nations.  
  
We recognize the critical importance of strengthening, protecting, and
accelerating progress towards achieving African food security to enable
African countries to trade more and enhance connectivity to critical
agricultural markets. We also acknowledge the critical importance of
agriculture as a source of millions of jobs and livelihoods across the
continent, including among youth and women.  We further note the
enormous untapped potential the continent represents, home to more than
60 percent of the world’s unused arable farmland, and the opportunity
that represents in terms of Africa’s role in addressing global food
insecurity. Through this strategic partnership, we intend to utilize all
diplomatic, multilateral, technical, and financial tools to build
stronger and diversified food systems and supply chains, to scale
Africa’s agricultural production capacity and to invest in more
resilient agricultural sectors.  
  
We reaffirm the commitments of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture
Development Program (CAADP), the Malabo Declaration and its Call to
Action, and the Global Food Security Summit held on the margins of the
United Nations General Assembly, for emergency assistance as well as
medium- to long-term investments for resilient food systems to address
chronic food insecurity as well as the priority actions outlined in the
International Financial Institutions (IFI) Action Plan to Address Food
Insecurity and the African Development Bank’s African Emergency Food
Production Plan. We also note the Dakar International Conference on
Agriculture to be co-hosted by the Government of Senegal and AfDB on
January 25-27, 2023.  
  
We also recognize the importance of intensifying efforts related to
climate adaptation, soil health and fertility, and the widespread use of
improved agricultural inputs.  
  
***U.S.-Africa Food Security Framework  
***  
To meet these goals, this U.S.-Africa strategic partnership will address
both short-term and longer-term priorities.  The United States is
committed to leveraging its unique convening power to bring together the
private sector and international financial institutions to address
underinvestment and to identify and remove obstacles that impede
Africa’s full participation in global food and fertilizer supply chains
and markets. In turn, the African Union will politically commit that
participating AU members will address and remove obstacles that impede
agriculture-centered investments.   
   
In the short-term:

-   Identify means for Africa to secure more diverse and resilient
    sources of grain and fertilizer supply – in the very near term and
    on a commercial basis – to meet its immediate needs.  
-   Where there is an acute need for humanitarian assistance, we will
    work together to provide immediate life-saving assistance, including
    cash, food and nutrition supplies—including where possible, by
    sourcing from the continent—to prevent famine or malnutrition, while
    helping to prepare for future shocks and pilot resilient
    investments.

In the medium- and long-term, the United States and Africa will exert
leadership to address chronic underinvestment and policy shortcomings
with respect to agriculture and food systems, in concert with other
willing partners to:

-   Explore ways to improve Africa’s access to global markets for
    agricultural commodities.  
-   Highlight the importance of African governments carrying out the
    policy reforms needed to achieve food security, notably by improving
    land access, enhancing the business environment, promoting open
    trade, and strengthening good governance.   
-   Identify and promote opportunities for transformative medium- to
    long-term investments from governments, the private sector –
    including the U.S. private sector, and multilateral development
    banks to strengthen the climate-resilience of agriculture and food
    systems, improve productivity, and increase sustainability.   
-   Increase the reliable and sustainable access to fertilizers and
    their inputs, with a focus on climate-smart alternatives, soil
    management and fertilizer efficiency techniques, to prevent
    shortages, reduce dependency on single-source fertilizer producers,
    help increase competition among fertilizer producers, and help
    increase crop yields in vulnerable African food markets.  
-   Focus on diversifying the production of agricultural commodities,
    including core commodities and traditional crops. This includes
    strengthening the physical and digital infrastructure and logistical
    supply chains to produce fertilizers and grow food and to cultivate,
    store and transport food efficiently. In addition, this effort will
    seek to improve transportation of food within regional food markets
    to bolster inter-regional trade and reduce single supplier
    dependency of African food systems.   
-   Promote effective agricultural production practices, approaches, and
    research and development across the full agricultural ecosystem,
    including greater access to innovative financial tools.
