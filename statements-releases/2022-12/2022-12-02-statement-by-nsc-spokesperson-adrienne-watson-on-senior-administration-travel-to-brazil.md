On Monday, December 5, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and
officials from the National Security Council and State Department will
travel to Brasilia, Brazil to meet with representatives of the
administration of President Bolsonaro and members of the incoming
administration of President-elect Lula da Silva. Sullivan will meet with
Brazilian Secretary for Strategic Affairs Admiral Flávio Rocha,
President-elect Lula da Silva, and Senator Jaques Wagner. During the
meetings, Sullivan will discuss how the United States and Brazil can
continue to work together to address common challenges, including
combatting climate change, safeguarding food security, promoting
inclusion and democracy, and managing regional migration. The meetings
follow President Biden’s call with President-elect Lula in October 2022,
where the President committed to keeping open channels of communication
between the two countries during the transition.
