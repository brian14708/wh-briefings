title: "President\_Biden Names Twenty-Eighth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate six individuals to
serve as federal judges—all of whom are extraordinar­­­ily qualified,
experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgroun­­­ds.

This will be President Biden’s twenty-eighth round of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 150.  President Biden has spent decades committed
to strengthening the federal bench, which is why he continues to move
rapidly to fill judicial vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the
most lower court judges for the first year of a presidency since the
Kennedy Administration
