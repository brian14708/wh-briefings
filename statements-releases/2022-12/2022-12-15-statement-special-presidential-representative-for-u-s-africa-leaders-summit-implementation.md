title: 'Statement: Special Presidential Representative for U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit
  Implementation'
---
 
At the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, held from December 13-15, 2022 in
Washington DC, President Biden reaffirmed the United States’ commitment
to deepen and expand our partnership with African countries to better
meet the shared challenges and opportunities of our era.  The Summit
reaffirmed our resolve to work collaboratively with African governments,
businesses, and publics to strengthen people-to-people ties, ensure more
inclusive and responsive global institutions, build a strong and
sustainable global economy, foster new technology and innovation,
strengthen health systems and prepare for the next pandemic, tackle the
food security and climate crises, support democracy and human rights,
and advance peace and security.  
   
The U.S. Government is dedicated to following through on these
commitments.  To that end, the Biden administration is establishing a
new **Special Presidential Representative for U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit
Implementation** to coordinate implementation efforts.  This senior
position will ensure this strengthened partnership manifests not only in
word, but also in deed.   
   
The Department of State will appoint Ambassador Johnnie Carson to this
role.  Ambassador Carson dedicated his 37-year career to African
diplomacy, serving as the former Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs and Ambassador to Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.  Earlier
in his career, he also served in Botswana, Mozambique, and Nigeria, and
was a Peace Corps volunteer in Tanzania.   
   
Ambassador Carson will coordinate with U.S. and African government,
civil society, private sector, and diaspora representatives to ensure
that the important dialogues that began during the Summit lead to
durable action.  He will also work with a wide range of stakeholders to
explore mechanisms for future high-level engagement.  We are looking
forward to bringing him on board.
