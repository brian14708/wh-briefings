U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Israeli National
Security Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata convened a virtual meeting of the
U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group (SCG) on December 22, 2022,
with participation from senior representatives from foreign policy,
defense, and intelligence agencies. Officials reviewed significant
regional developments since the last SCG meeting, including the current
situation with respect to Iran. They further discussed Iran’s growing
military relationship with Russia, including the transfer of weapons the
Kremlin is deploying against Ukraine, targeting its civilian
infrastructure, and Russia’s provision of military technology to Iran in
return. Officials expressed commitment to countering Iran’s threats to
the region, and to ensuring that Iran can never acquire a nuclear
weapon. They also discussed the broad array of economic sanctions
imposed in recent months against Iran, reviewed ongoing cooperation and
exercises between the U.S. military and Israel Defense Forces, and
assessed means for enhancing Israel’s security and economic integration
throughout the Middle East region.
