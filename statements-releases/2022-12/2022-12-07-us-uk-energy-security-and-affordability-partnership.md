title: "US-UK Energy Security and Affordability\_Partnership"
---
 
During this global energy crisis, brought on by Russia’s illegal
invasion of Ukraine, it is more important than ever for allied countries
to deepen their cooperation to ensure resilient international systems
which reflect our shared values.

Working with our allies, the United States and United Kingdom commit to
intensify our collaboration to support international energy security,
affordability, and sustainability, as Europe reduces its dependence on
Russian energy. Our immediate shared goal to stabilise energy markets,
reduce demand, and ensure short-term security of supply is underpinned
by the longer-term objective of supporting a stable energy transition to
achieving net zero emissions by 2050, which in itself will strengthen
our energy security.

To this end, we are establishing a Joint Action Group for Energy
Security and Affordability to accelerate our immediate cooperation on
short-term action to support energy security and affordability in the
United Kingdom and across Europe.

The initiative will focus on the following priority areas:

**1.**  **Energy Efficiency and Innovative Energy Solutions**

-   Underscoring the importance of energy efficiency in bolstering
    energy security and affordability, partnering to explore market
    mechanisms, exchange best practices, and policy solutions to
    increase efficiency, contributing to a projected 8% reduction in
    end-user demand for gas in the UK this winter compared to the
    previous five years. We will explore targeted, data-driven measures
    that will save customers on their bills and increase efficiency
    without sacrificing comfort.
-   The UK will establish a new Energy Efficiency Taskforce to reduce
    the UK’s energy consumption from buildings and industry by 15% by
    2030 against 2021 levels. The £1.5 billion Help to Heat programme
    provides energy efficiency upgrades to low-income households, and
    the UK has committed an additional £6bn in energy efficiency schemes
    to 2028. Meanwhile, the U.S. is investing more than $30 billion in
    energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions for low-income
    communities.
-   Recognising the role of demand reduction technologies including, but
    not limited to: EVs, batteries, heat pumps, and home energy
    management systems, seeking to expedite deployment of these
    technologies to consumers.
-   Sharing lessons learned on creating competitive markets for these
    Energy Smart Appliances (ESAs) and best practice as these proposals
    develop, including assessing the potential for UK-led
    interoperability standards to be used in the U.S., and vice-versa.

**2.**  **Gas Supply**

-   Further enhancing U.S. LNG supply to the UK and wider European
    market by supporting the market conditions for security of supply,
    recognising the role of natural gas in ensuring near-term energy
    security, and in particular the significance of UK LNG import
    infrastructure and interconnection to wider European supply
    security.
-   Working with international partners and industry to strive to ensure
    LNG volumes of at least 9-10bcm over the next year via UK terminals
    from the U.S. To this end, we will look to identify opportunities to
    support commercial contracts that increase security of supply.
-   Committing to maintain an enabling regulatory environment to
    facilitate continued supplies, including domestic UK production, and
    to act on issues raised by stakeholders including in the private
    sector.
-   Prioritising low-carbon LNG infrastructure by promoting efforts to
    reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity, incorporating Carbon Capture,
    Usage and Storage (CCUS) and renewables in production sites where
    possible, and collaborating to adopt regulatory frameworks to
    minimise leakage, venting, or flaring from new, modified, or
    existing infrastructure. Both sides take note of the U.S. Inflation
    Reduction Act’s Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which will
    invest $1.55 billion to reduce methane emissions and implement a
    methane waste fee on major emitting facilities, as well as recent
    proposed standards from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to
    sharply reduce methane and other harmful air pollution, as well as
    to spur cutting-edge solutions to reduce leaks and wasted gas, from
    both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas sectors.

**3.**  **Nuclear Cooperation**

-   Promoting civil nuclear as a safe and reliable part of the clean
    energy transition, and a secure source of energy, including through
    ensuring that global supply chains are less dependent on unreliable
    sources to pursue this objective.
-   Working together to deepen global collaboration between like-minded
    countries on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) in a way that mutually
    benefits our respective industries and provides opportunities for UK
    and U.S. industry to support a resilient and diversified nuclear
    fuel supply chain.

**4.**  **International Collaboration on Clean Energy**

-   Working with G7 and G20 partners to drive forward a high ambition
    energy transition agenda, including in the run up to COP28, reducing
    the risk of future fossil fuel dependency in emerging markets and
    developing countries, avoiding any backtracking on previous
    commitments, enhancing and accelerating ambition toward the
    achievement of net-zero energy sectors, incorporating implementation
    of the Glasgow Climate Pact, and ensuring energy security in the
    current geopolitical context.
-   In support of these goals, advancing Just Energy Transition
    Partnerships (JETPs) with international partners, alongside
    advancing the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
    Investment (PGII).
-   Partnering on the development of, investment in and mass deployment
    of clean energy technologies, including through International Energy
    Agency (IEA) technology collaboration programs, International
    Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM)
    and Mission Innovation initiatives.
-   In support of this, collaborating to establish global exports and
    imports of hydrogen and hydrogen technologies, including through:
    the development of appropriate and compatible certification schemes;
    the expedition of the development of the first wave of global clean
    hydrogen projects by exchanging information, experience and
    expertise; and the acceleration of the creation of hydrogen hubs in
    both the UK and US through industrial engagement in hard to abate
    sectors,
-   Continuing close collaboration on CCUS by sharing policies and
    lessons learned on the multilateral stage to advance global
    deployment.

The Joint Action Group will be convened by a representative from the
offices of the President and the Prime Minister. It will particularly
focus on intensifying further commercial and scientific ties between our
two countries. It will complement the existing Strategic Energy
Dialogue, which is the principal mechanism for collaboration on net zero
technologies, financing of nuclear projects, and multilateral
initiatives.
