title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Bicentennial of United\_States-Mexico\_\
  Bilateral\_Relations"
---
 
Today, the United States and Mexico celebrate 200 years of bilateral
relations. As the closest of neighbors and friends, we share a set of
values that form the root of our strength. We share an enduring
commitment to freedom, democracy, and rule of law. And we share a strong
and deepening economic and security partnership that has made North
America the most competitive and dynamic region in the world.

This bicentennial is even more meaningful because it falls upon the
Feast Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe – a holiday with deep religious and
cultural significance for millions of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans.
Today, we also honor the cultural and familial ties that unite our
people and the many unique contributions of Mexican-Americans, which
have strengthened and enriched the United States for generations.

Over the course of our shared history, Mexico and the United States have
demonstrated that we are stronger and safer when we stand together. Our
futures are irrevocably connected. And today – as we embark on the next
century of our partnership with mutual respect and commitment to our
shared aspirations – we remember that nothing is beyond our reach if we
continue to work together.
