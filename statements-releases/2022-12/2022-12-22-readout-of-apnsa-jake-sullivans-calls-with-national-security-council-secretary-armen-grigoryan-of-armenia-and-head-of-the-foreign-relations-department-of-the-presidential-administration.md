National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke separately today
with National Security Council Secretary Armen Grigoryan of Armenia
and Head of the Foreign Relations Department of the Presidential
Administration of Azerbaijan Hikmat Hajiyev. In these calls, they took
stock of the progress made in EU and U.S.-facilitated peace talks since
their joint September 27 meeting in Washington. All affirmed their
commitment to negotiations with the goal of finalizing a peace
agreement. Mr. Sullivan urged both sides to consider steps that will
ease tensions and serve as the basis of good neighborly relations in the
future. Mr. Sullivan noted our ongoing concern over impeded access to
the Lachin Corridor and the growing humanitarian implications of this
situation, and called for full restoration of free movement through the
corridor.
