President Biden has been committed to supporting the people of Puerto
Rico since his first day in office. The Biden-Harris Administration has
made unprecedented levels of federal funding available to Puerto Rico
for resilience, recovery, infrastructure, and economic growth. This has
created an opportunity for Puerto Rico to make transformational change
on the island. To seize on this moment, the President established the
[White House Working Group on Puerto
Rico](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/20/readout-of-the-first-meeting-of-the-white-house-working-group-on-puerto-rico/)
to coordinate federal efforts, co-chaired by Domestic Policy Advisor
Susan Rice, National Economic Advisor Brian Deese, and Director of
Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Rodriguez  
  
Today, the White House hosted Governor Pedro Pierluisi and members of
his cabinet for the first Puerto Rico Economic Dialogue, to ensure
resources from the federal and Puerto Rico governments are invested
effectively, swiftly, and equitably to benefit all residents of Puerto
Rico. This new initiative will renew and strengthen the working
relationship between Washington, D.C. and San Juan and [build on the
progress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/20/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-supports-puerto-ricos-recovery-and-renewal-in-its-first-year-in-office/)
that has already been made during this Administration to support
inclusive prosperity and dignity, equality, and respect for Puerto
Rico.  
  
This historic meeting, chaired by Director of Intergovernmental Affairs
Julie Rodriguez and Deputy Secretary of Commerce and Puerto Rico
Economic Growth Coordinator Don Graves, brought together Puerto Rico’s
leadership and the White House Working Group on Puerto Rico to chart a
comprehensive plan for joint action to further the island’s economic
growth. During the meeting, federal agencies and their Puerto Rico
counterparts endorsed a slate of actions and partnerships they will
implement over the course of 2023. These shared priorities will inform
investments in Puerto Rico, improve coordination and management of
disaster recovery and other funding, and ensure long-term partnership,
respect, and transparency. Over the next 12 months, both governments
will take steps together to:  

-   Strengthen **human capital and workforce development** to create
    more good jobs and training opportunities in high-growth industries
    for Puerto Rico’s workers.
-   Invest in **infrastructure, energy, and resilience** to ensure
    Puerto Rico can withstand future natural disasters and support a
    thriving, sustainable economy.
-   Build a **diversified economy** that promotes innovation,
    competition, access to capital, and entrepreneurship, particularly
    for Puerto Rico’s small businesses.
-   Improve **governance and data** collection and analysis in Puerto
    Rico to support greater transparency, access to information,
    administrative capacity, and a more robust business climate for
    Puerto Rico residents.
