title: "G7 Leaders\u2019 Statement"
---
 
1.  We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met on 12 December, to
    reflect on progress of our cooperation under Germany’s Presidency to
    jointly address global challenges at a time of severe geopolitical
    crisis and critical moment for the world economy. We were joined by
    Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This year in the face of
    Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression
    against Ukraine, we stood more united than ever, together with
    Ukraine and in unwavering commitment to our shared values, the
    rules-based multilateral order and international cooperation.  
2.  Today, we reaffirm our unwavering support for and solidarity with
    Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian war of aggression for as long
    as it takes. We condemn Russia’s continuous inhumane and brutal
    attacks targeting critical infrastructure, in particular energy and
    water facilities, and cities across Ukraine, and recall that
    indiscriminate attacks and attacks on the civilian population or
    civilian objects, constitute a war crime. We also condemn those who
    are facilitating Putin’s illegal war. We are determined to help
    Ukraine repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water
    infrastructure. We will help Ukraine in meeting its winter
    preparedness needs, will continue to support Ukraine’s civilian
    resilience, and will further enhance our efforts on this during the
    international conference to be held in Paris on 13 December. We are
    determined that Russia will ultimately need to pay for the
    restoration of critical infrastructure damaged or destroyed through
    its brutal war. There can be no impunity for war crimes and other
    atrocities. We will hold President Putin and those responsible to
    account in accordance with international law. We reiterate that
    Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable and that any
    use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons would be met with
    severe consequences.  
3.  Building on our commitments so far, we will continue to galvanise
    international support to help address Ukraine’s urgent short-term
    financing needs. We ask our Finance Ministers to convene shortly to
    discuss a joint approach for coordinated budget support in 2023. We
    affirm that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be central
    to this effort.  
4.  We firmly support efforts to secure Ukraine’s immediate financial
    stability and its recovery and reconstruction towards a sustainable,
    prosperous and democratic future, in line with its European path. We
    will build on the outcomes of the International Expert Conference on
    the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine held on 25
    October in Berlin, as well as at the Ukraine Recovery Conference on
    21-22 June 2023 in London. In particular, with a view to supporting
    Ukraine’s repair, recovery and reconstruction, together with Ukraine
    and our international partners and in close coordination with
    relevant International Organisations and International Financial
    Institutions, we will establish a multi-agency Donor Coordination
    Platform. Through this platform, we will coordinate existing
    mechanisms to provide ongoing short- and long-term support – with
    particular responsibility of the Finance Track for short-term
    financial support –, coordinate further international funding and
    expertise, and encourage Ukraine’s reform agenda as well as private
    sector led growth. We will also set up a Secretariat for the
    Platform. We will each designate a senior government representative
    to oversee the set-up of the platform and ongoing coordination
    efforts, and ask them to convene as soon as possible in January
    2023.  
5.  With a view to a viable post-war peace settlement, we remain ready
    to reach arrangements together with Ukraine and interested countries
    and institutions on sustained security and other commitments to help
    Ukraine defend itself, secure its free and democratic future, and
    deter future Russian aggression in line with its rights enshrined in
    the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter).  
6.  We will continue to coordinate efforts to meet Ukraine’s urgent
    requirements for military and defense equipment with an immediate
    focus on providing Ukraine with air defense systems and
    capabilities.  
7.  We also reiterate our strong condemnation of Russia’s continued
    seizure and militarisation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power
    Plant, the abduction and reported abuse of Ukrainian personnel, and
    the willful destabilisation of its operations. We support the
    International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) efforts to establish a
    Safety and Security Zone.  
8.  Russia’s war of aggression must end. To date, we have not seen
    evidence that Russia is committed to sustainable peace efforts.
    Russia can end this war immediately by ceasing its attacks against
    Ukraine and completely and unconditionally withdrawing its forces
    from the territory of Ukraine. We welcome and support President
    Zelenskyy’s initiative for a just peace.  
9.  We remain committed to our unprecedented coordinated sanctions
    measures in response to Russia’s war of aggression. We will maintain
    and intensify economic pressure on Russia and those who evade and
    undermine our restrictive measures. We will continue to shield
    vulnerable countries that are severely impacted by the repercussions
    of Russia’s war of aggression and its weaponisation of energy and
    food.  
10. We reaffirm our intention to phase out Russian-origin crude oil and
    petroleum products from our domestic markets. During the week of 5
    December 2022, the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil entered
    into force in our respective jurisdictions, delivering on our
    commitment to limit Russia from profiting from its war of aggression
    against Ukraine, to support stability in global energy markets and
    to minimise negative economic spillovers of Russia’s war of
    aggression, especially on low- and middle-income countries. We
    encourage third countries that seek to import seaborne
    Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products to leverage the
    price cap. We reiterate our decision that the price cap on Russian
    origin petroleum products will enter into force on 5 February
    2023.  
11. Russia’s war in Ukraine is exacerbating existing fragilities in the
    global economy, with direct impacts on the cost of living of people
    in our own countries, and on the world’s most vulnerable. We will
    continue to use all available policy tools to maintain global
    financial, macroeconomic and price stability and long-term fiscal
    sustainability, while providing targeted support to those most in
    need and working collaboratively to strengthen our collective
    economic security to external shocks and wider risks. We will make
    public investments and structural reforms to promote long term
    growth. We will further coordinate to respond to the urgent needs of
    most vulnerable countries and will encourage private investment in
    developing and emerging markets as a key enabler of sustainable
    economic pathways.  
12. We will keep up our ambition to address global food insecurity,
    including through the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS). We
    will keep supporting the delivery of grain and fertilisers to
    vulnerable countries in need and welcome the recent operations led
    by the World Food Programme (WFP) on this front. We welcome the
    extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) alongside further
    efforts to bring Ukrainian food to the world, namely the European
    Union’s Solidarity Lanes and the Grain from Ukraine Initiative.  
13. Reaffirming our steadfast commitment to implement the Paris
    Agreement and the outcomes of COP26 and COP27, we commit to urgent,
    ambitious, and inclusive climate action in this decade to limit
    global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We reaffirm our
    commitment to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050. To that
    end, and building on our statement adopted in June in Elmau, we
    endorse the Climate Club’s terms of reference as established by the
    Climate Club Task Force and hereby establish an open and cooperative
    international Climate Club. Focusing in particular on the
    decarbonisation of industries, we will thereby contribute to
    unlocking green growth. We invite international partners to join the
    Climate Club and to participate in the further elaboration of its
    concept and structure. In doing so, we will continue working closely
    together with relevant International Organisations and stakeholders.
    We ask the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
    (OECD), in tandem with the International Energy Agency (IEA), to
    host an interim secretariat working together with other
    International Organisations.  
14. Recalling our commitment to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by
    2030, we will work intensively towards a successful outcome at
    Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15, in particular the
    adoption of an ambitious and effective global biodiversity
    framework, with clear and measurable targets and its prompt and
    swift implementation. In this regard we are committed to mobilising
    resources from all sources and to substantially increasing our
    national and international funding for nature by 2025 to support the
    implementation of an ambitious global framework. We encourage
    countries beyond the G7 to join us in this endeavor.  
15. Accelerating our contributions to the Partnership for Global
    Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to make our global partners a
    better offer on sustainable, inclusive, climate-resilient, and
    quality infrastructure investment, we welcome the progress on the
    Just Energy Transitions Partnerships (JETP) with South Africa and
    Indonesia as flagship projects for multilateral cooperation, just
    energy transition and sustainable investment and look forward to
    swiftly concluding negotiations on a JETP with Vietnam, as well as
    to making further progress with India and Senegal. We will intensify
    our cooperation within a PGII working group to deliver on our joint
    ambition to mobilise up to 600 billion dollars by 2027, and on
    JETPs, we will coordinate through the JETP working group.  
16. Reaffirming our full commitment to realise gender equality and to
    consistently mainstream gender equality into all policy areas, we
    welcome the key recommendations by the Gender Equality Advisory
    Council (GEAC) and look forward to receiving the GEAC’s full report
    by the end of the year. We thank this year’s GEAC for its important
    work, reiterate our intention to convene the GEAC as a standing
    feature of all G7 Presidencies, and look forward to further
    strengthening it.  
17. This year, we have achieved progress to improve the global health
    architecture with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core,
    our capacity to prevent, prepare for and respond to future global
    health emergencies and to achieve universal health coverage,
    especially through the G7 Pact for Pandemic Readiness endorsed in
    Elmau. We welcome the successful Seventh Replenishment of the Global
    Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund). We will step
    up our efforts on training and qualifying health workforce as well
    as strengthening surveillance capacities to detect outbreaks and
    variants as early as possible by integrating the One Health
    approach. We will continue to support science to develop safe and
    effective vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.  
18. Under the German Presidency, we, the G7, together with other
    international partners, have demonstrated our resolve to jointly
    addressing both major systemic challenges and immediate crises of
    our time. Our commitments and actions pave the way for progress
    towards an equitable world. As we look to the 2023 G7 Summit in
    Hiroshima under the Japanese Presidency, and in our support to the
    Indian G20 Presidency, we stand strong, united and absolutely
    committed to rebuilding a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable
    future for all.
