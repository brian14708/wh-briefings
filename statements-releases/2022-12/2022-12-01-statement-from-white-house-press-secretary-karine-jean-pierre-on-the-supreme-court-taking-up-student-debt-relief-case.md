title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Supreme\
  \ Court Taking Up Student Debt Relief\_Case"
---
 
We welcome the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case on our student
debt relief plan for middle and working class borrowers this February.
This program is necessary to help over 40 million eligible Americans
struggling under the burden of student loan debt recover from the
pandemic and move forward with their lives. The program is also legal,
supported by careful analysis from administration lawyers.  President
Biden will keep fighting against efforts to rob middle class families of
the relief they need and deserve. As we previously announced, student
loan payments will remain paused while the Supreme Court resolves the
case.
