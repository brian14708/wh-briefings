President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Guillermo Lasso
of Ecuador at the White House to discuss deepening the economic and
security partnership between the United States and Ecuador.   
   
The leaders discussed strengthening regional economic integration
through the bilateral Trade and Investment Council Agreement, as well as
the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity initiative, by
promoting investment, deepening economic cooperation, establishing high
standards for labor and the environment, and providing opportunities for
working families. As a part of the visit, the President announced a
$13.5 million disbursement from the U.S. International Development
Finance Corporation to support microfinance loans through Ecuador,
including women-led and owned businesses, as well as the intent to
provide $5 million from USAID in support of President Lasso’s initiative
to address child malnutrition in Ecuador by improving sanitation and
access to clear water in rural areas. In recognition of Ecuador’s
commitment to make its public procurement practices more fair, open, and
transparent, the United States invited Ecuador to be one of just 16
global partners in the Global Procurement Initiative led by the United
States Trade and Development Agency. This initiative will facilitate the
development of high-quality, resilient infrastructure through training
for Ecuador’s public procurement officials.   
   
The leaders also agreed to deepen security cooperation focused on
helping Ecuador combat gang violence by supporting the government’s
efforts to strengthen its justice sector, prison system, and maritime
security. Additionally, the leaders discussed the importance of regional
migration cooperation, including through the Los Angeles Declaration on
Migration and Protection. Ecuador has set the example by granting
Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans fleeing the humanitarian
crisis in their country. The United States supported a $530 million loan
from the Global Concessional Financing Facility to promote inclusive,
resilient, and low-carbon development and to support Ecuador’s efforts
to integrate Venezuelan migrants and refugees. The United States also
announced $20 million to support Ecuador in reducing carbon emissions,
protecting biodiversity, reactivating the economy, and addressing the
challenge of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing. During the
meeting, the Presidents committed to continuing to work together to
address regional migration challenges and climate change.   
   
During the meeting, President Biden and President Lasso also committed
to close collaboration as Ecuador prepares to begin a two-year term on
the United Nations Security Council. President Biden recognized
President Lasso’s principled leadership on global issues, including his
condemnation of Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine. Finally, the
leaders welcomed congressional approval of the bipartisan *United
States-Ecuador Partnership Act of 2022* to expand the United States’
cooperation with Ecuador on strengthening democratic institutions,
promoting inclusive economic growth, and supporting environmental
conservation, among other issues.
