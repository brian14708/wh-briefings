title: "Statement from Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall on Arrest\
  \ of Abu Agila Mohammad Mas\u2019ud Kheir\_Al-Marimi"
---
 
Yesterday, the United States lawfully took custody of Abu Agila Mohammad
Mas’ud Kheir Al-Marimi and brought him to the United States where he
faces charges for his alleged involvement in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103.  This action underscores the Biden Administration’s
unwavering commitment to enforcing the rule of law and holding
accountable those who inflict harm on Americans in acts of terrorism.
Through the unrelenting efforts of the Department of Justice, Department
of State, and their partners, Abu Agila Mas’ud will now face justice.
