title: "Readout of White\_House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative\_Meeting"
---
 
Yesterday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House
Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez convened the final
national meeting of The White House Community Violence Intervention
Collaborative (CVIC), a cohort of 16 jurisdictions committed to using
American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to scale and
strengthen their CVI infrastructure. Investing in evidence-based
community violence interventions (CVI) to reduce gun violence is a key
pillar of President Biden’s comprehensive strategy to prevent and
respond to gun crime. Mayors, law enforcement leaders, CVI experts, and
representatives from more than a dozen philanthropic institutions
participated in the meeting to discuss the work of the collaborative and
the Administration’s continuing commitment to this work.

Leaders of CVI organizations discussed how CVIC has helped them advance
their work – including by making them more competitive for grant
funding. Leaders described how, through the technical assistance
facilitated by CVIC and anchored by Hyphen, they have established a
co-responder program to respond to emergency calls, brought young people
and law enforcement into the same room to talk about improving public
safety, scaled up the number of individuals served by skills training
and entrepreneurship programs, and even established new community
violence intervention programs.

Federal officials reaffirmed that the Administration will continue its
commitment to community violence interventions as a cornerstone of the
President’s strategy to reduce gun crime and make our communities safer.
Through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and last year’s omnibus
budget, President Biden secured the first-ever federal funding stream
dedicated solely to community violence interventions. Because CVI
programs need more resources to do their work, this Administration
continues to call for Congress to provide $5 billion over 10 years for
community violence interventions.

Announced in June 2021, the Collaborative was an 18-month initiative to
enhance partnerships and coordination in each jurisdiction and to
facilitate peer-to-peer learning around effective community-based public
safety strategies. National experts and federal agencies are providing
training and technical assistance (TTA) to help communities assess their
existing public safety ecosystem, identify gaps, and build the capacity
to expand programming that saves lives and provides needed services to
communities impacted by gun violence.
