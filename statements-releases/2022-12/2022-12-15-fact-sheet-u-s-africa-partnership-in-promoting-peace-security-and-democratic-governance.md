title: "FACT SHEET: U.S.-Africa Partnership in\_Promoting Peace, Security, and Democratic\_\
  Governance"
---
 
The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C. reaffirmed that
African leadership is critical to confronting today’s defining global
peace, security, and democratic governance challenges.  In the Peace,
Security, and Governance Forum, Secretary of Defense Austin, Secretary
of State Blinken, USAID Administrator Power explored innovative, locally
led, inter-ministerial, and multi-sectoral approaches to advancing
democracy, peace, and security in the region.  Their discussion
emphasized that fostering partnerships that are rooted in a mutual
learning and collaboration with African nations, institutions, and
people is essential to sustainable approaches to security.    
  
The Civil Society Forum, with over 200 participants from a diverse range
of civil society organizations, provided a platform to discuss
opportunities to increase representation of marginalized voices in
policymaking and public affairs, to strengthen efforts to counter
corruption, and to promote workers’ rights.  The Forum reaffirmed the
United States’ commitment to supporting, amplifying, and listening to
civil society voices and demonstrated the dividends of accountable and
inclusive government.    
  
A balanced and comprehensive whole-of-government approach that includes
defense, diplomacy, and development, and integrates African voices, is
essential to develop and sustain democracy and advance security. 
**Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United
States has invested and aims to provide more than $6.5 billion to
support peace, security, democracy, human rights, and governance in
Africa.**  This includes efforts to develop African partners’ military
capabilities; support peacekeeping efforts; advance women, peace and
security objectives; increase African institutional capacity; promote
gender equality, human rights, and the rule of law; empower civil
society; strengthen accountability mechanisms; and support democratic
transitions and institutions.  
  
**Peace and Security**

-   **21<sup>st</sup> Partnership for African Security (21PAS)**:
    President Biden announced this new initiative, which will
    incentivize and bolster African efforts to implement and sustain
    security sector capacity and reforms.  Working with Congress, this
    $100 million, three-year pilot program, will support U.S. and
    African partners to coordinate, share, and support solutions to
    security challenges. 
-   **Civil Society Partnerships for Civilian Security:** Working with
    Congress, the Department of State plans to invest at least $2
    million to develop a new initiative that facilitates civil society
    engagement in the security sector.  By facilitating the development
    of Civil Society Consortiums, the program will amplify civil society
    voices at the nexus of security, governance, and human rights on the
    continent.
-   **Supporting Peace and Stabilization Efforts:** The U.S. Government
    is currently investing $58.5 million through the new Prevention and
    Stabilization Fund, authorized by the 2019 Global Fragility Act, to
    enhance partnerships with Mozambique, Libya, and the Coastal West
    Africa countries of Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Togo
    over the next 10 years.  Long-term efforts are focused on promoting
    reconciliation; encouraging inclusive and sustainable development;
    improving responsive governance; promoting respect for human rights;
    strengthening justice systems; and reinforcing resilience in
    historically marginalized and conflict-affected areas, including
    countering recruitment by violent extremist organizations.
-   **Bolstering Peace, Security, Democracy, and Governance in the
    Sahel:** The U.S. Government aims to bolster peace and security as
    well as democracy, governance, and human rights programming in the
    Sahel to curb growing instability in the region and address the
    long-standing crisis of state legitimacy.  To support this effort,
    the United States is investing over $115 million in FY 2022 for
    economic and development assistance, with a particular focus on
    democracy and governance programming, and approximately $60 million
    to support the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership.
-   **U.S. Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS Strategy):** The
    U.S. Government’s WPS Strategy is a cornerstone of the United
    States’ broader peace and security priorities and investments in
    Africa.  The United States will continue to promote women’s and
    girls’ empowerment, protection, and leadership in conflict and
    crisis situations across Africa while prioritizing partnering with
    governments and regional institutions as a critical approach to
    support positive change for women and girls.  For example, the
    Supporting Her Empowerment: Women’s Inclusion for New Security (SHE
    WINS) program supports leadership and sustainability of women-led
    organizations in addressing peace and security challenges at the
    community level, in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the
    Democratic Republic of Congo.  The Peace Enhancement for Community
    Empowerment through Women Investing in more Secure Environments
    (PEACE-WISE) program supports women in Niger, Nigeria, and Sudan to
    play an active role in preventing and mitigating violence and
    conflict by engaging in the country’s political processes.
-   **Military and Security Assistance**: Through United States Africa
    Command (USAFRICOM) and United States Central Command (USCENTCOM),
    the United States provides security assistance to allies and
    partners in Africa for military material, equipment, and training. 
    These efforts and programs address, among other things, human
    rights; women, peace, and security (WPS); maritime security;
    intelligence capacity; health security; and logistics and
    maintenance capabilities.  The Department of Defense also works with
    African partners to improve cyber security and secure cyber
    information sharing through pan-African, multilateral, and bilateral
    engagements.  Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USAFRICOM is
    currently investing nearly $250 million in security assistance
    resources throughout the continent.  
-   **The U.S. Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to
    Atrocities:**  In the first-ever Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent,
    and Respond to Atrocities, the U.S. Government commits to applying
    tools from across the government to identify, prevent, and respond
    to early warning signs of atrocities as a core national security
    interest.  It will also broaden U.S. involvement to engage with our
    international partners and civil society, including through
    preventative diplomacy to deter violence, foreign assistance
    programs that help address underlying grievances and advance
    reconciliation and transitional justice, and defense support and
    security cooperation to bolster institutions and promote democracy,
    transparency, and respect for human rights. 

**Democracy, Governance, and Human Rights**

-   **African Democratic and Political Transitions (ADAPT):** The
    Biden-Harris Administration’s new ADAPT initiative reaffirms the
    U.S. commitment to engage with complex political transitions in
    Africa and demonstrate U.S. Government support to governments and
    civil society at critical moments.  Over three years, the
    Administration intends to work with Congress to invest $75 million
    for this initiative to counter democratic backsliding in partnership
    with regional bodies, governments, and civil society in support of
    durable political transitions.
-   **Transform Digital Spaces to Reflect Feminist Democratic
    Principles** (**Transform**): USAID Administrator Power announced
    plans to, working with Congress, invest $1.8 million over three
    years to ensure the inclusion of African countries and organizations
    in the Transform program.  When launched, Transform will support the
    piloting of practical activities to prevent, respond to, and
    mitigate the risk of technology-facilitated gender-based violence
    (TFGBV), including TFGBV perpetrated against women in politics and
    public life.  
-   **The Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal (PIDR):**
    Announced at the
    [2021](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/09/fact-sheet-announcing-the-presidential-initiative-for-democratic-renewal/)
    [Summit for
    Democracy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/09/fact-sheet-announcing-the-presidential-initiative-for-democratic-renewal/),
    the PIDR is a landmark set of policy and foreign assistance
    initiatives totaling more than $400 million that build upon the U.S.
    Government’s significant, ongoing work to bolster democracy and
    promote respect for human rights globally.  New programs launched
    under the PIDR include efforts to protect free and independent
    media, support democratic reformers, and strengthen election
    processes, including on the African continent. In March 2023, the
    U.S. Government will co-host the second **Summit for Democracy**
    with Zambia, as well as Costa Rica, the Netherlands, and South
    Korea.
-   **Child Protection Compact (CPC) Partnership**: On December 7th, the
    United States and the Government of Cote d’Ivoire signed a CPC
    partnership that aims to support the Ivoirian government’s work with
    national stakeholders and civil society organizations to address
    child sex trafficking and forced child labor.
