President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met December 14 with President Felix
Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), President Ali
Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, President George Manneh Weah of Liberia,
President Andry Nirina Rajoelina of Madagascar, President Muhammadu
Buhari of Nigeria, and President Julius Maada Bio of Sierra Leone to
discuss their countries’ upcoming elections in 2023 at this critical
time for democracy globally.  President Biden reflected on the recent
midterm elections, noting that the strength and resilience of American
democracy was reaffirmed in the process, and he reinforced the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to working collectively to
renew and defend democracy at home and abroad.  Although elections
themselves do not equal democracy, President Biden underscored that
holding elections is fundamental to a functioning democracy.  
   
Together the leaders discussed the challenges of holding elections and
exercising the right to vote, including foreign interference and
political violence, and shared best practices for how to manage these
risks and ensure transparency and public confidence in the electoral
process.  Participants reaffirmed their commitment to hold free, fair,
and transparent elections conducted by competent, independent, and
impartial national electoral bodies, as enshrined in the African Charter
on Democracy, Elections, and Governance.    
   
The elections in Africa in 2023 will be consequential.  While the United
States does not support any specific candidate or party, the United
States is committed to supporting electoral processes to deepen
democracy in Africa.  Working with Congress, the United States plans to
provide over $165 million to support elections and good governance in
Africa in 2023.  The United States has provided nearly $50 million in
support of civil society and the electoral commissions in the Nigeria
and the DRC.
