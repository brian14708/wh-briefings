Congratulations to the newest members of the United Auto Workers at the
Ultium Cells LLC EV battery plant in Warren, Ohio. I ran for President
to rebuild the middle class. The middle class built America – and unions
built the middle class. My economic plan is creating good-paying jobs
that you can raise a family on – many that don’t require a college
degree – and provide the free and fair choice to join a union. By
rebuilding our infrastructure and our manufacturing of electric vehicle
batteries and semi-conductors, these jobs will bring our supply chains
back home and tackle the climate crisis at the same time. In my
administration, American and union workers can and will lead the world
in manufacturing once again.
