title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Japan\u2019s Historic\
  \ National Security\_Strategy"

Today, Japan has taken a bold and historic step to strengthen and defend
the free and open Indo-Pacific with the adoption of its new National
Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and Defense Buildup
Program. The strategy sets forth the vision of Prime Minister Kishida
and the Japanese people for a broad and strong community of partners and
allies in support of peace and stability in the region. Japan’s goal to
significantly increase defense investments will also strengthen and
modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance. The new strategy reinforces Prime
Minister Kishida’s deep commitment to international peace and nuclear
nonproliferation and sets the stage for Japan’s leadership in 2023, as
Japan takes a seat on the United Nations Security Council and hosts the
G7. We are grateful for Prime Minister Kishida’s and Japan’s leadership
around the world, including their support for Ukraine as Russia wages
its brutal war. We congratulate Prime Minister Kishida and the people of
Japan on their historic new National Security Strategy which will help
us and our partners achieve lasting peace, stability and prosperity.
