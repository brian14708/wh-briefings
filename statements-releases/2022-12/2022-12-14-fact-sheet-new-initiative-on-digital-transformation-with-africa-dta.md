title: "FACT SHEET:  New Initiative on Digital Transformation with Africa\_(DTA)"
---
 
At the U.S.-Africa Business Forum on December 14 in Washington, DC, as
part of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, President Biden announced the
launch of a new Digital Transformation with Africa (DTA) initiative.  A
signature initiative of the Biden-Harris Administration, DTA will expand
digital access and literacy and strengthen digital enabling environments
across the continent.  **Working with Congress, this initiative intends
to invest over $350 million and facilitate over $450 million in
financing for Africa** in line with the African Union’s Digital
Transformation Strategy and the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan
Africa.  
  
Africa’s digital ecosystem offers massive potential to spur economic
recovery, promote opportunity, advance social equality and gender
equality, and create jobs.  Africa’s digital transformation has opened
new markets for U.S. exports and services; deepened partnership among
African governments, the U.S. private sector, educational institutions,
and the African diaspora; and increased productivity, competitiveness,
and e-government service delivery.  With new technologies transforming
the way Africans live and work, DTA will foster an inclusive and
resilient African digital ecosystem, led by African communities and
built on an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet.  This
initiative will also seek to empower women and other marginalized people
through and within the digital ecosystem.  DTA aims to help countries
rebuild economies impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and advance U.S.
national security, diplomatic, commercial, and development priorities. 
It will also advance commitments to invest in global infrastructure,
including digital connectivity, under the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment.

The initiative will achieve its objectives along three core pillars:

**Pillar 1:** **Digital Economy and Infrastructure**

-   Objective 1: Expand access to open, interoperable, reliable, and
    secure Internet for African communities across sectors
-   Objective 2: Expand access to and adoption of key enabling digital
    technologies, platforms, and services and scale the African
    technology and innovation ecosystem
-   Objective 3: Facilitate investment, trade and partnerships in
    Africa’s digital economy from the African diaspora, U.S. and
    like-minded allies

**Pillar 2: Human Capital Development**

-   Objective 4: Facilitate inclusive access to digital skills and
    literacy, particularly for youth and women
-   Objective 5: Foster inclusive participation in the digital economy
    through digital entrepreneurship and workforce development
-   Objective 6: Strengthen the capacity of public sector employees to
    deliver digital services

**Pillar 3: Digital Enabling Environment**

-   Objective 7: Strengthen the capacity of authorities and the
    independence of regulators to develop, implement, and enforce sound
    policies and regulations
-   Objective 8: Support policies and regulations that promote
    competition, innovation, and investment
-   Objective 9: Promote governance that strengthens and sustains an
    open, interoperable, reliable, and secure digital ecosystem

As a whole-of-government effort that harnesses the diverse tools and
capabilities of the U.S. Government, DTA will include initiatives by the
following departments and agencies:  

-   **The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)**
    will lead interagency efforts to increase digital skills and
    literacy, enhance digital entrepreneurship, and strengthen public
    sector digital service delivery.  USAID will leverage existing
    capabilities and networks, such as through the Young African Leaders
    Initiative, to mobilize digital leaders, especially women and
    members of other marginalized communities, across sub-Saharan Africa
    to foster the growth of local digital businesses and ecosystems. 
    Beyond this work, USAID will help facilitate investment and promote
    business friendly reforms to support the development of the digital
    sector.    
-   **The U.S. Department of State** will spearhead interagency efforts
    to strengthen the digital enabling environment.  The Department of
    State’s Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership will
    promote an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure digital
    ecosystem.  Activities will include targeted information and
    communications technology (ICT) infrastructure efforts, such as
    testing and deployment of technologies, feasibility studies,
    promoting supplier diversity, and the use of trusted suppliers.  The
    Department of State will support capacity building and technical
    assistance, to encourage enabling environments for innovation,
    cybersecurity, and digital capacity building in consultation with
    African partners.  The Department of State will invite a delegation
    of regulators to Washington for regulatory technical assistance, and
    in March 2023, the United States will hold an Open RAN workshop in
    Africa.  
-   **The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC**) will work with its
    partner countries to address country-driven digital transformation
    priorities, harmonize regulatory and enabling environments, and
    attract private sector investment.  MCC prioritizes long-term
    engagement to implement systemic changes and build the foundations
    of digital-driven economic growth in our African partner countries. 
    To advance inclusive and resilient growth, MCC will ensure that
    digital skills and services reach underserved communities, youth,
    and women; promote digital innovation; and harness the private
    sector to drive economic growth and reduce poverty.  
-   **The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)** is
    committed to supporting private sector investment in projects that
    expand access to affordable internet and telecommunications, as well
    as projects that leverage technology to fuel economic growth, such
    as financial technology and online education.  DFC is improving
    mobile connectivity across Africa through, for example, $100 million
    of financing for Africell to support mobile network upgrades and
    expansions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Gambia, and
    Sierra Leone to make mobile internet services more affordable and
    widely available.  DFC is also advancing technology infrastructure
    across Africa through $300 million of financing to build and expand
    Africa Data Centres in South Africa, Kenya, and other countries in
    Africa to meet a growing demand connectivity.  
-   **The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM)** will support
    DTA under its loan, guarantee, and insurance programs, including
    bolstering the competitiveness of U.S. exporters through the China
    and Transformational Exports Program.    
-   **Power Africa** is a U.S. Government initiative that works to
    increase access to power in sub-Saharan Africa and has helped
    deliver first-time electricity to nearly 159 million people.  Power
    Africa will engage the private sector to expand digital access and
    strengthen the business enabling environment for trade and
    investment.  For example, as part of its [Health Electrification and
    Telecommunication
    Alliance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/13/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-health-cooperation/),
    Power Africa will invest $10 million to improve internet access in
    rural health clinics and regional health facilities.   
-   **The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)** will co-lead
    interagency efforts on digital economy and infrastructure.  USTDA
    will fund grant-based project preparation and partnership-building
    activities to support the development of digital infrastructure
    across Africa.  Leveraging its Access Africa initiative, USTDA will
    partner with U.S. industry and Africa’s public and private sectors
    to advance inclusive, secure, and sustainable digital
    infrastructure, including priority connectivity, cybersecurity, and
    smart cities projects.  USTDA’s Access Africa portfolio has the
    potential to help unlock more than $1.5 billion in financing for
    digital infrastructure projects in close to 40 African countries.  
-   **Prosper Africa** is a U.S. Government initiative to increase trade
    and investment between African nations and the United States.
     Prosper Africa will serve as a one-stop-shop for businesses and
    investors, as well as coordinate interagency support, for deals in
    the ICT sector.  Prosper Africa will engage the private sector to
    strengthen the business enabling environment for digital trade
    through the Prosper Africa Tech for Trade Alliance.  
-   **The Department of Commerce** will co-lead interagency efforts on
    the digital economy and infrastructure.  The Department of Commerce
    will leverage regional digital attachés, located in South Africa and
    Egypt, to increase its focus on the digital sector through DTA and
    will co-chair *Pillar 1: Digital Economy and Infrastructure* with
    USTDA.  Additionally, the Department’s National Telecommunications
    and Information Administration is pleased to announce its intention
    to work with the United States Telecommunication Training Institute
    to empower and develop the next generation of telecommunications and
    ICT leaders in Africa.  The program will include a networking and
    mentorship event in Washington, DC, for young African leaders with
    U.S. tech, start-up, and government representatives, followed by a
    training workshop in Africa to help build out skills, knowledge, and
    digital leadership.
