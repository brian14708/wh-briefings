title: "FACT SHEET:\_U.S.- Africa Partnership in Elevating Diaspora\_Engagement"
---
 
The African Diaspora in the United States is a source of strength.  It
encompasses African Americans, including descendants of enslaved
Africans, and nearly two million African immigrants who have close
familial, social, and economic connections to the continent.  The
African immigrant community makes significant contributions to America’s
growth and prosperity.  The African Diaspora—i.e., people of native
African origin living outside the continent—has been described as the
sixth region of African Union.  The African and Diaspora Young Leaders
Forum, held on December 13 in Washington, DC as part of the U.S.-Africa
Leaders Summit, reflected the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment
to strengthening the dialogue between U.S. officials and the Diaspora in
the United States, as described in the [U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan
Africa](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/U.S.-Strategy-Toward-Sub-Saharan-Africa-FINAL.pdf).

During the Forum, Vice President Kamala Harris announced the creation of
the **President’s Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in the
United States (PAC-ADE)**.** ** Today, President Biden issued an
[executive order
(EO)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/12/13/executive-order-on-establishing-the-presidents-advisory-council-on-african-diaspora-engagement-in-the-united-states/)
directing the Secretary of State to establish PAC-ADE, which will
enhance the dialogue between United States officials and the African
Diaspora.  The EO encourages efforts to advance equity and opportunity
for the African Diaspora in the United States and strengthen cultural,
social, political, and economic ties between African communities, the
global African Diaspora, and the United States.

PAC-ADE will consist of diverse representatives from African-American
and African immigrant communities who have distinguished themselves in
government, sports, creative industries, business, academia, social
work, and faith-based activities.  PAC-ADE will provide information,
analysis, and recommendations to the President regarding:

-   Strategies to advance equity and opportunity for African Diaspora
    communities;
-   Ways to support the United Nations’ Permanent Forum on People of
    African Descent;
-   Programs and initiatives to strengthen cultural, social, political,
    and economic ties among the African communities, the global African
    Diaspora, and the United States and address challenges and
    opportunities to advance inclusion, belonging, and public awareness
    of the diversity, accomplishments, culture, and history of the
    African Diaspora;
-   Programs and initiatives, such as the International Visitor
    Leadership Program, to expand educational exchange programs between
    Africa and the United States;
-   Programs and initiatives to increase public- and private-sector
    collaboration and community involvement in improving the
    socioeconomic well‑being of African Diaspora communities; and
-   Programs and initiatives, such as Prosper Africa, to increase the
    participation of members of the African Diaspora in the United
    States with regard to trade, investment, economic growth, and
    development programs relating to Africa.

In addition to the new PAC-ADE, the U.S. Government is investing in
Diaspora engagement, including through its support for higher education
and workforce development, the creative industries and entrepreneurship,
and environmental equity.  Africa’s large, dynamic youth population
creates exciting opportunities for innovation and economic growth on the
continent. 

**Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United
States has invested over $385 million in education and youth leadership
programming**. **We intend to invest more than $690 million over the
next two years, for a total of nearly $1.1 billion.** 

-   **Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) Expansion**: The Vice
    President announced plans to work with Congress to provide over $100
    million toward YALI over multiple years to scale and sustain
    leadership development, increase access to skills training among
    women and other underrepresented groups, and enhance alumni
    networking, including connections with the Diaspora.  This will
    include a new **Young African Leaders Exchange**, which will be the
    first pan-African virtual platform allowing the Diaspora and other
    key stakeholders to directly connect with YALI alumni.  The Mandela
    Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders, the flagship YALI
    program, will also hold an **Alumni Symposium** in March 2023, in
    South Africa, for up to 500 alumni from the 2021 cohort.
