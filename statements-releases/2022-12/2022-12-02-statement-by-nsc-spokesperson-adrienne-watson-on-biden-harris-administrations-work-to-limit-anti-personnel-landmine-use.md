title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on\_Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019\
  s Work to Limit Anti-Personnel Landmine\_Use"
---
 
25 years ago tomorrow, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
Stockpiling, Production, and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on
their Destruction opened for signature in Ottawa, Canada.  The
indiscriminate and enduring threat posed by these weapons—especially to
civilians, including children— has led more than 160 countries around
the world to accede to the Ottawa Convention, and the Biden-Harris
Administration to align U.S. policy with its key provisions outside of
the Korean Peninsula.  

President Biden’s commitment to reduce the impact of these weapons is
being backed by action.  We are reducing our reliance on anti-personnel
landmines by directing excess weapons be removed from our inventories
and positioned for demilitarization in accordance with verifiable
timelines.  We are pursuing materiel and operational alternatives to
these weapons, while ensuring our ability to meet our alliance
commitments and respond to contingencies.  And we continue to lead the
world in eliminating the lasting impact of these weapons, contributing
over $4.7 billion in aid over the last two and a half decades in more
than 100 countries for the safe clearance and destruction of landmines,
explosive weapons, and conventional weapons.  

This progress would not have been possible without the leadership and
tireless efforts of Senator Patrick Leahy.  Since his founding of the
Leahy War Victims Fund in 1989, Senator Leahy has bettered the lives of
countless people around the globe who have been impacted by the
explosive remnants of war. Through his tireless advocacy and moral
clarity, he has helped us all envision a world free from the scourge of
these weapons.  The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to
continuing work toward this future.
