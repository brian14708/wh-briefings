The United States welcomes the Republic of Korea’s adoption of its new
Indo-Pacific Strategy as a reflection of our shared commitment to the
region’s security and growing prosperity. The strategy sets forth a
comprehensive approach that demonstrates the commitment of President
Yoon and the Korean people to upholding universal values such as the
rule of law and human rights. The ROK’s goal to expand its cooperation
with other allies and partners across the Indo-Pacific will strengthen
our shared ability to advance international peace, security, and promote
nuclear nonproliferation. The strategy will also enhance the region’s
economic security networks, cooperation in science and technology, and
engagement on climate change and energy security. We are grateful for
President Yoon’s and the ROK’s leadership, and congratulate the people
of the ROK on their new strategy, which will help the United States and
our partners advance a free, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.
