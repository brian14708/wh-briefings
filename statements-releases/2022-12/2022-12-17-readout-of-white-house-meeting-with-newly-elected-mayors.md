Friday, President Biden dropped by a meeting with a bipartisan group of
13 newly-elected mayors and mayors-elect to congratulate them on their
elections and emphasize the importance of the strong partnership with
this Administration and local governments. The mayors and mayors-elect
discussed key initiatives around public safety and housing, as well as

Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act which are
