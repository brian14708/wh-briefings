title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on U.S., Republic of Korea,\
  \ and Japan Trilateral Designations Targeting the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\
  \ of\_Korea"
---
 
The United States, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and Japan, issued
designations targeting various officials and entities associated with
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) for their support to
the DPRK’s unlawful development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and
ballistic missiles. This synchronized action demonstrates the increased
strength of the trilateral relationship between the United States,
Japan, and the ROK. It follows President Biden’s trilateral meeting last
month with Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan and President Yoon Suk
Yeol of the ROK, where the leaders condemned the DPRK’s unprecedented
number of ballistic missile launches this year and resolved to
strengthen deterrence and to forge closer trilateral ties in the
security realm and beyond.  
   
In the face of comprehensive U.S. and United Nations sanctions that have
isolated the DPRK from the international financial system, the DPRK has
turned to increasingly desperate ways to generate revenue, like virtual
currency heists and other cyberthefts, to fund its weapons programs.
Sanctions have been successful in slowing down the development of its
unlawful weapons programs. As the DPRK adjusts its tactics in the face
of international pressure, we will continue to use all available tools
to further limit the growth of these destabilizing weapons programs.  
   
As we have made clear, the door has not closed on diplomacy, but
Pyongyang must cease its destabilizing actions and engage
diplomatically. The DPRK’s decision to ignore our outreach is not in its
best interest, nor in the interest of the people of the DPRK who
continue to suffer as a result of decisions made by the regime. We will
continue to coordinate closely with our allies and partners to address
the threats posed by the DPRK and to advance our shared objective of the
complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
