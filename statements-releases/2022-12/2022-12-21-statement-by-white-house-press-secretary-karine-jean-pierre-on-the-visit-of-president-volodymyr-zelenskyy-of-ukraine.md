President Biden has invited President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to
visit Washington D.C. to underscore the United States’ enduring
commitment to Ukraine. President Biden looks forward to welcoming
President Zelenskyy tomorrow, December 21, at the White House, after
which President Zelenskyy will address a joint session of Congress,
demonstrating the strong, bipartisan support for Ukraine. Three hundred
days ago, Russia launched a brutal assault against Ukraine. In response,
President Biden rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine as
they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity. During the
visit, President Biden will announce a significant new package of
security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian
aggression. The visit will underscore the United States’ steadfast
commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes, including
through the provision of economic, humanitarian, and military
assistance.
