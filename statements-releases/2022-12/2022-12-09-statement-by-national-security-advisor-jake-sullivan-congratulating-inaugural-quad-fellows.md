The United States congratulates the first cohort of Quad Fellows from
Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. At the second in-person
Quad Leaders’ Summit this past May, President Biden, Prime Minister
Albanese, Prime Minister Modi, and Prime Minister Kishida officially
opened this Fellowship. Today we are proud to welcome a group of
100 diverse, interdisciplinary, inspiring, and exceptional students – 25
from each Quad country – who are the next-generation of great STEM
minds. Each of them have demonstrated their commitment to advancing
innovation and collaboration among our four great democracies and an
enthusiasm for building a better tomorrow for the Indo-Pacific and the
world. Under President Biden, the Quad partnership has been elevated to
unprecedented heights and it will only grow in the coming years. These
young people will bring the Quad closer together and with them leading
the way, we are confident our future is in good hands.
