Edward Lincoln De Coito III is a 50-year-old man who pleaded guilty to
involvement in a marijuana trafficking conspiracy at age 23; his
involvement was limited to serving as a courier on five or six
occasions. Mr. De Coito began his term of imprisonment in March 1999,
and was released from custody in December 2000. Prior to his offense, he
honorably served in the U.S. Army and the Army Reserves. In the course
of his service, he received numerous awards, including the Southwest

**Vincente Ray Flores** – Winters, California  
Vincente Ray Flores is a 37-year-old man who, at approximately age 19,
consumed ecstasy and alcohol while serving in the military; he later
pleaded guilty at a special court-martial. Mr. Flores was sentenced to
four months’ confinement, forfeiture of $700 pay per month for a
four-month period, and reduction in rank to E-2. In exchange for his
plea, the convening authority directed his participation in the Air
Force Return to Duty Program, which is a six-month rehabilitation
program that provides selected enlisted offenders with a chance to
return to duty after therapy and education. The convening authority
subsequently amended the reduction in rank to E-3. Mr. Flores remains on
active duty and has been awarded the Global War on Terrorism
Expeditionary Medal, the Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon with
Gold Border, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force
Commendation Medal, and the Meritorious Unit Award. His conduct and
efficiency ratings have been outstanding. Further, Mr. Flores serves on
the Honor Guard, has helped train others for Honor Guard ceremonies, and
has volunteered for a number of causes through his military units. These

**Beverly Ann Ibn-Tamas** – Columbus, Ohio  
Beverly Ann Ibn-Tamas is an 80-year-old woman who was convicted of
murder in the second-degree while armed for killing her husband. Ms.
Ibn-Tamas, 33 at the time of the incident, was pregnant and testified
that before and during her pregnancy, her husband beat her, verbally
abused her, and threatened her. According to her testimony, her husband
had physically assaulted her and threatened her in the moments before
she shot him. During her trial, the court refused to allow expert
testimony regarding battered woman syndrome, a psychological condition
and pattern of behavior that develops in victims of domestic violence.
Ms. Ibn-Tamas was ultimately sentenced to a term of one to five years’
incarceration, with credit for time served. Ms. Ibn-Tamas’s appeal
marked one of the first significant steps toward judicial recognition of
battered woman syndrome, and her case has been the subject of numerous
academic studies. Until recently, Ms. Ibn-Tamas was the Director of
Nursing for an Ohio-based healthcare business, and, at the age of 80,
she continues to work as a case manager there. She raised the two
children fathered by her husband as a single mother; her children have
earned advanced degrees, and her daughter is now an attorney.

count of possession and sale of distilled spirits without tax stamps.

government. In 1964, he was sentenced to five years’ probation. Mr.
Jackson attempted to fulfill his dream of enlisting in the United States
Marine Corps after his high-school graduation in 1964, but was rejected
due to the federal conviction. Mr. Jackson completed his probation term
