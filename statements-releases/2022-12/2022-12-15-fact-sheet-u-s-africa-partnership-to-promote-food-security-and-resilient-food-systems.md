title: "FACT SHEET: U.S.- Africa Partnership to Promote Food Security and Resilient\
  \ Food\_Systems"
---
 
Today at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, President Biden reaffirmed the
United States’ commitment to working with the African Union and our
African partners to accelerate progress toward achieving food security,
building stronger food systems and more diversified supply chains, and
expanding African countries’ access to agricultural markets. 

President Biden announced an additional $2.5 billion in emergency aid
and medium to long-term food security assistance for resilient African
food systems and supply markets, which builds upon over $11 billion in
U.S. humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone.
 President Biden also launched a new strategic partnership on food
security between the United States and the African Union.  Together, we
will leverage the public and private sectors, along with multilateral
development banks and international financial institutions to accelerate
transformational investments in sustainable and resilient food systems
to prevent food shocks before they happen.

The compounding impacts of the global pandemic, the growing pressures of
the deepening climate crisis, high energy and fertilizer costs, and
protracted conflicts – including Russia’s war in Ukraine – have pushed
weak supply chains to the brink and dramatically increased malnutrition
and food insecurity — particularly for African countries.  A multi-year
drought in the Horn of Africa has created a dire humanitarian emergency,
with parts of Somalia experiencing a severe risk of famine for the
second time in just over a decade.  The swift U.S. humanitarian response
over the past few months has helped forestall famine.  The Biden-Harris
Administration remains committed to responding to humanitarian needs and
providing lifesaving in response to the historic food security crisis,
while also investing in medium- and long-term resilient food systems and
supply markets.

**Humanitarian Response: Addressing the Immediate and Acute Food
Insecurity Crisis**

-   **Critical Humanitarian Assistance and Resilience Food Security
    Program Funds:** President Biden announced that through the U.S.
    Agency for International Development (USAID), the Administration
    will provide an additional $2 billion in urgently needed
    humanitarian assistance – including food, water, shelter, emergency
    healthcare, sanitation and hygiene, humanitarian protection, and
    critical nutrition services – to help the people of African nations
    impacted by disasters and ongoing protracted humanitarian crises.
     This includes providing immediate life-saving assistance to
    internally displaced people who have been forced to flee their homes
    and providing food assistance to refugees who have crossed national
    borders.

**Medium- and Long-term Investments**

-   **Benin-Niger Regional Transport Compact and Malawi Compact**: At
    the U.S. Africa Business Forum, the Millennium Challenge
    Corporation (MCC) [signed Benin-Niger Regional Transport
    Compacts](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/14/fact-sheet-u-s-africa-partnership-in-promoting-two-way-trade-and-investment-in-africa/),
    totaling $504 million with Benin and Niger contributing an
    additional $15 million each to support MCC’s investment.  The
    compact will help reduce transportation costs and lower trade
    barriers from the Port of Cotonou to Niger’s capital city of Niamey,
    enabling rural communities to multinational business corridors to
    grow faster, create more jobs, and attract additional private sector
    investments to strengthen food supply chains.  Earlier this year,
    MCC signed a Compact with the Government of Malawi, which includes a
    $245 million Accelerated Growth Corridors Project to reduce
    transport costs and better connect goods, farms, and rural
    populations to markets.

-   **Launching Scientific Exchanges Program in West Africa:** In 2023,
    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is partnering with the
    University of Missouri through the Foreign Agriculture Service’s
    Scientific Exchanges Program to provide training to researchers in
    West Africa on climate-smart agriculture and pest risk management.
-   **Increasing Food Safety for Food Security (FS4FS) Program:** USDA
    is partnering with USAID and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
    to support food safety capacity building in Africa. USDA, USAID, and
    FDA have launched a new, five-year $15 million program.  The FS4FS
    program will help address capacity building needs on sanitary and
    phytosanitary (SPS) policy and regulatory issues globally and in
    Africa. 

Other U.S. investments made this year to respond to the food crisis
include:

-   **Support for Food Security in Somalia:** USAID is also rapidly
    scaling up food security assistance to marginalized, vulnerable
    populations in Somalia, including women and youth.  This support
    will expand smallholder farmers’ access to high quality,
    climate-smart inputs, and investing in the fisheries sector to
    diversify local livelihoods.  This support is helping mitigate food
    price shocks, and strengthening the resilience of marginalized
    persons to withstand shocks.  Alongside these efforts to address
    severe famine, USAID’s humanitarian assistance activities support
    early warning decision-making to mitigate the impacts of natural
    disasters and support internally displaced households.  
-   **Sustainable, Resilient Food Systems:** Delivering on President
    Biden’s September 2021 commitment of $5 billion over five years for
    Feed the Future programs, USAID is investing $412 million in
    programming to drive economic growth and strengthen food systems.
     This funding will reduce food loss and waste; expand large-scale
    food fortification to deliver essential vitamins and minerals; and
    strengthen market systems.  
-   **Support for Last Mile Delivery:**  Through USAID, the U.S.
    Government is investing more than $100 million to mitigate the
    global fertilizer shortage and building agricultural capacity and
    resilience.  This includes a new effort to accelerate last-mile
    delivery of agricultural tools, information, and production methods
    to smallholder farmers.  Focal countries include Burundi, the
    Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, and
    additional countries impacted by the fertilizer supply crisis.  
-   **Furthering the Adapting Nutritious Crops Initiative in Africa:** 
    The U.S. State Department is launching a new initiative to increase
    investments in efforts to adapt the most important indigenous and
    orphan crops to climate change.  This initiative will identify the
    most important crops for nutrition in Africa through a
    multi-stakeholder process; assess how these crops will perform under
    climate change; and invest in yield improvement efforts for these
    crops.  
-   **Increasing U.S. Peace Corps Presence and Support for Feed the
    Future Countries:** By the end of 2023, the U.S. Peace Corps will
    send more than 700 Volunteers to 20 sub-Saharan African nations,
    including seven Feed the Future Target countries, to work on food
    security and nutrition. Invited by these countries, the Peace Corps
    will place Volunteers in the least served communities where they
    will work side-by-side with community counterparts to address the
    most urgent food security needs, including by providing direct
    assistance to smallholder farmers to sustainably increase food
    production and adapt to climate change.  
-   **Furthering Investments in Food Security and Agriculture in
    Africa:** In 2021, the U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation (DFC) announced a goal of investing $1 billion in food
    and agriculture projects globally over the next five years.  Over
    the past year, DFC committed more than $157 million to companies and
    intermediaries investing in food security in Africa.  These
    investments support agricultural small and medium enterprises,
    regenerative and drought resilient agriculture and aquaculture, as
    well as other sustainable and climate smart investments.  
-   **Furthering Support for the Global Agriculture and Food Security
    Program:** U.S. Treasury Department’s (Treasury) contribution of
    $155 million to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program
    (GAFSP) allowed for the launch of its first Call for Proposals since
    the pandemic, which includes 33 eligible countries in Africa and
    supports GAFSP’s efforts to invest in small-scale farmers and
    develop climate-smart, resilient food systems.  The Call is
    prioritizing interventions with climate benefits.  In addition to
    this recent contribution, earlier this year, Treasury stepped up to
    serve as Co-Chair of the GAFSP Steering Committee, which includes
    donors, partner countries, multilateral development agencies, and
    civil society organizations, and Chair of the Private Sector Window
    Donor Committee.  
-   **Supporting IFAD’s Crisis Response Initiative:** Treasury’s
    contribution of $10 million to the International Fund for
    Agricultural Development’s (IFAD) Crisis Response Initiative will
    help protect farmers’ livelihoods and build resilience in rural
    communities, reduce post-harvest losses and improve market
    access.   
-   **Support for AfDB’s Africa Fertilizer Financing Mechanism:** USAID
    will provide $15 million in support to the African Development
    Bank’s (AfDB) existing fertilizer guarantee activity, the Africa
    Fertilizer Financing Mechanism (AFFM), to provide financing and
    credit guarantees and leverage private sector financing for 4.5
    million African farmers, and help meet the growing demand for
    fertilizer in Sub-Saharan Africa.  For every $1 million in credit
    guarantees, this partnership is expected to leverage up to $20
    million in fertilizer sales.  
-   **USAID Partnership with the AfDB on Agricultural Trade Finance:**
    USAID is partnering with the AfDB to mitigate the impacts on food
    security and nutrition as a result of constrained supplies of inputs
    necessary to produce staple foods and expand the finance and trade
    of agricultural products within and across borders, and promote
    investment across the agriculture value chain to increase food
    production and growth of the agriculture sector.  
-   **Support for Food Security in the Sahel:** Through USAID, the U.S.
    Government is boosting food production, improving natural resource
    management, and increasing resilience to future shocks in the Sahel
    region. USAID will also program $3 million in Burkina Faso to
    enhance food production and improve value chain resilience, $3.5
    million in Mauritania to assist farmers, and $3.5 million in Chad to
    improve natural resource management to prevent future shocks.
