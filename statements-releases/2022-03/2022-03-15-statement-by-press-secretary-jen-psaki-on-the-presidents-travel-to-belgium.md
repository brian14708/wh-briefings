President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to Brussels, Belgium later
this month. President Biden will join an extraordinary NATO summit on
March 24 to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response
to Russiaâ€™s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine as well as to
reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO Allies. President Biden
will also join a scheduled European Council Summit to discuss our shared
concerns about Ukraine, including transatlantic efforts to impose
economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected
by the violence, and address other challenges related to the conflict.
