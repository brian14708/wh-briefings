Vice President Kamala Harris met today with Crown Prince Salman bin
Hamad Al Khalifa of Bahrain in Washington, D.C. The Vice President
underscored the U.S. commitment to strengthening the U.S.-Bahrain
partnership and expressed appreciation for Bahrain’s collaboration on a
range of bilateral, regional and global issues.  The Vice President and
the Crown Prince discussed Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified further
invasion of Ukraine and the international community’s collective
response. They also discussed regional issues, such as the challenges
posed by Iran, and the opportunities presented by the historic Abraham
Accords. The Vice President reiterated the Biden-Harris Administration’s
support for human rights in Bahrain and around the world. The Vice
President also welcomed Bahrain joining the Artemis Accords, a set of
rules and norms to guide international cooperation in space.
