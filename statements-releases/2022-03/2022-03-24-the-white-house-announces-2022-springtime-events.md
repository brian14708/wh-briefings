Today, the President and First Lady are pleased to announce plans for
the following springtime events: Spring Garden Tours and the White House
Easter Egg Roll.   

**SPRING GARDEN TOURS **

The President and First Lady will continue the annual tradition of
opening the White House gardens and South Grounds to members of the
public for Spring Garden Tours. This season’s tour weekend is scheduled
for 10:00 AM ET to 4:30 PM ET on Saturday, April 9 and Sunday, April 10.

These tours are free and open to members of the public; however, a
ticket is required for all attendees, including small children. The
National Park Service (NPS) will distribute free, timed tickets at a
tent stationed near the Ellipse Visitors Pavilion each day beginning at
8:30 AM ET. The entry point for all guests will be located near the
intersection of 15th Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW. Tickets will
be distributed, one ticket per person, on a first-come, first-served
basis.

**WHITE HOUSE EASTER EGG ROLL**

The White House Easter Egg Roll will take place on the South Lawn on
Easter Monday, April 18, continuing one of the oldest traditions in
White House history.
