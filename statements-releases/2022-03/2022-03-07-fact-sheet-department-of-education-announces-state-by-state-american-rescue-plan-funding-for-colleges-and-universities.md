title: 'FACT SHEET: Department of Education Announces State-by-State American Rescue
  Plan Funding for Colleges and Universities'
---
 
*During Week of Anniversary of American Rescue Plan, Biden-Harris
Administration Highlights Investments in Community Colleges,
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Other Critical
Institutions*

Today, the Department of Education announced state-by-state breakdown of
funding for colleges and universities provided in the President’s
American Rescue Plan – one of the largest one-time infusions of funding
ever provided to the nation’s colleges and universities. These funds
were provided through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF)
over the past year.

The American Rescue Plan provided:

-   More than $10 billion to over 1,000 community colleges
-   More than $2.7 billion to Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities (HBCUs)
-   More than $190 million to Tribally Controlled Colleges and
    Universities (TCCUs)
-   Approximately $11 billion to Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs)
-   Approximately $5 billion to Asian American and Native American
    Pacific Islander-serving institutions (AANAPISIs)
-   Almost $1 billion to Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs)

**The Department of Education expects at least half of these funds will
be used to provide direct financial relief to students.** In addition to
funding provided under previous coronavirus relief legislation, these
funds are already being used by colleges and universities across the
country to serve students and ensure learning continues during the
COVID-19 pandemic. These funds are already having a significant impact
on institutions and students:

-   A [recent survey of college presidents by the American Council on
    Education](https://www.acenet.edu/Research-Insights/Pages/Senior-Leaders/Presidents-Survey-HEERF.aspx)
    found HEERF enabled:
    -   **<u>93% of colleges to provide direct financial support</u>**
        to students at risk of dropping out

    <!-- -->

    -   **<u>81% of colleges to keep student net prices similar to
        pre-pandemic levels</u>**

    <!-- -->

    -   **<u>70% of colleges to continue to employ faculty, staff, and
        other employees</u>** otherwise at risk of unemployment

    <!-- -->

    -   **<u>63% of colleges to keep students and faculty safe</u>** by
        purchasing COVID-19 tests, health screenings, and health care
-   Thousands of colleges and universities all across the country are
    **<u>using HEERF to keep students enrolled and on track to graduate,
    as well as make college more affordable</u>**, by providing
    emergency grants, discharging outstanding student debt or unpaid
    balances, and eliminating transcript withholding practices.
