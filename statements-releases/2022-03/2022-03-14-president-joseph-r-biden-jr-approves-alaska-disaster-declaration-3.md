Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Alaska and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by the severe winter storm and straight-line winds during the
period of January 1 to January 4, 2022.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe winter storm and straight-line winds in
the Matanuska-Susitna Borough.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas J. Dargan as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
