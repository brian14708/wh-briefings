  Council"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with General Nikolay
Patrushev, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, to reiterate the
United States’ firm and clear opposition to Russia’s unprovoked and
unjustified invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Sullivan clearly laid out the
United States’ commitment to continue imposing costs on Russia, to
support the defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank, in continued full coordination
with our Allies and partners. Mr. Sullivan told General Patrushev that
if Russia is serious about diplomacy then Moscow should stop attacking
Ukrainian cities and towns. Mr. Sullivan also warned General Patrushev
about the consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision
to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.
