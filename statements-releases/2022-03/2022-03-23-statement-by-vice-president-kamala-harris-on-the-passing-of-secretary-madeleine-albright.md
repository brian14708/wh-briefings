title: Statement By Vice President Kamala Harris On The Passing Of Secretary Madeleine
  Albright
---
 
Madeleine Albright gave so much of her life to public service – always
with intelligence, strength, and conviction. She never forgot her
family’s journey to this country and what America meant to them. Every
day, she advocated for people around the world seeking safety, security,
and peace.

I first met Secretary Albright when I was a young lawyer in San
Francisco. From the beginning, she was generous with her time, support,
and advice. She was able to balance strength and compassion, and her
deep empathy has been a constant source of inspiration throughout my own
career.  
  
Secretary Albright was a mentor and a friend. I will always cherish the
conversations we had over the years, which ranged from global affairs to
our families.  
  
The world lost a brilliant and beloved leader today. But Secretary
Albright’s legacy will live on through the lives she touched. I will
miss her.  
  
My heart is with her daughters, Alice, Anne, and Katie, and their entire
family. Rest in peace, Madam Secretary.
