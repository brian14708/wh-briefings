*Investments in U.S. Manufacturing, Historic Buy American Update Fuel a
Recovery That Is Made in America*

Since his first day in office, President Biden relentlessly focused on
an industrial strategy to revitalize our manufacturing base, strengthen
critical supply chains, and position U.S. workers and businesses to
compete and lead globally in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This
whole-of-government effort is leading to an historic recovery in
domestic manufacturing—since President Biden took office, the economy
added [375,000 manufacturing
jobs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP) – the most in nearly 30
years. The U.S. economy grew at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years in
2021, and manufacturing as a share of U.S. GDP has [returned to
pre-pandemic levels](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPMA#0).  
  
The Biden-Harris [21<sup>st</sup> Century industrial
strategy](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/transcript/brian-deese-on-bidens-vision-for-a-twenty-first-century-american-industrial-strategy/),
Made in America policies, and transformational investments such as the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have catalyzed historic domestic
investments by the private sector to bring good-paying manufacturing
jobs back home. This includes nearly $80 billion in planned investments
in semiconductor manufacturing and more than $100 billion in announced
investments in electric vehicles, batteries, and critical minerals since
2021.  
  
Echoing President Biden’s call in this week’s State of the Union speech,
Congress must build on this historic progress by passing the Bipartisan
Innovation Act. This legislation will make record investments in
emerging technologies, critical supply chains, and American
manufacturing to level the playing field for American workers and
businesses and outcompete China and the rest of the world in the
21<sup>st</sup> Century.  
  
**Today, President Biden and Barbara Humpton, President and CEO of
Siemens USA, will announce that Siemens will invest $54 million in
expanded domestic production and create 300 jobs manufacturing critical
electrical infrastructure that supports everything from electric vehicle
chargers to data centers to industrial sites.**  
  
**Lonnie Stephenson, International President of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) will also speak to how the
Biden-Harris Administration’s Made in America policies support
good-paying, union jobs across the country.**  
  
**This builds on announcements from major companies bringing production
back home:**

-   Intel announced a [$20
    billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-bringing-semiconductor-manufacturing-back-to-america/)
    semiconductor manufacturing fab outside Columbus, Ohio that will
    create 7,000 construction jobs and another 3,000 permanent jobs.  
-   General Motors announced its largest-ever [$7
    billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/25/statement-by-president-biden-on-general-motors-investment-in-michigan/)
    investment to create 4,000 new EV manufacturing jobs at sites across
    Michigan.  
-   Boeing and the Qatar Airways Group announced a [$20
    billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/31/readout-of-president-bidens-meeting-with-amir-sheikh-tamim-bin-hamad-al-thani-of-qatar/)
    deal, including $6.8 billion to supply aircraft that will support
    tens of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs.  
-   MP Materials, who operate the only rare earth mine in the U.S.,
    announced a [$700
    million](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/22/fact-sheet-securing-a-made-in-america-supply-chain-for-critical-minerals/)
    investment to establish a fully domestic end-to-end supply chain for
    permanent magnets by 2025, which are used in electric vehicle
    motors, wind turbines, and defense systems.

**President Biden will also announce the most robust updates to the
implementation of the Buy American Act in nearly 70 years to ensure
taxpayer dollars create good-paying jobs here at home, strengthen
critical supply chains, and position U.S. businesses to compete in
strategic industries.**  
  
The Federal government spends more than $600 billion each year buying
goods and services.  
  
President Biden believes that when taxpayers foot the bill, that
spending should invest in American workers, manufacturers, and small
businesses. In his first week in office, he signed [Executive Order
1400](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/)5,
*Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America’s
Workers*, initiating a review of Buy American policy and establishing
the first-ever Made in America Office in the Office of Management and
Budget.  
  
Since January 2021, the Made in America Office, codified by the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has already helped agencies implement
Made in America requirements, launched a new website designed to provide
transparency into exceptions from Made in America laws, and created a
new Made in America Council to ensure we identify the best ideas and
practices from across the Federal government to implement Made in
America initiatives. The actions to date implement a whole-of-government
agenda designed to maximize the use of taxpayer dollars on domestic
products and services, strengthen our industrial base, and create
good-paying, union jobs for Americans.  
  
This rule is also consistent with international trade laws and will
bring the U.S. in line with the domestic procurement practices of peer
countries. It will allow the U.S. to use its purchasing power to seed
and grow new and strategic industries, while continuing our work with
allies and partners to diversify and strengthen international supply
chains to mitigate the global disruptions we’ve seen from COVID-19,
climate change, and geopolitical conflict.    
  
**Today’s final rule will deliver on President Biden’s commitment to
“Make Buy American Real” by:**

-   **Raising the domestic content threshold to 75 percent.** Today,
    products qualify as Made in America for federal procurement if 55
    percent of the value of their component parts are manufactured here.
    This final rule will increase that threshold to 60 percent this
    year, 65 percent in 2024, and 75 percent in 2029. This will close
    loopholes in the current regulation while allowing businesses to
    onshore manufacturing and adjust their supply chains to increase the
    use of American-made components. This change will create more
    opportunities for small- and medium-sized manufacturers and their
    employees, including small and disadvantaged enterprises, from all
    parts of the country.  
      
    To support this work, the Small Business Administration has created
    a new manufacturing office in its federal contracting division and
    agencies will work with the Hollings Manufacturing Extension
    Partnership to find and develop American sources for government
    needs.  
-   **Strengthening domestic supply chains for critical goods with new
    price preferences.** When President Biden took office, he signed an
    executive order to fortify our critical supply chains. Building off
    the release of the first-of-their-kind one-year industrial base
    reviews last week, this rule creates a framework to allow the
    government to apply enhanced price preferences to select critical
    products and components identified in a subsequent rulemaking. These
    preferences, once in place, will support the development and
    expansion of domestic supply chains for critical products by
    providing a source of stable demand for domestically-produced
    critical products.

**The President’s Made in America policies are already supporting U.S.
manufacturing, including small businesses, minority-owned businesses,
and woman-owned businesses.**  
  
Last year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced [new
reforms](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-reforms-to-increase-equity-and-level-the-playing-field-for-underserved-small-business-owners/)
to increase equity in Federal procurement, including increasing goals
for Federal procurement, increasing transparency, and supporting new
entrants to the Federal marketplace.  
  
**In just the last year:**

-   **American Fashion Network**, a U.S.-based SBA certified woman-owned
    small business, pivoted from strictly commercial work to
    manufacturing masks for the government during COVID. Building on
    that experience, AFN won its first major federal contract in 2021,
    for $46 million in Made in America apparel for the U.S. Marine Corps
    and is assisting in the pioneering of gender size inclusivity with
    the DOD across services, including maternity.  The apparel is
    manufactured Garden Grove, California which employs workers 70
    workers and Rochester, New York which employs 56 workers.  
-   **Ferrara Manufacturing**, a family-owned New York City business,
    began making PPE for city hospitals in spring 2020. After winning
    their first federal contract to make millions of Made in America
    PPE, they later won multiple contracts with the Defense Logistics
    Agency to produce coats for the U.S. Air Force, Coast Guard, Navy,
    and Military District of Washington. Their apparel is manufactured
    in New York City’s Garment District, where they employ over 100
    workers who are SEIU-affiliated Workers United Union members. In
    2022, the family hopes to add 150 new manufacturing jobs in their
    newly built factory in Queens, New York City.  
-   **Brothers Body and Equipment**, a service-disabled veteran-owned
    small business (SDVOSB) and a HUBZone certified company operates a
    30,000-square foot manufacturing facility in Galion, OH. It is
    executing on more than $300,000 in contracts to produce equipment
    for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and the Army, allowing the
    12-person firm to keep its doors open and recover from a 90% revenue
    decrease in 2021 as a result of COVID.  
-   **Garrett Container Systems** in Accident, Maryland manufactures
    aluminum storage and shipping containers. Awarded more than $500,000
    in contracts for the Department of the Navy and the Defense
    Logistics Agency, the HUBZone-located business now expects to
    increase its workforce to more than 120 workers to deliver on
    contracts through FY23.  
-   **Alkegen**, a manufacturer of meltblown fiber filtration media (the
    critical component in NIOSH N95 respirators), recently completed
    expansion of its plant in Rochester, New Hampshire where its 125
    employees manufacture Berry-compliant (100% Made in America)
    components for NIOSH N95 and surgical masks. The Make PPE in America
    Act, included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is catalyzing
    domestic investments like this one to make America’s health supply
    chain stronger and more resilient.    
-   **Showa Best Glove, Inc** was awarded two contracts totaling $81.3
    million by the Department of Defense on behalf of and in
    coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services for
    the industrial base expansion of 1.6 billion nitrile exam gloves per
    year. The production capacity is being added to Showa’s Fayette,
    Alabama facility to increase domestic production of nitrile gloves.
    Showa Best Glove, Inc. has 265 employees at its Alabama location.  
-   **Astrobotic Technology** (AB) was awarded a $236M Task Order from
    NASA to deliver NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration
    Rover (VIPER) to the Moon’s South Pole in late 2023. VIPER’s flight
    to the Moon is part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload
    Services (CLPS) initiative, which leverages the capabilities of
    industry partners to quickly deliver scientific instruments and
    technology demonstrations to the Moon. As part of its award, AB is
    responsible for the delivery of VIPER, including integration with
    its Griffin lander, launch from Earth, and landing on the Moon. AB
    is a 160-employee certified small business firm in Pittsburgh, PA,
    that builds and operates space technologies.
