*During Week of Anniversary of American Rescue Plan, Administration
Highlights Investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities*

Today, the Department of Education announced state-by-state breakdown of
**<u>over $2.7 billion in funding for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) provided in the President’s American Rescue
Plan</u>**. These funds were provided through the Higher Education
Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) over the past year. HBCUs create pathways
to opportunity for Black students and foster academic excellence
throughout our nation. This infusion of federal funding – **<u>among the
largest ever in the country’s HBCUs</u>** – is a key part of the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to shared prosperity and equity
for all Americans. This funding also complements other American Rescue
Plan funds for critical institutions of higher education that serve
communities of color.

**<u>The American Rescue Plan requires half of these funds to be used to
provide direct financial relief to students; the Department of Education
expects far more will ultimately be used for that purpose.</u>** In
addition to funding provided under previous coronavirus relief
legislation, these funds are already being used by colleges and
universities across the country to serve students and ensure learning
continues during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thousands of colleges and universities all across the country are
**<u>using HEERF to keep students enrolled and on track to graduate, as
well as make college more affordable</u>**, by providing emergency
grants, discharging outstanding student debt or unpaid balances, and
eliminating transcript withholding practices.
